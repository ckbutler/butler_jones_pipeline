 FIJI
 Fiji's multiracial society is about evenly divided between
 indigenous Fijians and ethnic Indians. Indians dominate the
 economy and professions and are prominent in the public
 service, while ethnic Fijians make up the bulk of the nation's
 military services.
 Fiji's system of parliamentary democracy, inherited when the
 country gained independence from Great Britain in 1970, ended
 in October 1987 with the installation of a military regime
 following two bloodless coups. An interim government,
 initially formed in December 1987 when coup leader Lt. Col.
 (now Major-General) Sitiveni Rabuka's military regime stepped
 down, remains in office and is headed by Prime Minister Ratu
 Sir Kamisese Mara, who held that position for 17 years prior
 to the April 1987 elections. At year's end, the Cabinet
 consisted entirely of civilian officials. Although
 Major-General Rabuka and all other serving officers have
 returned to the barracks, the military remains influential,
 especially in security matters.
 The small but professional Fiji Military Forces (FMF) number
 some 5,000 men. They include a small naval division and
 fledgling air wing. Fiji also has a separate police force
 totaling 2,000 men. The military and police report to, and
 are under the control of, the Prime Minister, in his capacity
 as Minister of Home Affairs. Police reportedly mistreated
 some detainees, and five FMF members abducted and beat a
 professor. In September the Government established a new
 Fiji Intelligence Service, with wide-ranging powers to search
 people and property, tap telephones, and open mail.
 Sugar and tourism constitute the mainstays of the economy,
 accounting for 43 percent of the nation's foreign exchange
 earnings. The economy's recovery from the effects of a severe
 decline following the 1987 coups was nearly complete. Gross
 domestic product grew by about 12 percent in real terms in
 1989. A growth rate of 4.5 percent was projected for 1990.
 The Government is promoting light manufacturing for export to
 diversify the economy and lessen its dependence on sugar and
 tourism.
 The major human rights development in 1990 was the
 promulgation on July 25 of the new Constitution. This
 document includes a detailed bill of rights but gives the
 Parliament wide powers to overrule guarantees of basic
 freedoms in the event of a perceived threat to national
 security. It also aims to guarantee political primacy for
 ethnic Fijians by reserving for them a disproportionate number
 of seats in the lower house of Parliament. Most Indian and
 opposition leaders have pledged to boycott elections, expected
 in 1991, under the new Constitution.
 The principal human rights concerns in 1990 included
 questions, in view of the new Constitution's unequal
 representation features, about the right of citizens
 peacefully to change their government; discrimination against
 ethnic Indians and women; inhibitions on freedom of speech and
 press; and indications the Government is attempting to
 discourage political activity by university faculty members.
 On the plus side, the Government dropped previous plans to
 introduce annual media licensing requirements, opposition
 views were widely reported in the press, and unions were able
 
 
 883
 FIJI
 to exercise vigorously their legal rights to organize and
 bargain collectively for their members.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of political killings by the Government
 or any political group.
 b. Disappearance
 In October an ethnic Indian professor at the University of the
 South Pacific (USP) who had organized a protest against Fiji's
 .new Constitution was abducted and taken to a forest outside of
 Suva,- where he was beaten with a metal pipe and interrogated
 regarding the identities of other protestors who had burned a
 copy of the Constitution. The Constitution burning reportedly
 prompted the Government to order police to uncover the
 protesters' identities. Five soldiers surrendered to police
 shortly after the abduction and beating and pleaded guilty to
 the offense. They maintained that they had acted
 independently. The five were given 12-month suspended jail
 sentences and fined a total of just over $1,000 which was
 awarded as damages to the victim. The victim and several
 others, is scheduled to appear in court in early 1991 on a
 separate charge of "sedition" for burning the Constitution.
 c. Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 In November five members of the military pleaded guilty to the
 abduction and beating of a USP professor (see Section l.b.).
 Police sometimes physically abuse detainees; the offending
 officers have been punished in some instances. Corporal
 punishment is allowed; strokes of the cane are administered
 under medical supervision.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In October police arrested three journalists in connection
 with an article stating that the USP staff and students would
 stage a repeat burning of Fiji's Constitution to protest the
 abduction and beating of the USP professor.- The three were
 charged with the "malicious act" of publishing a fabricated
 story under the Public Order Act (POA). They were released on
 bail, and are scheduled to appear for trial on January 30,
 1991. Several other staffers were taken in for questioning
 and released. Seven others, including five USP lecturers,
 were arrested and charged with sedition and unlawful assembly
 for participating in the Constitution burning demonstration.
 Haroon Ali Shah, arrested in 1988, purportedly under the
 provisions of the Internal Security Decree (ISD) sought
 redress and was awarded $35,000 in August 1989.
 Exile is not practiced formally. The authorities reportedly
 have a short list of Fiji citizens who are denied the right to
 return to Fiji, but this remains unconfirmed. No Fiji
 citizens were denied reentry in 1990.
 
 
 884
 FIJI
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judicial structure has been slightly reorganized under the
 1990 Constitution but remains modeled on the British system.
 The principal courts in Fiji are the High Court, the Court of
 Appeal, and the Supreme Court, which now becomes the court of
 final appellate jurisdiction because Fiji is no longer a
 member of the Commonwealth of Nations, and hence certain
 appeals are no longer transmitted to the British Privy
 Council. There are no special courts;-military courts try
 only members of the armed forces. Magistrates' courts
 continue to try minor offenses. In addition to its
 jurisdiction in serious civil and criminal cases, the High
 Court is granted special interest jurisdiction on behalf of
 the public and is empowered to review alleged violations of
 individual rights guaranteed under the Constitution.
 The judiciary remains independent under the new Constitution.
 Rights of due process are similar to those found under English
 common law. The right to public trial is guaranteed and
 defendants have a right to counsel. In lesser litigation,
 there is a public legal advisor who is concerned mainly with
 assistance to indigents in the domestic or family law court.
 The right of appeal exists despite occasional delays due to
 courts being understaffed. Normal bail procedures mean that
 most defendants do not experience any pretrial detention.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In general, privacy of the home is respected. The 1988 ISD,
 adopted following discovery of a smuggled arms cache, allowed
 warrantless searches, but since its suspension the practice
 has stopped. The new Fiji Intelligence Service has
 wide-ranging powers to search people and property, open mail
 and tap telephones. It is not yet clear to what extent these
 powers will be used. Surveillance of persons believed to
 represent a security threat is carried out to some degree.
 Many political dissidents believe their telephones and mail
 are monitored, but concrete evidence is lacking.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including;
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech has largely been restored. Political
 figures and private citizens can and do speak out against.the
 Government. No arrests for making any kind of public
 statement were reported in 1990, although several people who
 participated in a Constitution-burning protest were arrested.
 Although there are no legal restrictions on press freedom, the
 .Government has broad discretionary powers to impose
 restrictions, and it has done so in the past. The POA allows
 the Government to arrest anyone who publishes "malicious"
 material. This includes any false news which could create or
 foster public alarm or result in the "detriment of the
 public." Privately owned broadcast and print media operate
 without prior censorship but with considerable
 self-censorship. Newspapers refrain from printing editorials
 severely critical of the Government and do little
 investigative reporting. Statements about the political
 situation by opposition figures and foreign governments are
 reported, however. Journals such as the Fiji Labor Sentinel
 
 
 885
 FIJI
 are often highly critical of the Government and in 1990
 repeatedly called for an opposition boycott of elections. The
 letters column of the Fiji Times also frequently carries
 political statements from members of the deposed government
 and other persons and from groups opposed to the Government
 and the Constitution. While the press is still less than
 fully free, the situation has improved since 1987, when the
 newspapers and radio station were closed for 6 weeks.
 Journalists reportedly receive occasional telephone calls from
 government officials complaining about stories. In September
 the Government announced that it was dropping previous plans
 to require annual licensing of the media.
 Three-journalists were detained in October and charged with
 suspicion of malicious publication of an article about reports
 of a protest rally.at the university to burn a second copy of
 the Constitution. Several foreign journalists were denied
 visas in 1990. In May the Government closed the Fiji office
 of the-Pacific Islands News Service (PACNEWS) and expelled two
 German employees, ostensibly for contractual violations.
 Fiji is home to the University of the South Pacific (USP), a
 regional institution. Prior to the 1987 coups and immediately
 thereafter, the USP was a center of opposition political
 activity. The Government has made it clear that it wants the
 USP, and especially its expatriate staff, to stay out of
 Fijian domestic politics, and some politically active staff
 members have been targets of retribution. In September the
 Minister of Finance reiterated government concerns about
 active political campaigning by USP faculty members and warned
 that Fiji might have to consider reducing its important
 financial contribution to the institution if such involvement
 does not cease. Following this warning, the Government
 increased its financial support for USP by 24 percent.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Assembly for political purposes is allowed but subject to
 restriction. Public gatherings require permission from the
 Government's district offices, which may obtain prior
 assessment and advice from the police on the anticipated crowd
 size and the ability of the police to ensure public safety.
 Permits for large outdoor political meetings or demonstrations
 are not always granted. In June the Government denied a
 .permit to a planned National Farmers Union protest rally on
 the ground of "unsettled conditions." In October the
 Government invoked the POA to prevent any rally from taking
 place on the USP campus. However, permits were issued during
 the year for several rallies organized by political parties
 and groups opposed to the Government. Political parties are
 currently operating, and party headquarters, including those
 of the deposed coalition parties, remain open. Political
 organizations are allowed to operate and issue public
 statements.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution and
 honored in practice. The Constitution declares the importance
 of Christianity to the Fijian people but guarantees protection
 for all religions. After the 1987 coups, most commercial and
 social activities on Sundays were banned. The Sunday bans
 were relaxed substantially in mid-1989 to .allow public
 transportation and restaurants to operate and to allow
 agricultural activities and some sports to continue.
 
 
 FIJI
 Religious pressure for restoration of sweeping Sunday bans has
 dissipated somewhat. No significant restrictions affect
 foreign clergy, missionary activity, charitable works,
 religious publishing and education, or other typical
 nonpolitical activities of religious organizations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on freedom of movement within the
 country or abroad. Occasional detentions at the airport
 occur, but the courts do not hesitate to order redress where
 this is warranted. Fiji citizens are free to emigrate.
 According to best available estimates, about 25,000 to 30,000
 have done so since May 1987. Most of the emigrants are
 Indians, many of them professionals, but Fijians and others
 have also left. Several thousand have claimed refugee status,
 especially when applying for admission to Canada, but neither
 the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees nor any government has
 recognized those claims. There are no refugees in Fiji, and
 no forced resettlement programs.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The right of citizens to change their government is abridged
 by the provision of the new Constitution ensuring political
 dominance by ethnic Fijians. Moreover, the Constitution was
 promulgated by an unelected interim government and was never
 approved by a national referendum. In January the term of the
 first interim government came to an end, and the President
 announced a second interim government, with a reduced
 17-member Cabinet, devoid of active duty military officers.
 This Government implemented the first part of its announced
 mandate with the promulgation of the new Constitution on July
 25. National elections are expected to be completed in the
 latter part of 1991.
 According to the interim government, the new Constitution is
 intended to ensure political dominance by the indigenous
 Fijians, while reinstating a form of parliamentary democracy
 and ensuring protection for basic human rights and Indian
 communal interests. The Constitution thus provides that
 indigenous Fijians are to hold 37 of 70 seats in the elected
 lower house of Parliament with the ethnic Indians accorded 27
 seats, Rotumans (culturally distinct Polynesians) one, and
 other races are allotted 5. In the Senate, an appointed body
 with essentially review powers and the right to veto
 legislation, indigenous Fijians are to hold 24 of the 34
 seats, Rotumans 1, and the other groups 9. Other
 constitutional features designed to ensure indigenous Fijian
 political dominance include procedures and requirements
 governing the selection of the President and Prime Minister.
 The Constitution also incorporates a bill of rights, providing
 for freedom of speech, assembly, religion, and other rights
 and freedoms. The section setting forth these rights provides
 that they may not be altered by Parliament except with the
 approval of two-thirds of the lower house. However, elsewhere
 in the Constitution, Parliament is also given the authority to
 pass special acts to deal with certain specified emergency
 situations, notwithstanding human rights guarantees found in
 other sections of that document.
 
 
 887
 FIJI
 The attorney general's office has taken the view that any
 legislation introduced under the emergency powers provision
 would require two-thirds approval by the lower house, but
 critics of the Constitution maintain that only a simple
 majority would be needed. Critics thus claim that indigenous
 Fijians in the lower house would be able, solely on the
 strength of their own numbers, to abrogate constitutional
 human rights protections. Opposition coalition leaders cite
 this concern and the lack of proportional parliamentary
 representation for all races as major factors in their
 announced decision to boycott any elections held under the new
 Constitution. The President is to be selected by the Great
 Council of Chiefs (GCC), a traditional Fijian leadership body,
 (as are the Fijian members of the Senate). The Prime
 Minister, who along with the Cabinet will hold most executive
 authority, is to be chosen by the President from among the
 Fijian members of the lower house on the basis of his ability
 to command majority support within that body.
 Elections are to be held by secret ballot, with voting only by
 communal constituencies. This latter aspect is a significant
 change from the 1970 constitution, which provided for a
 complex system of cross-voting allowing Indians a say in the
 selection of 'some Fijians and vice versa. The Constitution
 calls for elections every 5 years, but the Government may call
 an election at any time. The Constitution also provides for a
 formal review of its provisions every 7 years.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no local human rights groups as such in Fiji, but
 the women's rights movement, the labor movement, and various
 political groups are involved in promoting a number of human
 rights causes. The Government regards externally based
 investigations of the political and humah rights situation as
 a violation of its sovereignty and does not permit them in
 Fiji.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The stated purpose of the 1987 military coups was to ensure
 the political supremacy of the indigenous Fijian people and to
 protect their traditional way of life and communal control of
 land. To this end a number of measures have been taken that
 favor the Fijian community over the other ethnic groups. The
 most obvious is the reapportionment of the new Parliament to
 guarantee a preponderance of Fijians. The Government is also
 committed to raising the proportion of Fijians and Rotumans in
 the public service to 50 percent or more at all levels. Many
 Fijians felt that the'precoup public service discriminated in
 favor of Indians, who controlled most of middle management
 because of their higher educational level. Current promotion
 and hiring policies in the public service favor ethnic
 Fijians. The new Constitution also provides specific
 affirmative action provisions to improve the conditions of
 those disadvantaged as a result of race, sex, place of origin,
 political opinion, color, religion, or creed.
 Control of land is a highly sensitive issue in Fiji. About 85
 percent of the land is held communally by indigenous Fijians.
 Most cash crop farmers are Indians, who lease their land from
 the Fijian villages. Freehold land title is not an indigenous
 
 
 888
 FIJI
 concept; lands owned currently by the State (6 percent) and by
 individuals (9 percent) were transferred from customary owners
 during the colonial period. The present land ownership
 arrangements were instituted by the British to protect the
 interests of the indigenous Fijians. Many Indians,
 particularly farmers, feel that the absence of secure land
 tenure discriminates against them. The military coups were
 prompted, in part, by Fijians' fears that Indians sought to
 take away their land.
 Indians are subject to significant harassment and crime based
 on race, compounded by inadequate police protection. In 1989
 five Indian temples and a mosque were subject to acts of arson
 or other desecration by a group of Fijian youths. Arrests
 were made and the alleged perpetrators brought to trial. The
 ringleader was sentenced to serve a prison sentence. Other
 member of the gang were convicted but received suspended
 sentences. Other random incidents of Fijian youth gangs
 shouting racial abuse and raiding or stoning Indian homes and
 property are occasionally reported but the perpetrators escape
 more often than not. Similar acts of vandalism have been
 reported against Chinese farmers in remote rural areas.
 Women in both the Fijian and Indian communities have
 functioned primarily in traditional roles, although some women
 rise to high places in the public service, politics, and
 business. Women can also attain high status in Fiji's
 traditional chiefly system. The Prime Minister's wife is, in
 her own right, Fiji's second highest-ranking traditional
 chief. In general, women in the Fijian community are more
 likely to rise to prominence in their own right than are women
 in the Indian community. Women have full rights of property
 ownership and inheritance, and a number have become successful
 entrepreneurs. Women are generally paid less than men, a
 discrepancy that is especially notable in the garment
 industry. Garment workers, most of whom are female, are
 subject to a special minimum wage considerably lower than that
 in other sectors. Reliable current statistics on
 representation of women in traditional male occupations,
 business management, and the professions are unavailable.
 However, relatively few women are employed in these areas.
 A woman heads the Ministry for Women and Social Welfare, and a
 woman also holds the cabinet portfolio f6r Indian Affairs.
 There is a small but active women's rights movement. A recent
 area of focus has been violence against women. The movement
 has pressed for more serious treatment of rape in the courts.
 The crime tends to draw prison sentences of only a few years.
 An admonition by the Chief Justice late in 1988 has resulted
 in some increase in the average prison term for rape. The law
 allows corporal punishment for rape, but this is generally
 used only in cases of offenses against minors. Domestic
 violence is also a problem in Fiji and is a second major focus
 of the women's movement. The authorities are generally
 reluctant to intervene in cases of domestic violence unless it
 is necessary to save the woman's life. Few cases result in
 prosecution, as the victim generally does not press charges.
 The Government has not been active in dealing with domestic
 violence. Suva has a privately funded women's crisis center
 which offers counseling and assistance to women in cases of
 rape, domestic violence, and other problems, such as child
 support paymehts. There is, overall, a growing awareness that
 women's issues are deserving of greater attention but the
 issue has been overshadowed by the political events stemming
 from the 1987 coups.
 
 
 889
 FIJI
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers are free to form and join unions, elect their own
 representatives, publicize their views on labor matters, and
 determine their own policies. Strikes are legal and in 1990
 Fiji Trade Union Congress (FTUC) unions carried out several
 major successful strikes, including those by the National
 Farmers Union, the Fiji Nurses Association, the Fiji Public
 Service Association, the Air Pacific Employees Association,
 and in the sugar industry. In June, the Government granted
 registration to the Fiji Mine Workers Union, a first step in*
 unionizing the important Vatukoula gold mines in the northwest.
 All unions must register with, but are not controlled by, the
 Government. The only central labor body, the FTUC, is closely
 associated with the opposition Fiji Labour Party-and the
 deposed Bavadra government. The labor movement is led largely
 by ethnic Indians. Persons with close ties to the Government
 have started rival unions primarily for ethnic Fijians; these
 unions are more amenable to political cooperation with the
 Government. The FTUC is free to associate internationally and
 it belongs to.regional.labor groupings as well as to the
 International Confederation of Trade Unions.
 The Committee on Freedom of- Association of the International
 Labor Organization (ILO> at its November session again asked
 the Government to reconsider its ban on Sunday meetings,
 includingunion meetings. The ban had been relaxed
 previously;- however, permits for such meetings are often not
 granted.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The law. recognizes the right to organize and bargain
 collectively. Employers are required to recognize a union if
 more than half the employees in a workplace have joined it.
 Recognition is determined by union membership numbers rathei
 than by an election. The Government has the power to order
 recalcitrant employers to recognize unions, although union
 leaders accused the Government of failing to- apply the law
 correctly in one recent case. Key sectors of the economy,
 including sugar and tourism, are organized, and collective
 bargaining is the norm.
 Currently, nationwide wage guidelines are in effect. These
 guidelines replace a mandatory wage cut and freeze put into
 effect after the 1987 coups. In 1990 the Government
 authorized a graduated set of wage increases with a 7 percent
 .increase for incomes up to $7,000. Above.this amount the
 increases averaged approximately 5 percent. Fiji'-s practice
 -for wage-bargaining has beento set national wage guidelines
 after consultations among the Government, employers, and
 unions. Wage negotiation on an industry-by-industry basis is
 not practiced, and a government proposal to introduce such
 . negotiations has been resisted by. employers and unions. Union
 leaders fear that straight market-based wage bargaining would
 open unacceptably large wage gaps between skilled and
 unskilled workers. Until 1984 a tripartite forum of
 employers, unions, and government oversaw labor negotiations.
 In that year, however, labor withdrew from the forum and it
 was abolished. The restoration of the body is now a key
 demand of the FTUC, reiterated in July at its 33rd Biennial
 Delegates Conference. While the Government has reportedly
 
 
 890
 FIJI
 agreed to consider the request, it is believed to favor the
 current format of an annual national economic summit as the
 forum for dealing with. labor matters.
 The unions are generally successful in preventing
 discrimination against workers for union activities. In
 September, FTUC Women's Wing Secretary Ema Druavesi reported
 some progress in organizing women in the garment industry
 despite what she said were the fears of many women regarding
 victimization and intimidation for union activity. Some 20
 garment factories out of the total 55 operating in Fiji are
 reportedly now unionized.
 Fiji's export processing zones are subject to the same laws as
 the rest of the country and many of their firms have unions
 which have negotiated collective bargaining agreements.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor does not exist in Fiji. The 1990 Constitution
 specifically prohibits such practices.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Children under 12 may not be employed in any capacity.
 Children (under age 15) and "young persons" (age 15-17) may
 not be employed in industry or work with machinery.
 Enforcement by the Ministry of Employment and Industrial
 Relations generally is effective, with except in the case of
 family members working on family farms or businesses.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 No national minimum wage has been established. Certain
 sectors have minimum wages set by the Ministry for Employment
 and Industrial Relations. These wages range from a low of
 $0.63 to a high of $1.15 per hour, except in the garment
 industry where the lowest wages were raised in November to
 $0.66 per hour. The minimum wage will support a barely
 adequate standard of living, except in the garment industry,
 where the starting wage is based on the assumption that
 workers are young people or married women living at home and
 not expecting to support a household. More senior garment
 workers earn $1.00 an hour or more, a living wage in Fiji.
 Fiji has no regulation specifying maximum hours of work for
 adult males. Women are prohibited from night work in industry
 and underground work in mines. Certain industries, notably
 transportation and shipping, have problems with excessive
 hours of work. A number of fatal bus accidents have been
 attributed to overlong working hours for drivers. Indians,
 who generally require a cash income to survive, are more
 vulnerable to pressure to work long hours than Fijians. Many
 Fijians can and will return to their villages rather than work
 what they consider excessive hours.
 Fiji has workplace safety regulations, a workmen's
 compensation act, and an accident compensation plan. Awards
 for'workers injured on the job are set by a tribunal.
 Government enforcement of safety standards under the direction
 of the Employment Ministry suffers from a lack of trained
 enforcement personnel, but the unions do a reasonable job of
 monitoring safety standards in organized workplaces. A 1989
 study of working conditions in the garment industry resulted
 in the Government ordering many employers to improve working
 
 
 891
 FIJI
 conditions. Union leaders complained that the Government's
 act-ion was too mild and that the employers should have been
 subject to criminal prosecution.
