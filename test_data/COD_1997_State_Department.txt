 DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO
 President Laurent Desire Kabila seized control of the government of the former
 Zaire on May 17 following a 7-month military campaign. Prior to Kabila's takeover,
 the late former president Mobutu Sese Seko had headed an authoritarian regime
 for 32 years. President Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of
 Congo-Zaire (ADFL) then established the Democratic Republic of the Congo. A sov-
 ereign national conference in 1992 had formulated a new constitution and enacted
 legislation establishing a transitional government in the years prior to the ADFL
 tae      however, there was no progress in the transition to democratic govern-
 ment. On May 29, Kabila announced a schedule for democratization, with elections
 scheduled for May 1999. Kabila rules by decree. Decree Law No. 3, promulgated on
 May 27, established a structure consisting of a president, a government, and the
 courts and tribunals. Prior constitutional provisions, laws and regulations, and the-
 Transitional Act remain in effect unless contrary to Decree Law No. 3, or repealed.
 The judiciary continues to be subject to executive influence and corruption.
 The security forces consist of a new national police force under the Ministry of
 Interior, a National Security Council, and the Congolese Armed Forces (FAC). The
 
 
 reorganized police force, in place in all regions by years end, handles basic criminal
 cases. The National Security Council is responsible for internal and external secu-
 rity, including border security matters. The FAC retains some residual police func-
 tions. Military police have jurisdiction over armed forces personnel. The security
 forces under both the Mobutu and Kabila regimes committed numerous, serious
 human rights abuses.
 Most sectors of the economy have been contracting since the late 1970's; in the
 1990's, the decline accelerated. Production and incomes have fallen steadily, as the
 modern sector has virtually disappeared. Physical infrastructure has suffered seri-
 ous damage, financial institutions have collapsed, and human capital has signii-
 cantly eroded. Annual per capita national income is estimated at $115. Subsistence
 activities, a large informal sector, and widespread barter characterize much of the
 economy. The insolvent public sector cannot provide even basic public services, and
 foreign economic assistance was limited.
 The Kabila Government's human rights record was mixed and serious problems
 remain in many areas. Until its overthrow, the Mobutu regime tolerated and com-
 mitted numerous, serious human rights abuses.
 Security forces of both governments were responsible for extrajudicial killings, dis-
 appearances, torture, rape, and other abuses; security forces arbitrarily arrested and
 detained citizens. In general the authorities did not punish the perpetrators, al-
 though the Kabila Government is attempting to establish controls over security
 forces; few allegations of abuses were made against the new police force. The judici-
 ary is subject to executive influence, and the judicial system remains plagued by
 lack of resources, inefficiency, and corruption. It remains largely ineffective as a de-
 terrent to human rights abuses or as a corrective force. Security forces violated citi-
 zens' rights to privacy. The Kabila Government suspended political party activities,
 and arbitrary arrest and detention were increasingly evident by year's end. Citizens
 were not able to vote to change their government in multiparty elections. Prolonged
 pretrial and extrajudicial detention is a problem.
 Although a large number of indepent newspapers publish freely, the govern-
 ments sought to limit freedom of sp.ch and the press by harassing and arresting
 newspaper editors and journalists. The Government restricted freedom of assembly
 and association. It suspended political party activity and used security services to
 stp political demonstrations, sometimes resulting in deaths and arrests. Freedom
 of religion is recognized. Although a law restricts the proc~ss for official recognition
 of religious groups. The Mobutu government had limited ireedom of movement. The
 Government resisted efforts by the United Nations to investigate reports of mas-
 sacres. Discrimination against women, ethnic minorities, and pygmies is a problem.
 Violence against women is a problem and is seldom punished. Female genital muti-
 lation persists among isolated populations in the north. Child labor is a common
 problem in the informal sector.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were many credible reports
 that the security forces of the Mobutu regime committed numerous killings of civil-
 ians during the year. Although precise estimates are unavailable, these included the
 random killing of civilians by soldiers engaged in criminal acts and the harassment
 of political opponents. These abuses subsided after the change in government as the
 AL strengthened its control over Kinshasa, and as many former army of Zaire
 (FAZ) soldiers surrendered their weapons to comply with the ADF's orders. How-
 ever, credible reports of killings by ill-disciplined troops continued in other areas of
 the country, particularly in the Kivus.
 The national Red Cross claimed to have collected 318 bodies in the 4 days follow-
 ing the ADFL takeover of Kinshasa. Some local human rights organizations re-
 ported a much higher number of deaths; these -figures were never verified. Most
 were persons killed while trying to loot or were former members of the FAZ carrying
 arms. There were also several reports of summary executions, some of which may
 have been committed by civilians.
 Harsh prison conditions and abuse led to an undetermined number of deaths in
 prisons. Prisoners under the Mobutu regime and the Government died of illness or
 starvation (see Section 1.c.).
 On June 12, a soldier shot a student to death who was traveling to a state funeral
 for a Mobutu government general. Accounts differ concerning the incident. In one
 version, the student threw a stone at the soldier; in another, several soldiers forcibly
 ordered the student from a vehicle hijacked by the student to attend the funeral.
 
 
 69
 On August 26, the FAC killed a student during a confrontation between students
 at the University of Kinshasa and the FAC. More than 10 other students were re-
 portedly wounded in the incident.
 On July 25, FAC soldiers fired on a peaceful demonstration by the Unified
 Lumumbist Party (PALU), killing one demonstrator and wounding six others. Sol-
 diers unfamiliar with riot controfprocedures reportedly overreacted when the dem-
 onstrators refused to disperse. At least one demonstrator was killed and six others
 seriously injured.
 In February Ela Meji Manyanga Alphonsine died in the custody of the Special Re-
 search Brigade (BSRS) after having reportedly been tortured in its facility. Ela Meji
 was reportedly detained in place of one of her children, who was sought by the
 BSRS or having listened to news of the war in a public place and consequently la-
 beled a rebel sympathizer.
 There were several reports in Autumn of killings of suspected witches in
 Orientale province, allegedly on the orders of local ADFL officials, after accusation
 by local residents.
 b. Disappearance.-There were several reported cases of disappearance, most oc-
 curring during the national conflict early in the year. Security forces of the Mobutu
 regime regularly held alleged suspects in secret detention for varying periods of
 time before acknowledging that they were actually in custody. Typical accounts de-
 scribed unidentified assailants who abducted, threatened, and often beat their vic-
 tims before releasing them. Journalists and opposition members claimed that they
 were targets for such actions.
 Two opposition figures, Ismail Tutu'emoto and Bunia Luminangulu, disappeared
 on July 1. They had been in exile during the Mobutu period, but returned to the
 country to support the ADFL. They were reportedly arrested for having criticized
 President Kabi a.
 A Ministry of Information employee and former leader of the ADFL reeducation
 campaign in Goma disappeared in late November after having been asked to report
 to the National Security Council. He may have been taken into custody on suspicion
 of collaborating with persons accused of attempting to destabilize the Government,
 or he may have gone into hiding.
 The authorities arrested Freddy Libeba, an early ADFL supporter on December
 21 on order of the National Security Council. His whereabouts were unknown as of
 year's end.
 There were multiple reports that ethnic Hutus were responsible for disappear-
 ances in the Boma area during the civil conflict.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the law forbids torture, security forces and prison officials under both the
 Mobutu and the Kabila administrations have disregarded this prohibition, often
 beating prisoners in the process of arresting or interrogating them. A nongovern-
 mental organization (NGO) worker in Maniema region was arrested and severely
 beaten in August by armed forces of the ADFL. In February security forces report-
 edly tortured a woman to death (see Section L.a.).
 Several prisoners released during the Mobutu period claim to have been struck,
 kicked, whipped and suspended upside down for long periods of time. The authori-
 ties, including the judiciary, rarely investigated claims of torture despite their fre-
 quency. Authorities of the Kabila administration have not responded to charges of
 inmate abuse and torture using electric shock and repeated beatings by its security
 and prison officials.
 Unionist Gaby Kyamusoke suffered harassment and threats to his personal secu-
 rity for continuing to denounce corrupt practices within the Directorate General of
 Taxation under the Mobutu regime. Kyamusoke encountered difficulties with
 Mobutu's National Intelligence Service (SNIP) during the conflict when Kabila alleg-
 edly threatened reprisal if Kyamusoke was subjected to any further harassment.
 Kabila's statements, broadcast on international radio, prompted the then-authorities
 to call Kyamusoke a rebel sympathizer and detain him. Kyamusoke was subse-
 quently required to report to SNIP every work day and to the public prosecutor's
 office every Monday and Friday.
 Soon after the ADFL took power, a number of cases arose in which women wear-
 ing short skirts or jeans were publicly stripped of their clothing and, in some cases,
 raped by ADFL troops. The authorities ended this practice within a few months, but
 there is no indication that the perpetrators were ever punished. Persons wearing
 uniforms raped women in many neighborhoods of Kinshasa and Lubumbashi (see
 Section 2.d.).
 Members of the security forces under the Mobutu regime robbed and extorted ci-
 vilians, generally without official rebuke. During the early- months of the year, they
 continued to commit many criminal infractions, including robbery, extortion, and
 
 
 looting, leading many citizens to welcome the ADFL, with its promises to respect
 individuals and to end such corrupt practices. While there are frequent examples
 of abuses by the Kabila governments military forces, the Government often at-
 tributes these to former Zairian soldiers integrated into its military forces. The
 newly revised military justice system prosecuted several FAC members on charges
 ranging from theft to rape to murder.
 Eugene Diomi Ngongala, leader of the Front for the Survival of Democracy, was
 arrested without charge on December 11. During his arrest, soldiers reportedly bur-
 glarized his house and raped two female relatives there. Diomi claimed to have been
 beaten regularly since his arrest. He remained uncharged and in custody at year's
 end.
 Military authorities took several relatives and friends of Freddy Libeba into cus-
 tody on December 20 and 21 (see Section 1.b.). They were interrogated concerning
 the whereabouts of weapons su posedly hidden by Libeba. They reported frequent
 beatings, and remained detainedwithout charge at year's end.
 The Kabila Government operates 220 known prisons and other places of deten-
 tion, all assumed from the Mobutu regime. In all such facilities, conditions remain
 life threatening, although at the end of the year the Government undertook work
 at Kinshasa's main prison, Makala, to improve conditions. The Mobutu government
 did not acknowledge its responsibility to provide prisoners with food or medical sup-
 plies. The Kabila administration provided food at some prisons, but not in sufficient
 quantities to ensure adequate nutrition for all inmates. Prison conditions remain a
 threat to prisoners' lives. Living conditions are harsh and unsanitary, and prisoners
 are poorly treated. The system-has severe shortages of funds, medical facilities, food,
 and trained personnel.
 Overcrowding and corruption - in the prisons were widespread abuses under
 Mobutu. Reports of prisoners being tortured, beaten to death, deprived of food and
 water, or dying of starvation were common during the Mobutu period, and continued
 under Kabila. Prisoners are wholly dependent on personal resources of family or
 friends for their survival. Inmates at Makala central prison in Kinshasa sleep on
 the floor without bedding and have no access to sanitation, potable water, or ade-
 quate health care. Tuberculosis, red diarrhea, and other infectious diseases are
 rampant. Although authorities do not target women for abuse, prison guards rape
 female inmates. fn some cases, such as in Goma, official prisons were destroyed dur-
 ing the fighting, and prisoners are held in military and security holding cells, where
 their rights often receive even less protection.
 The ICRC, religious organizations, and local human rights organizations usually
 had access to prisons nationwide under Mobutu. For several months after the ADFL
 takeover, neither these organizations nor family members were allowed access to
 several prisons throughout the country. The Kabila Government began to grant ac-
 cess to prisons in September. Under the Mobutu regime, the use of unpublicized and
 unofficial detention sites by the civil and military authorities circumvented humani-
 tarian groups' access to many prisoners and detainees. The practice of using unoffi-
 cial detention sites, such as private homes, occurs under the Kabila Government.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Despite legal provisions governing arrest
 and detention procedures, the security forces under beth Mobutu and Kabila were
 responsible for numerous cases of arbitrary arrest and detention. Under the Mobutu
 regime, police functions were carried out under the Ministry of Defense gendar-
 merie. Te new Government created a National Police Force under the Ministry of
 Interior. At year's end, the new police force had established a presence in all re-
 gions.
 Under the law, serious offenses (those punishable by more than 6 months' impris-
 onment) do not require a warrant for a suspect's arrest. Only a law enforcement offi-
 cer with "judicial police officer" status is empowered to authorize arrest. This status
 is also vested in senior officers of the security services. The law instructs security
 forces to bring detainees to the police within 24 hours. The law also provides that
 detainees must be charged within 24 hours and be brought within 48 hours before
 a magistrate, who may authorize provisional detention for varying renewable peri-
 ods.
 In practice these provisions were rarely followed under the Mobutu regime and
 have been violated by the Kabila regime. During the Mobutu period, gendarmes and
 civil guards commonly detained civilians without any legal authority. The security
 forces, especially those carrying out the orders of any official who could claim au-
 thority, used arbitrary arrest to intimidate outspoken opponents and journalists.
 Charges were rarely filed, and the political motivation for such detentions was often
 obscure. When the authorities did press charges, the claims they filed were some-
 times contrived or recitations of archaic colonial regulations.
 
 
 Detention without charge has been a frequent problem under the Kabila adminis-
 tration. Two NGO workers in Maniema were arrested by the military forces in Au-
 gust and held at a military camp. Soldiers in the camp allegedly accused them of
 spying for the United Nations Commission of Inquiry that is examining allegations
 of massacres in the eastern part of the country.
 Several high officials of the Mobutu regime were arrested by the Government in
 June for corruption. The authorities failed to prosecute their cases according to legal
 norms, detaining them for extended periods without moving their cases through the
 lea alydys.Som
 leg            yrrested up to 100 demonstrators followin the July 25 FAC in-
 cident. Some were released aftr a few hours; others were held several days. Some
 reported beatings during their detentions. All demonstrators who were arrested
 were released without being charged. In addition to these arrests, soldiers report-
 edly entered the home of PALU leader Antoine Gizenga and whipped a number of
 PALU supporters.
 Government security forces arrested 15 members of the Democratic Union for So-
 cial Progress (UPDS) during a peaceful gathering at the UDPS youth headquarters
 on August 15 and held them without charge, releasing them without explanation
 on October 15.
 Approximately 10 students at the University of Lubumbashi were taken into cus-
 tody by government forces on August 12 following confrontations on the campus be-
 tween students and soldiers. The students were protesting the death of a girl killed
 during a dispute between elements of the military and the police. The students had
 seizedthe dead student's body, refusing to release it to either government officials
 or the student's family. The detainees remained in custody without charge until
 their release in mid-October.
 On October 28, the authorities detained Professor Kalele Ka Bila and Jean-Fran-
 cois Kabanda, both UDPS supporters, for allegedly distributing a document calling
 on citizens to overthrow the "Tutsi invaders." Later in the year, additional charges
 of inciting citizens were added.
 Roger Sala Nzo Badila, leader of a local human rights NGO, was detained on No-
 vember 23 for having published an unflattering report of the Kabila Government's
 human rights record to that date. He remained uncharged and in detention at year's
 end.
 On November 24, Arthur Z'ahidi Ngoma and three colleagues at the political
 think tank Forces du Futur were arrested having violated the ban on public political
 activities.
 On November 26, police arrested Professor Nyabirungu, a legal advisor to UDPS
 leader Tshisekedi and a law professor. He remained in custody without charge at
 year's end.
 On November 26, police took into custody Commandant Masasu, a founder of the
 ADFL. Authorities did not place formal charges against him, although President
 Kabila accused him in a speech of a series of crimes, including drug trafficking and
 maintaining private prisons. Following Masasu's arrest, there were additional de-
 tentions of military and civilian personnel accused of plotting to overthrow the Gov-
 ernment.
 Several journalists and editors were arbitrarily arrested (see Section 2.a.).
 Two of 13 "Katangan gendarmes" detained by ADFL authorities in Lubumbashi
 on May 19 were released.
 At year's end, there were 11 political detainees.
 The Transitional Act specifically forbade exile, and neither government used it.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Despite provisions for independence provided in
 the Transitional Act, the judiciary under the Mobutu regime was not independent
 of the executive branch, which could and did manipulate it. The Supreme Court was
 cited specifically as an independent institution in Kabila's inaugural decree, Decree
 Law No. 3. However, the Kabila administration had not established mechanisms to
 ensure the independence of the judiciary by year's end. A judicial reform decree re-
 portedly is awaiting presidential approval. The judiciary also is ineffective and suf-
 fers from corruption.
 The judiciary includes lower courts, appellate courts, the Supreme Court, and the
 Court of State Security. The Kabila Government announced the creation of a new
 military tribunal in August. The tribunal began functioning in October, taking up
 the case of a soldier who shot a student.
 Civil and criminal codes are based on Belgian and customary law. The Legal Code
 provides for the right to a speedy public trial, the presumption of innocence, and
 legal counsel at all stages of proceedings. Defendants have the right to appeal in
 all cases except those involving national security, armed robbery, and smuggling, all
 of which are adjudicated by the Court of State Security. During the Mobutu period,
 
 
 the law provided for court-appointed counsel at state expense in capital cases, in
 all proceedings before the Supreme Court, and in other cases when requested by the
 court. Authorities of the Mobutu regime ignored these protections. The Kabila ad-
 ministration has not stated a position on providing counsel, but has done so at its
 discretion.
 In an effort to assert judicial independence, the Ministers of Justice and Interior
 in July issued a notice to political, administrative, and military authorities, as well
 as officials of the National Intelligence Agency expressing their concern over reports
 of arrests of magistrates and the closing of certain jurisdictions by political/adminis-
 trative authorities or elements of the ADFL. They reminded authorities that mag-
 istrates are allowed to conduct their activities without hindrance, and that if any
 were deemed to be abusing their authority, there were appropriate legal channels
 for disciplining them. It further promised severe punishment to anyone interfering
 in the administration of justice.
 Adherence to established legal procedures varied considerably under the Mobutu
 regime, and fair public trials were rare. Corruption was pervasive, particularly
 among magistrates, who were very poorly and4 intermittently paid and poorly
 trained. The system remains hobbled by major shortages of personnel,, supplies, and
 infrastructure. The Kabila Government acknowledge that the judiciary is dysfunc-
 tional, but had not taken steps to improve it by year's end.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-
 Mobutu's security forces routinely ignored legal provisions for the inviolability of the
 home and of private correspondence. They ignored the requirement for a search war-
 rant, entering and searching homes at will. Government troops under the Kabila re-
 gime conducted weapons searches in at least five residential districts of Kinshasa,
 entering homes without warrants. In July soldiers reportedly entered the home of
 Palu leader Antoine Gizenga and whipped a number of Palu supporters (see Section
 L.c.).
 In February security forces reportedly tortured to death a woman who was de-
 tained in place of one of her children (see Section l.a.).
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law In Internal Con-
 flicts.-In October 1996 a rebellion against the former government nominally led be
 the ethnic Tutsis (Banyamulenge) in South Kivu resulted in open warfare and the
 expulsion of Hutu refugees from the immediate area of the refugee camps in North
 and South Kivu, and loss of life on all sides. The rebellion expanded in November
 and December 1996; many observers concluded that the rebellion, led by the ADFL,
 was supported by Rwanda and Uganda, and later by Angola. Numerous serious vio-
 lations were committed by both sides during the rebellion which ultimately led to
 the ADFL takeover. Mobutu's government and the former Zairian armed forces
 (FAZ) reportedly executed from several dozen to 100 persons in Bukavu in the early
 days of the rebellion, on suspicion of being Tutsis. In many cases, the victims were
 stopped at impromptu checkpoints and killed on the spot if soldiers believed that
 they were Tutsis. The former Zairian authorities also organized gangs of young men
 to terrorize Tutsis who remained in their villages. Rape and theft by these soldiers
 or gangs also took place, according to reports. Mobutu soldiers and civilians had per-
 petrated a similar ethnic cleansing in Kinshasa in late 1996, when they intimidated
 several hundred Tutsis into fleeing, often after losing their homes and all their pos-
 sessions. The persecution was often aimed at anyone whom they said "looked" Tutsi.
 During the course of the military campaign, there were reports of civilian deaths
 caused by members of the FAZ, who pillaged towns, then fled the ADFL. Following
 the ADFL takeover of Kinshasa, there were reports of killings attributed to FAZ ele-
 ments, again in the context of attempted thefts or looting.
 In addition a pattern emerged in Bukavu that was then repeated in many towns
 in the east during the ADFL military campaign. With the news that the ADFL
 rebels were approaching, the FAZ increased its customary abuses of local residents,
 stealing cars and demanding larger sums of money, ending with a looting spree and
 flight in advance of the rebels. During these final lootings, the FAZ often severely
 beat civilians to force them to reveal where they had idden anything of value.
 Some of the worst abuses took place in Beni, north of Goma, where a large group
 of school girls was raped by the retreating FAZ. Throughout the FAZ retreat across
 the north, there were reports that they had kidnaped and raped girls, as well as
 committed killings, theft, and wanton destruction of civilians' property.
 According to many reports, members of the Former Armed Forces of Rwanda (Ex-
 FAR) and rnterahamwe or Hutu militia among the Rwandan refugee population also
 killed local residents and stole from them as they went. There were also credible
 reports that a local militia in the Kivus, the Ma Mai, killed Hutu and Tutsi refu-
 gees and local citizens.
 
 
 Rebels were accused of massacring segments of the refugee population, and of
 summarily executing business people who did not comply wit ADFL directives. At-
 tacks on the refugee camps in 1996, and during the year on groups of refugees, flee-
 ing to the West as ADFL troops advanced, were not onl attacks on armed extremist
 Hutu militia and military groups (Former FAR and Interahamwe) but also on
 women, children, and other noncombatants.
 There were armed Former FAR and Interahamwe elements among most groups
 of refugees throughout the conflict. In many cases, the Hutu refugees were hostages
 of armed Hutu elements, who were using them both as human shields and to ex-
 tract food and other aid from international agencies and NGO's. Hutu men found
 dead in the forest may in some cases have been fighting against ADFL troops. Other
 battles took place in which Hutu refugees died because they were on the scene rath-
 er than because they were targeted. Nonetheless, there are many persistent and
 credible reports of simple, straightforward killings of unarmedpersons by the ADFL
 forces or Rwandan troops. There are reports of massacres of Hutu refugees by the
 rebels, often specifically identified as Tutsis, or by Rwandan government forces
 throughout the campaign from the east to Kinshasa, with particularly numerous
 -and detailed reports from the area of the Kivus, the Kisanganiarea, an  andaa.
 Serbian mercenaries employed by the Mobutu regime reportediy executed resi-
 dents of the Kisangani area at random fur not possessing correct identification docu-
 ments.
 The U.N. Special Rapporteur on Human Rights for the Congo in a July report on
 allegations of massacres since September 1996, acknowledged information on 134 al-
 leged massacres, most of them attributable to the ADFL and the Banyamulenge. Re-
 portedly several thousand persons were killed in the massacres, including large
 numbers of women and children. Thousands of others probably died of disease or
 malnutrition.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Statutes that predate Decree-law No. 3 provide
 for these rights, and remain in effect. Freedom of expression generally has been ac-
 knowledge[ by governing authorities as a fundamental civil right since 1990, and
 the Kabila Government continued this recognition. Incidents of harassment, intimi-
 dation, and detention of journalists declined after the change in government. On oc-
 casion authorities harassed and arrested journalists, but most continued to operate
 under the Kabila Government. At year's end, incidents of press harassment beg an
 to increase. Most publications rely on external financing in. order to operate. This
 external financing most often comes from political parties and individual politicians.
 Thus publications tend to represent editorial points of view rather than present
 facts; many are highly critical of the Government. Most publications have been able
 to operate without hindrance, although Polydor Muboyayi, editor of the newspaper
 Le Phare, was arrested in September for publishing an article that claimed that
 Kabila was creating his own elite, ethnically based presidential guard, in the man-
 ner of Mobutu. He was released on November 18. Modeste Mutinga, editor of Le
 Potential, was detained for several hours by the authorities for attempting to ar-
 range protest activities to demand Muboyayi's release. Michel Ladi Luya of Le
 Palmares was detained for 5 days at the end of September on unknown charges.
 Publishers must continue to deposit copies with the Information Ministry.
 The principal means of communication with the public are radio and, in major
 urban areas, television. Although radio and television remain under government
 control, private stations are able to operate. Opositionparties were unable to gain
 access to official electronic media under both Mobutu andKabila.
 Government radio or television do not-exercise editorial independence. Under the
 Kabila Government, there have been expulsions of independent journalists from
 public media on grounds of being Mobutuist, regional radio stations being required
 to broadcast government news, and takeover of private radio stations in Kivu and
 Maniema.
 Academic freedom was restricted under Mobutu; under Kabila academic freedom
 is apparently respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-There is no legal protection for
 freedom of assembly. The right to assemble and associate was recognized by the
 Mobutu government, and to a lesser degree by the Kabila Government, as the full
 exercise of the right of assembly is subordinate to the maintenance of "public order."
 Both the Mobutu and Kabila Governments required all organizers to apply for per-
 mits, which are granted or rejected at the Government's discretion. Large scale ac-
 tivities are generally dispersed by government security services. Government at-
 tempts to disperse party meetings have resulted in deaths and detentions (see Sec-
 tions L.a. and 1.d.). These violent reactions to demonstrations by the Kabila Govern-
 
 
 ment were in part due to overreactions by FAC troops inexperienced in crowd con-
 trol rather than specific intent by the Government to inflict harm. No action was
 taken to punish those soldiers who overreacted.
 The law provides no protection for freedom of association. Effective from 1990,
 citizens were free to join or refrain from participating in any political party. Political
 parties were required to register with the Minister of Interior under the Mobutu
 government. Upon assuming power, Kabila suspended political party activities, but
 not the parties themselves. Kabila included individuals from parties outside the
 ADFL in his Government, who serve in their individual capacities (see Section 3).
 Political party offices remain open and parties continue to  ion.  bic political
 gatherings are effectively prevented by the Government, although opposition party
 leaders remain able to conduct small, private meetings. The effect of the party sus-
 pensions varies widely throughout the country, but is not strictly enforced in some
 provinces.
 In theory anyone wishing to form a new political party would be able to do so
 by registering with the Minister of Interior. No one has yet tried to do so. The Gov-
 ernment requires that NGO's register with the Minister of Justice. Those already
 in existence before the ADFL took power were not required to reregister with the
 new government.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is recognized, although the process
 for official recognition of religious groups is restricted by law. Both the Mobutu and
 Kabila Governments respeted freedom of religion in practice, with the reservation
 that the expression of this right neither disturb public order nor contradict com-
 monly held morals. There is no legally established or favored church or religion. Se-
 curity forces detained Pastr Ngoy flunga for 4 days for criticizing President Kabila
 and his Government during a sermon in his church Ngoy was again taken into de-
 tntion on December 16; at year's end, he remained in detention without charge.
 A 1971 law regulating re igious organizations grants civil servants the power to
 establish and dissolve religious groups. Although this law restricts the process for
 official recognition, officially recognized religions are free to establish places of wor-
 ship and to train clergy.
 Many recognized churches have external ties, and foreigners are allowed to pros-
 elytize. Both the Mobutu and Kabila governments generally did not interfere with
 foreign missionaries. There has been no known persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses
 or any other groups for practicing their faith in recent years.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Under the Mobutu government, the Transitional Act allowed for free-
 ado  of movement; however, the  obutu govenrment, and in particular the security
 forces acting independently, often restricted this freedom. A common extortion
 scheme involved stopping travelers and demanding to see identity cards, which have
 not been issued since 1987. Travel is generally easier under the Kabila administra-
 tion due to government efforts to combat corrupt practices.
 The threat of ape s  e   i     p          n      e  ersons, restricts free-
 dom of movement at night for women in many neighborhoods. Groups of citizens im-
 plemented neighbori ood watch programs, but women in many parts of Kinshasa
 and Lubumbashi do not leave their homes at night.
 The new Government has continued to provide first asylum. Tens of thousands
 of refugees were accepted into the country following the outbreak of civil war in the
 neighboring Republic of Congo during June. Refugees from Uganda and Angola con-
 tinue to live peacefully as well, and the Government cooperates with the U.N. High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHOR) and other international agencies. The Govern-
 ment stated that in view of the situation in Burndi at year's end, Burundian Hutu
 refugees would be allowed to remain in the country.
 The new Government's record on refugees since taking power was greatly marred
 by the forced return over 800 Rwandan and Burndian refugees from the refugee
 center in Kisangani to Rwanda in September. Although the Burundians apparently
 were not targeted for forcible return to a country where they feared persecution,
 they apparently were mixed with refugees from Rwanda in the camp and were gat  -
 ered with them. The UNHCR believed that it was likely that the camp contained
 Rwandans not entitled to refugee status, as well as some who were but had not yet
 been screened. The UNHCR had not initiated discussions with the Government over
 screening of the refugees. Government spokesmen claimed  at tahe repatriation
 was, in most cases, voluntary. It also claimed that some persons in the center had
 intimidated center residents and prevented voluntary repatriation by those who
 were genuine refugees.
 On October 3, the Government closed the border with Rwanda, preventing the ar-
 rival of an influx of Rwandan Hutus fleeing antiinsurgency operations in western
 Rwanda. It also claimed that it had expelled 4,000 newly arrived Rwandan Hutus.

 The country is a signatory to the 1951 U.N. Convention, its 1967 Protocol related
 to the Treatment of Refugees, and the 1969 Organization of African Unity refugee
 convention.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the right or the ability to change their government peace-
 fully. Citizens have not been able to change their government through free elections
 since independence in 1960. After 7 years of unsuccessful "transition," from authori-
 tarian rule by former president Mobutu to democratic governance, the ADFL take-
 over was welcomed by many citizens.
 In his inaugural address, President Kabila promised a constitution and elections
 by 1999. After several months of delay, in October the Government completed the
 first series of steps in the Government's announced election calendar, including the
 creation of a Constitutional Commission. The Commission is scheduled to produce
 a draft constitution by March 1998.
 In forming its government, the ADFL chose a relatively diverse group of ministers
 and other functionaries, drawn from different ethnicgroups, geographic regions, and
 political parties. Those drawn from outside the ADFL are required by opposition
 parties to serve as individuals and not as party representatives. During the military
 campaign through the Congolese countryside, the ADFL held quasi-electoral selec-
 tions--by acclamation--of provincial leadership (governor, vice-governor, mayor) in
 most provinces, where candidates, some drawn from outside the ADFL, were ap-
 proved in public meetings of the local population.
 I There are no official restrictions on the participation of women or minorities in
 politics. However, in practice- there -are few women or Muslims in senior positions
 in the Government, or-in political -parties. There -was one female ambassador with
 cabinet rank in Kabila's Government and two female vice ministers in the 23-person
 Cabinet at year's end.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigationr of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of effective human rights organizations have been-able to operate under
 both the Mobutu and Kabila governments. NGO activities were initially restricted
 in areas-occupied by the ADFL, but these restrictions were gradually relaxed.. Local
 human rights NGO's investigate and publish their findings on human rights cases.
 These activities have taken place largely without government restriction.
 In April U.N. -High    Commissioner for- -Human   Rights (UNHCHR)Special
 Rapporteur Roberto Garreton issued a report; on'the human rights situation in then-
 - Zaire, including a finding thatthere were credible reports of atrocities committed
 by A5FL forces against.Rwandan Hutu. refugees. The ADFL denied Garreton's alle-
 gations and refused to allow a follow-ur mission afrom the' UNHCHR to visit areas
 under ADFL contrl. After taking power, Kabila'ltimately accepted a second inves-
 -tigative team named by the U.N. Secretary_ General. After the team's arrival, the
 Government dlenied the team its frst choice for deployment, and accused the team
 of violating the terms of its investigation. After recall of the team leaders by the
 Secretary General to New York in October a new agreement for field investigation
 was reached and the leaders returned in November. The team 'deployed to
 - Mbandaka in December, withdrawing to the capital for security reasons when faced
 with protests against the team. At year's end, the team was working toward rede-
 loyment. The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights conducted
 discussions with the Ministry of Justice on creating a formal liaison mechanism,
 particularly regarding administration of justice and human rights education.
 The Government has responded to some human rights reports with stern edi-
 torials in newspapers and on xadio and television,-sometimes denying allegations of
 abuses, and labeling, them "lies." Some human, rights grups have complained of
 -harassment after theirissuance of unflattering reports. However, the majority of or-
 ganizations continue their activities -without interference, and several critical docu-
 ments have circulated without government intervention.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Previous constitutions forbade discrimination-based on ethnicity, sex, or religious
 affiliation, but the Government made little headway in advancing these provisions.
 Societal discrimination remains an obstacle to the advancement of certain groups,
 particularly women, Muslims, and the Pygmy (Batwa) ethnic group.
 Women.-Domestic violence against women, including rape, is believed to be com-
 mon, but there are no known government or NGO statistics on the extent of this
 violence. Rape is a crime, but the press rarely reported incidents of violence against
 
 
 women or children. Press reports of rape generally appear only if rape is a con-
 sequence of some other crime, rarely because of the act of rape itself. The police
 rarely intervene in domestic disputes.
 Women are relegated to a secondary role in society. They comprise the majority
 of primary agricultural laborers, and small-scale traders and are almost exclusively
 responsible for child rearing. In the nontraditional sector, women commonly receive
 less pay for comparable work. Only rarely do they occupy positions of authority or
 high responsibility. Women also tend to receive less education than men.
 Women are required by law to obtain their spouse's permission before engaging
 in routine legal transactions, such as selling or renting real estate, opening a bank
 account, accepting employment, or applying for a passport. A 1987 revision of the
 Family Code permits a widow to inherit her husband's property, to control her own
 property, and to receive a property settlement in the event of divorce. In practice,
 sometimes consistent with customary law, women are denied these rights. Widows
 are commonly stripped of all possessions-as well as their dependent children-by
 the deceased husband's family. Human rights groups and church organizations are
 working to combat this custom, but there is generally no government intervention
 or legal recourse. Women also are denied custody of their children in divorce cases,
 but they retain the right to visit them. Polygyny is practiced although it is illegal.
 Children of plygynous unions are legally recognized, but only the first wife is le-
 gally recogmzed as a spouse.
 Children.-Government spending on children's programs is nearly nonexistent.
 Primary school education is not compulsory, free, or universal. In public schools,
 parents are formally required to pay a small fee, but the education system deterio-
 rated so badly under the Mobutu regime that parents are often informally expected
 to pay teachers' salaries. Dire economic circumstances often hamper parents' ability
 to cover these added expenses, meaning that children may not be able to attend
 school. Most schools function only in areas where parents have formed cooperatives.
 There are no documented cases in which security forces or others targeted chil-
 dren for specific abuse, although children suffer from the same conditions of gener-
 alized social disorder and widespread disregard for human rights that affect society
 as a whole. These conditions sometimes render parents unable to meet their chil-
 dren's basic human needs.
 Some children as young as 10 years of age were allowed to enlist as soldiers in
 the Kabla military forces. There have been no reports of forced conscription of chil-
 dren. The Government has not taken comprehensive measures to remove all child
 soldiers from its armed forces. Government demobilization of some child soldiers in
 Bukava took place in December with assistance from the U.N. Children's Fund
 (UNICEF). The number of very young soldiers appears to have declined as military
 training programs produced new adult recruits. However, child soldiers remain a
 very significant presence.
 Female genital mutilation, which is widely condemned by international health ex-
 perts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is not widespread, but
 it is practiced on young girls among isolated groups in the north. Legislation prohib-
 iting the practice was not enforced by the Mobutu government. The Kabila Govern-
 ment has not addressed the problem.
 People With Disabilities.-The law does not mandate accessibility to buildings or
 government services for the disabled. There are some special schools, many with
 missionary staff, that use private funds and limited public support to provide edu-
 cation and vocaiona training to blind and physically disabled students.
 Indigenous People.-Societal discrimination ontinued against the Pygmy (Batwa)
 population of less than 10,000. Although citizens, Pygmies living in remote areas
 took no part in the political process.
 NationalRacia/Ethnic Minoritis.-The last official census was taken in 1984.
 It is estimated that the population is now 45 to 50 million, and comprises more than
 200 separate ethnic groups. Four indigenous languages have national status. French
 is the landage of government, commerce, and education. Members of former presi-
 dent Mobutu e Ngbandi ethnic group were disproportionately represented at the
 highest levels of the military and intelligence services. In the final months of the
 Mobutu regime, ethnic Tutsis were subjected to harassment and abuse throughout
 the country by government security forces and by some citizens for perceived Tutsi
 disloyalty in the face of growing rebellion. There were accusations that President
 Kabila used disproportionate numbers of Tutsis and Katangans in his Government,
 but the distribution of ministerial and senior military positions did not appear to
 reflect such favoritism. The Government has representatives from all regions and
 major tribal groups.
 
 
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Legislation in effect from the Mobutu period permits
 all workers except magistrates and military personnel to form and join trade unions.
 Before 1990 the law required all trade unions to affiliate with the National Union
 of Zairian Workers (UNTZA), the sole recognized labor confederation and which also
 formed part of-Mobutu's Popular Movement of the Revolution (MPR) party. When
 political-pluralism was- permitted in ApriL1990,' UNTZA disaffiliated itself from the
 R and reorganized under new leadeship chosen through elections deemed fair
 by outside observers. After the ADFL- takeover, the-union renamed itself the Na-
 tional Union- of Congolese (UNTC). Although the UNTC remains the largest labor
 federation, almost 100 other independent-unions are now registered with the Labor
 Ministry and two other -large federations. are active. Some of these are affiliated
 with political parties or associated- with a single industry or geographic area.
 The law recognizes the right to strike. However, legal strikes-rarely, occur since
 the law requires prior resort to lengthy mandatory arbitration and appeal proce-
 dures. Labor unions have not been able. to.defend effectively the rights of workers
 in the deteriorating economic environment. Illegal general, sector,,and other strikes,
 often called by political parties and not necessarily organized-by unions, occurred
 under the Mobutu government. Such illegal strike tactics have not been used under
 the Kabila Government. The law prohibits employers or the Government from re-
 taliating against-strikers, but it is rarely enforced.           \\
 Unions may-affiliate with international bodies. The UNTC participates\in the Or-
 ganization of African Trade Union Unity,.and the Central Union of.Congo is affili-
 ated with the World Confederation of Labor.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Mobutu period law pro-
 vides for the right tobargsin ollectively, and an agreement between the UNTC and
 the Employers' Association provided for wages andprices to be jointly negotiated
 each year under minimal government supervision. This system, which functioned
 until i991, broke down as a result of the rapid.depreciation of the currency. The
 professional unions and the Congolese Business lFederation signed a cooperative
 agreement in September. While collective bargaining still exists in theory, continu-
 Ang inflation encouraged a return to pay rates individually arranged between em-
 ployers and employees.
 The collapse of the formal economy has also resulted in a decline in the influence
 of unions,, a tendency to ignore existing labor regulations, and a buyer's market for
 labor. The Labor Code prohibits antiunion discrimination, although this regulation
 was not strongly enforced by the Ministry of Labor under Mobutu. The law also re-
 quires employers to reinstate workers fired for union activities. In the public sector,
 te Government sets wages by decree; public sector-unions act only in an informal
 advisory capacity.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, and it is not known to occur. The law does not specifically prohibit
 forced and bonded labor by children, but such practices are not known to occur.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The legal
 minimum age. for employment is 18 years. Employers may legally hire minors be-
 tween the ages of 14 and 18 with the consent of a parent or guardian, but those
 under age 16 may work a maximum of 4 hours per Jay; those between the ages of
 16 and 18 may work up to 8 hours. The law prohibiting forced or compulsory labor
 does not specifically mention children, but forced and bonded labor by children are
 not known to occur (see Section 6.c.). Employment of children of all ages is common
 in the informal sector and in subsistence agriculture, which form the dominant por-
 tions of the economy. Such employment is often the only way a child or family can
 obtain money for food. Neither the Ministry of Labor, which is responsible for en-
 forcement, nor the labor unions make an effort to enforce child labor laws. Larger
 enterprises do not commonly exploit child labor. The availability of education for
 children is extremely limited in practice (see Section 5).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Most citizens are engaged in subsistence agri-
 culture or commerce outside the formal wage sector. The minimum wage, last ad-
 justed by government decree in 1990, was subsequently rendered irrelevant due to
 rapid inflation. Most workers rely on the extended family and informal economic ac-
 tivity to survive. The maximum legal workweek (excluding voluntary overtime) is
 48 hours. One 24-hour rest period is -required every 7 days.
 The Labor Code specifies health and safety standards. The Ministry of Labor is
 officially charged with enforcing these standards, but its efforts to do so remain in-
 sufficient. There are no provisions in the Labor Code permitting workers to remove
 themselves from dangerous work situations without penalty.
