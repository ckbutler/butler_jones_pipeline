 MONGOLIAN PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC
 
 There is a paucity of information on the "Mongolian
 People's Republic" (MPR), and much of what is available
 comes directly from the Mongolian regime. The few resi-
 dent diplomats and occasional visitors are mainly limited
 to the capital city of Ulaanbaatar and get only brief
 and opaque glimpses of Mongolian life in other parts of
 the country. The U.S. does not recognize or have diplo-
 matic relations with the MPR.
 The MPR is a communist country almost totally
 dominated by the Soviet Union. Although the U.S. has no
 specific evidence of human rights shortcomings or
 violations, it is assumed that the MPR regard for human
 rights is no greater than that of its Soviet mentors.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 The Department of State has no information regarding
 whether or not torture is employed in the MPR.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Department of State has no information regarding
 whether or not cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment
 or punishment is practiced in the MPR.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 See paragraph d below.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 During the 1920's and 1930's and into the 1940's, the
 MPR used secret police methods, secret trials, and
 during the 1930's, like the Soviets, had a series of
 purges with trumped-up or non-existent evidence.
 Indeed, not qntil 1949 did a law specifically confirm
 the exclusive right of legally constituted courts to
 try criminals cases. The civil and criminal codes
 provide the formal right to judicial process, right of
 the accused to a defense, and open courts, except as
 "specially stipulated by law." The Department of State
 has no information on how the judicial system actually
 operates, but all effective instruments are controlled
 by the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, and
 aggrieved citizens are not likely to secure redress in
 the courts. The emphasis in the criminal code is on
 crimes against the state, i.e., the death penalty may be
 imposed for "deliberate embezzlement or misappropriation
 of state property."

 e.   Invasion of the Home
 The Department of State has no information regarding
 whether or not homes in the MPR are secure from
 invasion.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the
 Fulfillment of Such Vital Needs as Food,
 Shelter, Health Care and Education:
 The MPR has made major efforts to transform an
 essentially nomadic, semi-feudal country into a
 more modern society, although the MPR has been
 described by an American journalist who recently
 visited the country as the most backward of the
 Communist states. From a base of almost complete
 illiteracy in 1921, it has now reportedly achieved
 a level of approximately 80% literacy. There is
 compulsory free education for seven years, a
 system of technical and high schools, one univer-
 sity and four post-secondary institutes. The
 regime has also utilized adult education with
 considerable success to help stamp out illiteracy.
 Similarly, considerable achievements in medicine
 and public health are claimed. A two-year medical
 technical school was opened in 1931; in 1938 the
 first four Mongolian doctors (trained in Moscow)
 returned to practice in their native country; and
 in 1947 the first fully-qualified Mongolian doctors
 were graduated from their own medical institute.
 According to MPR statistics, the MPR ranks second
 only to Japan in the number of doctors and hospital
 beds per capita in Asia. Sanitation, although
 still primitive in the smaller cities and rural
 areas, had become a major works project in
 Ulaanbaatar.
 The MPR provides free medical attention, temporary
 disability payments, permanent disability pensions,
 old age assistance, unemployed payments, aid to
 expectant mothers, burial costs, and free or low
 cost access to government-operated health resorts.
 These services are based on the Constitutional-
 guarantees that all citizens have the "right to
 material assistance in old age as well as in the
 event of illness and loss of capacity to work."
 The MPR has also done a creditable job in pro-
 viding food and shelter for its citizens. There
 has been considerable construction of modern
 apartment buildings, especially in Ulaanbaatar,
 but construction has not been able to keep up
 with growing needs as nomads move to urban life.
 Still, many Mongols prefer to live, even in the
 city, in their traditional tent-like dwelling.
 Mongolia is a food exporting country. The
 normal diet in the past was almost entirely
 restricted to meat and animal products. The
 regime has encouraged, and even forced, the
 cultivation of grains and vegetables to broaden
 the diet, although traditional dietary habits
 are slow to change.
 
 
 497
 While the political elite clearly has many more
 privileges than the average citizen, the Department
 of State has no information indicating that corrupt
 activities are condoned by the regime.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 The Constitition guarantees both freedom of worship
 and freedom of anti-religious propaganda. The
 Buddhist church, which sixty years ago was the best
 organized and intellectual force in Mongolian life,
 has been reduced to a few showcase monasteries and a
 handful of clergy, who serve primarily as propa-
 gandists for the Mongolian regime in its relations
 with the international Buddhist movement. The
 Constitution also provides for freedom of speech,
 of the press, of assembly, and freedom to hold
 demonstrations and assemblies. The Constitution
 specifically states however, that these "freedoms"
 are provided "in order to strengthen the socialist
 state system of the MPR," and it is probable that
 any persons who exercise these freedoms in ways that
 are not viewed by the authorities as contributing to
 this goal would rapidly find themselves in difficul-
 ties. Control is exercised through various mass
 organizations extending down to the block committee
 level. The Supreme Court is responsible for
 guaranteeing the constitutional rights of individuals.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 One of the major tasks of the regime in extending
 its control over its citizens (and in seeking
 economic improvements) has been to change an
 essentially nomadic population into a more stable
 one. Over the last fifty years, the state has
 gradually forced collectivization on the nomads and
 encouraged permanent settlements. All Mongolians
 over 16 years of age must have internal passports
 and must obtain permission from the militia in order
 to travel from one area of the country to another.
 There is little emigration from the MPR other than
 students temporarily studying in the Soviet Union
 or Eastern Europe. If there are Mongolians who wish
 to depart the MPR but who are not permitted to do
 so, their cases have not reached the attention of
 the outside world.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 The Constitution provides that all citizens over 18
 (except the mentally ill) have the right to vote
 and to be elected. The Constitution also provides
 for equal rights irrespective of nationality or
 religion. There is no evidence, however, of
 religious persons or those other than the dominant
 Khalka Mongols occupying elite Party or "government"
 
 
 498
 positions. In elections, only one candidate is
 listed for each office so the choice is to vote
 for him or to cross out his name. Not sur-
 prisingly, many elections result in a 99.9%
 turnout, with the winning candidate receiving
 99.9% of the vote. Obviously the method for
 participating fully in the political process is
 through joining the MPRP and moving up carefully
 through the Party ranks.
 Human rights is not a subject of debate or
 concern for the MPR. In the absence of concrete
 evidence, the Department of State assumes that
 its Constitutional guarantees are applied in
 much the same way as in other communist countries,
 particularly the Soviet Union.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental Investi-
 gation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 We know of no past attempt by outside investigators
 to examine human rights violations by the MPR.
 
 
 NEW ZEALAND
 New Zealand enjoys a firm tradition of democracy
 dating back to its founding in the 19th century. Univer-
 sal suffrage, personal freedoms, respect for minority
 rights, rule by law, fair trial, decent treatment for,
 prisoners, concern for the economically deprived, free
 press, free trade unions, and freedom of religion are
 deeply ingrained principles of the society and are funda-
 mental, unquestioned tenets of the government.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is illegal and is not practiced.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punish-
 ment
 Cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punish-
 ment is not practiced. Capital punishment is not prac-
 ticed and summary executions are unknown. Abuse of pri-
 soners and use of excessive force by police are not con-
 doned and thegovernment has adequate procedures to deal
 with them. Prison and detention facilities provide
 adequate shelter, food, and medical care. Prisoners'
 relatives and attorneys are allowed to visit them. The
 International Committee of the Red Cross has access to.
 all detainees.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest and. Imprisonment
 There are no political prisoners in New Zealand.
 Habeas corpus exists and is honored in practice. Pre-
 ventive detention does not exist.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The law, which guarantees the right to a fair,
 public trial, is respected. Defendants are en-,
 titled to counsel, who have free access to them.
 Courts are independent of executive or military
 control. There are no special courts to deal with
 political or security offenses.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Arbitrary invasion of the home is illegal. Private
 property can only be searched in conformity with the law,
 which requires a warrant.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, and Education
 The New Zealand Government has a highly-developed,
 
 (499)
 
 
 500
 effective system of social welfare that ensures that no
 person lacks adequate food, health care, and housing for
 any reason. Dependent children, old-age pensioners, univer-
 sity students, and the unemployed receive special financial
 assistance. There is compulsory, free public education
 through the secondary level, and fees for university level
 education are very low.
 New Zealand's society is one of the most egalitarian
 in the world. There is little social class distinction.
 Wealth and income are distributed very equally.
 Corruption is not a factor in regard to the fulfill-
 ment of human needs in New Zealand.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly:
 These rights are guaranteed by law as well as by
 custom. All are firmly established cultural traditions.
 There is no censorship or control of the press by the
 government. All religions are freely practiced. There
 is complete freedom of association and assembly.
 The political process is free, democratic, and open.
 The country has a multi-party parliamentary system, in
 which oposition parties function freely and may criticize
 the government. Participation in the political system
 is guaranteed by law to all citizens. Women have legal
 equality with men and participate freely in all phases of
 New Zealand life. Discrimination on the basis of sex is
 illegal.
 The trade union movement enjoys the right to strike,
 to elect its officers, to bargain collectively, and to
 lobby.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigations of Alleged Viola-
 tions of Human Rights
 We know of no requests for investigations involving
 human rights.
