 IRAQ
 Iraq is governed by the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party (ABSP) of
 Iraq through a Revolutionary Command Council (RCC) which has
 both executive and legislative authority under the provisional
 Constitution of 1968. Saddam Hussein holds decisive power as
 President of the Republic, Chairman of the Council, and
 Secretary-General of the Regional Command of the ABSP.
 Iraq contains many disparate groups, most notably Shi'a and
 Sunni Arab Muslims, Kurds, Turcomans, and various Christian
 sects, predominantly Assyrians and Chaldeans.
 In 1985 the war with Iran continued into its sixth year. A
 major Iranian offensive in March severely tested the Iraqi
 southern defenses before being defeated. Iran continues to
 reject Iraqi and international calls for a cease-fire, and to
 use both military-action and terrorism in efforts to overthrow
 Iraq's secular political system. Tight domestic controls
 imposed by the Iraqi regime-in the name of national security
 remain in effect, including a decree which prescribes the
 death penalty for anyone who damages the country's military,
 political, or economic position. Wartime travel restrictions,
 which prevent most Iraqis from departing the country, also
 remained in force. Iranian prisoners of war (POWs) in Iraq
 are estimated at approximately 10,000. Most are believed to.
 be registered with the International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC), which visits the camps. In the past, POWS in
 Iraq were believed to have faced instances of physical
 mistreatment and inadequate diet, but the ICRC reported that
 treatment in 1985 was improved.
 The Ba'ath Party's ideological commitment to increased social,
 labor, and educational opportunities for women and to the
 protection of religious minorities continues to be translated
 into practical action. Iraq has continued to abjure support
 for terrorist groups and to state its opposition to
 terrorism. It has said that support for the Palestinian cause
 does not signify that it condones actions such as the Achille
 Lauro hijacking. On the other hand, political and individual
 rights are sharply limited. The news media are subject to
 censorship. Antiregime activity is dealt with harshly, often
 by extralegal means employed by a large and feared internal
 security police force and the intelligence services.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:'
 a. Political Killing
 Execution has been an established method for dealing with
 perceived political and military opponents of the Government,
 particularly members of the outlawed Da'wa Party
 (fundamentalist Shi'a Muslim) and the Communist Party. In
 July 1985 Iraq confirmed to Amnesty International the
 execution of 16 individuals: 6 members of the banned
 Kurdistan Democratic Party for committing acts of sabotage,
 and 10 members of the prominent Hakim family for organizing an
 opposition political movement and suspected involvement with
 the Da'wa Party. There have been unconfirmed reports of the
 execution without trial of three members of the Iraqi Assyrian
 community for nationalist political activity. Members of the
 political elite have also been executed as a result of
 
 
 1247
 IRAQ
 factional conflict, although no such executions are known to
 have occurred since 1982.
 In 1983 and 1985, the military conducted aerial attacks on
 Kurdish villages suspected of supporting Iranian military
 incursions into Iraq or harboring antigovernment guerrillas,
 resulting in unknown numbers of casualties. From time to time
 there have been reports of executions of military deserters.
 After the March 1985 Iranian offensive, Iran renewed charges
 that Iraq had used chemical weapons, allegations denied by
 Iraq. In March the State Department spokesman condemned Iraqi
 use of chemical weapons. Iraq is a party to the 1925 Geneva
 Protocol banning use, but not production, of lethal and
 incapacitating chemical weapons. There are indications that
 Iraq continues to stockpile lethal agents.
 Iraq is believed to have withdrawn its support in 1983 from
 such terrorist groups as the Black June Organization led by
 Sabri Al-Banna, or "Abu Nidal," and the May 15 organization
 under Husayn Mohammed Al-Umari, or "Abu Ibrahim." Recent
 reports surfacing in the wake of the Achille Lauro hijacking
 indicate that Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
 Executive Committee Member "Abu Abbas" of the Palestinian
 Liberation Front presented an Iraqi diplomatic passport when
 detained by Italian officials. The Iraqis maintain that the
 passport was issued to him in recognition of his official
 position as a member of the PLO Executive Committee and not to
 facilitate the execution of terrorist acts. The Iraqis
 themselves were the victims of several terrorist acts in 1983,
 1984, and 1985 supported by Syria and Iran.
 b. Disappearance
 Iraqi emigrants have reported that some suspects, particularly
 those detained by the security police for subversion,
 disappear following detention. It is difficult in such cases
 to ascertain whether the suspect has been executed or has died
 while incarcerated. In October 1983 Amnesty International
 submitted to Iraq the names of 114 people whose whereabouts
 remain unknown since their abduction between 1979 and 1982.
 Subsequent reports from Amnesty International indicate other
 instances of disappearance, among which is the alleged
 disappearance in 1984 of 153 Assyrians.
 Antigovernment Kurds in Northern Iraq occasionally kidnap
 foreign workers and businessmen. Ransom demands have included
 money, a halt to Western economic cooperation with Iraq, and
 support for the release of prisoners in Iraq. Victims
 generally have been released following negotiations involving
 overseas Kurdish representatives, the victims' employers, and
 Iraqi security organizations.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture and prescribes stiff
 punishment for it, and the Government rejects charges that it
 practices torture. Nevertheless, reliable reports make clear
 that both physical and psychological torture are used by the
 authorities, especially the security police. Given the rigid
 chain of command within the Government and security services,
 it is unlikely that torture could be practiced without the
 authorization of senior officials.
 
 
 1248
 IRAQ
 According to former prisoners, persons detained by the
 security police for political or security-related matters are
 frequently tortured and mistreated. Treatment is reported to
 be worst immediately following arrest and during the period of
 interrogation and investigation, which can last for months.
 Torture and brutal treatment are not limited to political
 cases. Security-related offenses include such routine
 criminal matters as currency violations.
 The security forces' methods of torture, often to extract
 confessions or information about the suspect and his
 colleagues, reportedly include beatings with fists and rubber
 truncheons, electrical shocks to the genitals and other parts
 of the body, and the extraction of fingernails and toenails.
 A Tunisian, who was detained for 10 months by Iraqi security
 forces and released in 1984, alleged torture while in
 custody. Subsequent medical examinations in Paris under the
 auspices of Amnesty International concluded that the signs of
 physical and mental trauma were consistent with the
 allegations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution and legal code guarantee the rights of
 citizens and place checks on police powers in such areas as
 arrest, detention, imprisonment, and search. These guarantees
 are generally respected in criminal cases but have little
 weight in political or national security cases. Security
 police not only make arbitrary arrests but also secretly
 detain suspects, whose fate sometimes has become known only
 after execution. Charges have included espionage, treason,
 and conspiracy against Iraq or the party and revolution, often
 in collaboration with unnamed foreign foes.
 In the past, Iraq expelled large numbers of Iranians and
 Iraqis of supposed Iranian descent. These deportations have
 ceased; however, those remaining often live under the fear of
 deportation or incarceration. Many "Iranian" families have
 been in Iraq for generations. Some say their forebears were
 not from Iran but claimed the nationality to evade Ottoman
 military conscription. Citizens considered to be of Iranian
 origin bear special identification, often precluding desirable
 employment or impeding advancement.
 Iranian military deserters and civilians who fled to Iraq
 during the war have been detained and sometimes mistreated.
 Most of these people reportedly came to Iraq, after long and
 hazardous journeys through Kurdistan, in response to Iraqi
 propaganda promising good treatment and easy access to third
 countries. In response to the decrease in such Iraqi
 propaganda, the numbers of new arrivals at refugee camps have
 lessened. There have been frequent allegations that some have
 been shot or beaten with rubber hoses and metal cables. Some
 Iranian refugees reportedly have been coerced to collaborate
 with Iraqi propaganda despite the danger to family members in
 Iran. When, after many months, these emigres are designated
 "political refugees," their treatment improves and outside
 organizations gain access to them.
 In recent years Amnesty International has reported the
 imprisonment or detention of large numbers of Kurds. Many
 have been removed to resettlement camps. In a separate report
 of July 1985, Amnesty International reported the death while
 imprisoned of a member of a group of 90 males reported to have
 
 
 1249
 I RAQ
 been in detention without charge or trial since their arrest
 in May 1983.
 Following the replacement of the head of the general
 intelligence directorate in late 1983, it is believed that the
 number of political prisoners and arbitrary arrests declined.
 The Da'wa Party, a violent dissident Shi'ite Group, is still
 proscribed, and its members are subject to incarceration and
 execution, as are members of other parties believed to be
 cooperating with Iran.
 There is no indication that Iraq uses forced labor. Apart
 from the expulsion of thousands of residents of Iranian
 descent in 1980 and earlier, exile is not resorted to as a
 means of punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials in civil, criminal, and religious courts are open.
 Defendants are entitled to counsel. A lawyer is provided if a
 defendant cannot afford one. Charges and evidence are
 available for review. Appellate courts hear cases not under
 the jurisdiction of the revolutionary courts. The
 revolutionary courts, which usually hold closed trials, deal
 with espionage, treason, smuggling, and drug trafficking. The
 right of defense in such courts reportedly is severely
 restricted.
 The "special courts" constituted by the Revolutionary Command
 Council for specific incidents, such as the reported
 conspiracy against the regime in 1979, are also closed. These
 special tribunals are apparently exempt from constitutional
 safeguards of defendants' rights. The right of defense is
 proscribed; defendants are held incommunicado, and confessions
 extracted by torture are used against defendants. Appeals can
 be taken only to the Chairman of the Revolutionary Command
 Council. However, the availability of this appeal may be
 questioned, since there are reports that executions take place
 shortly after trial.
 Political dissidence in Iraq is taken by the authorities to
 encompass a wide range of activities and, in an environment
 where no public acknowledgement is made of arrest or.
 imprisonment, it is extremely difficult to gauge the number of
 political prisoners. Amnesty International received reports
 of "several hundred people" being detained for political
 reasons in 1984. Undoubtedly the practice has continued in
 1985.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home,
 or Correspondence
 The Constitution provides protections for the inviolability of
 the home, and strong cultural values reinforce these
 protections. Police must obtain a search warrant before
 entering the home of a criminal suspect. Warrants are not
 required for the arrest of security suspects. Although most
 arrests occur outside the home, there have been reports of
 forced entry and arrest by the security police, particularly
 of suspected members of the outlawed Da'wa Party.
 In late 1985, Iraqi government forces reportedly conducted
 large-scale searches of homes in at least one city in a
 predominantly Kurdish area and detained a number of people.
 
 
 1250
 I RAQ
 There is no legal protection against the monitoring of
 telephones, which many Iraqis believe to be a common
 practice. Likewise, all mail is believed subject to review by
 censors. Government security services and the Ba'ath Party
 are generally assumed to maintain pervasive networks of
 informers.
 Membership in the ruling Ba'ath Party is viewed as a key to
 advancement inside and outside the Government. Although the
 Ba'ath is an elitist party, recruitment can be aggressive.
 Some emigrants have claimed that they joined the party to
 avoid beatings or harassment or to enhance career prospects.
 Certain ethnic and religious groups within Iraq traditionally
 reside in particular areas of the country. Kurds, for
 example, have strong roots in the north. The Government has
 sometimes tried to force changes in settlement patterns. Most
 relocations of Kurds took place in the mid-1970's. More
 recently, families and villages of the Barzani tribe were
 forcibly resettled following the participation by tribe
 leaders and members in Iran's 1983 invasion of northern Iraq.
 Rather than allow Iranian Kurdish refugees displaced by the
 war to remain in the northern mountainous terrain to which
 they are accustomed, the Government is holding this large
 population in detention camps elsewhere. One such camp,
 located in the desert west of Baghdad, is believed to contain
 up to 25,000 people. The Iraqis also provide shelter to
 thousands of displaced ethnic Arabs from Iran's Khuzistan
 Province.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government views political dissent as a security threat,
 and controls exercise of the rights of speech, press, and
 assembly. The Constitution prohibits "any act aimed at
 undermining the national unity of the people, providing
 racial, sectarian, and regional bigotry, or violating gains
 and achievements of the country." Nonetheless, the use of
 minority languages is unrestricted. Kurdish, an official
 language, is used in schools and media in Kurdish areas.
 The Government owns and operates the press, radio, and
 television. The media do not criticize the Government and
 news reporting is strongly biased. Opposition viewpoints are
 not heard. Few foreign periodicals reach Iraq, and Western
 newspapers are not sold. Foreign visitors' newspapers,
 magazines, and cassettes can be confiscated at the airport.
 To control the dissemination of political leaflets,
 typewriters and photocopying machines must be registered.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public meetings are organized only under the auspices of the
 Government or Ba'ath Party. Nonreligious free association and
 demonstrations without government approval have met severe
 repression. Professional organizations are subject to control
 by the Ba'ath Party Central Vocational Bureau.
 Union workers do not represent a significant part of the total
 work force, comprised mostly of agricultural workers,
 shopkeepers, and government employees. Industrial workers,
 the most unionized, are only a small portion of the work
 
 
 1251
 I RAQ
 force. Workers are organized in the Federation of Trade
 Unions under the control of the Ba'ath Party Central Labor
 Bureau. Unions may operate only under officially approved
 guidelines. Elections are held for union executive councils,
 which in turn select officers from among the council
 membership. Nominees are mainly party members. The right to
 bargain collectively is not recognized. Workers legally have
 the right to strike after providing notice to the Labor
 Ministry, but no strikes have been reported since 1968. The
 unions initiate grievances, but a primary union function is to
 indoctrinate members with Ba'athist ideology. Union
 membership is a prerequisite for employment in some sectors.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Iraq is an ethnically and religiously diverse society. Many
 non-Muslims, principally Jews and Christians, left Iraq under
 previous regimes. Members of religious minorities have
 expressed fear that they would again face persecution if Iran
 were to impose an Islamic regime in Baghdad. Since its rise
 to power in 1968, the Ba'athist Government has enforced
 tolerance of religious diversity, seeking to submerge
 religious differences in the promotion of secular nationalism.
 A 1981 law gave the Ministry of Endowments and Religious
 Affairs the authority to promulgate laws and regulations
 governing places of worship, appointment of clergy, religious
 literature, and participation in religious councils and
 meetings. However, while the Government has assumed much
 greater authority in Islamic religious affairs since 1981, the
 law has not been invoked against Iraq's Christian sects.
 Religious leaders operate under close government supervision.
 Muslim leaders are considered government employees and receive
 their salaries through the Government. The Government
 administers the principal Muslim shrines and mosques and has
 increased allotments to refurbish and maintain them in an
 apparent attempt to win support from the devout.
 The Shi'a, who make up roughly 55 percent of the population,
 historically have been economically, politically, and socially
 disadvantaged. The Government has a declared policy to raise
 their living standards and equalize opportunities for economic
 and professional advancement. In recent years, the Government
 and party have promoted Shi'a into prominent positions, and
 the economic and social status of the Shi'a has improved
 markedly. Nevertheless, the Government maintains a close
 watch against Iranian attempts to exploit dissatisfaction
 among Iraqi Shi'a, who share the same branch of Islam
 prevalent in Iran.
 Over 500,000 Christians constitute nearly four percent of the
 population. Their freedom of worship in churches of
 established denominations is legally protected, but they are
 not permitted to proselytize or to hold meetings outside
 church premises. Convents and monasteries exist and some new
 churches are constructed, in some cases with government
 financial support. Although Christians sometimes allege
 discrimination in education and jobs, adherence to their
 religion has not prevented many from obtaining wealth and
 professional advancement. The Deputy Prime Minister and
 Foreign Minister, a Chaldean Christian, represented Iraq at
 the meeting in late 1984 of foreign ministers of the
 Organization of the Islamic Conference. Other Christians hold
 important official and private positions.
 
 
 1252
 IRAQ
 The Jewish community is believed to have decreased from
 150,000 following World War II to about 400. It was severely
 persecuted in the past, but there is no evidence of recent
 persecution. In 1985, a Western journalist visited the last
 known synagogue in Baghdad and confirmed that it is still
 functioning.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Iraqis are generally free to travel within the country and to
 change their residences or workplaces. However, they are
 likely to be constrained by social, cultural, and religious
 traditions which define the areas occupied by the various
 ethnic and religious groups. Sensitive border and other
 security areas are off-limits. Civilian travel in the war
 zone is restricted. Curfews are in effect where Kurdish
 insurgents have been active. There are police checkpoints on
 highways and outside major towns, but most Iraqis and
 foreigners travel freely in nonrestricted areas. Foreign
 diplomats must obtain Foreign Ministry permits for travel
 outside of Baghdad, which are usually granted when requested
 sufficiently in advance.
 All Iraqis and most foreigners who have remained in the
 country for more than two weeks must obtain exit permission.
 Because of the war's drain on the economy, permission to
 travel abroad is restricted to a few categories of Iraqis,
 including officials, government-approved students, and persons
 needing medical treatments. The Iraqi Government seeks to
 limit the countries an Iraqi traveler may visit and, should
 the traveler visit a nonauthorized country, a small fine may
 be levied upon his return. Iraqis who have residences abroad
 may depart the country provided they originally had left
 before the war began. In general, a married woman must have
 the permission of her husband to travel abroad. The
 Government can require a prospective traveler to post a
 substantial bond to assure return. According to officials of
 the Higher Education Ministry, although Iraqi students abroad
 should get permission before accepting foreign scholarships or
 grants, they would not be punished upon return to Iraq for
 failure to have done so. If students on government
 scholarships abroad do not return, their families must repay
 the costs of the education.
 There is no specific bao on emigration nor special
 restrictions for members of minority groups; however,
 emigration is discouraged. Prospective emigrants have had
 travel permission delayed and have been harassed. Many
 emigrants leave behind substantial property because of the
 difficulty of exporting assets. Currency exchange violations
 are considered national security offenses, and penalties can
 be severe.
 Alien spouses of Iraqi citizens who have resided in Iraq for
 at least three years are required to become naturalized or
 leave Iraq. Many people, including several Americans, have
 thus been obliged to accept Iraqi citizenship and are
 therefore subject to the present travel restrictions. In
 March 1984 an RCC resolution reduced the residency period
 before naturalization to one year for the spouses of Iraqis
 employed at government offices.  The Iraqi spouse faces
 penalties for noncompliance, including loss of job, a fine of
 approximately $10,000, and repayment of the costs of education.
 
 
 1253
 I RAQ
 In recent years, the Government has instituted special
 programs to encourage the repatriation of qualified
 professionals. Aliens of Iraqi origin can apply for a
 document permitting them to enter and exit Iraq without a
 visa. Former Iraqis can more easily obtain visitors' visas
 than other aliens, who generally must have an official sponsor.
 Other persons of Iraqi origin are permitted to return,
 including many individuals who were admitted to other
 countries as refugees. A number of such people, especially
 Assyrian Christians, have returned on temporary visits. They
 are free to come and go, within the limits of the present
 travel restrictions, since they are not considered to have
 violated Iraqi laws. However, those who emigrated only after
 the beginning of the Iran-Iraq war, including several U.S.
 permanent resident aliens, have been unable to depart Iraq
 after returning.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of
 Citizens to Change Their Government
 The elitist Ba'ath Party, dominated by the President and the
 Party's Regional Command, rules Iraq. The Party reportedly
 has some 1.5 million adherents, representing about 10 percent
 of the population. However, only some 50,000 "active" or full
 members, less than 0.33 percent of the population, participate
 influentially in party activities. There are two other legal
 political parties, both Kurdish. They and the Ba'ath Party
 constitute the Patriotic and Progressive National Front,
 essentially a vehicle of support for the Government. The two
 non-Ba'ath parties carry on only limited activity. Members of
 the military or security services may engage in political
 activities only within the Ba'ath Party. Association with the
 party is not required for appointment to senior government
 positions or military ranks or election to the National
 Assembly, but normally is necessary to attain political
 influence. Opposition groups, including various Kurdish
 groups and splinter parties, are severely repressed. The
 Communist Party was removed from the National Front and
 declared illegal in 1979. In 1982 the Government amnestied
 Iraqi Communists both in Iraq and abroad, but the number
 released is unknown.
 The outlawed, Iranian-supported Da'wa (Islamic Call) Party has
 been a major target of persecution. It has claimed violent
 acts against the Government in Iraq and abroad, and was
 implicated in the December 1983 truck bombing of the U.S.
 Embassy and other U.S., French, and Kuwaiti targets in Kuwait.
 In 1984, general elections were held for the 250-seat National
 Assembly, first elected in 1980. The Government screened all
 the candidates for consonance with Ba'ath party ideology.
 Though in theory possessing a wide range of official duties,
 the Assembly exercises little real authority.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 Iraq denies charges that it violates human rights. The
 Government acknowledges Amnesty International accusations and
 in a letter to Amnesty International in July 1985 confirmed
 approximately two-thirds of the executions Amnesty
 International said took place in February and March 1985. The
 
 
 1254
 IRAQ
 Iraqi Government contends, however, that these have not been
 political executions but executions carried out for crimes
 against national security. In the past it has offered to
 investigate allegations of torture if the victims, interviewed
 outside Iraq, returned. None is known to have done so.
 There is no government office or official charged with
 investigating human rights and coordinating with other
 governments and international organizations on human rights.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) delegation
 based in Iraq has made regular visits to Iranian prisoners of
 war (POWs) since 1980 and has assisted in Iraq's unilateral
 repatriation of some of them. Iraq has received the ICRC
 president and other delegates several times to discuss the
 treatment of POWs and the protection of civilians in the
 Iran-Iraq war. Although the ICRC has noted that material
 conditions in POW camps in Iraq have improved and that
 authorities have taken steps to end the random acts of
 brutality to which the ICRC had previously called their
 attention, reports still circulate of sporadic outbursts of
 violence against POWs in the camps. In its last published
 report in October 1985, covering the year 1984, the ICRC
 expressed concern that its representatives have been denied
 access to some prisoners. This situation continues. After an
 ICRC delegation visited Iraq in December of 1984, the ICRC
 gained access to prisoners who had been held since the
 previous spring offensive. The Iraqis apparently on occasion
 retard ICRC efforts to registef new POWs as a means of
 pressuring Iran to permit access to and registration of Iraqi
 POWs.
 Since February 1984 Iraq has cooperated with the ICRC in
 efforts to resettle Iranian civilian refugees in third
 countries. Approximately 60 such refugees had left for
 several host countries, including the United States, by
 November 1985.
 In its 1985 report, Amnesty International continued to express
 concern about widespread arbitrary arrest of suspected
 opponents of the Government and their prolonged detention
 without charge or trial; disappearances; continued detention
 of civilians without legal proceedings in POW camps,
 apparently because of their ethnic origin; routine torture of
 detainees during interrogation and ill-treatment and detention
 of their families allegedly to exert pressure to cooperate
 during interrogation; and a large number of executions, mostly
 for political crimes. Freedom House calls Iraq "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Iraq's population is estimated at just over 15 million, and
 its growth rate at about 3.2 percent. Per capita gross
 national product (GNP) almost quintupled during the 1970's,
 rising from $630 in 1970 to $3,021 in 1980. Much of this
 increase, however, represented a pro rata share of accumulated
 foreign exchange reserves resulting from higher oil prices.
 When oil earnings were cut sharply after the outbreak of war,
 per capita GNP declined dramatically to $1,742 in 1981. Per
 capita GNP probably has increased in nominal terms since then,
 largely as a result of price inflation and an artificially
 high exchange rate.
 The Government exerts a high level of control over the
 economy. The State owns all major industries, including
 
 
 1255
 IRAQ
 petroleum and banking. However, the small private sector is
 important in some industries. The regime has been expanding
 the role of the private sector in the last couple of years,
 particularly in agriculture.
 During the first two years of the war, the Government largely
 isolated the people from the war's economic impact by pursuing
 an ambitious development program. However, the loss of Iraq's
 offshore export terminals and closure of its oil pipeline
 through Syria cut oil exports from a prewar high of 3.2
 million barrels to around 650,000 barrels per day. By late
 1982 Iraq's foreign exchange reserves were nearly exhausted,
 The Government instituted a strict austerity program and
 slashed civilian imports, putting Iraq on a sounder financial
 footing but reducing the availability of consumer goods and
 the varieties of food.
 Petroleum accounts for 95 percent of Iraq's export revenues,
 and the Government has given high priority to the restoration
 of oil export capacity. An expansion of the Turkish pipeline
 completed in 1984 increased oil exports to approximately 1
 million barrels per day. The October 1985 opening of the spur
 line to the Saudi east-west pipeline offered a potential
 further increase of 500,000 barrels per day but output so far
 has been somewhat less. Work is continuing on a new, second
 pipeline through Turkey which will offer an additional 1
 million barrels per day export capacity.
 The feudal system of land ownership came to an end with the
 overthrow of the monarchy. In April 1981, President Hussein
 abandoned a program to impose collective farms on the East
 European model and returned land to private ownership.
 Heavy migration from rural areas has resulted in substandard
 urban living conditions. Large-scale public housing projects
 are under construction. Subsidies and controls keep the
 prices affordable for most food staples, utilities, and
 transportation while other prices are rising.
 Health care is free or provided at nominal cost. From 1968 to
 1980 government programs boosted the number of medical workers
 from 9,000 to over 40,000, and increased medical training
 institutions from 3 to 65. In 1980, there was 1 doctor for
 every 3,000 people. Serious shortages of qualified medical
 workers remain; recent government decrees have offered
 increased benefits to men and women entering nursing.
 Moreover, a 1985 law decreed that all female secondary school
 and college graduates who seek government employment must
 first work as a nurse for one year.
 Education is free through the university level. The
 Government offers scholarships for advanced study abroad. The
 number of students studying abroad has decreased during the
 war. In the last 10 years, enrollment in primary and
 secondary schools has more than doubled, with female
 enrollment largely responsible for the rise. The number of
 students in vocational schools and universities has increased
 markedly. According to the Government, implementation of the
 1977 Anti-Illiteracy Law has raised the literacy rate to 70
 percent. As of 1985, over 1,700,000 Iraqis had graduated from
 literary centers.
 Children are frequently encouraged to work as necessary to
 support the family, an acceptable social practice in the
 
 
 1256
 IRAQ
 Middle East. The employment of children is-forbidden in
 state-run enterprises or other than small-scale family
 enterprises. The urban work week is 6 days a week, 6 to 7
 hours a day for government workers; on Friday all but private
 vendors are closed. Wages are set by the Government for
 public sector workers (i.e., the bulk of the employed) and do
 not adhere to any fixed per hour or per day rate; salaries are
 generally deemed low but adequate, Wages in the small private
 sector are set solely by supply and demand. Occupational
 safety programs are in effect in state-run enterprises and
 inspectors make irregular visits to private establishments;
 enforcement varies widely.
 The Ba'ath Party has been committed to the equality of the
 sexes, and a series of laws since it came to power in 1968 has
 steadily improved the status of women. Such laws have
 protected women from exploitation in the workplace; granted
 subsidized maternity leave; permitted women to join the
 regular army, Popular Army, and police forces; and equalized
 women's rights on divorce, land ownership, taxation, suffrage,
 and election to the National Assembly. In the 1970s, the
 Government imposed legal penalties on families that opposed
 sending their women to literacy schools, and on men who were
 seen harassing women.
 The percentage of female students among students in elementary
 schools climbed from 37.4 percent in 1977-78 to 46.4 percent
 in 1982-3. Secondary school female enrollment went from 29.2
 to 34.5 percent in the same period. About 32 percent of the
 students at universities and technical institutes are female.
 Women represent about 47 percent of agricultural workers and
 about 25 percent of the total work force. By 1977, women were
 reported to comprise 39 percent of teachers, 31 percent of
 doctors, 30 percent of chemists, 25 percent of physicists, 15
 percent of accountants, 15 percent of civil servants, and 11
 percent of factory workers. The war has accelerated the
 Government's drive to elevate the status of women, and some
 Iraqis believe that it has permanently broken cultural
 barriers to the acceptance of women in traditional male
 roles. Women have become increasingly visible as architects,
 construction engineers, oil engineers, air traffic
 controllers, factory and farm managers, and Air Force pilots.
 Some 40,000 women reportedly were volunteers in the Popular
 Army in 1982.
 The General Federation of Iraqi Women (GFIW) was established
 in 1969, the regime's first year in power, to promote the
 Government's policies towards women. Membership in the GFIW
 does not require affiliation with the Ba'ath Party. The GFIW
 organizes conferences on women's issues, establishes training
 courses for women, implements programs to eradicate
 illiteracy, undertakes civilian war relief activities, and
 administers nurseries. It drew up a four-year plan (1983-86)
 to encourage women to work outside the home and has opened
 four employment offices in Baghdad for women graduates.
