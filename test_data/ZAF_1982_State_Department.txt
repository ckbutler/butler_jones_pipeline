 SOUTH AFRICA
 South Africa is a multiracial country with a parliamentary demo-
 cratic system in which, as a result of the apartheid system,
 the 16.2 percent of the population which is white presently holds
 a monopoly of power. The South African system is a mixture of
 Western-style human rights practices and limits on these prac-
 tices. National elections are free and fair, but only whites
 may presently participate. The press is free, but circumscribed
 by government pressure. Free labor unions exist, but while
 black unions are growing in strength; government pressure on
 them, including arrests of union leaders, has increased. The
 judiciary is based on the British model, but security legisla-
 tion encroaches broadly on judicial power.
 Political change of the apartheid system was the focus of reform
 proposals, public debate, and counter-proposals in South Africa
 in 1982. At the same time internal and regional violence in-
 creased as a result of the conflict between the South African
 Government-and groups such as the African National Congress,
 some of which have resorted to violent means to bring about an
 end to apartheid. The process of evolutionary change toward an
 undefined future political system was thus accompanied by both
 violent efforts to bring about revolutionary change and govern-
 ment efforts to eliminate opposition and keep control of the
 pace, direction, and substance of the process.
 Increasing opposition to apartheid, the reaction to violence,
 and the process of change itself significantly affected South
 Africa',s human rights situation in 1982. Chief among the
 effects was the-continued erosion of the rule 'of law and its
 replacement by administrative fiat, diminishing the ability of
 citizens to:appeal to courts for protection., The public now
 has no effective judicial remedy against the de-nationalization
 of Africans, forced resettlement, and indefinite detention with-
 out charge, among other administrative actions. While many of
 these actions are defended by the Government as necessary and
 correct measures to counter violent opposition to apartheid,
 they often affect those who have eschewed violence and are
 seeking to bring about peaceful, evolutionary change away from
 apartheid.
 Following a consolidation of.the position of advocates of change
 within the rulingNational Party, the South African Government
 in 1982 took some steps toward broadening participation in the
 country's political process. It also enacted a new Internal
 Security Act which contains some peripheral improvements over
 previous legislation .governing such practices as detention with-
 out trial and banning (internal exile). The Government also
 moved administratively but not legislatively tceameliorate the
 treatment of security prisoners in the wake of widespread inter-
 national criticism of deaths in detention. The year also saw
 the.moderation of some restrictions imposed on leading individ-
 ual opponents of apartheid.,
 The Government's new proposals for constitutional reform include
 a limited national franchise for South Africans of colored
 .(mixed race) and Asian descent. Not yet.agreed to by these com-
 munities or implemented by legislation, these reforms have
 sparked wide debate. These proposals were designed to address
 a major inconsistency in apartheid doctrine as originally con-
 ceived: while black South Africans had been given political
 
 
 280
 rights only in the context of separate "national states" created
 for them, the blacks losing in the process their South African
 citizenship, South Africa's colored and Asian populations were
 not considered nations and, while regarded as South African
 citizens, had no logical place in the political system. The
 government-sponsored reforms, if implemented, will recognize the
 rightful place of these two groups in the present Republic of
 South Africa and extend to them, on an ethnic basis, a form of
 limited national political representation. The proposed reforms
 do not allow for participation by black South Africans in the
 South African central Government.
 While increasingly recognizing the need for economic integra-
 tion, the South African Government continues to look for a
 political alternative to a unitary, non-racial South Africa.
 While the Government's proposed reforms have been criticized by
 opponents of apartheid as "cosmetic," the ruling white National
 Party split in February 1982 over the very issue of power sharing
 with coloreds and Asians. Despite the National Party split, a
 severe right-wing backlash in the Afrikaner community, and poten-
 tial splits within the colored and Asian communities, the Govern-
 ment has indicated its determination to move ahead with its re-
 form proposals.
 As the debate continues on whether or not the process of change;
 under way in South Africa represents the beginning:of meaningful
 reform of apartheid or only its rationalization and moderniza-
 tion, apartheid remains the governing reality of life in South
 Africa. Apartheid, by whatever name, institutionalizes political
 and economic control by the white minority. The 83.8 percent of
 South Africa's population which is not white suffers pervasive
 discrimination which severely limits political, economic, and
 social life.  (This report refers to the four major South African
 population groups as African, colored (the South African legal
 term for people of mixed race), Asian (Indian), and white. The
 term black is used in the broad sense, embracing all those of
 color in South Africa--Africans, coloreds, and Asians.)
 The Constitution of South Africa, as amended since the National
 Party came to power in 1948, currently denies all persons who
 are not classified as white the right to vote in parliamentary
 elections or to be members of Parliament. Government proposals
 for constitutional reform currently being discussed would extend
 the franchise on a racially exclusive basis to coloreds and
 Asians. Derived from the Westminster model; the South African
 Constitution contains no Bill of Rights and provides for parlia-
 mentary supremacy. Government policy holds that, because of
 South Africa's ethnic and cultural diversity, the present eco-
 nomic and educational disparities among its constituent groups,
 an orderly society can best be achieved through separation of
 the races. A web ogdiscriminatory laws and practices has thus
 been implemented throughout South African society. Important
 examples include: (A) the Constitution itself; (B) legislation
 which limits the citizenship of South Africa's 21 million black
 citizens to generally resource-poor "homelands" comprising 13 per-
 cent of the country's land area; (C) influx control or "pass"
 laws which prescribe the conditions under which black workers and
 their families may remain outside the homelands;  (D) separate
 and unequal educational systems for the various race groups;
 (E) the Group Areas Act, which mandates separate residential
 
 
 281
 areas for whites, coloreds, and Asians; (F) the Immorality and
 Mixed Marriage Acts, which make sexual relations or marriage
 between whites and persons of other races illegal; and (G) the
 Separate Amenities Act, which authorizes the use of public
 facilities by persons of a particular race group without re-
 quiring equivalent facilities for other race groups.
 South Africa has through the years also enacted legislation
 that, in the name of security, curtails the civil liberties of
 those persons (of all races) whose statements, actions, or
 associations~are viewed as seriously challenging the established
 order. After a careful review of existing security laws, the
 South African Government enacted a new Internal Security Act
 during 1982 which repeals, while retaining and consolidating
 under the new Act, virtually all previous legislation affecting
 state security. While critics acknowledge peripheral improve-
 ments, they also assert that the Act preserves many of the
 objectionable elements, including detention without charge or
 trial and the authority to ban individuals, organizations, publi-
 cations, and gatherings.
 Flowing out of the defense of and opposition to apartheid in
 South Africa, a vicious cycle of violence is developing in
 southern Africa involving African National Congress attacks into
 South Africa and South African attacks against the African
 National Congress in neighboring states. A December 9, 1982,
 South African Defense Force raid aimed at elements of the African
 National Congress in Maseru, Lesotho, left 42 persons dead,
 including South African refugees, women, children, and Lesotho
 citizens. There are also reports that the South African Govern-
 ment supports dissident movements in neighboring states as a
 means of diminishing local government support for the African
 National Congress. The conflict between the Southwest Africa
 Peoples' Organization and South Africa over Namibia, resulting
 in Southwest Africa Peoples' Organization attacks into Namibia
 from Angola, parallels the situation along the borders of South
 Africa itself. This growing cycle of cross-border violence is a
 challenge to both human rights and political stability in the
 entire southern African region.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 In 1982 two security detainees died while in police custody.
 Neil Aggett, a white physician and labor activist detained in
 November 1981, was found hanged in his Johannesburg cell on
 February'5, 1982. In the government inquest into the circum-
 stances surrounding his death, lawyers for the Aggett family
 contended that he was driven to suicide by abusive interrogation
 techniques employed by the police. The magistrate presiding
 over the lengthy inquest ruled on December 21, 1982, that there
 was no proof beyond a reasonable doubt that any police officer
 or other person had committed unlawful or negligent acts that
 caused Dr. Aggett's death. On August 9 police found Moabi Dipale
 hanged in his cell after three days detention.
 A white South African police officer in Durban was convicted in
 1982 of kidnapping, but acquitted of murder, in the deaths of three
 African murder suspects whose bodies were found under a bridge in
 Natal Province in November'1981. The officer in question stated
 
 
 282
 in court that he had already held the three men the maximum of
 48 hours for questioning. Needing to travel to Swaziland on
 business and fearing their release, the officer admitted that he
 made the 14-hour round trip with the three men locked in the
 trunk of his car. He claimed that he then returned the three
 men alive and well to a police station near Durban. The officer
 received a 5-year sentence on the kidnapping charge. His
 alleged accomplice fled to Britain where he is being held pend-
 ing trial.
 The African National Congress was apparently responsible for a
 string of sabotage acts during 1982 directed mainly at key insta-
 lations (power stations, pipelines, railways, fuel depots),
 courts, and offices involved in the administration of apartheid,
 and police stations both in "white" South Africa and in the
 "independent" homelands. The African National Congress publicly
 asserts a policy of avoiding civilin deaths, although innocent
 civilians have been killed and a number injured as a result of
 African National Congress attacks. Several alleged African
 National Congress members have also died in confrontations with
 the police.
 Three separate groups of African National Congress insurgents
 faced the death penalty in 1982, although none were executed.
 N. J. Lubisi, N. Manana, and P. T. Mashigo were sentenced to
 death in November 1980 for their participation in an armed attack
 on Soekmekaar Police Station in which no one was killed. The
 insurgents lost their appeal, but were granted clemency by the
 State President on June 3, 1982, after representations by the
 international community. In a similar case of three African
 National Congress members being sentenced to death for direct
 involvement in police station attacks and sabotage incidents in
 which no one died, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court
 has dismissed the appeal of A. B. Tsotsobe, J. Shabangu, and
 D. Moise, and the three have applied for clemency to the State
 President. T. S. Mogoerane, J. S. Mosololi, and M. T. Motaung,
 who were sentenced to death on August 6, 1982, for their admit-
 ted attacks, inter alia, on three police stations where four
 constables were killed, have applied directly to the State
 President for clemency rather than appeal their convictions.
 b. Disappearance
 South African laws do not require notification of a detainee's
 family, lawyer, or any other person when the individual is
 detained or released. In fact, the Second Police Amendment Act
 of 1980 prohibits unauthorized publication of the name of any
 person detained "for the prevention or combatting of terroristic
 activities." Police spokesmen usually do not volunteer informa-
 tion on detainees, although they will often respond to written
 inquiries about their status.
 c. Torture
 Torture is officially not condoned. However, provisions of
 South African security legislation allow police considerable
 latitude in arresting suspects and questioning detainees. Defen-
 dants and witnesses in a number of political trials have testi-
 fied in court that they were assaulted or abused by police during
 interrogation. During 1982 several detainees were admitted to
 hospitals complaining of mental illness or disorientation. The
 Detainees Parents Support Committee in 1982 compiled statements
 
 
 from 70 former detainees detailing a range of physical and
 mental abuse at the hands of security police.
 'Pollowing the death in detention of Steve*Biko in 1977, the
 Government began a practice of appointing two retired justices,
 designated by the Minister of Justice, to visit security
 detainees and send. confidential reports-of their findings to
 the Minister. Several released detainees have charged that
 their complaints to inspectors were ignored or that they never
 csaw an-inspector. The new Internal Security Act provides for
 forknightlyvisits by a mag~istrate and district surgeon, as
 wellas visits 'as-often as possible" by inspectors--all
 employees of the State. Critics of the:-final outcome of the
 long and thorough Aggett inquest have pointed to the case as
 an indication of a lack of determination to hold the police
 responsible for abusive treatment of detainees.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 According to figures compiled by the South African Institute
 of Race Relations in July 1982, 202 people were currently
 being detained under security legislation; 112 of these were
 detained in 1982.
 The new Internal Security Act abolishes minimum sentences for
 security-related offenses, restoring the courts' discretion
 in sentencing.
 Reversing long-standing government policy, Minister of Justice
 Kobie Coetzee announced in Parliament in May 1982 that security
 prisoners could under certain circumstAnces qualify for parole or
 remission of sentence. Subsequently, a number of security
 prisoners were released prior to the end of their sentences,
 though most had only a short time left to serve. Afrikaner poet
 Breyten Breytenbach was granted an early release in December 1982
 after having served seven years of a nine year'sentence on sub-
 version charges.
 The Internal Security Act, Sections 18-23, authorizes the
 Minister of Law and Order, as under previous legislation, to
 issue banning orders. Any person the Minister believes
 endangers law and order, threatens State security, or promotes
 the aims of communism or an unlawful organization can be (1)
 made to resign as officer or member of any organization; (2)
 restricted to or excluded from certain areas; (3) prohibited
 from communicating with anyone or attending gatherings; (4)
 ordered to report regularly to police stations; (5) prohibited
 from being quoted or published. No court of law can challenge
 the Minister's power in this regard, although the new Internal
 Security Act established new procedures for an administrative
 review of banning orders. Banned persons or other interested
 parties may make written representations to the Minister of
 Law and Order Within 14 days of the issuance of a banning
 order. A Board of Review consisting of three members appoint-
 ed by the State President is created. The chairman must be
 an acting or former judge, and a second member must hold a law
 degree. This board conducts a review of banning orders when
 requested to do so either by the banned person or by the
 Minister of Law and Order. After hearing both oral and writ-
 ten arguments, the board makes recommendations to the Minister
 of Law and Order, who may, at his-discretion, lift or relax
 the banning order. According to the South African Institute
 of Race Relations, some 1400 South Africans have been banned
 
 
 284
 since 1950, and approximately 370 of these have left the
 country. As of July 1982, 96 people were still banned.
 Minister of Law and Order'Louis Le Grange announced November
 24, 1982, the issuance of an administrative directive to all
 police officers regarding procedures for treatment of detainees
 held under Section 29 of the Internal Security Act. The Minis-
 ter indicated that failure to comply with this new 37-point
 code would result in disciplinary action and possibly criminal
 action against those officers responsible. Beyond an elabora-
 tion of the provisions of Section 29 with regard to detainees'
 access to a board of review, access to medical attention, and.
 periodic visitation from magistrates, district surgeons, and
 inspectors of detainees, the new regulations make the follow-
 ing pqints:
 Upon making an arrest under Section 29, the police
 must notify the appropriate government authorities
 and "the nearest available relative of the detainee",
 unless that is against the wishes of the detainee
 himself or will jeopardize the police investigation.
 A detainee shall at all times be treated in a humane
 manner with proper regard to the rules of decency and
 shall not in any way be assaulted or otherwise ill-
 treated or subjected to any form of torture or inhuman
 degrading treatment.
 -- Sufficient sleep, exercise, food, and water must be
 made available to the detainee.
 -- Two members of the force should normally be present
 during the interrogations including a woman police
 officer if the detainee is female.
 In addition to the above, the guidelines enumerate in detail
 the circumstances under which an internal investigation of
 mistreatment must be launched. Certain records on each de-
 tainee must be kept, including reports on visit$ to the
 detainee, measures taken to prevent self-inflicted injury,
 and the detainee's complaints.
 While most observers have conceded that the new guidelines con-
 tain certain improvements, some have also stated that they do
 not go far enough. Most criticism was centered around the
 fact that the guidelines are not themselves law, but rather
 administrative regulations, with significant room for police
 discretion in implementation and interpretation.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There are four key clauses in the new Internal Security Act
 which authorize detention without charge or trial. The Minis-
 ter of Law and Order may order the unlimited detention of any
 person deemed likely to commit offenses of terrorism, subver-
 sion, sabotage, or other actions endangering the State or
 maintenance of law and order. No access is permitted to the
 detainee without the Minister's permission, except for legal
 counsel appealing the detention. Any commissioned police
 officer above the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel is permitted to
 detain for interrogation any individual on suspicion of commit-
 ting or intending to commit, or withholding information about,
 
 
 acts of terrorism or subversion. There is no maximum period of
 detention and no one besides the police may have access to
 the detainee, except for a magistrate, a district surgeon, and
 an inspector of detainees, all of whom are required to visit
 regularly. The Act provides for the Attorney-General to
 issue an arrest warrant for any person likely to give evidence
 for the State in connection with certain crimes, to prevent
 intimidation or their absconding. This detention is limited
 to six months if no court proceedings have yet begun. Finally,
 the Act. introduces new powers of detention and permits any
 police officer above the rank of Warrant Officer to detain for
 48 hours without a warrant any individual who is believed to
 be contributing to a state of unrest or who could contribute
 to the resumption of unrest. If the officer obtains a warrant
 within 48 hours, the detainee may be held for a maximum of 14
 days, unless charges are laid. No court may. challenge arrests
 under.those provisions of the law, though certain administra-
 tive reviews are required.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 While the principle of habeas corpus is affirmed in South
 African common law, it is nullified in practice by various
 -security,.law provisions as noted above; If-a person cannot
 pay:'for.his or her defense, the publicly financed Legal Aid
 Board or. various private organizations have funds for legal
 assistance, but these funds are limited and these sources do
 not accept all cases, nor do they meet more than a fraction of
 the total need. As a rule, only in cases involving capital
 offenses may the court appoint counsel without charge. Once
 legal assistance is obtained and paid for, a defendant has
 access to counsel throughout the proceedings. While convicted
 prisoners are generally allowed access to their attorneys,
 the timing and frequency of such visits are at the discretion
 of local:prison authorities.
 Because security detainees may be interrogated without access
 to counsel, they may admit to actions or charges the implica-
 tions of which they may not fully-understand. Such state-
 mentsare usually, admissible in courtv-Sometimes an indivi-
 dual may not be-aware that legal assistance has been retained
 by family or friends. Inaddition;,many-trials are held *in
 camera* and some trials are held in distant parts of the
 country, making it difficult or tpossible-for family and others
 to attend. If the court deems it-necessary, witnesses may give
 testimony without being publicly identified. Security as well
 as criminal trials are-held-before regular courts, which are
 generally regarded as independent of executive or military
 control.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The Black (Urban Areas) Consolidation Act allows police to
 enter homes witkout- a warrant if any black is suspected of
 illegally residing or working there. The Criminal Procedures
 Act of 1977 authorizes a judge or magistrate to issue a search
 warrant if there are reasonable grounds to believe that Othe
 internal security of the Republic or the maintenance of law
 and order is likely to be endangered by or in consequence of a
 .meeting" :being held in a given place. Under the Act a police
 
 
 286
 
 officer may enter, search, and question anyone in a place without
 a warrant if the officer has reason to believe that a warrant for
 such purposes would be issued but that the delay caused by first
 obtaining the warrant would defeat the purpose of the search.
 African home ownership outside the homelands is extremely limited
 by laws and restrictions. Most homes are rented from the Govern-
 ment which owns and subsidizes them; some better-off blacks con-
 struct their own houses in urban areas, but they cannot own the
 land. In some areas, however, blacks may now obtain 99-year
 leases on land for home construction.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The press, particularly the opposition press in South Africa, con-
 tinues to be a vigorous critic of the government. Despite the
 progressive erosion of press freedom over the last decade, the
 press nonetheless remains a vital channel of communication within
 South African society and with the outside world. The number and
 scope of laws which restrict the press have increased in recent
 years. The introduction of several pieces of legislation in 1982
 have further reduced the freedom of the press: the Nulcear Energy
 Act, Laws on Cooperation and Development Amendment Act, and the
 Registration of Newspapers Amendment Act. Most significant, how-
 ever, was the passage of the Protection of Information Act which
 replaces the Official Secrets Act and broadens the definition of
 information which may not be publicly disclosed. In addition to
 restrictive legislation, the Government has occasionally taken
 direct action to suppress press activities, including banning
 newspapers and journalists.
 Direct government censorship of all other publications, films,
 and public entertainment (though not yet television or radio) is
 authorized by the Publications Act of 1974, which does not apply
 to newspapers. The government-appointed publications committees
 established by the Act may prohibit the distribution or posses-
 sion of publications, films, or other public entertainment that
 in its view are considered obscene or blasphemous, that bring
 any section of the public into ridicule, that harm relations
 between sections of the public, or that are prejudicial to the
 safety of the State. Decisions of the Publications Committee may
 be appealed to the government-appointed Publications Appeal Board
 but not to the courts.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The new Internal Security Act seriously obstructs freedom of
 assembly, as it gives magistrates the power to prohibit gatherings
 under certain conditions, impose conditions on the holding of
 meetings, and close off areas to the public to prevent prohibi-
 ted gatherings. In response to the widespread unrest in 1976,
 the Minister of Justice banned all outdoor gatherings except
 sports or specially authorized meetings. Though originally in-
 voked for a one-year period, the ban has been renewed each
 succeeding year and is still in effect.
 Freedom of association is regulated by the complex of laws pre-
 scribing separate schools, residential areas, and public facili-
 ties for different racial groups, as well as by prohibitions on
 interracial sex or marriage. The Political Interference Act of
 1968 makes it unlawful for a person of one racial group to join
 
 
 287
 a political partywhich has members from another racial group;
 to participate in an election campaign for a person of another
 racial group; or to address a group all or most of whom belong
 to another racial group, in order to promote a political party.
 Thus, each racial group must pursue its political aspirations
 in distinct structures..
 In recent years the government has expanded the scope of admini-
 strative exemptions from apartheid laws, allowing some restau-
 rants, drive-in theaters, private hospitals, libraries, and
 other public amenities to admit persons of all races upon
 application. Certain legal barriers to interracial sport have
 been removed.
 In the trade union sphere, the government has continued to imple-
 ment recommendations of the 1979 report of the government-created
 Wiehahn Commission on labor reform. The numbers of recognition
 agreements and negotiated wage settlements have also increased.
 Worker resistance led the Government to withdraw a controversial
 pension bill. Studies on the totally unregulated millions of
 employees who work in the agricultural and domestic sectors were
 begun. Proposed legislation was also published which would im-
 prove the so far ineffective industrial court. However, pending
 legislation on such key issues as union registration, which is
 still subject to de facto racial criteria, and promised reforms
 which-would remove the last remaining white-exclusive job reser-
 vation in the mining industry, have been delayed.
 Other structural problems remain. Workers of all races are
 prohibited by-law from picketing. Virtually every one of the
 black-called strikes this year has been illegal, which suggests
 a serious defect in the legal dispute resolution machinery.
 The government, however, has seemed to recognize this structural
 de.fect by failing to prosecute leaders in the vast majority of
 strike incidents.,
 The wave of arrests of generally black trade unionists in late
 1981 left most of them still in detention through the early
 months of 1982. All but a handful were eventually released
 without charges, although some of them were subsequently banned.
 A new piece of legislation enacted in 1982 was used at least
 twice against union officials. This law, called the Intimidation
 Act, is a broadly worded document which permits authorities to
 charge persons alleged to be intimidating others. Contacts
 with international labor groupings and other national labor
 centers, including US labor organizations, is tolerated. There
 has been some selectivity in the granting of visas to trade
 unionists wishing to visit South Africa, and the selective appli-
 cationof the Fund Raising Act against one major black union
 federation continues. The ILO, particularly through the forum
 of its apartheid committee, has been highly critical of South
 Africa's detentions without charge and bannings of black trade
 union officials.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is generally respected, and religious organi-
 zations are-allowed to hold meetings and other activities without
 interference so long as they do not seriously challenge govern-
 ment policies-or otherwise venture into the political realm.
 Conscientious objector status on religious or any other grounds
 
 
 288
 is generally denied except in certain cases involving members
 of "Peace Churches," e.g., the Jehovah's Witnesses.
 Government ministers often criticize the South African Council
 of Churches and its General Secretary, Anglican Bishop Desmond
 Tutu. Bishop Tutu's travel abroad has been limited since his
 passport was revoked in 1981. The South African Government did,
 however, grant Bishop Tutu a special two-week travel document in
 lieu of a passport in September 1982 to attend an Episcopal Con-
 vention in the United States. The Government also created a com-
 mission to investigate alleged financial irregularities at the
 South African Council of Churches, leading some to believe that
 the Government plans direct action against the organization.
 Some clergymen who have actively opposed government policy remain
 banned, including Afrikaner apartheid critic C. F. Beyers Naude,
 who was served with a new three-year banning order in October
 1982, the scope of which was somewhat relaxed in December 1982
 under the new Board of Review procedures. The five-year banning
 order of Dr. David Russell, an Anglican priest, was allowed to
 lapse in 1982.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Except that they must obtain permits to visit some black areas,
 white South Africans, other than banned persons, ;are free to move
 about the country. Whites must also possess valid travel docu-
 ments in order to travel abroad and emigrate legally. There are
 legal restrictions on Asians who wish to reside or visit the
 Orange Free State (one of South:Africa's four provinces) or
 certain parts of Natal Province without special permission.
 Africans' residences and travel are ourrently regulated by a
 system ofi"influx control" or pass laws which severely restrict
 the number of Africans entitled to stay in a given urban area
 for more than 72 hours at a time. Periodically, the police will
 conduct raids or sweeps, during which all passes are checked and
 people illegally resident are arrested and/or transported to
 their assigned homeland. Nevertheless, the prospect of arrest
 and removal has not deterred many Africans from seeking the
 greater economic opportunities available in urban areas.
 The threat of removal is not limited to undocumented Africans in
 urban areas. It is estimated that over two million blacks have
 been resettled from one area to another since 1960 as a result
 of the Government's efforts to implement its ethnic blueprint
 for South Africa. This is in addition to several hundred thou-
 sand people who were relocated under the Group Areas Act. In
 addition to consolidating the homelands territories, the Govern-
 ment also has a policy of resettling in the homelands residents
 of so-called "black spots" in white rural areas. In many cases,
 the resettlement has been under direct duress, by means of
 forcibly transporting individuals and their belongings to the
 areas in which they are to be resettled; in others, the pressure
 has been less direct.
 In 1981 Prime Minister P. W. Botha publicly declared that a
 citizen's access to a South African passport was a privilege,
 not a right. In dismissing Bishop Tutu's application to have
 his passport restored, the Pretoria Supreme Court ruled in 1982
 that the Minister of Internal Affairs has an "unchallenged right
 to revoke" a passport "without ascribing any reasons for his
 action." Though exceptions are made when its interests are
 
 
 289
 served, the Government normally requires that an individual
 assigned to an "independent" homeland must travel abroad on the
 homeland travel document. No country beyond South Africa, how-
 ever, recognizes the "independent" homelands as sovereign
 nations, placing the legal validity of those documents in
 question. Many Africans have refused invitations to travel
 abroad to avoid acknowledging a non-South African citizenship by
 accepting a homeland passport. Through its restrictive passport
 and visa policies, the Government has blocked the travel to and
 from South Africa of participants in US Government-funded pro-
 grams, including scholarship recipients, speakers, and inter-
 national visitor grantees. Over the past year this situation has
 improved somewhat. The Department of Internal Affairs, however,
 continues to exclude from South Africa and Namibia large cate-
 gories of individuals, particularly clergy, whose views or
 associations With black South Africans the Ministry finds objec-
 tionable. Although emigration from South Africa is unrestricted
 for those with valid travel documents, it is in fact discouraged
 somewhat-by currency regulations.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Until government reform proposals affecting coloreds and Asians
 are enacted, political participation at the national level will
 remain limited to whites through a democratic parliamentary,
 multi-party system. National political rights for black
 Africans, 72 percent of the population, continue to be denied.
 While the ruling National Party has a substantial parliamentary
 majority, three small opposition parties, which operate as
 freely as the ruling party, are represented in Parliament.
 Historically, the political structures assigned to coloreds,
 Indians, and blacks have been considerably limited in scope.
 Bodies such as the Colored Persons Representative Council and
 the South African Indian Council have been set up to provide a
 measure of legislative and budgetary authority over these
 groups, but they have been rendered ineffective by election
 boycotts and opposed from within as unacceptable apartheid
 structures. In 1980 the Government created the first multi-
 racial consultative body at the national level by appointing
 whites, coloreds, and Asians to serve on the President's
 Council, which was created by constitutional amendment to advise
 the executive on matters of state, particularly the political
 dispensation of blacks. The members appointed included 45
 whites, 10 coloreds, and 5 Asians. The fact that Africans were
 excluded seriously eroded support for the President's Council
 and led to the resignation of some of its members.
 Convened for the first time in 1981, the President's Council
 met throughout the year and unveiled its recommendations for
 the reorganization of all three levels of government in May
 1982. After studying the President's Council report, the
 South African Government put forward in July its own proposals
 for constitutional reform, based partially on the President's
 Council's advice and partly on the National Party's own 1977
 constitutional proposals. The proposals call for a tricameral
 parliament divided racially for whites, coloreds, and Asians
 whosemembership would be elected on racially based separate
 voter rolls. Each chamber of parliament would have primary
 responsibility for legislation affecting its own racial con-
 stituency; a multiracial (white, colored, Asian) President's
 
 
 290
 Council, appointed by the Executive President, would decide
 which issues are of general concern and must be treated by all
 chambers of Parliament. The Cabinet would be appointed by the
 Executive President from the Parliament but in a racial ratio
 which ensures a white majority in the Cabinet. The Executive
 President would be selected by an electoral college which con-
 tains a substantive majority of whites, but also some coloreds
 Asians. The Executive President would replace the Prime
 Minister in the current system, and would have the power to
 dissolve Parliament and call elections.
 Thus far the South African Government continues to assert that
 except on a local level, African political aspirations must be
 realized in the homelands. Since 1970 all Africans have been
 considered "citizens" of one of ten designated homelands or
 "national states," created by the Government and destined for
 eventual "independence." Each African from birth is assigned to
 an ethnic group and thereby to a homeland, regardless of whether
 the individual was born, or has lived in, or has ever visited
 that homeland. When a homeland becomes "independent," all
 blacks assigned to it lose their South African citizenship
 and retain only "citizenship" in the homeland.
 Slow movement toward a confederal arrangement, which would be
 more or less divided along racial lines, is being promoted by
 the Government. Under this framework whites, coloreds, and
 Asians could exercise some political rights in common, while
 blacks would exercise national political rights through their
 respective "independent homelands," and perhaps autonomous
 black urban municipalities. These could be linked in a loose
 confederation to the present central Government.
 In 1982 the Government sought to abolish the kaNgwane ethnic
 homeland and cede that territory and part of the kwaZulu homeland
 to the Government of Swaziland. This action would have had the
 effect of denying South African citizenship to approximately
 596,958 ethnic Swazis living elsewhere in South Africa plus the
 159,882 persons resident in kaNgwane and 96,048 persons resident
 in the Ingwavuma district of kwaZulu. Following rejection of
 this proposal by the South African Appeals Court, the Government
 formed a commission of inquiry to study the proposal.
 Racial classification and definition is an arbitrary process per-
 formed by various elements of the Government or by self-declara-
 tion. While blacks are racially classified into one of ten
 ethnic groups based largely on language, whites are not similarly
 classified since a person is considered white regardless of
 whether the person speaks English, Afrikaans, Portuguese or
 Polish.
 All "citizens" of the homelands are entitled to participate in
 the homeland political process. However, except in Bophuthat-
 swana, at least half of the legislatures' memberships are
 appointed. A number of homeland opposition leaders have been
 restricted or imprisoned, and white civil servants seconded
 from the South African Government still wield considerable
 decision-making power. To a great extent, "independent" home-
 lands have adopted security legislation modeled on South Africa's,
 and Transkei, Venda, and Ciskei have used these laws against
 political opponents of the Government. The Constitution of
 Bophuthatswana, however, contains a Bill of Rights patterned
 on the European Convention on Human Rights. The strength of
 this bill of rights was demonstrated when South Africa's
 
 
 291
 highest.court of appeal overturned Mr. Wilfred Marwane's con-
 viction under the Terrorism Act, which was found contradictory
 to a number of rights guaranteed in the Bophuthatswana consti-
 tution.
 Although all Africans are technically-homeland citizens, approxi-
 mately .ten million live. in so-called white areas, the majority of
 these :persons reside in urban-areas, usually in nearby townships.
 Urban Africans may participate in elections for Community Council
 members, who~exercise'some control over township affairs. How-
 -ever1 these-elections have..been heavily boycotted, and only about
 6-percent of el-igible voters turned out for the 1978 Soweto Com-
 munity ,Counail.elections, although participation in subsequent in
 .other African townships ranged from 15 to 30 percent or more during
 4980 th limited responsibilities of certain Community Councils
 were-expanded to .include the authority to levy rent increases, al-
 locate.housing, and .oversee the administration of projects such as
 township electrification. Nevertheless, the role of these Coun-
 cils remains circumsrribed by their continuing financial and admin-
 strative dependene- n, th-Department of Cooperation and Develop-
 ment and~the-Administration Boards which oversee them. The Black
 -Local;Authorties Act, passed during the 1982 parliamentary ses-
 :sion,.-raised the rights and responsibilities of these black muni-
 cipal-authorities to the status of white municipal governments,
 ,but-they.remain:dependent for financing and personnel on the
 Administration Boards.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 Governmental Investigations of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 South Africa extends little or no cooperation to various United
 Nations bodies or private organizations, .like Amnesty Inter-
 national, which investigate South Africa's human rights record.
 The Government's objections to reports on the state of human
 rights in South Africa center on its contention that it .is being
 unfairly singled out for criticism, and that similar standards
 are. not applied to other countries, particularly in black
 Africa.
 In its 1982 report, covering events of 1981, Amnesty Interna-
 tional expressed continuing concern for the banishment, banning,
 or imprisonment of prisoners of conscience, detention without
 trial, and allegations of torture and harsh prison conditions.
 Freedom House, an American civil liberties organization, desig-
 nated South Africa as "Not Free" in its 1982 report. On a de-
 scending scale of 1 to 7, .South Africa ranked 5 and 6 on
 political rights and civil liberties, respectively.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross is permitted access to
 convicted security prisoners, including those on Robben Island, and
 visits them on an annual basis. The Committee does not, however,
 visit security prisoners sentenced to death because the South African
 Government has refused to permit the Committee to speak to them in
 private. The International Committee of the Red Cross is not per-
 mitted access to security detainees, except for those held under
 Section 28 of the Internal Security Act which provides for preven-
 tive detention. Security Detainees awaiting trial or those held
 Security detainees awaiting trial or those held under either
 Section 29 (indefinite detention for interrogation) of the Act or
 Section 31 (detention of witnesses) are not available to the Commit-
 tee or-any other-outside body.,-Bophuthatswana authorities did allow
 Committee representatives to visit their one convicted security
 
 
 292
 prisoner (Marwane). Progress is also being made with Venda
 authorities to acquire regular access to security detainees and
 convicted prisoners. Transkei has failed to reply to The Commit-
 tee's offer of services, and Ciskei has not yet been approached.
 Foreign journalists have on occasion been allowed to visit South
 African prisons. Helen Suzman, the parliamentary opposition
 spokesman for human rights, has been permitted to visit Robben
 Island and has had discussions with many of the prisoners. The
 Prisons Act, however, has tightly limited journalists' investi-
 gations into prison conditions. Over the years, legal and human
 rights groups have frequently attended important trials, although.
 some foreign observers have experienced difficulty obtaining
 South African visas for this purpose.
 A number of South African organizations observe, report, and
 contest human rights violations in the country. Black political
 organizations have been particularly vocal in calling for a
 society based on internationally accepted principles of human
 rights. A number of other organizations have also been active.
 In June 1980, a "lawyers for human rights" association was formed
 to monitor and suggest changes in the human rights situation in
 South Africa. The Black Sash Organization reports extensively
 on the abuses of the influx control system based on its experi-
 ence in assisting Africans who have fallen afoul of the pass laws.
 Thb South African Council of Churches has spoken out on a wide
 range of human rights issues and is active in assisting persons
 incarcerated under security laws and other groups deprived of
 their human rights. The South African Institute for Race Rela-
 tions is also very active in this sphere, numbering among its
 activities the compilation of lists and statistical material on
 security detainees and banned persons.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 The dualistic South African economy extends from a highly sophis-
 ticated modern sector to a large subsistence rural sector.
 Virtually the entire white and Asian populations, and a signi-
 ficant proportion of the colored population, receive their income
 from the modern economy. Most of the economically active African
 population of approximately 7 million also participate in this
 "First World" economy, though generally at lower rates of remu-
 neration and skill/authority levels. Roughly half of the African
 population, however, resides in the various homelands, which for
 the most part are resource-poor and lacking in job opportunities.
 Although there has been considerable economic development in some
 homeland areas, subsistence agriculture supplemented by remit-
 tances from relatives working in "white" South Africa is the
 prevalent source of livelihood. Since many if not most of the
 economically active males in the homelands seek employment in the
 modern sector of "white" South Africa, a disproportionate number
 of dependents (women, children, and the elderly) actually reside
 in the homelands. Though agricultural progress is being achieved
 in some rural black areas, the homelands as a whole do not pro-
 duce enough food to feed their resident populations. Over-
 population and inefficient farming practices continue to result
 in declining agricultural conditions.
 Building on earlier decentralization schemes designed to induce
 more rapid economic development in the periphery, the South
 African Government launched a regional development program in
 early 1982 to speed economic activity away from the several major
 
 
 293
 urban industrial complexes. To assist in this effort to
 stimulate economic activity and thereby curb rural (African)
 migration to the major urban areas, the Government's plan
 includes provision of financial incentives and technical assis-
 tance for qualifying new projects and expansion of existing
 ones.
 Overall economic growth in South Africa will help expand the
 modern economy and draw more blacks into its ambit. The South
 African Government has estimated, for example, that an annual
 real growth of 5-6 percent is necessary for the economy to
 absorb the approximately 250,000 Africans entering the labor
 market each year. Economic growth will also, as it has in the
 recent past, help to narrow existing income, employment, educa-
 tion, and other gaps between whites and blacks. For example,
 between 1970 and 1980, a period of impressive economic growth
 in South Africa, the average annual earnings of black wage-
 earners quadrupled, rising more than five percent a year in real
 terms. This compares with a slightly negative trend in real
 earnings for white workers over the same period. According to
 a respected American study, during this same decade the ratio
 of white wages to black wages in manufacturing dropped from 6:1
 to 4.3:1. In mining the ratio dropped from 19.8:1 to 6.6:1.
 World Bank data indicate a relatively high per capita gross
 national product of $2286 in 1980, a figure that has since grown.
 Income distribution has traditionally been skewed along racial
 lines, though this phenomenon is diminishing to some degree. A
 respected university study indicates that the black share of
 personal income has been rising in recent years, from 23 percent
 of the total in 1970 to 29 percent in 1980. While the real in-
 crease in personal income was 10 percent from 1975 to 1980 for
 the country as a:whole, it was 3 percent for whites, 26 percent
 for Asians, 17 percent for coloreds, and 23 percent for Africans,
 according to the same study.
 According to the World Bank, the South African population was
 29,626,000 in 1981. The most recent census of the country's
 population, taken in 1980, records average annual population
 growth rates by racial groups from 1970 to 1980 as: whites,
 1.7,percent; coloreds, 2.2 percent; Asians, 2.4 percent; and
 Africans, 2.7 percent. Official statistics concerning infant
 mortality rates per 1,000 live births in 1978 were: whites,
 14.9; coloreds, 80.6; and Asians, 25.3. Records for Africans
 are incomplete, but estimates of 'infant mortality among this
 sector of the population range to more than 200 per 1000 live
 births, especially in rural homelands such as Ciskei. The
 higher rate of infant mortality among Africans is ascribed
 largely to poor sanitary conditions and low standards of
 nutrition.
 World Bank data indicate that as of 1960, 57 percent of the
 adult population of South Africa was literate. Because school
 attendance has traditionally been compulsory for whites,
 coloreds, and Asians, the vast majority of South Africa's illit-
 erate population is black. In 1981 black pupil enrollment was
 just over five millilon .in regular primary through high school
 grades. Only slightly more than one percent of enrollment
 was in the last grade of high school, illustrative of a high
 dropout rate. A private study indicated that of African
 school leavers, some 54 percent departed prior to achieving
 literacy.
 
 
 294
 Both in 1981 and 1982 the Government reiterated its commitment
 to racially-segregated education in responding to recommendations
 for the establishment of a single system. However, within the
 present system, the Government has been devoting significantly
 increased funds to educating blacks. Annual expenditures on black
 education have increased from $83 million per year to $400 million
 since 1974. Over the past five years, such spending has grown
 at an annual rate of 21 percent. There remains, however, a huge
 disparity between spending on blacks as opposed to whites. For
 example, in fiscal year 1980/81, the Government spent $202 per
 African pupil and $1174 per white pupil. Nevertheless, the trend
 is toward a narrower gap in expenditure and educational opportu-
 nities for all race groups. Starting in 1981 free compulsory
 education began to be gradually introduced for Africans, and
 African enrollment at "white" universities (in subjects not
 offered in the segregated African universities) has been growing
 slowly but substantially.
 South Africa suffers from a housing shortage that is apparently
 still getting worse. The African population is the hardest hit.
 Early in 1982 a South African Government department announced that
 almost 120,000 housing units would have to be built annually in
 "white" South Africa to overcome the shortage within ten years.
 For Africans alone, the department said some 52,000 units would
 be needed every year. The situation in the homelands is worse.
 African unemployment is not measured directly. South African
 Government figures show a decline in unemployment among the
 economically active population throughout 1981, though this does
 not reflect conditions of unemployment and underemployment in
 the rural areas. The unemployment rate was recorded at 7.1 per-
 cent (402,000 people) in November that year. As the economy has
 continued to experience a downturn in 1982, unemployment has
 risen generally. This phenomenon has been more serious among
 the African population. Private estimates of African unemploy-
 ment range up to two million.
 Discrimination against women in South Africa is manifested in
 cultural attitudes, legal restrictions, and economic differentia-
 tion. The latest South African figures show that in business
 13 percent of managerial posts are held by women. Approximately
 25 percent of white South African women work, but they earn 35
 percent less than men in the same positions. Moreover, South
 African tax laws do not permit separate taxation of a working
 couple's income; women's earnings are added to those of their
 husbands for tax purposes. Additionally married women are
 regarded as virtual minors before the law, unless they make
 special contractual arrangements with their husbands to retain
 certain financial and legal powers which are normally given to
 the husband at marriage. The Parliament is considering legisla-
 tion which would change this situation. Black women encounter
 far greater difficulties than their white counterparts. Millions
 of black working women are still totally neglected and unprotec-
 ted by legislation. Domestic workers are unprotected by minimum
 wage laws and do not qualify for sick leave or maternity bene-
 fits. Black women are regarded as perpetual minors before the
 law, which severely limits their ability to own property and to
 rent accommodations in urban areas where they find employment.
