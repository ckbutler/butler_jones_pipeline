 BURMA
 The Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma is a one-party,
 authoritarian state whose leaders come from a narrow elite
 within the military. The ruling Burma Socialist Program Party
 (BSPP) dominates and parallels the Government; the 1974
 Constitution gives the BSPP the responsibility "to lead the
 state." The party is subordinate to its chairman, U Ne Win,
 who was commander of the army when the current regime came
 into power in a 1962 coup. The Government is headed by a
 29-member Council of State whose chairman, U San Yu, is ex
 officio President of Burma. A unicameral National Assembly
 includes 489 members elected for 4-year terms and is the
 titular source of all power in the state. Though nonparty
 members are permitted to run for the Assembly and local
 .peoples' council," candidates must be approved by the BSPP.
 A 1975 antisubversion law codified the wide discretionary
 powers of government security agencies. There are several
 government organizations charged with state security; in
 addition, each local people's council has its own security
 committee with block and neighborhood wardens.
 Since the early 1960s, the Government has been trying to build
 a centrally planned economic system under an ideological
 program known as the "Burmese Way to Socialism." Initially
 the Government pursued a rigid policy of economic
 self-sufficiency. After encountering serious economic
 difficulties in the early 1970's, it has over the past decade
 tempered its doctrinaire socialism with some pragmatic
 economic measures, including greater tolerance of the private
 sector and acceptance of foreign grant and loan capital.
 Although the State retains ultimate rights to all land and
 natural resources, the right to own property, alone or in
 association with others, is recognized by the Constitution and
 respected in practice.
 An important contributing factor affecting the human rights
 situation continues to be the widespread insurgencies against
 the Government. Dozens of different insurgent groups, based
 primarily among Burma's ethnic minorities, have been fighting
 the Government for decades. Some of these groups are fighting
 for autonomy or independence and against what they perceive to
 be domination by ethnic Burmans, who constitute at least
 two-thirds of the population. The Burma Communist Party (BCP)
 has also been fighting for over 30 years to overthrow the
 Government. The BCP and many of the insurgent groups traffic
 in narcotics to finance their operations. Some of the groups
 are in effect narcotics syndicates with private armies.
 There continued to be a number of serious human rights
 problems in Burma in 1985. Quadrennial elections of local and
 national-level party and government officials were held
 throughout the country, but authoritarian control over the
 political and economic system was essentially unchanged. The
 abuses committed by all sides in the insurgencies continued.
 Persons of non-Burmese ancestry continued to face elements of
 institutionalized discrimination.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Although summary executions are not allowed under the Burmese
 judicial system, there have been credible reports that
 government forces have executed captured prisoners or killed
 suspected insurgent supporters during military operations.
 There are also frequent credible reports of noncombatant
 deaths resulting from the fighting with the insurgents. Some
 insurgent groups have carried out summary executions of
 prisoners, opponents, and suspected informers. Attacks by
 insurgent groups against civilian targets increased. This
 included shelling towns, mining trains, kidnapping, and
 assassination.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no specific reports over the past year of people
 being abducted, secretly arrested, or held in clandestine
 detention by security forces. There is usually no attempt to
 conceal common criminal or political/security arrests from
 family members, although details about the charges may not be
 revealed. Some insurgent groups have resorted to abduction as
 a political weapon or to coerce local inhabitants into
 cooperation.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Although the Constitution provides that punishment shall not
 be in violation of human dignity, and the Government denies
 that torture or inhuman treatment is practiced, reliable
 reports over the years suggest that the police and other
 security forces use torture and psychological coercion during
 investigations in both common criminal and political/security
 cases. In addition, there are also reports of serious
 mistreatment of some political/security prisoners in regular
 prison facilities. Prison conditions are poor as a
 consequence of the generally low standard of living,
 overcrowding, low government expenditures, and limited staff.
 In June there were reports that Burmese army troops summarily
 executed several groups of captured smugglers in contested
 areas of the Karen state.
 Insurgent groups sometimes employ death threats, beatings, and
 other forms of physical and mental coercion against opponents
 or villagers who refuse to cooperate with them.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There is no provision in Burmese law for a person in detention
 to seek a judicial determination of the legality of his
 detention. In oases involving national security, persons are
 sometimes never formally charged but held in indefinite
 detention without trial. The Government neither acknowledges
 holding political prisoners nor considers itself compelled to
 justify the detention or imprisonment of anyone. The number
 of political detainees is thought to have decreased since
 1980, when there was a general amnesty. Some estimates place
 the current number in the hundreds.
 
 
 719
 BURMA
 In common criminal cases, police may detain suspects up to 24
 hours, after which a court order must be sought from competent
 judicial authorities. These court orders, which are
 renewable, authorize extensions of the detention of 14-day
 periods until charges are formally brought before a court.
 Detainees are frequently held incommunicado during the period
 of investigation and interrogation but are normally allowed
 visitors thereafter. Refugees and other stateless persons are
 regarded as illegal immigrants subject to arrest. If they
 cannot be repatriated after serving sentences for illegal
 entry, they may be detained indefinitely. The Government is
 thought to have under detention several hundred illegal
 immigrants from a number of Asian countries. It is reportedly
 willing to release those remaining if they are accepted for
 permanent resettlement elsewhere.
 There is no statutory prohibition of forced labor in Burma's
 Legal Code. Civilian males in the vicinity of military
 operations (primarily ethnic minority populated areas) are
 frequently conscripted for porter duty by the Burma Army.
 Some of these porters are killed by mines planted by
 insurgents or by being caught up in military engagements.
 Insurgent groups also press-gang villagers as recruits or as
 porters.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Justice is administered by "Judges' Committees." These
 committees are elected from a single slate of candidates
 chosen by the party. Almost all judges are BSPP members, and
 a large number are military officers, either active or
 retired. Although untrained in the law, they are normally
 advised by professional legal officers. The legal code is
 residually based upon the British colonial system of law with
 an overlay from the present Constitution and other legal
 measures imposed by the present Government. The judiciary is
 not independent of the Government, which can influence both
 verdict and sentence, particularly in political/security cases.
 The Constitution provides for public trials in most cases, and
 this practice is followed in common criminal cases. In
 political/security cases, special judiciary committees may be
 named by the Council of State. The public is normally not
 allowed to attend such trials.
 When both common criminal and political/security cases come to
 trial, the burden of proof is on the prosecution, and the
 accused has the right to counsel. Legal counsel is provided
 for indigent defendants if they are faced with a possible
 sentence of 7 years or more. Normally, defendants can consult
 freely and privately with their lawyers, and defendants and
 their lawyers are made aware of the charges and evidence and
 are permitted to submit their own evidence. The verdicts of
 civil, security, and military courts may be appealed to the
 next higher court up to the Council of State.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In common criminal cases, police officials are required to
 have a valid search warrant or to be accompanied by a member
 of the local People's Council at the time of search.
 
 
 720
 BURMA
 Search warrants are issued by local or state Judges'
 Committees. In political/security cases, security forces are
 not subject to judicial procedures and usually enter homes
 without warrants. In areas of insurgency, forced entry and
 warrantless searches are carried out by government security
 forces and rebel groups alike. It is widely believed that
 security personnel monitor private correspondence and
 telephone calls. A well-developed system of neighborhood
 informers reports on dissent and criticism of the Government.
 The State does not interfere with private religious
 practices. All foreign publications are subject to government
 scrutiny and approval prior to distribution.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There are significant restrictions on freedom of speech and
 press in Burma. The Constitution guarantees freedom of
 speech, expression, and publication but stipulates that the
 exercise of such freedoms should not be "contrary to the
 interest of the working people and socialism." In practice,
 opposition viewpoints and public criticism of the Government
 are not tolerated. Party members can express some views about
 economic problems or bureaucratic failures, but outspoken
 members can be disciplined or expelled. Anyone criticizing
 the Government's leadership in public or private is subject to
 arrest although muted private criticism is usually ignored.
 Most mass media in Burma are government owned and operated,
 including television, radio, and the six national newspapers.
 Newspaper editors are appointed by the Ministry of
 Information. Editorials must be approved in advance.
 Journalists are subject to strict guidelines as to what can be
 broadcast or published, especially on domestic matters.
 Although subject to prior review, international news reporting
 is generally objective and balanced.
 Criticism of government officials is not permitted, although
 cartoons and opinion editorials will sometimes criticize local
 administration indirectly. All forms of communications--
 domestic and imported books and periodicals, stage plays,
 motion pictures, and musical recordings--are subject to
 government control and censorship.
 The Government monitors academic inquiry in the social
 sciences. The difficulty of obtaining scholarly publications
 from abroad and of communicating with foreign scholars impedes
 academic research although there have been modest improvements
 in recent years.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution guarantees the right of assembly and
 association, but only for those organizations permitted-by
 law. In practice, most legitimate organizations are limited
 to the BSPP. BSPP "mass organizations" for workers, peasants,
 and youth have been established at every administrative
 level. These organizations serve primarily as vehicles for
 communicating national policies and implementing government
 programs. Opposition political groups are banned, and their
 members are subject to arrest. Public meetings must be
 sanctioned by the Government.
 
 
 721
 BURMA
 There is no independent labor movement in Burma. Workers do
 not have the right to organize independently, to bargain
 gollectively, or to strike. The labor force is organized into
 party-controlled workers' and peasants' mass organizations.
 Most of the leaders of these organizations are party
 officials, and the national leadership is made up of ranking
 party and government officials. For example, the workers'
 organization national chairman is also the Minister for Social
 Welfare and Labor, and the peasants' organization chairman is
 also the Minister for Agriculture and Forests; both are
 members of the party's central committee.
 Labor disputes are mediated by arbitration boards composed of
 worker, management, and government representatives. In
 practice the party and the Government decide disputes. In the
 public sector where workers, management, and government
 representatives are all generally party officials, the process
 has little meaning. However, in the private sector this
 process can provide workers with a real voice. Burma is a
 member of the International Labor Organization (ILO). Labor
 organizations and other professional associations are
 generally not permitted to maintain independent relations with
 international private bodies.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Burma is a secular state. Freedom of religion is guaranteed
 in the Constitution and widely observed in practice. The
 great majority of Burmese are Buddhist, although there are
 sizable Christian, Muslim, and animist minorities among
 minority ethnic groups. Minority religious groups are allowed
 to practice freely. Religious groups can and do maintain
 links with coreligionists in other countries, such as with the
 Vatican in the case of Catholics. Religious travel such as
 the Hajj is permitted and in some cases subsidized by the
 Government. Foreign religious representatives are usually
 allowed only tourist visas and are not permitted to preach or
 proselytize, although a few foreign missionaries who are
 longtime residents of Burma have been permitted to remain and
 serve their congregations. All religious organizations are
 required to register with the Government, and religious
 publications are subject to the same governmental control and
 censorship as other publications.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution guarantees Burmese citizens the right to live
 anywhere in the country. Except for limitations in areas of
 insurgent activity, Burmese citizens can travel freely within
 the country but must inform local authorities of their
 temporary place of residence. Noncitizens must obtain prior
 permission to travel.
 Legal requirements and bureaucratic procedures cause long
 delays in obtaining passports, and the right to emigrate often
 is denied. Emigrants are severely limited in terms of what
 they are allowed to take out of the country with them. Before
 traveling abroad private citizens normally must reimburse the
 Government for their university and professional education and
 pay income tax in advance. Persons who retain their Burmese
 citizenship and who left the country legally are generally
 allowed to return to visit relatives. Emigrants wishing to
 return permanently are required to reapply for Burmese
 
 
 722
 BURMA
 citizenship. In general, those who leave the country
 illegally cannot legally return.
 Burma does not permit foreign refugees or displaced persons to
 resettle or seek safe haven within Burma. The Government
 treats persons claiming to be refugees as illegal immigrants
 to be incarcerated.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Burma has an authoritarian, one-party system in which
 leadership is essentially drawn from a small elite within the
 military officer corps.
 All government institutions and other organizations in Burma
 are subordinate to the guidance of the ruling BSPP. The party
 in turn follows the leadership of Chairman U Ne Win, who has
 personally ruled and guided the formulation and execution of
 national policy for the last two decades.
 Political opposition is not tolerated, and opposition
 political parties are illegal. The BSPP is used to mobilize
 popular support behind decisions of the leadership rather than
 as a vehicle to express individual or group opinions of the
 members. The party chooses a single slate of candidates for
 government offices. Although party nominees run unopposed,
 they must receive 50 percent of the vote to be elected. In a
 few cases, all at the lower government levels, the party
 nominees have not been elected. In party and governmental
 decisionmaking assemblies, votes are almost always unanimous.
 Ethnic Burmans dominate the political system although the
 party seeks to expand-participation by Burmese ethnic
 minorities; women are underrepresented.
 Under the 1982 citizenship law, ethnic Burmese, including
 indigenous minorities, enjoy advantages that are not available
 to immigrants and their immediate descendants. The law
 significantly limits the political rights of immigrants
 (primarily ethnic Chinese and Indian) whose parents and
 grandparents are not-citizens.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Burmese Government does not permit investigations of its
 human rights practices, nor is it willing to discuss human
 rights problems with outside governmental or nongovernmental
 organizations. The Government has permitted visits by U.N.
 organizations such as the ILO and the Office of the United
 Nations Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to discuss a few
 specific issues. No Burmese organization, governmental or
 private, monitors the human rights situation in Burma. Burma
 does not actively participate in international or regional
 human rights bodies. In its 1985 Report, Amnesty
 International expressed its continuing concern about reports
 of human rights violations, including arbitrary arrests and in
 some instances torture, relating to ethnic minorities and the
 Muslim community. It also expressed concern about the
 practice of local civilians being impressed as porters by army
 personnel in areas of active military operations. Freedom
 House rates Burmas as "not free."
 
 
 723
 BURMA
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 According to data supplied by the World Bank, Burma's
 population was 36,919,000 and growing at the rate of 2 percent
 annually. With a per capita gross national product of $180 in
 1983, Burma ranks among the world's poorest nations. However,
 official statistics do not reflect adequately the important
 private/black market economy.
 The country remains largely reliant on agriculture, with more
 than 60 percent of its labor force employed in the
 agricultural sector. Burma is essentially self-sufficient in
 food, and most Burmese maintain a marginally adequate standard
 of living. Partly due to decreased earnings from rice and
 mineral exports, Burma experienced serious economic
 difficulties in 1985, including a sharp decline in foreign
 exchange reserves. The trade deficit currently is over $300
 million a year. Total foreign debt now exceeds $2 billion.
 Government austerity measures have had a dampening effect on
 development; estimates on the current economic growth rate
 range from 4.5 to 6.5 percent. In November the Government
 demonetized some denominations of Burmese currency in an
 apparent attempt to curb black market activity. The action
 initially created hardships for local residents; its impact on
 the economy over the longer term is uncertain. Burma receives
 about $450 million a year in bilateral and multilateral
 assistance; Japan, the largest aid donor, provides $250
 million annually.
 Life expectancy in 1985 was 56 years at birth, and the infant
 mortality rate was estimated at 89 per 1,000 live births.
 Calorie supply as a percentage of minimum established daily
 requirements was estimated at 115 in 1982. The percentage of
 the population with access to safe drinking water was
 estimated to be 21 percent in 1980. In 1978, approximately 40
 percent of the population, both urban and rural, were
 estimated to live below an absolute poverty level.
 Education in Burma is free through the university level, and
 the party and Government have made a major effort to improve
 literacy in recent years. Adult literacy rates in 1980 were
 estimated at 76 percent for males and 56 percent for females.
 The World Bank reports the primary school enrollment ratio as
 of 1981 was 84 percent overall: 87 percent for males and 81
 percent for females.
 Burma is currently in the process of revising and updating its
 labor laws. At present the minimum age for workers is 15.
 There is a 5 day, 40-hour workweek for employees in the public
 sector and a 6-day, 48-hour workweek for private sector
 employees, with overtime pay for additional work above this
 amount. Workers have 21 paid holidays a year, and there are
 numerous legal provisions to protect workers' health and
 safety. The minimum legal wage is about 750 at the official
 rate of exchange. In the private sector the minimum wage law
 applies only to cheroot-rolling plants and rice mills. The
 gap between legal provisions and actual conditions can yary
 widely, with government entities and government corporate
 enterprises coming closest to the legal standard." In 1984 it
 was reported that the Law Commission of the National Assembly
 had before it proposed legislation to bring Burma into
 conformity with ILO Conventions, 17, 62, and 87. In fact, the
 Commission has under consideration legislation concerning only
 Conventions 17 (workers' compensation) and 52 (hours of
 
 
 724
 BURMA
 work). Because the Commission has a large backlog of work, it
 is not known when it might consider this legislation or send
 it on to the Assembly.
 Women in Burma have distinct social roles, which vary with
 their cultural traditions and ethnic backgrounds. In general,
 Burmese women enjoy most of the same rights as men. They keep
 their own names after marriage, are active in trade, and often
 control family finances.
 Burma's numerous ethnic minorities have their own distinct
 cultures and languages, and many of the minority groups have
 historically resisted assimilation. Economic development
 among minorities has lagged, and many still live at the
 subsistence level. This is due in part to the chronic
 insurgencies and geographic factors which impede economic
 development in rugged, isolated ethnic minority populated
 border areas. Minorities are underrepresented in the party
 and Government and are largely excluded from the military
 leadership. Many individuals with nonethnic Burmese ancestry,
 primarily Indians and Chinese, are denied full citizenship
 status and are not permitted to hold party or government
 positions but continue to play an important role in the
 economy.
