 JAPAN
 Japan is a parliamentary democracy in which democratic
 institutions are firmly established. Its industrial
 free-market economy is the second largest in the world in
 terms of gross national product. Japan's culture incorporates
 many elements from the West while retaining strong Eastern
 roots. Buddhist and Shinto traditions continue to have a
 basic and pervasive influence on thought and social
 institutions, but several minor religions also flourish. Less
 than one per cent of the population is Christian. Though the
 Japanese are receptive to foreign ideas, the citizens of this
 densely populated nation have a cultural, ethnic, and racial
 homogeneity which makes them less willing or able to integrate
 alien residents in Japan into their society.
 While the legal system has gradually evolved toward granting
 equality of opportunity to minorities, there has been little
 change in the social prejudice against Koreans, approximately
 670,000 of whom are first, second, and third generation
 permanent residents, in addition to approximately 120,000
 naturalized Japanese nationals of Korean ancestry. An
 estimated 1.2 million descendants of persons historically
 considered to be outcasts (Burakumin) also suffer social but
 not legal proscription.
 The Japanese Constitution states, 'All of the people are equal
 under the law and there shall be no discrimination in
 political, economic or social relations because of race,
 creed, sex, social status, or family origin." The human
 rights guaranteed by the Constitution are secured by a just
 and efficient legal system. Political liberties are
 guaranteed to all nationals, and over 70 percent of the
 electorate usually vote in general elections, which involve
 candidates from seven freely-functioning political parties.
 The right of workers to organize and to bargain and act
 collectively'is guaranteed by the Constitution, with slightly
 under 30 per cent of the active work force belonging to labor
 unions. Most unions are involved in political activity as
 well as labor relations.
 During 1984 several important steps were taken toward making
 the status of women more equal to that of men.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There are no known cases of murder for political motives on
 the part of the Government or any other organization.
 b. Disappearance
 There are no known cases in which people have been abducted,
 secretly arrested, or held in clandestine detention by
 security forces or any other organization.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from torture, cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment
 or punishment is guaranteed by the Constitution and respected
 
 
 785
 JAPAN
 in practice. Criminal sentences do not include physical
 punishment. There is no evidence that penal treatment varies
 by social class, sex, or religion.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaranteed by
 the Constitution and respected in practice. Japanese law
 provides for a writ of habeas corpus. Individuals cannot be
 detained without charge, and prosecuting authorities must be
 prepared to demonstrate before trial that sufficient evidence
 exists to detain the accused. The length of time before a
 suspect is brought to trial depends on the nature of the
 crime, but rarely exceeds two months; the average is one to
 two months. Preventive detention does not exist.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution guarantees the right to a speedy and public
 trial by an impartial tribunal in all criminal cases, and this
 right is respected in practice. The defendant is made aware
 of charges upon arrest and guaranteed a public trial by an
 independent civ-ilian court with defense counsel and the right
 to cross examination. Defense counsels have free and private
 access to defendants and have the right of access to evidence
 that is deemed to be necessary for trial after a formal
 indictment has been made and generally before a trial.
 Defendants also are protected from self-incrimination and the
 application of ex post facto laws. Judges are appointed by
 the Cabinet for permanent terms but face periodic review
 through popular referendum. A defendant who is dissatisfied
 with the decision of a trial court of first instance may,
 within the period prescribed by law, appeal to a high court as
 the reviewing court.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under the Constitution, each search or seizure shall be made
 upon separate warrrant issued by a judicial officer. Japanese
 authorities have been scrupulous in observing the legal
 requirements for warrants. The standards for issuing such
 warrants exist to guard against arbitrary searches. There are
 no reports that the Government or any other organization has
 arbitrarily interfered with privacy, family, home, or
 correspondence.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Japanese Constitution, an independent press and judiciary,
 and a functioning democratic political system combine to
 ensure freedom of speech and press.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These freedoms are guaranteed by the Constitution and
 respected in practice. Japanese law grants unions the right
 to organize, strike, bargain collectively, lobby, and make
 political campaign contributions, and they actively do so.
 Unions are involved also in international bodies and bilateral
 exchanges. Public corporation employees do not have the right
 to strike but do have recourse to mediation and arbitration in
 order to resolve disputes. Members of the armed forces,
 police officers, and fire fighters are not permitted to
 
 
 786
 JAPAN
 organize. In 1984 as in 1983, Japanese public sector unions
 deposited a complaint with the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) alleging that the Government's decision to
 only partially implement wage increases for Government
 employees recommended by the independent national personnel
 authority ran contrary to the Freedom of Association
 Convention. In response the ILO recommended that the Japanese
 Government fully implement the wage recommendations. The
 Government responded that it would try to accommodate the
 recommendation while taking into consideration its financial
 difficulties.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed by the Constitution and
 respected in practice. While Buddhism and Shinto remain the
 two major religions, there are many others, including several
 Christian denominations. Missionaries are welcome and receive
 special visa status. Some temples and shrines, as treasured
 national properties, receive public support for maintenance.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Nationals have the right to travel freely, both within Japan
 and abroad, to change their place of residence, to emigrate,
 and to repatriate voluntarily. Nationality is never revoked.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 As a parliamentary democracy, Japan is ruled by the political
 party or parties able to form a majority in the lower house of
 its bicameral Diet. The Liberal Democratic Party-New Liberal
 Club coalition currently holds a parliamentary majority. Five
 opposition parties are active. All adult nationals have the
 right to vote. Vote is by secret ballot. Political interest
 groups can organize and engage in nonviolent political
 activity regardless of their political hue. Well organized
 labor unions ensure participation by workers in the political
 process.
 According to law, aliens with five years continuous residence
 are eligible for naturalization and the simultaneous
 acquisition of citizenship rights, including the right to
 vote. In fact, however, relatively few eligible aliens have
 been naturalized. Naturalization is a difficult and
 complicated process requiring "proof of assimilation into the
 Japanese culture,* and many Korean residents are unwilling to
 seek naturalization on the grounds that their cultural
 identity would be erased by the requirements. Although the
 law does not require applicants for naturalization to take
 Japanese names, in practice the Ministry of Justice strongly
 encourages them to do so, and only a few who have been
 naturalized have retained their previous names. Korean human
 rights activists have urged Japan to restore unconditionally
 the citizenship which Korean residents of Japan had previously
 but which was revoked after World War II.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Various groups have petitioned the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission (UNHRC) to take up allegations of discrimination
 
 
 787
 JAPAN
 against Koreans in Japan and of allegations of maltreatment of
 mental patients in Japan. The Government responded positively
 to these complaints and the UNHRC decided not to take up these
 matters for further discussion or investigation. Through its
 membership in the UNHRC, the Japanese government is active in
 working for improvement of human rights practices in other
 countries. In 1984 the Foreign Ministry established a Human
 Rights and Refugee Division to give more long-range attention
 to these concerns.
 A large number of private organizations in Japan are
 interested in human rights. They mainly lobby against the
 death penalty, for increased social and economic opportunities
 for minorities, and for human rights in other countries. By
 keeping these cases before the public eye, they have helped
 gradually to change the way many Japanese people and the
 Government view these problems. The 1984 Amnesty
 International Report expressed concern about use of capital
 punishment. Freedom House in its 1984-85 report rated Japan
 as 'free.*
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Good quality food, shelter, health care, and education are
 widely available to inhabitants of Japan regardless of race,
 religion, sex, ethnic background, or political opinion.
 Discrimination by private employers against women continues
 despite its prohibition by the Constitution and by legislative
 measures adopted over the past 30 years to accord women the
 same legal status as men. A 1983 Government White Paper on
 the status of women noted that, as of 1981, 45 per cent of
 companies discriminated against women in hiring and
 promotion. To eliminate such discrimination and to complement
 existing laws stipulating equal pay for equal work, the
 Ministry of Labor drafted legislation for equality in
 employment standards which it hopes will pass the Diet in
 1985. Passage of this legislation would allow Japan to ratify
 the U.N. Convention on the Abolition of Discrimination Against
 Women. Women hold 26 of 763 seats in the Diet. In 1984 the
 National Diet revised the Patrilineal Nationality Act to give
 women equal status with men in conferring nationality on their
 children. Concurrent revision of the Family Register Law
 allows Japanese women married to non-Japanese to assume their
 husbands' surnames, and their children to assume the father's
 surname without petitioning family courts. Gender
 discrimination in naturalization requirements for foreign
 spouses of Japanese citizens was also eliminated.
 The Government has enacted several laws and regulations in
 recent years extending to permanent resident aliens, 82
 percent of whom are Koreans, the benefits of equal access to
 public housing and loans, limited-tenure employment at public
 colleges and universities, and old age pensions for those who
 pay into the system for the requisite 25 years. In 1984, for
 the first time, Korean residents were appointed as faculty
 members in state universities. Rectifying another issue of
 concern to resident Koreans, the Foreign Ministry began to
 pronounce Korean names according to their Korean, rather than
 Japanese, reading. On the other hand, there was growing
 conflict between alien residents, primarily Koreans (although
 some Americans were also involved), and the Government over
 the requirement that foreign residents be fingerprinted every
 five years. Entrenched social prejudice against both Koreans
 
 
 788
 JAPAN
 and members of the Burakumin community (descendants of feudal
 era 'outcasts' who practiced so-called 'unclean' professions
 such as hide tanning) restricts the access of both groups to
 private housing, employment, and marriage opportunities. The
 Government has extended until 1987 a Special Measures Law
 (first issued in 1969) designed to help assimilate Burakumin
 into mainstream society through a number of social, economic,
 and legal programs.
 Japan's population in 1984 was 119,996,000, growing at an
 annual rate of 0.6 percent. The infant mortality rate was 6
 per 1,000 live births in 1984, while life expectancy at birth
 in 1980 was 75.5 years. With a highly competitive education
 system that provides nine years of free, compulsory schooling,
 Japan has a primary school enrollment ratio of 106 percent and
 has long had nearly total adult literacy. The ratio of
 calorie supply available for consumption relative to
 nutritional requirements was 126 percent in 1977. The GNP per
 capita in 1982 was $10,075.
