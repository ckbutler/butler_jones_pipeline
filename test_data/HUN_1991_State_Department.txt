 HUNGARY
 Hungary is completing its second year as a newly democratic
 republic under the amended 1989 Constitution that contains a
 broad range of human rights protections. The country has a
 democratically elected Parliament, a coalition government, and
 an independent judiciary.
 The nation's 32,000-strong police force, of which approximately
 18,000 are uniformed, is controlled by the national police
 headquarters. Although the police are independent of the
 Ministry of the Interior on day-to-day operational matters, the
 Minister of the Interior is still ultimately responsible for
 the police before Parliament. Since 1990 the state security
 services have reported to a Minister without Portfolio,
 and these oversight mechanisms have proven effective. In
 accordance with the 1990 Hungarian-U.S.S.R. agreement, all
 Soviet troops stationed in Hungary were withdrawn in 1991.
 Hungary continued to transform its economy from one based on
 state ownership and management to one based on the domestic and
 international markets. Many new private ventures were started,
 as well as thousands of foreign joint ventures. A major
 milestone was government passage of legislation to compensate
 (at least in part) property owners whose holdings were
 nationalized by former regimes. The legislation reestablished
 the legal basis and mechanism for private ownership and trade
 in land and real property. The transformation has been
 characterized by high inflation and greatly increased
 unemployment. The resulting lower tax revenues and increasing
 costs of social benefits for the unemployed have caused a
 significant rise in the budget deficit. Those whose fixed
 incomes have not kept up with the high rate of inflation have
 felt the greatest burden.
 The Constitution provides for human rights, civil liberties,
 and freedom of the press. Members of all political parties
 perceive some elements of the press as biased against their
 interests. Efforts to enact legislation codifying the status
 of the media have been ensnared in an intense political
 dispute.   The legislation also is to lift the current
 moratorium on granting radio and television licenses. The most
 recent draft would limit non-Hungarian ownership and content in
 the electronic media, restrictions which, according to some,
 could have implications for freedom of the press.
 Major public incidents of anti-Semitism decreased in 1991
 compared to 1990. However, several graves were desecrated at
 the Kozma Jewish Cemetery in Budapest. Of major concern to the
 Jewish community were the speeches of some prominent
 politicians, including members of the coalition parties, who
 allegedly engaged in expressions of anti-Semitism. The Prime
 Minister and other government officials have several times, at
 home and abroad, reiterated a commitment to respect and protect
 the Jewish community. The Government has been relatively
 generous in supporting the growing number of refugees from
 neighboring countries, especially those from Yugoslavia and
 Romania. Many Hungarians, however, continue to discriminate
 against the Gypsy population.

 HUNGARY-
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. *Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There is no evidence that such killings occurred.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 No known instances of torture or other cruel or degrading
 treatment occurred.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.
 In contrast to conditions during the Communist period, persons
 are not subject to arbitrary arrest. Upon arrest, they must be
 informed of the charges against them and may be held for a
 maximum of 72 hours before charges must be filed. It is a
 requirement that persons be allowed access to counsel from the
 moment they are suspects undergoing questioning and throughout
 all subsequent proceedings. The authorities must specifically
 provide counsel when a person is mentally handicapped,
 juvenile, or unable to afford counsel. There is no bail
 system. Depending upon the nature of the crime, the accused
 may be released upon his or her own recognizance. Pretrial
 detention is limited to 1 year while criminal investigations
 are in progress. This period may be extended with the approval
 of a judge. There is no evidence that these procedures were
 violated during 1991 or that any illegal or incommunicado
 detention occurred.
 There is no exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Under the Constitution, the courts are responsible for the
 administration of justice, and the Supreme Court exercises
 policy control over the operations and administration of all
 courts. There are four levels of courts in the current
 system: the Supreme Court, the Budapest Appeals Court, county
 courts, and local courts. There is no jury system; hence,
 judges are the final arbiters. Decisions may-be appealed to
 the Supreme Court, which has supervisory responsibility over
 all other courts and whose decisions are binding.
 The Constitutional Court is charged with reviewing the
 constitutionality of laws and statutes brought before it for
 review. The Court's 10 members are elected by Parliament for
 nonrenewable 9-year terms. (According to the law, the
 Constitutional Court is to be composed of 15 members; 10 have
 been elected to date, and the remaining 5 are scheduled to be
 seated by 1995.) No judge or member of the Supreme Court or
 the Constitutional Court may belong to a political party or
 engage in political activity.
 The right to a fair public trial is provided for by law and
 respected in practice. In some cases, however, judges may
 agree to a closed trial if it is for the protection of the
 
 
 1134
 HUNGARY
 accused, such as in some rape cases. This is also true for
 military trials which follow civil law and may be closed if
 state, service, or morale grounds justify a closed trial.
 Juvenile cases are afforded the protection of a closed trial.
 In all cases, sentencing must take place publicly. Defendants
 are entitled to counsel during all phases of criminal
 proceedings and are presumed innocent until proven guilty.
 Judicial proceedings are generally investigative rather than
 adversarial in nature; there is no trial by jury. Decisions of
 the courts may be appealed. In the case of military trials,
 appeals also may be addressed to the Supreme Court.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Search warrants under current law may be issued independently
 by the prosecutor's office. House searches must be carried out
 in the presence of two witnesses. A written inventory of items
 removed from the premises must be prepared.
 According to the law, only the Minister of Justice has the
 authority to approve wiretapping for national security reasons
 and for legitimate criminal investigations. The State respects
 the individual's freedom of choice in family matters.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech is provided for in the Constitution and is
 respected in practice. A variety of uncensored newspapers,
 magazines, and books express a wide range of opinion, and
 independent news publications continue to proliferate. Foreign
 partners have invested in numerous publications, particularly
 in Budapest where the Hungarian dailies compete fiercely.
 Nearly all radio and television stations are owned by the
 State. Until recently NAP-TV was the sole private television
 station in Hungary, broadcasting on a frequency rented from
 state television. It now operates more like a private
 production company, producing programming for state
 television. The one private radio station of any size, Radio
 Bridge (also a Voice of America affiliate) broadcasts in
 English on an FM frequency, reaching Budapest and its immediate
 environs.
 No legislation was adopted in 1991 implementing the
 constitutional provision of freedom of the media. The
 Government is drafting bills on the print media and the
 broadcast media which will regulate the allocation of
 frequencies and set limits on non-Hungarian ownership anad
 content. The opposition parties and the government coalition
 differ sharply on the question of media legislation. (Any
 media law will require a two-thirds majority for passage;
 hence, coordination and ultimate agreement among the government
 coalition parties and at least part of the opposition will be
 necessary.) At issue is the desirability of press legislation
 in the first place, as well as ultimately the content of such
 legislation, including questions of supervision and control,
 foreign investment, cable television, commercial broadcasting,
 and licensing procedures.
 The case against Szent Korona, the weekly indicted for
 incitement of anti-Semitic feelings, is pending before the
 Constitutional Court (also see Section 5). The case is
 
 
 1135
 HUGARY
 especially difficult in that the Court is being asked to
 balance freedom of speech against protection of minorities.
 Szent Korona has been allowed to continue publishiing pending a
 decision by the Constitutional Court on the broader question of
 what constitutes freedom of the press.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Peaceful public gatherings are essentially unrestricted. In
 general, no permits are required for assembly except in cases
 when.a public gathering is planned near sensitive installations
 such as military facilities, embassies, and key government
 buildings. Police may sometimes alter or revoke permits, but
 there is no evidence that this right is abused. There were no
 reports of interference with the right of peaceful assembly in
 1991.
 Any 10 or more persons may form an association, provided that
 it does not commit criminal offenses or disturb the rights of
 others. Associations with charters and elected officers must
 register with the courts.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Hungary is largely Roman Catholic by tradition; members of
 other faiths practice their religions freely. There is no
 officially preferred religion, and religious affiliation
 carries no benefits or penalties. In July'Parliament passed
 legislation that provides for the return of some former church
 properties, confiscated during Communist rule. If the return
 of property proves impossible, there is a formula for partial
 compensation. Limited state subsidies are available to
 religious organizations that maintain educational facilities.
 Since 1990 conscientious objectors to military service may
 perform alternate civilian service.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement-within or outside
 Hungary, including the rights of emigration and repatriation.
 Emigration may be delayed, but not denied, for those who have
 significant court-assessed debts or who possess state secrets.
 Economic and political conditions in the region resulted in a
 rising flow of refugees into Hungary, most recently from
 Yugoslavia. The Government reported that since 1988 over
 70,000 refugees have been registered. Despite the difficult
 economic situation, Hungary continued to provide basic food and
 housing-assistance. The Government does not force refugees to
 return to countries where they face persecution.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Hungarians over the age of 18 have the right to change their
 government through national and local elections held every 4
 years. The Parliament's 386 members are elected through a
 complex formula of individual and party lists. The Prime
 Minister is the head of the largest party in Parliament, the
 Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF). Currently, Hungary has a
 center-right coalition government, formed by the MDF, the
 Independent Smallholders Party, and the Christian Democratic
 People's Party, which effectively exercises power. Three
 
 
 1136
 HUNGARY
 center-left parties constitute an active opposition in
 Parliament.
 There are no restrictions, in law or in practice, on the
 participation of women in government or politics.
 Nevertheless, it is only in the judiciary that women have a
 significant presence. There are 27 women in Parliament.
 Minorities represented in Parliament include nine Germans, two
 Gypsies, one Croat and one Slovak.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Several human rights organizations operate in Hungary.
 Prominent among these are the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, the
 Wallenberg Association for Minority Rights, and the Hungarian
 Human Rights Foundation. A 25-member parliamentary Committee
 for Human, Minority, and Religious Rights oversees the field of
 human rights.
 Hungary worked actively in the United Nations and the
 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to promote
 human and minority rights. Hungary's particular concern is the
 welfare of Hungarian minorities in neighboring countries,
 especially as the Government estimates that approximately 4
 million Hungarians reside outside Hungary's borders.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Gypsies, who account for roughly 5 percent of Hungary's
 population of 10.5 million, constitute the largest minority
 group (though not officially recognized). Conditions of life
 within the Gypsy community are significantly poorer than among
 the general populace. Gypsies tend to be considerably less
 educated, have lower than average incomes, and have a life
 expectancy that falls several years short of national norms.
 Gypsies also have a higher unemployment and crime rate. The
 Government sponsors programs both to preserve Gypsy languages
 and cultural heritage and to assist social and economic
 assimilation. Nevertheless, widespread popular prejudice
 continues. Gypsy organizations, such as Roma Parliament and
 Phralipe, claim that there is discrimination against Gypsies
 in education, vocational training, employment, access to loans
 and subsidized housing, and career opportunities. The
 Government has criticized attacks on the Gypsy community and
 continues to seek to improve their situation. Gypsies are
 generally regarded as untrustworthy and treated as such. Gypsy
 organizations, while divided among themselves, seek to improve
 the status of their people.
 In 1991 overt incidents of anti-Semitism decreased. However,
 several graves were desecrated in the late spring at the
 Budapest Kozma Jewish Cemetery. The Jewish community is also
 concerned that while the Government does not condone anti-
 Semitic activities, prominent members within the parties of the
 coalition continue to fuel anti-Semitic sentiment. While
 acknowledging the existence of anti-Semitism in Hungary, the
 governing coalition disputes the validity of this charge. The
 Government has often demonstrated its support for the Jewish
 community, most recently when Prime Minister Antall, during his
 speech before the United Nations General Assembly on October 1,
 1991, condemned the U.N. resolution equating Zionism with
 racism. Both the Prime Minister and the President have met
 
 
 1137
 HUNGARY
 with prominent local Jewish and Israeli leaders to reiterate
 their commitment against anti-Semitism. As noted above, in
 1991 Szent Korona, the weekly publication of the National
 Federation of Hungarians, the Christian National Union, and the
 Hungarian National Party--organizations generally characterized
 as rightwing extremist--was indicted for incitement of
 anti-Semitic feelings. The case is pending before the courts.
 Legally, women have the same rights as men, including identical
 inheritance and property rights. There is no overt
 discrimination against women. However, the number of women in
 middle or upper managerial positions is low. Women are heavily
 represented within the judiciary, and the medical and teaching
 professions.
 Women's rights groups are still in their infancy and have had
 no noticeable impact on societal attitudes. While there are
 laws against rape, it often goes unreported because public
 attitudes toward crimes of rape have not kept up with legal
 prohibitions. Police attitudes towards victims of sexual abuse
 reportedly are often unsympathetic. No data are available on
 the frequency of marital sexual abuse, and this is not an
 acknowledged legal concept.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Legislation passed in 1989 recognizes the right to organize,
 establishing the possibility of trade union pluralism.
 Excluding judicial and military personnel and the police,
 workers have the right to associate freely, choose
 representatives, publish journals, openly promote members'
 interests and views, and go on strike. Three so-called unions
 in the armed forces operate more as professional associations
 than as trade unions.
 A number of competing trade union formations have emerged. The
 1989 legislation guaranteed workers the right to call strikes
 to defend their economic and social interests, but strike
 action has been limited and more often directed against
 government policies rather than employers. Twice since June,
 the Confederation of Hungarian Trade Unions (MSzOSz), the
 successor to the former monolithic Communist union, threatened
 to call a 2-hour warning strike over a series of demands.
 Following intense negotiations at the Interest Reconciliation
 Council (IRC), in which representatives from the.trade unions,
 the employers' association, and the Government met to negotiate
 and coordinate policies, the strike was averted. Unions
 participate freely in internationl organizations.
 In practice, the right of association was marred by the
 existence of a so-called checkoff system that workers had to go
 through at the workplace to relinquish membership in MSzOSz in
 order to join newer unions. Other unions--e.g., the League of
 Independent Democratic Unions and the Federation of Workers'
 Councils-denounced this checkoff system as an unfair pressure
 tactic that favored MSzOSz. In July Parliament intervened by
 passing legislation that effectively killed the checkoff system
 by prohibiting employers from deducting trade union or business
 federation dues from an employee's wages except with the
 express consent of the employee.
 
 
 1138
 HUNGARY
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to bargain collectively exists in law, although in
 practice wages have been excluded and are centrally negotiated
 in a tripartite macroeconomic policy body to control the rate
 of inflation. The right to bargain collectively was
 established in a 1969 law, which was amended in 1989 to allow
 collective bargaining at the enterprise and industry level.
 Trade union views are expressed at the IRC. The Ministry of
 Labor is responsible for drafting labor-related legislation,
 while special labor courts enforce labor laws.' The decisions
 of these courts may be appealed to the civil court system.
 Under the new legislation passed in July, employers are
 prohibited from discriminating against unions and their
 organizers. It is too soon to judge the effectiveness of this
 legislation. There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law, which is
 enforced by the Ministry of Labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Labor courts enforce the minimum employment age of 16 years,
 with exceptions for apprentice programs, which may begin at
 15. There does not appear to be any significant abuse of this
 statute.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The legal minimum wage is established by the IRC and
 subsequently implemented by Ministry of Labor decree. The
 current minimum wage is insufficient to provide an adequate
 living for workers and their families. Real incomes continued
 to drop by around 4 percent in 1971, and consumption declined
 by an estimated 12 percent. In order to maintain a decent
 standard of living, many Hungarians supplement their primary
 employment with second jobs.
 The average official workweek varies between 40 and 42 hours,
 depending upon the nature of the industry. The amended Labor
 Code of 1967 sets the workweek at 42 hours, but'this varies
 slightly in some industries. Under existing law, workers
 receive overtime, a minimum of 15 days' paid leave per year,
 free health care, maternity leave, and pensions. Labor courts
 and the Ministry of Labor enforce occupational safety standards
 set by the Government, but specific safety conditions are not
 always up to internationally accepted standards.
