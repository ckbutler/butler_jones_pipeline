 BELIZE
 Belize is a parliamentary democracy with a Constitution enacted in 1981 upon
 independence from the United Kingdom. The Prime Minister, a Cabinet of Min-
 isters, and a Legislative Assembly govern the country. The Governor General rep-
 resents Queen Elizabeth H in the largely ceremonial role of Head of State. Both
 local and national elections are scheduled on a constitutionally prescribed basis.
 The Police Department is responsible for law enforcement and maintenance of
 order. It is responsible to and controlled by civilian authorities, but there were occa-
 sional credible reports of police abuse and mistreatment.
 The economy is primarily agricultural. The Government favors free enterprise and
 generally encourages investment, both foreign and domestic. Preliminary estimates
 put 1994 gross domestic product growth at 1.5 percent in real terms.
 The Constitution  rovides for and citizens enjoy in practice, a wide range of fun-
 damental rights an freedoms. Principal human rights abuses include occasional re-
 ports of police use of excessive force when making arrests, prolonged incarceration
 without trial, discrimination and domestic violence against women, and employer
 mistreatment of immigrant workers in the banana industry.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of such
 killings
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution expressly forbids torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment. Nonetheless, there were occasional credible reports of
 mistreatment and abuse by police. For example, during the Government's well-pub-
 
 
 324
 licized anticrime campaign against urban gangs several of those arrested alleged
 police abuse. The Police Department, the Police Iompints Board, and on occasion,
 special independent commissions appointed by the Prime Minister investigate any
 such allegations. No police or prison officer was charged with or convicted of such
 an offense in 1994.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest or detention, and the authorities respect these provisions in practice. The law
 requires the police to inform a detainee of the cause of detention within 48 hours
 of arrest and to bring the person before a court within 72 hours. In practice, the
 authorities normally inform detainees immediately of the charges against them. Bail
 is gnted in all but the most serious cases. However, many detainees cannot make
 bal' and backlogs in the judicial system often cause considerable delays and post-
 ponements of hearings, resulting in overcrowded prisons and prolonged incarcer-
 ation without trial.
 The Constitution forbids exile, and it does not occur.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Persons accused of civil or criminal offenses have
 constitutional rights to presumption of innocence, protection against self-incrimina-
 tion, defense by counsel, a public trial, and appeal. Trial by jury is mandatory in
 capital cases. Those convicted by either a magistrate's court or the Supreme Court
 may appeal to the Court of Appeal. In some cases, including those resulting in a
 capital sentence the convicted party may make a final appeal to the Privy Council
 in the United kingdom. In December the Privy Council agreed to hear three such
 appeals, thereby suspending the government-imposed death sentences.
 The authorities respect these constitutional guarantees in practice, although ob-
 servers question the judiciarys independence from the executive branch, noting that
 judges and the Chief Prosecutor must negotiate renewal of their employment con-
 tracts with the Government and thus ma be vulnerable to political interference.
 Some observers opined publicly that the Chief Prosecutor's decision in December to
 drop a case against two suspected major drug criminals might have been influenced
 by such considerations. The Supreme Court and magistrate courts suffer backlogs
 aggravated by the inability to maintain a full complement of judges.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 _f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the protection of personal property, privacy of home and
 person, and recognition of human dignity, and the Government generally honors
 these provisions. The law requires plice to obtain judicial warrants .before search-
 ing private property, except when they have a reasonable suspicion that a crime is
 being committed and d not have time to obtain a warrant, The police observe
 requirement in practice. Customs officers do not need a warrant to search private
 property.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution and local custom protect free-
 dom of speech and the press. In practice, all viewpoints are publicly presented with-
 out government interference. Six privately owned weekly newspapers, several of
 them fiercely partisan, engage in lively debate. The opposition press is a frequent
 critic of government officials and policies. All newspapers are subject to the con-
 straints of libel laws. In 1994 the Prime Minister won a libel suit against the opposi-
 tion newspaper and was awarded $12,500 in damages.
 Belize's fir'st privately owned commercial radio station began broadcasts in 1990.
 Since then, broadcast media have become considerably more open. The popular
 radio call-in programs are lively and feature open criticism of and comment on gov-
 ernmient and moii    a maters. Continuing indirect government influence over the
 autonomous Broadcasting Coo    ration of Belize, a former government monopoly
 which depends on government financial support, sometimes affects its editorial deci-
 sions regarding news and feature reporting.
 There are 18 privately owned television broadcasting stations, including several
 cable networks . The Government's Belize Information Service and the independent
 television station channels 5 and 7 produce local news and feature programs. The
 Belize Broadcasting Authority (BBA) regulates broadcastna  n s serts its right to
 preview certain broadcasts, such as those with political content, and to delete any
 defamatory or personally libelous material from the political broadcasts of beth par-
 ties. As far as is known, the BBA did not exercise this authority during 1994.
 The law provides for academic freedom and the Government respects it in prac-
 tice.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Assoiation.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and the authorities honor it in practice. Political parties and
 other groups with political objectives freely hold rallies and mass meetings. The or-
 
 
 325
 $anizers of public meetings must obtain a permit 36 hours in advance of the meet-
 ings; such permits are not denied for political reasons. The Constitution permits citi-
 zens to form and join associations of their choice, both political and nonpolitical.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is no state religion. All groups may worship as
 they choose, and all groups and churches may establish places of worship, train cler-
 gy, and maintain contact with coreligionists abroad.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Freign Travel, Eymigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on freedom of movement within the country.
 Foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation are unrestricted.
 As many as 40,000 Central Americans from neighboring countries have taken up
 residence in Belize since 1980, many of them entering illegally and living in the
 country without documentation. Successive governments conferred refugee status on
 nearly one-fourth of the new arrivals and provided them with assistance. However
 the sheer number of refugees and other immigrants strained government social
 services, while the highly visible presence of recent immigrants in the labor force
 and the marketplace has provoked widespread resentment among native-born
 Belizeans.
 Occasionally over the past few years, the Human Rights Commission of Belize
 (HRCB) and others have complained that immigration and law enforcement authori-
 ties abused suspected illegal immigrants and in a few cases deported persons who
 in fact were legal residents or bona fide refugees. In response to complaints, the
 Government promised to investigate all charges of unfair treatment, discourtesy or
 abuse. The Government claims that no specific evidence of these allegations has
 been presented. To facilitate greater understanding between Belizean officials and
 the Spanish-speaking people with whom they increasingly must work, the Govern-
 ment instituted mandatory Spanish language training for field officers in the Cus-
 toms Service and Immigration and Nationality Department.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Belize is a democracy governed by a Legislative Assembly, with executive direc-
 tion from a Cabinet of Ministers headed by Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel. The
 law requires national elections at least every 5 years.
 All elections are by secret ballot, and suffrage is universal for citizens 18 years
 and older. National  litical parties include the People's United Party the United
 Democratic Party (UDP), and the National Alliance for Belizean Rights (NABR).
 The nation's ethnic diversity is reflected in each party's membership. The Govern-
 ment changed hands (for the third time since independence in 1981) in 1993 when
 a coalition of the UDP and NABR won 16 of 29 seats in the House of Representa-
 tives.
 Women hold a number of appointive offices, including three of nine Senate seats.
 One member of the House of Representatives is a woman, but women in elective
 office are the exception rather than the rule. None hold senior positions in the politi-
 cal parties. No laws impede participation of women in politics; their scarcity in
 Belizean electoral politics can be attributed to tradition and socioeconomic factors.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The HRCB, a nongovernmental organization (NGO) affiliated with regional
 human rights organizations, operates free of government restriction on a range of
 issues, including refugee and agricultural workers' rights, cases of alleged police
 abuse and cases of alleged illegal deportations of Central American nationals. The
 HRCB publicizes, and urges police and other government bodies to act upon, com-
 plaints it receives. Local and international human rights groups operate freely, and
 the Government cooperates with independent investigations of human rights condi-
 tions.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Belize is a multiracial, multiethnic country, and the Government actively pro-
 motes tolerance and cross-cultural understanding. Discrimination on ethnic or reli-
 gious grounds is illegal and not common, although ethnic tension, particularly re-
 sentment of recently arrived Central American immigrants, continued to be a prob-
 lem.
 Women.-Despite constitutional provisions for equality, women face social and
 economic prejudices. For example, women find it more difficult than men to obtain
 business and agricultural financing and other resources. Most employed women are
 concentrated in female-dominated occupations with traditionally low status and
 wages. A Women's Bureau in the Ministry of Labor and Social Services is charged
 
 
 326
 with developing programs to improve the status of women. A number of officially
 registered women's groups work closely with various government ministries in pro-
 moting social awareness pror  s. Women have access to education and are active
 in all phres of national le, but relatively few are found in top managerial posi-
 tions.    e the law mandates that women receive equal pay for equal work, women
 wage earners often earn less than men in similar jobs. Women are not impeded from
 owning or managing land or other real property.
 Domestic violence agst women is a chromc problem. The Government took sev-
 eral steps to address domestic violence, including a public education campaign con-
 ducted by the Women's Services Office in the Ministry of Human Resources, as well
 as the introduction in Parliament of a sexual harassment bill. Women Against Vio-
 lence (WAV), an NGO with branches throughout the country, runs a shelter for bat-
 tered women and a hotline for rape victims. WAV and other women's organizations
 successfully lobbied the Government to secure passage of a domestic violence law
 in 1992. The law appears to have had an effect in at east one instance. In a much
 publicized case in December, in which a court convicted Lorna James of murdering
 her husband, the charge was later reduced to manslaughter because Ms. James had
 been the victim of domestic violence inflicted by her husband.
 Children.-The Government formed a Family Services Division in the Ministry of
 Human Resources devoted primarily to children's issues. The division coordinates
 programs for children who are victims of domestic violence, advocates remedies in
 specific cases before the Family Court, conducts a public education campaign, and
 works with NGO's and the U.N. Children's Fund to promote children's welfare. The
 Government also created a National Committee for Families and Children, chaired
 by the Minister of Human Resources.
 People With Disabilities.-The law does not mandate specifically the provision of
 accessibility for disabled persons nor prohibit job discrimination against them. The
 Government's Disability Services Unit, as well as a number of NGO's such as the
 Belize Association of and for Persons with Disabilities and the Belize Center for the
 Visually Impaired, provide assistance to physically disabled persons. Disabled chil-
 dren have access to government special education facilities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right ofAssociation.-By statute and in practice, workers are free to estab-
 lish and join trade unions. Thirteen independent unions, with an estimated 9.8 per-
 cent of the labor force, represent a cross-section of white-collar, blue-collar, and pro-
 fessional workers, including most civil service employees. Several of the unions,
 however, are moribund and inactive. The Ministry of Labor recognizes unions after
 they file with the Office of Registry. The law empowers members to draft the bylaws
 and constitutions of their unions and they are free to elect officers from among the
 membership at large. Unions which choose not to hold elections may act as rep-
 resentatives for their membership, but the National Trade Union Congress permits
 only unions which hold free and annual elections of officers to join its ranks. Both
 law and precedent effectively protect unions against dissolution or suspension by ad-
 ministrative authority.
 Although no unions are officially affiliated with political parties, several are sym-
 pathetic to one or the other of the two main parties. Unions freely exercise the right
 to form federations and confederations and affiate with international organiza-
 tions. The law permits unions to strike, but unions representing essential services
 may strike only after giving 21 days' notice to the ministry concerned. The Public
 Service Union, which is the bargaining unit for some 1,400 civil servants, staged a
 3-day wildcat strike after talks with the Government broke down over increased
 wages, but the strike was not well-supported.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for collec-
 tive bargaining and unions freely practice it throughout the country. Employers and
 unions set wages in free negotiations, or, more commonly, employers simply estab-
 lish them. The Labor Commissioner acts as a conciliator in deadlocked collective
 bargaining negotiations between labor and management, offering nonbinding coun-
 sel to both sides. Historically, the Commissioner's guidance has been voluntarily ac-
 cepted. However, should either union or management choose not to accept the con-
 ciliator's decision, both are entitled to a legal hearing of the case, provided that it
 is linked to some provision of civil or criminal law.
 The Constitution prohibits antiunion discrimination both before and after a union
 is registered. Unions may freely organize, but the law does not require employers
 to recognize a union as a bargaining agent. Some employers have been known to
 block union organization by terminating the employment of key union sympathizers,
 usually on grounds purportedly unrelated to union activities. Effective redress is ex-
 tremely diffiult in such situations. Technically, a worker may file a complaint with
 
 
 327
 the Labor Department, but it has been virtually impossible to prove that a termi-
 nation was due to union activity.
 The Labor Code applies in the country's two export processing zones (EZ's).
 There are no unions in the EPZs, however, reflecting the general weakness of orga-
 nized labor in the country, as noted above.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution forbids forced
 labor, and it is not known to occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 is 14 yars, or 17 years for employment near hazardous machinery. Inspectors from
 the Ministries of Labor and Education enforce this regulation, although in recent
 years school truancy officers, who have historically borne the brunt of the enforce-
 ment burden, have been less active. The law requires children between the ages of
 5 and 14 to attend school, but there are many truants and dropouts.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage is $.12 (B$2.25) per hour,
 except in export industries where it is $1.00 (B$2.00) per hour. For domestic work-
 ers and shop assistants in stores where liquor is not consumed, the rate is $0.87
 (B$1.75) per hour. The minimum wage law does not cover workers paid on a piece-
 work basis. The Ministry of Labor is charged with enforcing the -legal minimum
 wage, which is generally respected in practice. The minimum wage as a sole source
 of income is inadequate to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and fam-
 ily. Most salaried workers receive more than the minimum wage.
 The law sets the normal workweek at no more than 6 days or 45 hours. It re-
 quires payment for overtime work and an annual paid vacation of 2 weeks. A patch-
 work of health and safety regulations covers numerous industries, and the Min-
 istries of Labor and Public Health enforce these regulations in varying degrees. En-
 forcement is not universal countrywide, and the ministries commit their limited in-
 spection and investigative resources principally to urban and more accessible rural
 areas where labor, health, and safety complaints have been registered. Workers
 have the legal right to remove themselves from a dangerous workplace situation
 without jeopardy to continued employment.
 The exploitation of undocumented foreign workers, particularly young service
 workers and workers in the banana industry, continues to be a major concern of the
 HRCB and other concerned citizens. Undocumented immigrants working in the
 Stann Creek area banana industry have complained of poor working and living con-
 ditions and routine non payent of wages. In 1992 a government labor inspector was
 assigned to the area to help resolve wage disputes and promote improved conditions,
 but after more than 2 years, little progress has been made.
