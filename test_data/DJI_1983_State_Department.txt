 DJIBOUTI
 Djibouti is a tiny, resource-poor, yet strategically located
 developing nation. It is one of Africa's newest independent
 states. Following legislation passed in late 1981 effectively
 outlawing opposition political parties, Djibouti formally
 became a one party state under the ruling Popular Assembly
 Party. Normally, political power is shared by an arrangement
 in which the President is a Somali Issa and the Prime Minister
 an Afar, with Cabinet positions roughly divided equally among
 these tribes. Real power is nevertheless almost totally in the
 hands of the Somalis of the Issa clan, who control the Govern-
 ment, the civil service, the armed forces, and the party.
 The most recent elections were held in May, 1982 when a new
 National Assembly was chosen. A single slate of party candi-
 dates chosen by the Central Committee of the party was elected
 without opposition.
 The country is divided among the majority politically dominant
 ethnic Somalis, who in turn are subdivided into clans and
 factions thereof; a substantial minority of Afars who fear
 exclusion from power; and Arabs, mainly Yemenis.
 Despite its meager resources, Djibouti continued in 1983 to
 host some 30,000 refugees from Ethiopia and Somalia and allow
 international relief agencies to operate in refugee camps.
 The Government treated refugees well and in compliance with
 accepted international norms. In September 1983, the Govern-
 ment cooperated with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 and Ethiopia on an agreed plan of voluntary refugee repatria-
 tion.  Under the program, by the end of 1983 some 5,000-8,000
 of the refugees are to have been repatriated to Ethiopia.
 The rights to personal security and integrity of Djiboutians
 are generally well protected, despite the fact that the legal
 system is still in its formative stage. Corruption within the
 judiciary has allowed, on occasion, bribery by defendants to
 gain their freedom and by plaintiffs to gain convictions. On
 any topic not yet covered by Djiboutian legislation, the
 Napoleonic code, a product of the French colonial period, and
 to an extent, the Koran-based Shari'a, apply. There have been
 several allegations of both harassment of political opposition
 leaders and torture of political opponents. There was an
 independent confirmation of these charges in 1980, followed by
 a commitment by Djibouti's President Hassan Gouled to eliminate
 this practice. However, in March, 1983 a former government
 employee fled to France to seek asylum alleging he had been
 imprisoned and tortured in Djibouti.
 Djibouti's economy rests on a large foreign expatriate commun-
 ity, the maritime and commercial activities of the port of
 Djibouti, the airport, and the operation of the Addis Ababa-
 Djibouti railroad. This recent economic stagnation has been
 compounded with the refugee burden. Because of Djibouti's near
 total lack of resources, the major focus of its government is
 on economic development, which is intrinsically tied to foreign
 economic assistance. Unemployment and under-employment remain
 major problems.  Free enterprise is encouraged in Djibouti's
 service-oriented economy, and the right of private property and
 freedom of movement are generally well respected.

 The openness of the society creates an atmosphere in which most
 citizens feel free to pursue their livelihood without much
 fear of governmental interference. There are few signs of
 popular discontent with the Government. The Government has
 been living up to its commitment to strictly voluntary refugee
 repatriation.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from;
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There have been no incidents of killing by the Government for
 apparent political motives since Djibouti became independent in
 1977. However, in December, 1981, the reputed leader of a
 Somali dissident group was assassinated in Djibouti City. The
 Djibouti government arrested several individuals for this crime
 in late 1982 and announced that it had evidence of foreign
 complicity, although no country has yet been blamed publicly.
 b. Disappearance
 During 1983, no allegations of disappearances are known to have
 been made.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 In September 1982, in a television program produced in France
 entitled "Djibouti: Republic in Uniform,' former Prime
 Minister Armed Dini reiterated charges he and others had made
 previously that political prisoners were being systematically
 tortured in Djibouti. The Government denied these charges. In
 March, 1983, a former government employee arrested on charges
 of espionage escaped to France to seek asylum. He reportedly
 told Amnesty International representatives there that he had
 been systematically tortured during interrogation. There has
 also been one report that three former Afar dissidents who
 had been implicated in terrorist actions in 1977-79 and who
 returned to Djibouti from Ethiopia under the 1982 amnesty were
 arrested and tortured at Villa Christophe prison for threat-
 ening state security. There has been no reaction to these
 charges from the Government or any international organizations.
 These charges remain unconfirmed and there have been no other
 reports of torture.
 Prison conditions are minimally adequate, but two prisoners died
 from food poisoning in 1983. Family members and counselors are
 permitted access to prisoners, and public health and medical
 services supervise health conditions in a competent manner.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The current system of justice is a carry-over from the
 French colonial period and is a mixture of French and
 Islamic practice. There is no habeas corpus, and preventive
 detention is permitted. However, prosecutors are required
 
 
 106
 to, and do file charges in an expedient fashion. In October,
 1982, however, one dissident and another suspected supporter
 were detained briefly following their alleged appearance in the
 French television program. Amnesty International was also
 investigating reports in October 1983 of arrests and expulsions
 of Ethiopian asylum-seekers.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Both the State Security Court, which was established to deal
 with crimes against the security of the state, and ordinary
 civil and criminal courts, permit family members and counsel,
 though not the general public, to be present during trials. The
 judiciary is independent of military and/or executive pressures.
 However, there were several allegations in 1983 of corruption
 within the judiciary, including that convictions of acquittals
 could be arranged through bribery.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Decree Law No. 8 of June 1980 states that government authori-
 ties "may not enter or remain in the domicile of a private
 individual without his consent and without a legal order,"
 except, among other circumstances, when it is necessary to
 facilitate the prosecution of persons accused of crimes and
 when the public order is seriously disturbed. There are
 reports of non-compliance with this statute. The judiciary
 issues warrants to the police for searches. There were no
 charges of arbitrary government interference in the private
 lives of its citizens in 1983.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 All Djiboutian media are government-owned and support the
 Government and its policies. Djibouti's radio and television
 entity claims to receive only limited guidance from senior
 political levels on handling news it presents to the public.
 There is occasional criticism of the shortcomings of local
 institutions, some associated with key political figures, and
 of corrupt practices, but not of the central Government. There
 have been occasional removals from public distribution of
 foreign publications which contained commentary critical of the
 Government. Some political opponents were imprisoned in 1981
 for making anti-government remarks and attempting to form an
 opposition party, but all were released by early 1982.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public meetings require a permit that may be denied for secur-
 ity reasons. The Government permits free association outside
 the political realm, and there are several independent social,
 religious, and commercial organizations. However, the Govern-
 ment has organized the single national labor federation and
 keeps it under its control. The right of labor to organize and
 strike is effectively suppressed. There were some brief minor
 strikes in 1982 and 1983, but the Government-applied various
 legal pressures which caused the strikers to return to work
 
 
 107
 qui'ckly. Some power plant workers who struck in June 1983,
 were detained and later lost their jobs. It is reported that
 labor leader Ahmed Djama Oboley was arrested in November 1983
 for leading a call for strikes by a group of dissident union
 activists within the National Labor Federation. Some workers
 have allegedly been dismissed from places of employment for
 union activities. only a small portion of the work force
 is unionized. The national labor federation maintains relations
 with recognized international bodies in their fields.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Whereas over 96 percent of the population is Muslim, other
 religions are permitted to operate freely. Freedom of religious
 practice and association with co-religionists outside the coun-
 try are observed.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Djiboutians have and exercise the right to travel freely
 within, leave, and return to their country. Passports are
 generally freely available.
 Djibouti has received approximately 30,000 refugees, mostly
 Ethiopian, and has allowed international field agencies to
 operate in the two major refugee camps. All refugees have the
 right to live in the camps and to receive food and medical
 care. Refugees have reportedly been restricted to their camps
 and are not able to move freely.
 In February 1982, following a series of roundups of alleged
 illegal immigrants, approximately 35 refugees were deported
 to Ethiopia. The Djiboutian Government claimed at the time
 that the deportation was an attempt to rid the country of
 illegal aliens posing as legitimate refugees. However, almost
 half of those deported were in fact legitimate refugees,
 although at the time most could only provide photocopies of
 their refugee identity cards as proof. During the same period,
 approximately one hundred Somali citizens without legal docu-
 mentation were taken to the nation's borders. But when they
 were not accepted by Somali authorities, they were permitted to
 return. Protests were made by the U.N. High Commissioner for
 Refugees and by concerned embassies. Current government policy
 is to encourage all refugees to move to refugee camps in the
 short term and, in the long term, to return to their country of
 origin.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Djibouti is a one party state whose leaders and candidates
 for parliament are chosen by the leadership of the Popular
 Assembly Party. The party leadership carefully controls and
 directs all political activity. The party, Government and
 armed forces are dominated by Issa Somalis, but positions are
 given to Afars aligned with the Government. At present, all
 significant minority groups are represented in the Government.
 In August, 1981 an opposition party attempted to gain legal
 recognition to compete for seats in National Assembly elections
 
 
 108
 scheduled for May, 1982. The Government refused to grant the
 proposed party legal recognition and took steps to institute
 a single party political system. Later, 13 leaders of the
 opposition group were detained with the Government maintaining
 they were attempting to encourage internal ethnic strife.
 Although they were later released, the Government's actions led
 to charges that there is no democratic or non-violent means
 of opposition against the present Government. These charges
 were echoed before the National Assembly elections in May
 1982 when opponents of the government charged it had manip-
 ulated voting district registration rolls to reduce the
 influence of regions where the dissidents were strong. Over
 90 percent of the reported registered voters voted in the
 May, 1982 elections, and less than two percent exercised a
 blank paper or wrote the word *no" on the ballot. There
 were reports of minor scattered violence on election day as
 well as some coercion of voters.
 Women have equal political rights with men, but have not played
 an active role in politics. There are currently no women
 parliamentarians or major government officials.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 On at least five occasions since independence, most recently
 in March 1983, there have been foreign press and other reports
 alleging human rights violations by the Government. The
 Government accepted the 1981 human rights investigation request
 by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. It also
 cooperated with a delegate from Amnesty International who
 visited Djibouti in 1981 to investigate charges of torture and
 death from torture. In September 1983, three visiting foreign
 researchers representing an organization critical of Djibouti's
 refugee policy were expelled from the country because of their
 views of the proposed voluntary refugee repatriation program,
 and failure to consult with government officials before inter-
 viewing refugees. In 1983, Amnesty International expressed
 concern over the alleged expulsion of Ethiopian asylum seekers
 and individuals being detained since September 1981 without
 legal grounds. Freedom House rates Djibouti *not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Djibouti is a poorly developed country, almost totally lacking
 in natural resources. It is heavily dependent on the mainten-
 ance of a large French military and expatriate presence and
 outside donor support, mainly from France and Saudi Arabia, for
 its economic well-being and development. This support is
 directed toward many aspects of the economy, including education
 and health facilities, and is designed to ameligrate the high
 poverty level in the country. The country is in the process
 of publishing its first census. Results are expected    to be
 announced in late 1983.
 The harsh, hot environment is one of the causes of the low life
 expectancy of 50 years (1973 statistics) and the high infant
 mortality rate of 140.7 per 1,000 live births. The latter in
 
 
 109
 turn contributes to a relatively high birth rate of three
 percent per annum, as families seek to replace those who have
 died. There is limited agricultural potential, and the only
 large-scale source of locally-produced food is fish. The
 Government has encouraged the population to supplement their
 diets with fish, and this program has met with some success.
 There are no figures available on the calorie supply relative
 to nutritional requirements.
 Water is a scarce commodity and of poor quality in most
 of the country, and there are no surface water sources.
 The Government has made efforts to truck water to the more
 remote areas of the country. An African Development Fund study
 of September 1979 estimated 51 percent of the population
 received safe water (53 percent in urban areas, 20 percent in
 rural areas). Active government-sponsored assistance efforts
 to identify and to utilize further water sources and storage
 areas are currently under way.
 According to a November 1980 World Bank report, the adult
 literacy rate in the French language was 17 percent. The
 primary school enrollment was approximately 21,000 in 1983, an
 increase of some 320 percent since independence in 1977. The
 high school enrollment has increased from 3,000 to 9,000 during
 the same period. This increase, with a concomitant rise in the
 number and quality of educational facilities, reflects the high
 priority the Djiboutian Government gives to education.
 In 1983 the gross national product (GNP) of Djibouti was
 an estimated $476 per capita. However this figure is mislead-
 ing, given the very high poverty levels in much of the country
 and the large, well-paid, predominantly French expatriate
 community, some four percent of the total estimated population
 of 275,000. For Djibouti citizens, the estimated GNP per
 capita is $260.
 Almost one third of the population lives a nomadic life of
 bare subsistence in the rural hinterlands of the Republic.
 Two factors other than the near total lack of natural resources
 or economic potential contribute significantly to the poverty
 level: first, practically all commodities are imported for
 consumption, and costs of even basic staples are extraordinar-
 ily high for most of the non-expatriate population. Second,
 the high level of unemployment and the shortage of jobs necess-
 itates that working members of a family be economically respons-
 ible for non-working members. A French study of 1980 estimated
 that 47 percent of the population earned less than $120 per
 annum.
 The latest available information concerning unemployment is an
 International Monetary Fund 1980 report which accepts Djibouti
 Ministry of Labor statistics on unemployment indicating that
 more than 50 percent of those seeking employment in 1979 could
 not find work. In 1982 unemployment was estimated at 45
 percent and underemployment at 33 percent of the work force.
 Women play a secondary role in public life and none hold high
 governmental or legislative positions. None are in the Cabinet
 or National Assembly. Women constitute only 20 percent of the
 work force and occupy a traditional family role.
