 BARBADOS
 Barbados, a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, is a constitutional democ-
 racy with a multiparty, parliamentary form of government. The Queen is Head of
 State; she is represented by an appointed Governor General. The Prime Minister is
 the Head of Government and governs with an appointed Cabinet. National elections,
 which were last held in January 1991, were contested by two major political parties,
 an offshoot of the government party, and several independent candidates. Prime
 Minister Erskine Sandiford, leader of the Democratic Labour Party (DLP), was re-
 elected at that time for a maximum 5-year term.
 The Royal Barbados Police Force is charged with maintaining public order. The
 small volunteer Barbados Defense Force, responsible for national security, can be
 employed to maintain public order in times of crisis, emergency, or other specific
 need. The Defense Force assisted the police by patrolling certain tourist areas in re-
 sponse to a major increase of crime. On the whole, the police respected constitu-
 tional and legal guarantees of human rights, but there were incidents of police use
 of excessive force.
 The country's economy is based on agriculture, tourism, light manufacturing, and
 services, which makes it vulnerable to external economic developments. Per capita
 gross domestic product exceeds $5,000 per year. An International Monetary Fund
 8-month stabilization program ended in May. It included layoffs of public sector
 employees, an 8-percent public sector wage cut, divestment of various state-owned
 enterprises, tax increases, and other means of increasing revenue and easing serious
 balance of payments difficulties. The reductions in government social spending af-
 fected thousands of Barbadians, but political tension and social unrest decreased in
 1993 from the levels witnessed in 1992.
 Barbados has a long record of generally respecting human rights, and there was
 no significant change in that record during 1993. Nonetheless, reports of human
 rights abuse included excessive use of force by police and a significant level of soci-
 etal violence against women and children.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Political killings are nonexistent in
 Barbados.
 The only allegations of extrajudicial killings involved the case of three young
 men-Ezra White, Ronald Codrington, and Devere Headley-who died as a a resu t
 of a June shootout with police. An official police investigation was conducted, and
 initial reports suggested that the police responded appropriately. The men were re-
 ported to be well-known criminalsinvolved in a number of assaults with guns and
 they apparently initiated the exchange of fire which led to their deaths.
 In the case of Ryan Jordan a 17-year-old who died in police custody in April 1992,
 Amnesty International called on Barbadian officials to initiate an impartial inves-
 tigation and prosecute those responsible. The coroner's inquest in the case has not
 been completed. Local human rights monitors believe that, although Jordan may
 have suffered injuries not caused by the police, the police may have beat him as
 well, contributing to his death.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution specifically prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment. However, the local press reported that a very high per-
 centage of convictions are based on confessions in Barbados. There continued to be
 credible reports that brutality by law enforcement officials during detention is some-
 times used to extract confessions.
 After several publicized reports of police extracting forced confessions and beating
 suspects in 1992, the Commissioner of Police condemned "the use of unauthorized
 force" by police officers. He initiated new procedures which provide that suspects
 and other persons held by the police can be questioned only at a police station, ex-
 cept when expressly permitted by a senior divisional officer. An officer must visit
 
 
 a detainee at least once every 3 hours to inquire about the detainee's condition.
 After 24 hours, a written report must be submitted to the Deputy Commissioner.
 All movements of the detainee between stations must be approved and recorded.
 Barbados is in the forefront of an initiative to standardize police procedures
 throughout the English-speaking Caribbean region. However, contrary to the un-
 armed tradition of the police force-in response to the shooting death of a policeman
 and the rise in gun- and drug-related crime-special units and some foot patrols
 were issued firearms in 1993.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and imprisonment and requires detainees to be brought before a court of law
 within 72 hours of arrest. These provisions are generally respected in practice. New
 rules of guidance set out in mid-1992 by the Police Commissioner specify methods
 of detention, means of reporting such, and disclosure of the condition of the detainee
 to senior police officers. Criminal defendants have the right to counsel, and attor-
 neys have ready access to their clients.
 Exile is not used as a punishment or means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides that persons charged
 with criminal offenses be given a fair, public hearing within a reasonable time by
 an independent and impartial court. The judicial system provides for rights of due
 process at each level. Dfendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty. The
 Government provides free legal aid to the indigent. The judiciary acts independently
 and is free of intervention from other branches of government. Criticizing the Gov-
 ernment is not a political offense, and there are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondene.-The
 Government does not routinely interfere in the private lives of its citizens. The Con-
 stitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search, or seizure, and the law requires warrants
 to be issued before privately owned property may be entered and searched. Nonethe-
 less, there continued to be credible reports that, in response to increased druV-relat-
 ed crime, the police resorted to searches of homes in certain neighborhoods in Bar-
 bados, sometimes without a warrant. The Government neither censors mail nor re-
 stricts the receipt of foreign correspondence or publications.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and press, and these rights are respected in practice. There are five radio stations,
 two of which are owned by the Government. Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation
 (CBC) television service (the only television source, excluding direct satellite recep-
 tion) is government-owned. Though CBC is a state enterprise, views opposing gov-
 ernment policies are regularly reported. Oppositionpolitical figures occasionally
 claim their positions are given little attention. This allegation has been made over
 the ears regardless of which party controls the Government. There are two inde-
 pendent dally newspapers, both of which present opposition political views. The
 Government regularly comes under attack in the newspapers and on daily call-in
 radio programs. Although critics allege that the Government sometimesuses its in-
 fluence to discourage media from reporting on sensitive issues, the press remained
 vigorously critical ol Government on a broad span of issues.
 Barbados is the site of the Cave Hill campus of the University of the West Indies;
 academicians across the political spectrum express their views freely.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government observes the
 constitutional guarantees of peaceful assembly and private association. Permits re-
 quired for public demonstrations continue to be routinely granted. Political parties,
 trade unions, and private organizations function and hold meetings and rallies with-
 out hindrance.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is full freedom of religion. While the Anglican and
 Methodist faiths have traditionally predominated, there are numerous other active
 religious denominations and organizations throughout the country, including Mus-
 lims and Rastafarians. Foreign missionaries of various faiths proselytize freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens and legal residents move freely within Barbados and leave and
 enter the country without restriction.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have this right in law and exercise it in practice. Political parties freely
 compete in fair elections by secret ballot at least every 5 years. There are no impedi-
 ments to participation in the political process, and all Barbadians over age 18 ma
 vote. The present Democratic Labour Party (DLP) Government, in pwer since 1986,
 won the January 1991 parliamentary elections with a majority of 18 out of the 28
 
 
 362
 seats. (One DLP member resigned from the party in 1993 and remained in Par-
 liament as an independent.) The main opposition party, the Barbados Labour Party
 (BLP), won 10 seats. A Cabinet of ministers appointed by the Prime Minister exer-
 cises executive power, balanced by a bicameral Parliament and the judiciary system.
 Women are well represented at all but the uppermost levels of government and poli-
 tics.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local groups involved with human rights matters operate freely and without gov-
 ernment hindrance. Caribbean Rights a Caribbean-wide human rights organization,
 has its headquarters and a small staff in Barbados, and it investigates and reports
 on allegations of human rights violations throughout the region.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equal treatment under the law, regardless of race,
 relvgion, or sex.
 Women.-Women actively participate in all aspects of national life and are well-
 represented at all except the uppermost levels of be the public and private sectors.
 They form a large percentage of heads of household in Barbados and are not dis-
 criminated against in public housing or other social welfare programs.
 However, women's rights groups continued to single out violence against women
 and children as a significant social problem in Barbados. They reported that the in-
 cidence of sexual assaults, domestic violence, incest, and rape amongfamily mem-
 bers increased, despite the fact that there is still some reluctance on the part of vic-
 tims to report such incidents. There are public and private counseling services for
 domestic violence, rape, suicide, and child abuse.
 The 1992 Domestic Violence Law specifies the appropriate police response to do-
 mestic violence, intended to protect all members of the family, including men and
 children, and applies to commonlaw relationships as well as married people. Crimi-
 nal penaltiesfor violent crimes are the same, regardless of the sex of the offender
 or the victim. In cases of domestic violence, courts typically issue restraining orders
 if requested by the victim, the breach of which is punishable by a jail sentence. The
 courts heard a number of cases of domestic violence against women involving as-
 sault or wounding. Human rights monitors criticized the inconsistency in sentencing
 for rape, incest, and statutory rape, which is often left to the discretion of the judge.
 The lack of sentencing guidelines resulted in longer sentences being handed down
 for persons accused of petty theft than for incest; and lesser sentences for incest
 than for rape or sexual assault of nonfamily members.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's human rights and welfare.
 The Child Care Board is the key agency responsible for monitoring and responding
 to the critical welfare needs, interests, and rights of children. Recent incidents of
 statutory rape and child abuse have received greater press attention and more seri-
 ous government denunciations than were typical in the 1980's. As noted above, local
 women's groups say that violence against children remains a serious problem.
 People with Disabilities. -There is neither local legislation nor regulations within
 the Labor Code which prohibit discrimination against the physically disabled in em-
 ployment, education, or the provision of other state services. The Handicapped Sec-
 tion of the Labour Department, which is concerned with finding jobs for the dis-
 abled, unsuccessfully advocated the introduction of such legislation in the 1980's.
 Similarly, there is no legislation mandating provision of handicapped access to pub-
 lic thoroughfares or public or private buildings. However, there are interest groups
 that have lobbied for this type of legislation from time to time, but so far without
 success.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right to form and belong to trade
 unions and to strike, and they freely exercise these rights. There are two major
 unions and several smaller ones, representing various sectors of labor. The civil
 service union, the National Union of Public Workers (NUPW), is completely inde-
 pendent of any political party or the Government. The largest union, the Barbados
 Workers' Union (BWU), was historically closely associated with the governing Demo-
 cratic Labour Party. However, in February Leroy Trotman, BWU General Secretary
 and president of the Caribbean Congress of Labor, resigned from the DLP while re-
 maining in Parliament as an independent representative. Trotman resigned because
 of a perceived conflict between his role as union leader and his role as parliamentar-
 ian. The latter required him to support the Government's economic stabilization and
 austerity measures which were viewed as setting back union achievements and
 
 
 363
 harming workers. Nevertheless, Trotman's deputy in the BWU remained a govern-
 ment backbencher in Parliament.
 Trade unionists' personal and property rights are given full protection under law.
 Strikes are prohibited only in the water andelectric utilities and among the security
 forces; all other private and public sector employees are permitted to strike.
 There was less industrial action in 1993 than 1992, despite severe cutbacks in
 personnel in the private sector. In the public sector, wage cuts, layoffs, and efforts
 to privatize state-run enterprises continued. In the summer, public, private, and
 union sector leaders signed a tripartite wage policy accord that called for a 2-year
 wage freeze. Any increases in wages will be tied to productivity increases by particu-
 lar workers or by particular enterprises. Some critics argued that the wage policy
 undermined the right of unions to bargain collectively because it forestalled any new
 companywide or industrywide negotiations for wage and benefit increases.
 Trade unions are free to form federations and are in fact affiliated with a variety
 of regional and international labor organizations. The main regional labor organiza-
 tion, the Caribbean Congress of Labor, has its headquarters in Bridgetown and con-
 ducts many of its seminars and other programs in Barbados.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bar ain Collectively.-The right to organize and to
 bargain collectively is provided by (aw and respected in practice. In 1992 over 25
 percent of the working population was organized, but a major loss of jobs in the
 economy has resulted in a reduction in union membership. The BWU reported that
 it alone lost about 2,000 members in 1993 in the transport, private, and public sec-
 tors as a result of economic conditions. Normally, wages and working conditions are
 negotiated through the collective bargaining process, but this was influenced by the
 tripartite wage accord described above.
 Employers have no legal obligation to recognize unions under the Trade Union Act
 of 1964, but most do so when a majority of their employees signify a desire to be
 represented by a registered union. While there is no speciic law prohibiting
 antiunion discrimination, the courts provide a method of redressfor employees alleg-
 ing unfair dismissal. The courts commonly award monetary compensation but rarely
 order reemployment.
 There are no manufacturing or special areas where collective bargaining rights
 are legally or administratively impaired. Barbados has no specially designatedex-
 port processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by the Constitution and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum working age
 of 16 is generally observed. Minimum age limitations are reinforced by compulsory
 primary and secondary education policies, which require school attendance until age
 16.Oasionally, especially among migrant worker families, children assist in agri-
 cultural production during peak season. The Labour Department has a small cadre
 of labor inspectors who conduct spot investigations of enterprises and check records
 to verify compliance with the law. These inspectors are authorized to take legal ac-
 tion against an employer who is found to have underage workers.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Minimum wages for specified categories of
 workers are administratively established and enforced by law. Only two categories
 of workers have a formally regulated minimum wage- household domestics and
 shop assistants (entry level commercial workers). Household domestics receive a
 minimum wage of about $32.50 (bds $65.00) per week. There are two age-related
 minimum wage categories for shop assistants. The adult minimum wage for shop
 assistants is $1.87 (bds $3.75) per hour; the juvenile minimum wage for shop assist-
 ants is $1.62 (bds $3.25) per hour. Agricultural workers (i.e., sugar plantation work-
 ers) receive a minimum wage as a matter of practice, but such compensation is not
 found in legislation.
 The minimum wage for shop assistants is marginally sufficient to meet minimum
 living standards; most employees earn more. In 1992 an International Labor Orga-
 nization (ILO) Committee of Experts (COE) cited Barbados for not adhering to the
 ILO convention on equal remuneration in its wage differentials in the sugar indus-
 try. The COE admonished the Government to ensure the application of the principle
 of equal remuneration for work of equal value to male and female workers in the
 sugar industry or to provide further information on job descriptions which might
 justify such wage distinction. This case was not resolved at year's end.
 The standard legal workweek is 40 hours in 5 days, and the law requires overtime
 payment for hours worked in excess of that. Barbados accepts ILO conventions,
 standards, and other sectoral conventions regarding maximum hours of work. How-
 ever, there is no general legislation that covers all occupations. Workers are guaran-
 teed a minimum of 3 weeks' annual leave. All workers are covered by unemploy-
 ment benefits legislation, and by national insurance (social security). A comprehen-
 
 
 364
 sive government-sponsored health program offers subsidized treatment and medica-
 tion.
 Under the Factories Act of 1983, which sets out the officially recognized occupa-
 tional safety and health standards, the Department of Labour enforces health and
 safety standards and follows up to ensure that problems cited are corrected by man-
 agement. Workers have a limited right to remove themselves from dangerous or
 hazardous job situations without jeopardizing their continued employment. The Fac-
 tories Act requires that in certain sectors firms employingmore than 50 workers
 set up a safety committee. This committee can challenge the decisions of manage-
 ment concerning the occupational safety and health environment. Recently, how-
 ever, trade unions called on the Government to increase the number of factory in-
 spectors in order to enforce existing and proposed safety and health legislation more
 effectively, and to follow up to ensure that problems cited are corrected by manage-
 ment. Government-operatedcorporations in particular were accused of doing a "poor
 job" in health and safety, the Government promised to undertake inspections of gov-
 ernment-run corporations and manufacturing plants as a priority.
 BELIZE
 Belize is a parliamentary democracy with a Constitution enacted in 1981 upon
 independence from the United Kingdom. It is governed by a Prime Minister, a Cabi-
 net of Ministers, and a Legislative Assembly. A Governor General represents Queen
 Elizabeth II in the largely ceremonial role of Head of State. Both local and national
 elections are scheduled on a constitutionally prescribed basis.
 The Belize Defence Force (BDF) consists of regular and reserve infantry and small
 air and maritime wings. The 750-member Police Department is responsible for law
 enforcement and maintenance of order. It is responsible to and controlled by civilian
 authorities.
 Belize is a developing nation with an economy dependent primarily on agriculture.
 The Governmert favors free enterprise and actively encourages investment, both
 foreign and domestic. In 1992 the grss domestic product (GDP) grew by 5.3 percent
 in real terms, and the per capita GDP was $2,170.
 Constitutional protections for the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individ-
 ual, including women and all ethnic groups, are upheld by the judiciary. An active
 press and increasingly independent radio and television stations buttress the peo-
 ple's civil and political rights. However, there were a number of credible reports of
 police abuse and mistreatment, and at least one allegation of police killing an un-
 armed suspect during the year. The Government promised to investigatecomplaints
 and punish those officers guilty of wrongdoing. However, none were charged or pun-
 ished for human rights abuses in 1993. Domestic violence against women is a chron-
 ic problem; in addition, there continued to be credible reports of employer mistreat-
 ment of immigrant workers in the banana industry.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHlTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings. There were several allegations of misuse of lethal force by police
 officers in 1993, constituting extrajudicial killings. In each of three such cases re-
 orted and investigated duri:ng the year in which excessive force was alleged to have
 een used in the course of hot pursuit or arrest of criminal suspects, the Director
 of Public Prosecutions determined that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute.
 However, charges were filed against a police officer following a 1991 incident in
 which a prisoner was killed in police custody when the officer apparently tried to
 break up a fight between prisoners. That case had ended in a hung jury in early
 1993; the prosecutor filed charges again and a new trial is pending.
 b. Disappearance. -There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment are ex-
 pressly forbidden by the Constitution. Nonetheless there are occasional credible re-
 ports of mistreatment and abuse by police. Such allegations are investigated by the
 Police Department, the Police Complaints Board, and on occasion, by special inde-
 pendent commissions appointed by the Prime Minister. No police or prison officer
 was charged with or convicted of such an offense in 1993.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest or detention, and these provisions are respected in practice. A detainee must
 be informed of the cause of detention within 48 hours of arrest and must be brought
 
 
 365
 before a court within 72 hours. In practice, detainees are normally informed imme-
 diately of the charges against them. Bal is granted in all but the most serious
 cases. However, many detainees cannot make bail, and backlogs in the judicial sys-
 tem often cause considerable delays and postponements of hearings, resulting in
 overcrowded prisons and prolonged incarceration without trial.
 Exile is forbidden by the Constitution and does not occur.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Persons accused of civil or criminal offenses have
 constitutional rights to presumption of innocence, protection against self-incrimina-
 tion, defense by counsel, public trial, and appeal. Trial by jury is mandatory in cap-
 ital cases. Those convicted by either a magistrate's court or the Supreme Court may
 appeal to the Court of Appeal. In some cases, including those resulting in a capital
 sentence the convicted party may make a final appeal to the Privy Council in the
 United Kingdom.
 These constitutional guarantees are respected in practice, although the judiciary's
 independence from the executive branch has been questioned by observers who note
 that judges must negotiate renewal of their employment contracts with the Govern-
 ment and may thus be vulnerable to political interference. The Supreme Court and
 magistrate courts suffer backlogs aggravated by the inability to maintain a full com-
 plement of judges.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Con-
 stitutional provisions for the protection of personal property, privacy of home and
 person, and recognition of human dignity are generally honored by the Government.
 Police are required to obtain judicial warrants before searching private property ex-
 cept when they have a reasonable suspicion that a crime is being committed and
 do not have time to obtain a warrant. This requirement is obeyed in practice. Cus-
 toms officers do not require a warrant to search private property.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and the press are protected
 under the Constitution and by local custom. In practice, all viewpoints are publicly
 presented without government interference. Five privately owned weekly news-
 papers, two of them fiercely partisan, engage in lively debate of the issues. The
 oppositionpress is a frequent critic of government officials and policies. All news-
 papers are subject to the constraints of libel laws.
 Belize's first privately owned commercial radio station began broadcasts in 1990.
 Since then, broadcast media have become considerably more open. The popular
 radio call-in programs are lively and feature open criticism of and comment on gov-
 ernment and political matters. Continuing indirect government influence over the
 autonomous Broadcasting Corration of Belize, a formergovernment monopoly
 which depends on government financial support, sometimes affects its editorial deci-
 sions regarding news and feature reporting.
 Fifteen privately owned television broadcasting stations, including several cable
 networks, operate in Belize. The Government's Belize Information Service and the
 independent Channel 5 television station produce local news and feature programs.
 Broadcasting is regulated by the Belize Broadcasting Authority (BBA), which as-
 serts its right to preview certain broadcasts, such as those with political content,
 and to delete any defamatory or personally libelous material from the political
 broadcasts of both parties before these are aired. As far as is known, the BBA did
 not exercise this authority during 1993.
 Academic freedom is provided or by law and respected in practice.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is constitutionally assured and honored in practice. Political
 parties and other grou pa with political objectives freely hold rallies and mass meet-
 ings. The organizers of public meetings must obtain a permit 36 hours in advance
 of the meetings; such permits are not denied for political reasons. Under the Con-
 stitution, Belizeans are free to form and join associations of their choice, both politi-
 cal and nonpolitical.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is no state religion. All groups may worship as
 they choose, and all groups and churches may establish places of worship, train cler-
 gy, and maintain contact with coreli onists abroad. There is an active missionary
 presence. In church publications andfrom the pulpit, church leaders comment on
 government and political policies as these affect the social welfare of the country.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 p atriation. -There are no restrictions on freedom of movement within the country.
 oreign travel, emigration, and repatriation are unrestricted.
 As many as 40,000 Central Americans from neighboring countries have taken up
 residence in Belize since 1980, many of them entering illegally and living in Belize
 
 
 366
 without documentation. The Government conferred refugee status on many of the
 new arrivals and provided them with assistance. However, the sheer number of ref-
 ugees and other immigrants strained government social services, while the highly
 visible presence of recent immigrants in the labor force and the marketplace has
 provoked widespread resentment among native-born Belizeans.
 The Human Rights Commission of Belize (HRCB) and others complained that im-
 migration and law enforcement authorities abused suspected illegal immigrants and
 on occasion deported persons who in fact were legal residents or bona fide refugees.
 In response to complaints, the Government promised to investigate all charges of
 unfair treatment, discourtesy, or abuse. The Government claims that no specific evi-
 dence of these allegations has been presented.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Belize is a functioning democrac governed by a Legislative Assembly, with execu-
 tive direction from a Cabinet of Ministers headed by Prime Minister George Price.
 National elections must be held at least once every 5 years. Municipal and town
 board officials are elected in local contests at 3-year intervals.
 All elections are by secret ballot, and suffrage is universal for Belizean citizens
 18 years and older. National political parties include the People's United Party
 (PUP), the United Democratic Party (UDP), and the National Alliance for Belizean
 Rights (NABR). The nation's ethnic diversity is reflected in each party's member-
 ship. The Government changed hands (for the third time since independence in
 1981) when a coalition of the UDP and NABR won 16 of 29 seats in the House of
 Representatives in the general elections of June 30.
 Allegations that large numbers of Central American immigrants were illegally
 naturalized in order to p ad voter rolls before the June general elections were inves-
 tigated by an independent consortium of nongovernmental organizations (NGO's).
 The consortium discovered a pattern of irregularities which rent credence to the
 charges, and the new Government promised to study and act on the group's rec-
 ommendations to prevent such abuses from occurring in the future.
 Women hold a number of appointive offices-the Governor General and three of
 nine Senators are women-but women in elective office are rare. No laws or prac-
 tices impede participation of women in politics. One of four women who contested
 June's generalelection was elected to the House of Representatives.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local and international human rights groups operate freely, and the Government
 cooperates with independent investigations of human rights conditions in Belize.
 The HRCB, a nongovernmental organization that is affiliated with regional
 human rights organizations, was active in 1993 on a range of issues, including refu-
 gee and agricultural workers' rights, cases of alleged poice abuse, and cases of al-
 leged illegal deportations of Central American nationals. The HRCB publicizes and
 urges police and other government bodies to act upon complaints which the HRCB
 receives. It lacks the resources to conduct independent investigations, but it does
 participate in joint projects such as the NGO consortium investigation discussed
 above.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Belize is a multiracial, multiethnic country, and the Government actively pro-
 motes tolerance and cross-cultural understanding. Discrimination on ethnic or reli-
 gious grounds is illegal and is not common, although ethnic tension, particularly re-
 sentment of Central American immigrants, continued to be a problem.
 Women.-Despite constitutional provisions for equality, Belizean women face so-
 cial and economic prejudices. For example, women can find it more difficult than
 men to obtain business and agricultural financing and other resources. Most em-
 ployed women are concentrated in female-dominated occupations with traditionally
 low status and wages. A Women's Bureau in the Ministry of Labor and Social Serv-
 ices is charged with developing programs to improve the status of women. A number
 of officially registered women s groups work closely with various government min-
 istries in promoting social awareness programs. Women have access to education
 and are active in all spheres of national life, but relatively few are found in top
 managerial positions. While the law mandates that women receive equal pay for
 equal work, women wage earners often earn less than men in similar jobs. Women
 are not impeded from owning or managing land or other real property.
 Domestic violence against women is a chronic problem. Women Against Violence
 (WAV), an NGO with branches throughout the country, runs a shelter for battered
 
 
 women and a hotline for rape victims. WAV and other women's organizations suc-
 cessfully lobbied the Government to secure passage of a domestic violence law in No-
 vember 1992.
 Children.-In 1990 Belize became the fifth nation worldwide to ratify the U.N.
 Convention on the Rights of the Child. With support from the United Nations Chil-
 dren's Fund, the Government and various NGO's are currently studying legislative
 changes which will be required to bring national law into conformity with the Con-
 vention. Several NGO's are active in the field of child welfare and the prevention
 of child abuse. The Government has sponsored a series of public service television
 announcements to sensitize the public to the issue of child abuse.
 People with Disabilities.-Assistance to physically disabled persons is provided by
 the Government's Disability Services Unit as wellas by a number of NGO's such
 as the Belize Association of and for Persons with Disabilities and the Belize Center
 for the Visually Impaired. Disabled children have access to government special edu-
 cation facilities. Belizean law does not specifically prohibit job discrimination
 against disabled persons. The provision of accessibility for disabled persons is not
 mandated legislativelyor otherwise.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-By statute and in practice, workers are free to estab-
 lish and join trade unions. Thirteen independent unions, with an estimated 9.8 per-
 cent of the labor force, represent a cross-section of white-collar, blue-collar, and pro-
 fessional workers, including most civil service employees. Several of the unions,
 however, are moribund and inactive. Unions are recognized by the Ministry of Labor
 after they file with the Office of Registry. Members are empowered to draft the by-
 laws and constitutions of their unions, and they are free to elect officers from among
 the membership at large. Unions which choose not to hold elections may act as rep-
 resentatives for their membership, but the National Trade Union Congress (NTUC)
 of Belize permits only unions which hold free and annual elections of officers to join
 its ranks. By both law and precedent, unions are effectively protected against dis-
 solution or suspension by administrative authority.
 Although no unions are officially affiliated with political parties, several are sym-
 pathetic to one or the other of the two main parties. Unions freely exercise the right
 to form federations and confederations and affiliate with international organiza-
 tions. Unions are legally permitted to strike, but unions representing essential serv-
 ices may strike only after giving 21 days' notice to the Ministry concerned. A wildcat
 strike by nonunion women textile workers occurred in 1993 following the failure of
 the employer to meet his payroll. The Government suspended the offending compa-
 ny's development concession in October and the company's management promised
 to pay the workers' back wages as soon as possible.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is pro-
 tected in law and freely practiced throughout the country. Wages are set in free ne-
 gotiations between employers and unions or, more commonly, simply offered by em-
 loyers. In practice, the Labor Commissioner acts as a concliator in deadlocked col-
 lective bargaining negotiations between labor and management, offering nonbinding
 counsel to both sides. Historically, the Commissioner's guidance has been volun-
 tarily accepted. However, should either union or management choose not to accept
 the conciliator's decision, both are entitled to a legal hearing of the case, provided
 that it is linked to some valid provision of civil or criminal law.
 The Constitution prohibits antiunion discrimination both before and after the
 union is registered. Theoretically, unions may freely organize. In practice, however,
 employers are not legally required to recognize a union as a bargaining agent, and
 some employers have been known to block union organization by terminating the
 employment of key union sympathizers, usually on grounds purportedly unrelated
 to union activities. Effective redress is extremely difficult in such situations. Tech-
 nically, a worker may file a complaint with the Labor Department, but it has been
 virtually impossible to prove that a termination was due to union activity.
 Belize's two export processing zones (EPZ's) are not exempt from the Labor Code.
 There are no unions in the EPZ's, however, reflecting the general weakness of orga-
 nized labor in the country, as noted above.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is forbidden by the
 Constitution and is not known to occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age of employment
 is 14 years, or 17 years for employment near hazardous machinery. Inspectors from
 the Ministries of Labor and Education enforce this regulation, although in recent
 years school truancy officers, who have historically borne the brunt of the enforce-
 ment burden, have been less active. Children between the ages of 5 and 14 are re-
 quired to attend school. In practice, there are many truants and dropouts.
 
 
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage is $1.12 (B$2.25) per hour,
 except in export industries where it is $1.00 (B$2.00) per hour. For domestic work-
 ers and shop assistants in stores where liquor is not consumed the rate is $0.87
 (B$1.75) per hour. Workers paid on a piecework basis are not covered by the mini-
 mum wage law. The Ministry of Labor is charged with enforcing the legal minimum
 wage, which is generally respected in practice. The minimum wage as a sole source
 of income is inadequate to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and fam-
 ily. Most salaried workers receive more than the minimum wage.
 No worker is obliged to work more than 6 days or 45 hours per week. Payment
 for overtime work is obligatory, as is an annual paid vacation of 2 weeks. A patch-
 work of health and safety regulations covers numerous industries, and these regula-
 tions are enforced in varying degrees by the Ministries of Labor and Public Health.
 Enforcement is not universal countrywide, and in 1993 the limited inspection and
 investigative resources were committed principally to urban and more accessible
 rural areas where labor, health, and safety complaints had been registered.
 The exploitation of undocumented foreign workers, particularly young service
 workers and workers in the banana industry, continues to be a major concern of the
 HRCB and other concerned citizens. Undocumented immigrants working in the
 Stann Creek area banana industry have complained of poor working and living con-
 ditions and routine nonpayment of wages. In 1992 a government labor inspector was
 assigned to the area to help resolve wage disputes and promote improved conditions,
 but after more than a year, little progress was made.
