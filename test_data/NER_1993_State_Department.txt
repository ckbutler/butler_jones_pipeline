 NIGER
 After adoption of a new Constitution in December 1992, Niger conducted in early
 1993 its first multiparty presidential and legislative elections since independence in
 1960. In the presidential elections, which international observers judged to be free
 and fair, eight parties banded together against the party created by the former mili-
 tary rulers to elect Mahamane Ousmane as President of the Third Republic. Nine
 parties won representation in the National Assembly elections. The governing coali-
 tion, the Alliance of the Forces of Change (AFC), led by Prime Minister Mohamadou
 Issoufou, consists of six parties with 50 of the total of 83 Assembly seats. The
 former ruling party, the National Movement for the Development of Society (MNSD-
 Nassara), won 29 seats in the Assembly and now leads the opposition.
 The new Government moved quickly to a&dress the Tuareg insurgency in the
 north, and in March reached a 3-month truce with the major Tuareg group, the Lib-
 eration Front of Air and Azawak (FLAA). The March truce led to an exchange of
 all prisoners and was extended in June for another 3 months. By September, how-
 ever, the Tuareg rebellion had split into three principal factions only one of which,
 the Front for the Liberation of Tamoust (FLT), agreed to renew the truce for an-
 other 90 days. Despite the truces, some armed Tuareg continued throughout 1993
 to attack convoys and government outposts, raiding vehicles and taking food and
 fuel. By year's end, the Government was continuing efforts to engage the Tuareg
 factions in talks aimed at a comprehensive settlement offering greater regional au-
 tonomy.
 The main security forces consist of the army, the gendarmerie (rural paramilitary
 police), and the national police. The new Government experienced problems in main-
 taining control over the security forces. In July some of the same elements that mu-
 tinied n 1992 once again attempted an uprisintg, demanding rejection of the Govern-
 ment's budget austerity measures, payment of  a   arrears, and implementation
 of longstanding proposals to reorganize the military. Supporters of the newly elected
 oalitiotn staged Larg counterdemonstrations, and the troops returned peacefully to
 their barracks. Following the mutiny, the Government initiated disciplinary action,
 including loss of rank, transfer, andremoval, of personnel associatedwith the mu-
 tiny.
 Upwards of 90 percent of the population depend on traditional subsistence farm-
 ing or herding. Uranium mines produce the single most important export. Persistent
 drought cycles, low literacy rates, the declining demand or uranium, and burden-
 some debt have further weakened an already marginal economy'. The Governments
 1993 austerity budget cut the single largest exponditure-civil service salaries,
 which comprise half the formal wage sector. The labor unions have been critical of
 the Government's program but at the end of 1993 had agreed to the reductions.
 Observance of human rights advanced with the introduction of a new Constitu-
 tion, with free elections and the installation of a coalition Government, and with ef-
 forts to resolve the Tuareg rebellion, including delineating electoral districts in the
 National Assembly to ensure minority representation. Nevertheless, there continued
 to be serious human rights problems. In particular, during the fighting early in
 1993, both government and rebel forces committed human rights abuses, causing
 some civilian deaths and property destruction. Moreover, while generally respectful
 of human rights, the transition government, which was in power in the first quarter
 of the year, made numerous attempts to intimidate or otherwise restrict its critics
 in the media. Some splinter Tuareg groups continued throughout 1993 to commit
 serious abuses, including killing noncombatants, but the Government's restrictive
 
 
 information policy in the northern security zone made precise information difficult
 to obtain.
 The Tuareg rebellion has been fueled in part by historical conflicts and by a cen-
 tralized political system dominated by the more numerous Hausa and Djerma ethnic
 groups. Serious societal discrimination and domestic violence continue against
 women, who also lack educational and employment opportunities. The overloaded
 court system dispensed justice only very slowly with long pretrial confinement.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-The newly elected Government did
 not engage in political or extrajudicial killings in 1993. However, early in the year,
 under the transition government, there were reported instances of extrajudicial kill-
 ing. In August 1992, military and paramilitary forces captured some 180 presumed
 Tuareg rebels in raids. Some of the 180 have never been accounted for and must
 be considered as having been killed extrajudicially. Similarly, Tuareg rebels took an
 undetermined number of captives early in 1993 who have disappeared and are pre-
 sumed dead. Additionally, the conflict between military forces and Tuareg rebels in
 the north produced human rights violations resulting in a number of civilian casual-
 ties (see Section 1.g.). Early in the year, the local press reported that two policemen
 held by the rebels had died of malnutrition.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of government-instigated disappear-
 ances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no reports of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment inflicted by either
 the army or Tuareg rebels after the truce in March was signed. There were random
 instances of individual law enforcement or prison officers abusing detainees and
 prisoners, although such cases were much reduced from 1992. Reports of abuse by
 police or prison officials involve occasional instances of beatings of detainees or pris-
 oners, usually those believed guilty of sexual offenses or crimes against persons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The 1992 Constitution prohibits arbi-
 trary detention. By law an arrestee must be either charged or released within 48
 hours. In special cases the public prosecutor may authorize a 24-hour extension.
 However, in practice, if a police officer has failed to gather sufficient evidence within
 the detention period, the prosecutor gives the case to another officer, and a new 48-
 hour detention period begins. A case is not dismissed if the limits on detention are
 not respected.
 The judicial system is seriously overloaded; individual magistrates hear upwards
 of 400 cases per year. There are no statutory limits on pretrial confinement which
 frequently lasts months or even years. As many as 80 percent of prisoners in
 Niamey are awaiting trial. There are only two sessions of criminal court per year,
 lasting 2 to 3 weeks each. If an arrestee is finally judged innocent, compensation
 for unjustified detention may be awarded.
 Defendants are allowed to choose their own lawyer, and bail is available for
 crimes carrying a penalty of less than 10 years' imprisonment. Widespread igno-
 rance of the law and lack of financial means prevent these rights from being exer-
 cised fully.
 In January the Government released 81 suspected rebel Tuaregs in Agadez for
 lack of sufficient evidence. In February the police in Zinder released an undeter-
 mined small number of detainees suspected of being rebels. Outside its effort to
 combat the rebels, the Government did not arrest people for their opinions.
 Shortly after national elections in March, the Government and rebels signed a 3-
 month truce which was renewed for a second 3-month period. The initial truce was
 followed by a general amnesty. All prisoners held by the Government and Tuareg
 rebels were released. In September the Government and the FLT, a Tuareg splinter
 group, extended the truce another 90 days. From March to September, the truce ac-
 cords were largely respected by the main Tuareg factions, although attacks by splin-
 ter groups continued to occur. Since September only one Tuareg faction has agreed
 to a continued truce, and the frequency of reported attacks has increased. The Gov-
 ernment, through French and Algerian intermediaries, has attempted to arrange
 talks with all the Tuareg factions aimed at a comprehensive settlement of the rebel-
 lion based on increased local government autonomy and economic development as-
 sistance to the northern region.
 The new Constitution prohibits the use of exile as a means of political control,
 and no instances of exile occurred.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The formal legal system in Niger derives from
 French law. Civil and criminal cases not involving security-related acts are tried
 
 
 207
 publicly. Defendants have the right to be present at their trial, to confront wit-
 nesses to examine evidence brought against them, and to present evidence of their
 own. The new Constitution affirms the presumption of innocence.
 Nigeriens can have cases involving divorce or inheritance heard by either a tradi-
 tional chief or a customary court. Customary courts, located only in large towns and
 cities, are headed by a legal practictioner with basic legal education who is advised
 by an assessor knowledgeable in the society's traditions. The judicial actions of
 chiefs and customary courts are not regulated by code. Cases unresolved by chiefs
 or customary courts can be appealed to the formal court system. There are no reli-
 Minors and defendants charged with crimes carrying a sentence of 10 years or
 more are eligible to be defended by counsel at public expense, if they cannot them-
 selves afford a lawyer. Lawyers comply with government requests to provide counsel
 in these cases but generally are not paid for their services.
 Defendants and prosecutors may appeal a verdict, first to the Court of Appeals
 and then to the Supreme Court. Both Courts are obligated to hear appeals. The
 Court of Appeals reviews questions of fact and law while the Supreme Court reviews
 only the application of the law. Nigerien law prohibits execution until the executive
 privilege of pardon is explicitly rejected.
 The Constitution stipulates an independent judiciary. In the departmental capital
 of Maradi, a judge dismissed a case brought by the Government against members
 of an oppsition political party charged wit organizin an illegal political rally. The
 judge ruled the Go vernment had not complied~with the law in attempting to sup-
 press the rally and, therefore, the rally must be considered legal. The integrity of
 the courts, on the other hand, has been called into question by credible reports of
 judges being influenced by family or business ties.
 Official investigations continued into the 1990 and 1991 incidents in which gov-
 ernment security forces killed civilians during political demonstrations. The Govern-
 ment promised that those responsible wouldbe prosecuted, but by year's end there
 had been no arrests.
 The Government has the legal power to constitute a State Security Court to try
 high crimes against the State, but had no cause to call the Court into operation in
 1993. Proceedings may be held in secret at the discretion of the Court, and the
 names of judges are not published. Due process prvisions apply in the State Secu-
 The newly elected Government launched an effort to combat illicit enrichment,
 corruption, and influence peddling. The Prime Minister instructed all ministers to
 ensure that their staffs were fully aware of the relevant provisions in the Penal
 Code. Shortly after the Prime Minister publicized the illicit enrichment campaign,
 the first arrests of officials accused of corruption were made in Maradi and Agadez.
 At the end of 1993, there were no known political detainees being held by the
 Government. In late 1993, the Government detained several persons for questioning
 for their alleged involvement in a plot to destabilize the Government. According to
 a police source, only one or two suspects remained in custody.
 f. Arbitrary Interference wth Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-By law
 the police are required to have a search warrant, normally issued by a judge. The
 law stipulates that the police may enter a home only between the hours of 6 a.m.
 and 9 p.m., unless in hot pursuit. The police may search without warrants when
 they have strong suspicion that a house shelters criminals or stolen property. Evi-
 dence thus gained is fully admissible in court. Human rights organizations report
 that routine searches are often conducted without warrants and at all hours. There
 were no reports of interference with correspondence.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 lict.-Government security forces and rebel Tuareg grups engaged in sporadic
 skirmishes during the first quarter of 1993, and there were credible reports of viola-
 tions of human rights. The Government established a security zone in the north,
 and journalists and others do not have ready access to the zones orto information.
 Therefore, the number of civilian casualties in the fighting was unknown, but in-
 complete reports indicated that there were several deaths. F or example, in January
 a Tuareg commando killed nine people, including three members of the Republican
 Guard, in Abala. Also, in February there were reports that Arabs of the Tessara re-
 gion, allegedly supplied with arms by government forces during the period of the
 transitional government, killed 13 Tuaregs at Intarikad.
 Despite the truce, splinter groups of rebels or bandits continued to attack civilian
 targets to obtain food, fuel, and other supplies, often resulting in deaths. In August
 a Tuareg raid left seven dead, four of whom were infants. To keep supply lines open
 to the north, the Government organized armed convoys. Although many of the at-
 tacks were attributable to banditry, others were attributable to armed Tuareg fac-
 
 
 208
 tions associated with the rebellion. The political goal of these attacks reportedly was
 to demonstrate the Government's vulnerability and inability to protect civilian popu-
 lations.
 While there were no reports of government forces perpetrating acts of violence
 against noncombatants nor using excessive force against rebels after the March
 truce, human rights groups reported that the military used the security zone to ob-
 scure its activities from public scrutiny. The press was not expressly forbidden from
 the security zone but in practice seldom ventured there. The Government was reluc-
 tant to talk openly, much less publish detailed information, on the rebellion for fear
 that it would compromise the truce and stop further talks with the rebels.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution explicitly provides for the
 rights of free speech and press and makes permanent the Superior Council of Com-
 munication (CSC), created by the National Conference in 1991, to monitor commu-
 nications policy. Although members of the CSC have been elected, it is not yet oper-
 ational due to a dispute over who should represent the public press. Deputies speak
 freely in the National Assembly and openly criticize the Government.
 The most important medium in reaching the public is the government-operated
 national radio service. It disseminates information in eight languages, including pro-
 grams to explain the meaning and function of democracy. The national radio service
 covers opposition activities, and there is no progovernment bias in its programming.
 In addition, the Government publishes the daily Le Sahel, as well as a weekend edi-
 tion in French.
 Several private newspapers came into existence bringing to eight the total num-
 ber of French and Hausa-language weekly papers. During the transitional govern-
 ment's rule, there were numerous attempts to intimidate the media, including a rec-
 ommendation by the Minister of Interior that publications be deposited with the
 Government 48 hours before their distribution. The recommendation was never im-
 plemented, however. The newly elected Government made no attempts to intimidate
 or interfere with the media. In fact, the media criticized the Government and even
 published interviews with Tuareg leaders after they were released from incarcer-
 ation. When the official daily failed to cover labor's views, several independent
 weeklies carried full explanations of labor's reasons for opposing the Government's
 economic austerity program.
 While Niger boasts an active association of editors of private newspapers and an
 association of female communications professionals, some journalists did not always
 substantiate their stories. As a consequence, several government officials, including
 the former Prime Minister, brought suits against journalists for defamation or libel.
 The courts found several journalists guilty of libel and in one case awarded the
 plaintiff $1,000, a large sum for a financially fragile independent newspaper. How-
 ever, there did not appear to be a pattern of high officials routinely bringing suits
 to intimidate the press or inhibit press freedom.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom of assembly and asso-
 ciation was exercised without hindrance. The Government retains the authority to
 deny permission for demonstrations under tense social conditions or if notice is not
 provided to public authorities at least 48 hours in advance. However, permits ar
 routinely granted. Demonstrations are free to use loudspeakers, pamphlets, signs,
 and other means of mass communication and openly criticize high officials, includ-
 in the President.
 There were several incidents testing the transitional and new Governments' com-
 mitment to free assembly. Security forces used tear gas to disperse several dem-
 onstrations: in January to disperse a demonstration demanding that the Govern-
 ment find the finances to save the school year; in April to halt a political rally pro-
 testing the election of the Prime Minister when demonstrators invaded the National
 Assembly; and in August in Maradi to disperse a demonstration against the mayor.
 In the Maradi incident, the authorities made a dozen arrests and wounded three
 after the crowd was sprayed with tear gas. The Government claimed that the march
 organizers did not wait the mandatory period and consequently jailed them for 5
 days. They were released when a judge ruled that the Government had acted ille-
 gally in banning the demonstration. The organizers have since sued the mayor say-
 ing they were illegally arrested at night.
 Under the Constitution, Nigeriens may form political parties of any kind, except
 those that are based on ethnicity, religion, or region. Eighteen political parties for-
 mally registered to participate in the 1993 elections.
 
 
 209
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Niger's population is over 90 percent Muslim. Despite the
 objection of certain Islamic groups, the new Constitution defines Niger as a
 anonconfessional" State.
 The right to practice other religions is respected. Christians-Catholic, Protestant,
 and Jehovah's Witnesses-as well as Baha'i, practice freely and establish houses of
 worship and schools. Conservative Muslim leaders printed denunciations of Baha'is,
 calling them heretics. Foreign missionaries live, work, and travel freely in Niger but
 must be members of an internationally recognized organization and register as a
 Nigerien association. Dozens of such organizations operate in Niger. Only a very few
 have ever been denied permission to work.
 Violence inspired by religious differences between the mainstream Tijaniyya Mus-
 lims and the purist Izala sect continued to occur. In August a marabout (Muslim
 religious leader) of the Tijaniyya was killed, and many believed that members of the
 rival Izala sect were responsible. An Izala marabout was detained for questioning
 but was ultimately released.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-In general, freedom of movement is not restricted. Among the Hausa
 and Fulani people in eastern Niger, however, many women are cloistered and can
 leave their homes only if escorted by a male and usually only after dark. Security
 forces at checkpoints monitored travel of persons and the circulation of goods, par-
 ticularly in and near major population centers. Attacks by rebels or bandits on vehi-
 cles traveling on major routes to the north severely restricted movement. Neither
 emigration nor repatriation is restricted.
 There are currently 3,605 Chadians (mostly women and children) in eastern Niger
 being supplied food, medical assistance and educational fees by the United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). In addition to Chadians, Niger is host
 to some 4,000 Malian Tuaregs who, according to the UNHCR, will soon gain refugee
 status in order to be repatriated to Mali with international assistance. Niger also
 hosts a small number of Togolese, Rwandese, Burundian, and Zairian refugees.
 There were no reports of forced repatriation of refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercised this right in early 1993 in parliamentary and two rounds of
 presidential elections. Citizens aged 18 years and over enjoy the franchise. Just
 prior to the elections, in December 1992, citizens voted overwhelmingly (by nearly
 90 percent) to accept the new Constitution establishing the Third Republic. It sets
 fort a system of checks and balances, with a strong Presidency, an 83-seat Na-
 tional Assembly, and an independent judiciary and enumerates 30 specific civil lib-
 erties. A close working relationship has been established between the Presidency
 and the Prime Minister, and the coalition Government has functioned well, despite
 a deteriorating economic situation.
 Women do not traditionally take part in political decisionmaking. Nevertheless,
 the new coalition Government appointed 5 women to ministerial positions in a 28-
 member Cabinet. Women's organizations and other human rights groups conduct
 educational campaigns aimed at increasing the participation of women in the politi-
 cal process.
 The traditional practice of husbands voting their wives' proxies was widely used
 during the National Assembly elections and the first round of presidential elections.
 The attempt by some men to vote for as many as four wives caused the Electoral
 Commission to tighten up on the use of the proxy before the second round of presi-
 dential elections. Human rights groups seek to eliminate the practice of men voting
 the proxy of their wives.
 The Electoral Commission (made up of officials and private citizens appointed by
 the Government) drew electoral districts to ensure that minority ethnic groups
 (Toubou, Fulani, Tuareg, and Arabs) would be fairly represented. Citizens elected
 members of each group to the National Assembly.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Independent human rights groups and associations addressed human rights con-
 cerns without governmental hindrance. Several organizations are active: the
 Nigerien Association for the Defense of Human Rights; Democracy, Liberty, and De-
 velopment; the National League for Defense of Human Rights; and Adalci ("Dignity"
 in Hausa). In addition, there are women's gups and the Network for the Integra-
 tion and Diffusion of Rights in the Rural Milieu (known as "Ridd-Fitila").
 Human rights organizations acted mainly through public declarations, private
 demarches, and articles and appeals in the press to try to raise public awareness
 
 
 210
 of human rights issues. The International Committee of the Red Cross is active in
 Niger and had access to Tuareg detainees and rebel-held hostages during the transi-
 tion period. Amnesty International has visited without government hindrance to ex-
 amine human rights practices.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on sex, social origin, race, eth-
 nicity, or religion.
 Women.-LDespite the Constitution, the deep-seated traditional belief in the sub-
 mission of women to men results in discrimination against females in many areas,
 including in the political process (see Section 3), in education (see below), and in
 employment and property rights. The situation is particularly discriminatory in
 rural areas where women do much of the subsistence farming as well as the child-
 rearing. For example, when the transitional government appointed the first female
 prefect (governor), the local citizens objected so strenuously that the appointment
 ad to be rescinded.
 Women do not enjoy equal legal status with men. For example, while the head
 of household has certain legal rights, divorced or widowed women, even with chil-
 dren are not considered the head of their household. With the draft family and
 rural codes now under consideration by the National Assembly, women's rights
 groups are attempting to strengthen women's rights in inheritance, land tenure, and
 child custody, and in particular to end the practice of repudiation. This latter prac-
 tice permits the husband to obtain an immediate divorce without having further re-
 sponsibility for the wife or children.
 While tradition strongly inclines employers to favor men as employees, there is
 a small, but increasing, number of women professionals. About one-third of the doc-
 tors, perhaps 10 percent of magistrates, and 24 percent of the civil service are
 women serving mostly at the lower ranks. The first female police officers and sol-
 diers were widely publicized in the popular press. Still, even in urban areas women
 remain severely underrepresented in middle and high-ranking positions, in both the
 public sector and the formal private sector.
 Domestic violence against women and children is widespread, though neither the
 Government nor women's rights groups have firm statistics on its extent. Women's
 groups report that wife beating is common even in upper social strata. Families
 often intervene to prevent the worst abuses, and women may (and do) divorce for
 physical abuse. While women have the right to seek redress in the customary or
 modern courts, few do so out of fear of the stigma of being labeled a bad wife. Fur-
 thermore, the majority of women are economically dependent, and to speak out is
 to risk immediate divorce by repudiation. Women s rights organizations report that
 prostitution is often the only economic alternative for a woman who wants to leave
 er husband.
 There were isolated incidents of violence against women attributed to religious
 motivation. Some extremists physically abused African women wearing Western
 clothing because a religious leader had blamed the failure of the rains on immoral
 women.
 Children.-The Government's responsibility to children is reflected in the Con-
 stitution which provides that the State's public services must be directed to promote
 the physical and moral health of the family, particularly the mother and children.
 The Government focuses its limited resources on programs which support women
 and children. In addition, public education through grade six is mandatory and free.
 Child labor is strictly limited by law.
 Cultural discrimination against females starts early. The vast majority of young
 girls are kept home to work. Only about 25 percent of children of primary school
 age actually attend school and about 60 percent of those finishing primary school
 are male. Young girls rarely get more than a few years of formal schooling. As a
 result, the male literacy rate is 18 percent; for females it is 7 percent. Families of
 young girls enter marriage agreements on the basis of which girls are sent at the
 age of 10 or 12 to join their husband's family under the tutelage of their mother-
 in-law.
 Female genital mutilation (circumcision) has been condemned by international
 health experts as dangerous to both physical and mental health. In Niger it is lim-
 ited to one small ethnic group.
 National/Racial /Ethnic Minorities. -Ethnic minorities-Tuareg, Fulani, Toubou,
 Kounouri, and Arab-assert that the far more numerous Hausa and Djerma ethnic
 groups discriminate against them. The new Government has attempted to address
 this issue by providing for greater representation in the National Assembly (see Sec-
 tion 3) and by other measures, such as providing schools and clinics in the remote
 
 
 arts of the country. Still, nomadic peoples-Tuaregs and many Fulani-continue to
 ave less access to government services, largely due to their nomadic way of life.
 The Hausa with about 50 percent of the population, and the Djerma with about 21
 percent are sedentary, mostly urbanized, peoples who have historically dominated
 commerce, the professions, and the civil service.
 People with Disabilities.-The Constitution charges the State with responsibility
 for the handicr.pped. In the formal economy, the handicapped (except occasionally
 those crippled by polio) are rarely employed. The education of those with special
 needs is beyond the means of an underfunded educational system. There is neither
 legislation mandating accessibility for the disabled nor the financial means to imple-
 ment such regulations.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The right of workers to establish and join trade
 unions has been practiced since the 1940's and is codified in the new 1992 Constitu-
 tion and in the Labor Code of 1962. However 90 percent of Niger's work force is
 employed in the largely subsistence agricultural sector, which is not unionized.
 In the industrial sector, the labor federation, the National Union of Nigerien
 Workers (USTN), comprises 42 unions representing about 70 percent of the 60,000
 salary and wage earners in Niger. The vast majority of its membership is made up
 of government employees, i.e., civil servants, teachers, and employees in state-owned
 corporations like the national electrical utility. The USTN and the Teachers Union
 (SNEN) have stated policies of political autonomy, but all unions have informal ties
 to political parties. Labor challenged the Government on a wide range of issues, no-
 tably in 1993 on the reductions in the government budget.
 Several unions representing professionals and high-level civil servants remain un-
 affiliated with the USTN. In addition, there are a hundred or more trade associa-
 tions which are required, like unions, to file their bylaws with the State and must
 refrain from overt affiliation with any political party.
 The Constitution provides for the right to strike. A minimum 3-day notice is re-
 quired, and the motives for the strike must be listed. The security forces and police
 are prohibited from striking. In 1993 the USTN called a series of strikes by public
 sector employees over back pay of up to 4 months. There were general strikes for
 2 days in June, 3 days in July, and 5 days in September. In the July and September
 strikes, the USTN also protested the Government's austerity budget and its planned
 deep cuts in civil service salaries. In the 5-day September strike, the USTN de-
 manded smaller salary cuts and a reduction in the number of ministerial portfolios.
 Late in the year, doctors and medical workers (all state employees) and the national
 electrical utility went on strike, each for a few days. All these strikes were legal,
 and the Government did not attempt to suppress the strikes or punish strikers. Em-
 ployer retribution against strikers is prohibited.
 By the end of 1993, the National Assembly delayed further consideration of a new
 labor code, including new provisions regarding civil servants' right to strike, until
 March 1994. Features of the draft law include: mandatory conciliation before a
 strike could be legal, 7 days' notice before a strike could begin, and docking pay for
 the days civil servants are on strike. Private sector workers already have their pay
 reduced for days out on strike.
 The USTN is a member of the Organization of African Trade Union Unity and
 abides by that organization's policy of having no formal affiliations outside the Afri-
 can continent. However, it enjoys assistance from some international unions, and in-
 dividual unions, such as the Teacher's Union, are affiliated with international trade
 secretariats.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-In addition to the Constitu-
 tion and the Labor Code, there is a Basic Framework Agreement, negotiated by the
 USTN's predecessor, employers, and the Government, which has been in force since
 1972. The Agreement defines all classes and categories of work, establishes basic
 conditions of work, and union activities. In the private, public, and state-owned en-
 terprise sectors, unions widely used their right to bargain collectively with manage-
 ment without government interference for wages over and above the statutoy mini-
 mums as well as for more favorable work conditions. Collective bargaining exists in
 the public sector. However, since most organized workers are government employ-
 ees, the Government is actually involved in most bargaining agreements. The US'IN
 represents all workers in the bargaining, and labor/management agreements are ap-
 plied uniformly to all employees.
 The Labor Code is based on International Labor Organization (ILO) principles
 and protects the right to organize and prohibits antiunion discrimination by employ-
 ers. Labor unions reported no such discrimination in 1993. A Ministry of [.4ibor oli.-
 cial acts as a binding arbitrator in certain circumstances defined by law, such as
 
 
 reductions in force or firing of a union delegate. In addition, the Government is in-
 volved in negotiations to resolve strikes.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, except for legally prosecuted prisoners.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Child labor in nonindustrial enter-
 prises is permitted by law under certain conditions. Children under 14 must obtain
 special authorization to work, and those aged 14 to 18 years are subject to limita-
 tion on hours (a maximum of 4.5 hours per day) and types of employment (no indus-
 trial work) so that schooling may continue. Employers are required by law to ensure
 minimum sanitary conditions for working children (and women).
 Law and practice prohibit child labor in industrial work. Child labor laws are en-
 forced by the labor inspections of the Ministry of Labor. In practice, child labor is
 practically nonexistent in the formal (wage) sector. Instead, economic necessity
 forces children to work in the unregulated agricultural, commercial, and artisanal
 sectors, usually for an immediate relative. Often the only alternative for urban chil-
 dren to working under Niger's difficult economic conditions is begging in the streets.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-A minimum wage for salaried workers of each
 class and category is established by law. The lowest minimum is about $70 (18,000
 CFA Francs) per month. Additional salary is granted for each family member and
 for such conditions of work as night shifts and required travel. The minimum wages
 are not sufficient to provide a decent living for workers and their families. Most
 households have multiple earners (largely i.formal commerce) and rely on the ex-
 tended family for support.
 The legal workweek is 40 hours. However, certain occupations involving irregular
 hours are authorized longer workweeks, with a maximum of 72 hours. The Labor
 Code also establishes occupational safety and health standards enforced by the Min-
 istry of Labor inspectors. Because of staff shortages, however, ins-ctors focus on
 safety violations in the mining, building, and industrial sectors. Although generally
 satisfied with the safety equipment provided by employers, citing in particular ade-
 quate protection from radiation in the uranium mines, unions say workers should
 be better informed on the risks posed by their jobs. Workers who remove themselves
 from dangerous work are likely to be fired, with no legal right to be reinstated.
