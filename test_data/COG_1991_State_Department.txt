 CONGO
 The Congo's political system changed dramatically in 1991 as
 the country ended decades of one-party, Marxist rule and
 installed a transitional government mandated to prepare the way
 for democratic, multiparty elections in 1992. Assuming
 sovereign powers, the National Conference, composed of some
 1,200 delegates from a broad cross-section of institutions,
 organizations, and social groups, met from February 25 to June
 10 to chart a new political course for the country. The
 National Conference permitted the President of the Republic,
 Denis Sassou Nguesso, to remain in office but with only
 ceremonial duties; elected Prime Minister Andre Milongo to
 serve as interim Head of Government; adopted the Fundamental
 Act, including a comprehensive bill of rights, to serve as an
 interim constitution; and elected a 153-member Superior Council
 of the Republic to serve as an interim legislative body.
 Shortly before the Conference, the 12-year-old regime of Sassou
 Nguesso had legalized political parties and had instituted a
 number of other democratic reforms, including freedom of
 speech, press, and assembly. A new constitution will be put up
 for referendum sometime in early 1992. At year's end, some 100
 political parties had begun their campaigns for local,
 legislative, and presidential elections scheduled for the first
 6 months of 1992.
 Formerly, the Congolese military was closely tied to the
 Congolese Workers Party (PCTY under the one-party regime. It
 was responsible along with the State Security Organization
 (DGSE) for internal security and suppressing dissident
 activity. High-ranking military officers held party positions,
 and party-designated "political officers" served at all levels
 of the military. In January these positions were abolished,
 and active membership in any political party became
 incompatible with holding a military commission. Throughout
 the National Conference the military played a neutril,
 apolitical role. It ensured the security of the conference
 hall and the delegates, but did not, as an organization,
 participate in the proceedings. The transition Government
 reorganized the country's security services and abolished the
 military-commanded DGSE, leaving the civilian police with
 responsibility for law enforcement and public order.
 The economy is highly dependent on petroleum earnings.
 Declining oil prices since 1985 have forced the Government to
 seek debt relief and cooperate with international institutions
 in implementing a long-term, austerity readjustment program,
 including a gradual shift toward a free market economy.
 Congo's economic difficulties were a major impetus for
 political and economic reform in 1991.
 The human rights situation improved significantly in 1991. The
 National Conference decisions, if effectively implemented, hold
 the potential for entrenching real democratic reform and the
 enjoyment of a broad array of civil and political liberties.
 However, early in 1992 units of the military seized control of
 parts of Brazzaville and demanded the replacement of Prime
 Minister Milongo, thus threatening the democratic transition.
 After several days of tension, the military returned to its
 barracks, the Prime Minister announced a cabinet reshuffle, and
 the provisional legislature set dates for elections. Human
 rights problems in 1991 included police beatings of detainees
 (a problem which has apparently not diminished during the
 transition period), harsh prison conditions, and documented
 reports of the existence of slavery in remote parts of the

 CONGO
 country.. In response to a large influx of people fleeing
 serious unrest in Zaire, the Government deported 10,000
 Zairians, including many who had been resident in the Congo for
 years.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of such killings authorized or condoned
 by the transition Government, or by the Congo's military or
 security forces.
 b.. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance.
 c.- Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The new Congolese bill of rights forbids the use of torture,
 and there were no reports of its use by the current
 Government. Justice in the Congo remains somewhat arbitrary:
 shopkeepers still beat marketplace thieves with impunity, and
 the local police reportedly still regularly beat detainees,
 especially those who allegedly'resist arrest.          -
 As the Government has officially acknowledged, prison
 conditions are bad. The prisons are old, and were never
 designed for long-term deteritions, since under French rule'
 convicted felons were sent out of the country. Between.30 to
 100 prisoners are currehtly kept in one large cell. They sleep
 on the floor and subsist on a single meal per day. There are
 no exercise or educational facilities, and medical care is
 rare. Women prisohers are kept separate from the men.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The new bill of rights forbids arbitrary arrest, detention, or
 exile. There is no'evidence that the interim Government has
 engaged in any of these practices.
 The current Code of Penal Procedure requires that a detainee be
 brought before a judge within 3 days and that a detainee must
 be charged or released within 3 months. However, these
 protections are frequently ignored in practice. The time
 between-arrest and trial can extend to years, with bail often
 denied arbitrarily. Official indifference and insufficient
 personnel to handle case loads are major factors in
 perpetuating these abuses.
 The Government does not use forced exile as a means of
 political 6ontrol. All voluntary exiles from the former regime
 have been invited to return. Some members of the previous
 government have gone into self-imposed exile rather than face
 prosecution for past crimes.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The court system continues to b6 modeled on the French system
 and consists, under the new Government, of three levels: local
 courts, courts of appeal, and the Supreme Court. All "special"
 
 
 CONGO
 courts have been abolished, as have secret trials. The accused
 has a right to a lawyer of his own choice, with the State
 paying the fees in cases of poverty.
 Judges are required to have a degree in judicial studies and,
 after due service on the bench, may be appointed by Parliament
 to a term on the Supreme Court. It is too early to estimate
 the degree of independence judges will be able to exercise.
 Congo's traditional courts still handle many local disputes,
 especially property cases. They operate in urban as well as
 rural areas. Many domestic disputes are also adjudicated
 within the context of the extended family.
 The present and future Governments are faced with the problem
 of coming to terms with the human rights abuses and economic
 crimes of the past. Several former high officials have already
 been sentenced to long jail terms for embezzlement.
 Prosecutions for human rights violations will probably not take
 place until an elected government is in power. Former
 officials suspected of crimes or civil rights abuses are not
 prevented from traveling abroad.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Current law requires a warrant for all searches and forbids the
 police to conduct searches during the hours of darkness. The
 Government has publicly announced that the police have limited
 powers and encourages people to insist on their rights. The
 secret police, which was formerly responsible for the
 surveillance of citizens antagonistic to the Government, has
 been disbanded. The new Government outlawed wiretapping and
 the maintenance of security files on citizens who have not been
 accused of violating the law.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The new bill of rights provides for complete freedom of
 expression. People on the street talk freely and are often
 quite critical of past and present political figures, something
 that was impossible a year ago.
 There is no longer an official government newspaper. It has
 been replaced by numerous private newspapers operating without
 hindrance. The broadcast media, radio and television, are
 still state owned, although the journalists belong to an
 independent union and are allowed to disagree on the air with
 government positions. To help eliminate the Marxist bias in
 the media, the Government transferred some state reporters
 hired by the old government, who-under Congolese law are almost
 impossible to discharge, to the provinces where they would have
 less influence on national politics. There are, in principle,
 no barriers besides economic ones to the establishment of
 private radio and television -services.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The new bill of rights guarantees the freedom to assemble and
 associate without government interference. Those wishing to
 hold public assemblies must inform the Minister of the
 Interior, who reserves the right to forbid assemblies inimical
 to public peace or welfare. In practice, permission was almost
 
 
 89
 CONGO
 never denied since the new Government came to power. The right
 of political parties to form was widely exercised. The single
 political party of the former government has been replaced by
 nearly 80 independent parties, which compete freely for members
 and office.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion; the people are free to join any
 church or practice any religion. Denominations not already
 established in the Congo (there were only seven allowed by the
 former government) must complete a rather cumbersome
 registration process. Local missionaries report no hindrance
 either before or after registration. According to the Ministry
 of the Interior, registratidn is for the sole purpose of
 granting legal status. The current Governmeit is in the
 process of returning church property confiscated by the former
 regime. Church leaders of the seven denominations recognized
 by the former regime were active in the National Conference and
 continue to play a role in the interim Government.
 The Tehovah's ,Witnesses, prohibited in previous years, are
 again active, and held a large public rally in 1991. As far as
 is known, the Government has not. restricted the activities of
 this group.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The new bill of rights grants freedom of movement both inside
 and outside the country,, and there are, in practice, no
 restrictions on travel. In contrast to the past, there were no
 reports of arbitrary, politically motivated denials of
 passports by the trinsition Government. The office-formerly
 responsible for controlling movement within the Congo has been
 abolished.
 The Congolese have'traditionally been hospitable to refugees,
 allowing them to enter, obtain work, and have access to
 government services on the same basis as Congolese citizens.
 The Go4ernment was especially helpful during the September and
 October evacuatidns from Zaire, setting up refugee processing
 centers for African and European evacuees-and providing food,
 shelter, and assistance with onward travel arrangements. The
 large influx of Zairians, however, strained this traditional
 policy, and, declaring the Zairians to be economic migrants,
 the Government forcibly deported about 10,000 Zairians,
 including many who had lived in the Congo for years.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens acting through the National Conference forced a
 peaceful change in government in 1991. The Conference
 abolished the old one-party system, set multiparty elections
 for 1992, and established a broadly based transitional
 Government headed by Prime Minister Milongo. If followed to
 completion, this process will result in a functioning democracy
 by the end of 1992, governed by a Prime Minister and a
 bicameral legislative body. Under the future constitution, the
 President of the Republic will almost certainly have more
 responsibility than the ceremonial duties now entrusted to
 President Sassou Nguesso. The proposed constitution has been
 published and awaits the upcoming referendum.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are several domestic human rights organizations, which
 include the National Committee on Human Rights, headed by Dr.
 Norbert Lamini (see Section 5), the Congolese Human Rights
 League, and a committee of the Congolese Association of Women
 Lawyers. All have criticized aspects of past government human
 rights practices.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based of Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The new bill of rights forbids all discrimination on any basis
 and requires equal pay for equal work. A small group of about
 7,000 Pygmies, who live in the northern forests, are isolated
 from the mainstream of Congolese life, but there is no official
 discrimination against them. However, missionaries report that
 nurses at some government medical centers frequently refuse to
 provide services to Pygmies. Congolese human rights activist
 Dr. Norbert Lamini reported finding "incontrovertible evidence"
 of the practice of traditional, ancestral slavery in parts of
 the Congo, especially the keeping of Pygmy slaves by Bantu
 farmers in the rural north of the country, around the district
 capital of Ouesso. Dr. Lamini also reported evidence of
 Bantu/Bantu slavery- in the port city of Pointe Noire.
 There is no officially sanctioned discrimination against women
 in the Congo, except in the area of adultery, which is legal
 for men, but not for women. Despite the lack of legal
 discrimination, there remains a large disparity between the
 salaries of men and women and in educational opportunities.
 According to a 1991 United Nations study, females receive only
 33 percent of the schooling males receive. Moreover, although
 several women have attained high official status, women in
 general often find themselves relegated to a secondary role in
 both urban and rural areas.
 Polygamy is legal and widely practiced, but a woman may, at a
 state-sponsored wedding, bind her future husband, with his
 agreement, to a monogamous marriage. An estimated 80 percent
 of urban women have the opportunity to choose monogamy. In the
 villages the figure is less than 20 percent. There are no
 statistics available concerning the percentage of polygamous or
 monogamous marriages. The husband, father, or other male head
 of family has considerable legal or actual control over the
 activities of female family members. Indeed, on the death of
 the husband, the wife is often lumped together with the
 husband's other moveable property and parceled out to the
 relatives. The husband's power is often moderated by the
 influence of the extended family.
 Anecdotal evidence suggests that violence against women,
 especially wife beating, is not uncommon, but there are no
 statistics available. Family violence against women is
 generally handled in the context of the extended family rather
 than in the formal judicial system. Female circumcision is not
 practiced among the Congolese. The new Government has not
 addressed the issue of violence against women.

 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The.Right of Association
 The Labor Code affirms the right of workers to associate
 freely, and there are no restrictions on the formation of trade
 unions. The right to join a union is also protected under
 Article 15 of the new Bill of Rights. The former single
 confederation, the Congolese Trade-Union Confederation (CSC),
 has lost its official status but is still the only umbrella
 organization in the country. The checkoff system which gave
 the CSC much of its power was abolished in June by Decree
 91-672 of the interim Government. After the CSC lost its
 monopoly status, numerous small unions based on employment
 interests were established. Unions may now freely form and
 join federations or confederations and affiliate with and
 participate in international trade union bodies. The new
 Congolese trade uniions have not yet contracted any formal
 internatlonal' affiliations, but a number of them cooperate with
 foreign,- usually French, counterparts.
 Unions are free to strike, but in theory a strike may not take
 place until after both parties, employer and union, have gone
 through a process of nonbinding arbitration under the auspices'
 of the.regional inspector of the Department of.Labor. The
 Government reserves the right to halt all strikes that are
 "inimical to the public order," a phrase which it currently
 interprets to mean "violent." There were several strikes in
 1991, especially in the oil sector. There were also brief
 transportation strikes and general strikes. Most of these
 occurred in Pointe Noire and took place without government
 interference.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The free union system is recent, and not all the methods of
 bargaining and mediation have yet been worked out. In the
 past, wages were determined by. agreement between the union,
 Unicongo (the employers' group), and the Ministry of Labor.
 The salary schedules were then published in one of the many
 "conventions" that exist for each industry.
 The unions are currently engaged in a common effort to
 accomplish three major goals: (1) gain higher wages; (2)
 tenure more categories of workers (making them extremely
 expensive to fire, even in cases of economic contraction); and
 (3) prevent the privatization of the old state monopolies.
 Goals one and two are part of every current bargaining
 session. These sessions are frequently tinged with violence;
 and several death threats against employers were reporte, in
 1991. The third goal is presently in abeyance as the State has
 not yet abolished any of its monopolies. However, this may
 become an issue after the June 1992 elections, when a popularly
 elected government is expected to begin promised restucturing
 of state-oVned enterprises.
 Differences between workers and employers are adjudicated in
 special labor courts jointly administered by the Departments of
 Justice and Labor, with oversight by the Supreme Court. These
 labor courts have jurisdiction over all labor issues, not just
 those involving unions.
 There are no special export processing zones in the Congo.
 
 
 92
 CONGO
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor, except as part of the penal process, is forbidden
 under the new bill of rights and is not currently practiced.
 Traditional forms of slavery, however, persist in parts of the
 country (see Section 5).
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment is 16. This is enforced only in
 the formal wage sector by the Ministry of Labor. Children
 often work at younger ages on family farms in the large
 subsistence agricultural sector.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Government sets a minimum wage, theoretically at a level
 that allows for "human dignity." In those trades subject to
 "conventions," (see Section 6.b.) the agreed upon minimum wages
 are all considerably higher than the legal minimum. However,
 even these wages are often quite low in comparison to the cost
 of living and many workers hold second jobs, practice
 subsistence agriculture, or receive help from the extended
 family. The Labor Code specifies not only reasonable pay, but
 also paid holidays, sick leave, overtime after 40 hours a week,
 and regular days of leisure. Health and safety standards are
 supposed to be enforced by twice yearly visits by officers from
 the Ministry of Labor. An informal survey suggests that the
 inspections are made but on a less than regular basis.
