 BELIZE
 Belize gained its independence from Great Britain on Septem-
 ber 21, 1981, and at that time a new constitution came
 into effect providing for a Westminster-model parliamentary
 democracy. The constitution makes specific commitments
 for the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of
 the individual in a democratic context regardless of race,
 creed, sex, or ownership of property. In this regard it
 further codifies the system of English common law and the
 colonial laws of Belize, which remain largely in effect.
 Belize has long been free of civil and political strife.
 Serious opposition-led civil disturbances in March-April
 1981, however, led the British governor to declare a state
 of emergency which lasted four weeks. Certain rights of
 assembly were temporarily curtailed.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is specifically prohibited by the constitution.
 There are no indications that it is practiced.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Such treatment and punishment are also prohibited by the
 constitution. Sentences are either by fine or by imprisonment.
 The prisons are old and, although overcrowded, efforts
 are made to lodge adults and juveniles separately. An
 adequate basic diet is provided. The death penalty, by
 hanging, is rarely invoked; a recent execution of a convicted
 criminal was the first in over five years.
 c. Disappearances
 There have been no reports of disappearances in Belize.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment
 and guarantees the right of habeas corpus. A person is
 entitled to be informed within 48 hours of the reasons
 for the arrest or detention and to be brought to a court
 within 72 hours. Release on bail is allowed for all but
 the most serious, violent criminal offenses.
 a. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty by
 the Belizean constitution. Criminal defendants are not
 compelled to give evidence at their own trials. Access
 to legal counsel is permitted, and a newly reactivated
 legal aid society provides legal counsel at little or no
 charge to indigent defendants. Court-appointed interpreters
 are provided when necessary at no charge. Public trials
 are required unless agreed to otherwise by all parties.
 These safeguards are reportedly respected in practice.
 Military courts have jurisdiction only over service-related
 offenses of personnel of the Belize defense force.

 f. Invasion of the Home
 Arbitrary search and entry are prohibited by the constitution.
 Search warrants are required. There have been no reports
 of violations.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The constitution specifically guarantees these freedoms,
 and they are respected in practice. They may be curtailed,
 ,however, during times of national emergency declared by
 the governor general or the national assembly in order
 to preserve public order. Brief states of emergency have
 been declared only twice -- in the aftermath of hurricane
 Hattie in 1961, and due to civil disturbances in March-
 April 1981. In the latter instance, only the right to
 assembly was curtailed, and a curfew imposed. Freedom
 of the press and speech was preserved.
 There is no television in Belize and only one radio station,
 which is government-controlled. A recent dialogue between
 the government and the opposition United Democratic Party
 led to the government's commitment to expand the scope
 of its radio coverage and to allow greater access for opposi-
 tion viewpoints.
 There is no state religion, and a variety of Christian
 and non-Christian denominations operate freely.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within Belize, on
 foreign travel or on emigration. Forced repatriation (except
 for the deportation of aliens) is unknown. Voluntary repatria-
 tion by Belizean nationals is unrestricted.
 Belize has been a traditional haven for refugees from neighbor-
 ing countries, as evidenced by the recent admission of
 more than 2,000 Salvadoran refugees.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 All citizens aged 18 and over are eligible to register
 and vote, and no group is denied the right to participate
 in political activity. Approximately 90 percent of the
 electorate voted fn the last general election.
 The opposition party has charged that fraud took place
 during the registration and balloting for the 1979 election,
 but these challenges were not upheld in the courts. The
 government recently agreed with the opposition to consider
 electoral reforms.
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 A human rights council was recently formed to provide informa-
 tion and to promote the observance of human rights in Belize.
 The council is reportedly affiliated with international
 human rights bodies. The government has indicated its
 intention to accede to all applicable human rights and
 refugee conventions. No international bodies have made
 
 
 348
 application to investigate the human rights situation in
 Belize.
 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 The government is committed to an active role in ensuring
 and promoting the economic and social well-being of its
 people. Great emphasis is placed in the government's program
 and budget on education and health. Education is universal
 and compulsory to age 16 and may be received in either
 state or church facilities. The literacy rate in 1960
 was 86.6 percent and is now claimed to be over 90 percent.
 The adjusted primary school enrollment ratio is approximately
 85 percent. These figures do not Vary significantly in
 rural and urban areas, nor on the basis of sex, race or
 socio-economic circumstance.
 Health care is provided by the governmeht, in addition
 to private physicians. Although nominal in cost, government
 medical facilities outside Belize City are widely dispersed,
 and are sometimes unable to provide for other than routine
 care. An estimated 80 percent of the population had access
 to safe water in 1970. Government health teams spray through-
 out the country to control malaria, dengue and yellow fever,
 once primary causes of death in Belize. Health and nutritional
 awareness is also strongly emphasized through campaigns
 to encourage breast feeding, to select appropriate meals
 from local produce and to create a rural cadre of primary
 health care practitioners. Life expectancy at birth is
 62 years; the infant mortality rate is 45 per 1,000 live
 births. These figures are again consistent for both rural
 and urban areas on a nondiscriminatory basis.
 Per capita gross national product in 1979 was $950. Wage
 earners received an average weekly wage of about $45.
 Income is distributed somewhat unevenly, with approximately
 30 percent of the population living on a subsistence level
 of less than $15 per week, and about 25 percent earning
 more than $80 per week. Few, if any, are at or below the
 absolute poverty level. Wage increases in both the private
 and public sectors have appproximated the pace of inflation
 -- 15 to 18 percent in recent years -- but have not adequately
 compensated for the even greater increases in the costs
 of imported goods. Price controls are maintained on basic
 foodstuffs. Economic growth has been about two percent
 annually since 1977, insufficient to provide enough job
 opportunities for the growing population. The gross population
 growth rate has been about four percent annually in recent
 years. The net population growth rate is reduced to 1.9
 percent by emigration, primarily to the United States,
 in search of greater economic opportunities. Overall unemploy-
 ment is about eight percent, but unemployment and underemploy-
 ment are considerably higher in Belize City, which contains
 one-third of the country's 145,000 people. Unemployment
 in other areas of Belize is about three to four percent,
 with negligible underemployment.
 The average number of persons housed per room in 1960 was
 1.9.
 Labor laws safeguard the rights of the employee, and they
 include the right to organize and strike, which have been
 successfully utilized. A new social security system for
 employees was introduced in June 1981. Economic opportunities
 exist primarily in the agricultural sector, given Belize's
 limited industrial base and manufacturing sector. Consequently,
 
 
 349
 opportunities for skilled professionals, such as technicians,
 engineers and accountants, are limited. The government's
 development plan for 1980-83 calls for large-scale investment
 to-develop and expand the agricultural sector. Private
 ownership.of land for small farming in the undeveloped
 interior is also encouraged.
 To upgrade the status of women, the government of Belize
 established a women's bureau within the ministry of labor
 in April 1981. At present the bureau is partially financed
 by the United Nations, but in two years it is to be fully
 funded by the government. In a short time, the women's
 bureau has established a commendable-record of achievement.
 Although women are not proportionally represented in the
 1government, the office of governor general is held by a
 distinguished woman educator. Women hold one deputy cabinet
 level position and two seats in the.26-member legislature.
