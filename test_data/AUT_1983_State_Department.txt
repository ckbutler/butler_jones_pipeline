 AUSTRIA
 Austria has been a parliamentary democracy since the end of
 World War II. Elections are free and participation is high. It
 is relatively easy for a newly founded political party to
 contest elections at the Federal, state, and local levels.
 During 1983, Austria went to the polls to elect a new lower
 House of Parliament. The Socialist Party lost its majority
 position in the Parliament and was obliged to form a coalition
 government with the Freedom Party, a liberal party in the
 European sense. The People's Party (a conservative party with
 connections to the Catholic Church) remained in opposition.
 Some controversy arose during 1983 over the participation in the
 election campaign of a party known as the "stop foreigners
 movement" (Ausleender Halt Bewegung). Some maintained that the
 party was in essence a neo-Nazi organization. Despite
 objections in some quarters, the party contested the election in
 Vienna only and received 3,315 votes, about .08 percent of the
 total.
 Illiteracy is virtually unknown in Austria, and the country as a
 whole enjoys a high standard of living and a highly developed
 economy. The country has a strong Christian (Catholic)
 tradition, but other religious groups are able to practice
 without interference. Recent governments have made a conscious
 effort to eliminate clauses in laws which tend to discriminate
 against women. While the traditional role of women within the
 family remains, women are entering the work force in increasing
 numbers and have made substantial progress toward equality. The
 legal and medical professions in particular have attracted many
 women in recent years.
 An Austrian Foreign Service officer, Dr. Kurt Herndl, serves as
 the director of the U.N. Subcommission for Human Rights. The
 Austrian police provide citizens with protection from criminal
 elements and are not known to have committed human rights
 violations. The 1983 human rights situation in Austria was
 essentially unchanged from the situation which prevailed in
 previous years.
 Since World War II, Austria has served as a country of first
 asylum for refugees from Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
 Although this activity has at times proved to be a financial
 burden, Austria continues to fulfill this function, albeit in
 1983 at a reduced level. Jewish emigrants from the Soviet Union
 generally transit Austria en route to countries of final
 settlement.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Article II of the European Convention for the Protection of
 Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (subsequently referred to
 simply as the "European Convention" in this report) is an
 integral part of the Austrian Constitution. There were no
 reports in 1983 of politically motivated killings either by
 government authorities, opposition, or terrorist groups.
 (922)
 
 
 923
 b. Disappearance
 There were no abductions by authorities during the reporting
 period. The only apparently politically motivated abduction was
 the hijacking of an Air France airliner by four Arab terrorists
 on a flight from Vienna to Paris. The episode ended with the
 surrender of the terrorists to Iranian authorities in Tehran.
 No injuries or deaths resulted from this incident. The apparent
 objective of the terrorists was to demand the release of
 Lebanese citizens imprisoned in France and a curtailment of
 French military aid to Iraq, Chad, and Lebanon. There has been
 some speculation that the hijackers were closely linked to the
 Iranian Embassy in Vienna, but there has been no proof of this
 allegation.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture in Austria was originally banned in 1776 by imperial
 decree. Article III of the European Convention also prohibits
 torture and has been incorporated into the Austrian
 Constitution. There is no evidence of any violation of this
 provision.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Austrian Constitution prohibits arbitrary detention or
 exile. The law provides for investigative detention for 72
 hours by which time an investigative judge must decide on the
 legality of the detention. Provided the investigative judge
 agrees, the accused can be held in detention pending completion
 of an investigation for up to a maximum of two years. Grounds
 for investigative detention are enumerated in the law, as are
 conditions for release on bail. A law which went into effect on
 July 1, 1983, reforms the provisions concerning detention by
 shortening pretrial procedures, restricting the number of
 detentions except in the case of persons who have or are alleged
 to have committed major crimes, and providing better legal
 protection for the detainees. There are no allegations that
 these provisions for investigative detention have been violated.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair, public trial is guaranteed by the Constitution as well as
 by Article VI of the European Convention, which has been
 formally incorporated into the Austrian Constitution. Austrian
 law provides for an independent judiciary and specifies the
 principle of public trials. There has been some public
 criticism of a provision which requires public prosecutors to
 act on instructions of the Ministry of Justice. Some feel that
 this provision might lead to the polarization of the prosecution
 process. There have been no reports of such abuses, however.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by the
 Constitution as well as by Article VIII of the European
 Convention. A judge may issue search warrants for entry of a
 private residence. No warrant is needed in case of public
 hazard or of a fugitive from justice.
 
 
 924
 Constitutional provisions also protect the secrecy of the mail
 and telephone.
 A 1978 law provides for the protection of personal data
 collected, processed, or transmitted by Government agencies,
 public institutions, and private entities.
 Family life in Austria is highly respected. There is no effort
 by the Government to monitor or control family life.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedoms of speech and press are guaranteed by the Constitution
 and by Article X of the European Convention. Austria has a
 free, independent, and multifaceted press. It is possible,
 however, to have publications removed from circulation if they
 violate legal provisions concerning morality or public
 security. As a matter of practice, such cases are extremely
 rare.  Opposition viewpoints are given wide attention in
 Austrian publications. Austria's well-established democratic
 political system, its active and independent press, and its
 effective judiciary combine to assure continued freedoms of
 speech and press.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Article XII of the 1667 Constitutional Law and Article XI of the
 European Convention guarantee freedom of assembly and
 association. Both of these articles have been incorporated into
 the Austrian Constitution. The Austrian State Treaty of 1955
 provides an exception to this principle in the case of Nazi
 organizations and activities. The Constitutional Law of 1945
 prohibits Nazi organizations. The law on the formation of
 associations stipulates that permission to form an association
 may be denied if it is apparent that the organization will
 pureue the illegal activities of a prohibited organization.
 Prior to the 1983 parliamentary elections, there was
 considerable discussion of whether rightwing parties should be
 permitted to participate in the electoral process. According to
 the law on political parties, such groupings cannot be
 prohibited if they are already in existence. Austria's
 political left demanded a reform of the law to make it possible
 to prohibit such parties if they espouse Nazi-like policies and
 programs. The Government did not attempt to amend the law, and
 the party in question, the Auslaender Halt Bewegung, received
 minimal support in Vienna, the only district in which it
 contested the election.
 Public demonstrations require a permit by the police
 authorities. In processing such applications the police may
 consider only the public safety aspect of the proposed
 demonstration and not its political purpose. Permits are
 routinely issued.
 Trade unions in Austria have an important voice in the country's
 political life due to their role in the social partnership, an
 unofficial system by which Austria's economic policies are
 determined by labor and management representatives. Labor is
 organized in 15 national unions, each of which is a member of
 
 
 925
 the Austrian Trade Union Federation. This organization has a
 strong, centralized leadership structure. Individual unions and
 the Federation are independent of government or political party
 control. Unions have the right to organize workers, tc
 negotiate wage agreements, and to strike, although as a
 practical matter strikes in Austria during the postwar period
 have been rare. Two members of the present Cabinet are
 presidents of national unions, and the president cf the lower
 House of Parliament also serves as the president of the
 Federation. Nearly 60 percent cf the work force is organized in
 trade unions. The Federation is a member of the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions and also provides the worker
 delegate for Austria's International Labor Organization
 delegation.
 By law, most employees must be members of the Chambers of
 Labor. This organization, which is unique to Austria,
 represents workers' interests vis-a-vis the Government, whereas
 the unions represent the workers vis-a-vis the employers. The
 leadership of the trade unions as well as of the Chambers of
 Labor is elected through democratic balloting. A large number
 of trade associations and other professional groupings are
 further testimony to freedom of association in Austria.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 This right is guaranteed by the Constitution and by Article IX
 of the European Convention, both of which form part of the
 Austrian Constitution. Article 63 of the Treaty of St. Germain,
 which is also a constitutional provision, restricts this freedom
 to the practice of religions which are compatible with public
 safety and morality. Eighty-five percent of the Austrian
 population is Roman Catholic. In order to qualify as a
 recognized religious organization under Austrian law, religious
 groups register with the Government. Most of the world's major
 religions are represented in Austria. A Buddhist pagoda was
 opened in Vienna in 1983. Despite its dominant position in the
 country, the political influence of the Catholic Church has
 steadily diminished since 1945 and is no longer considered a
 major political force.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions concerning freedom of movement within
 the country or the right to change residence or workplace.
 Austrian residents are free to travel or to emigrate. Citizens
 who have left the country have the right to return. No area of
 the country is closed to travel. Austria serves as a country of
 first asylum for refugees from Eastern Europe and the Soviet
 Union. The Government of Austria imposed recently visa
 requirements for most countries of Eastern Europe, making it
 somewhat more difficult for an intending refugee to obtain
 admission to the country. Once in Austria, refugees are not
 forcibly returned to their homelands.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Austria is governed through a parliamentary system. Under the
 Constitution elections must be held at least every four years.
 The 1983 national elections resulted in a change of government
 
 
 926
 in Austria. The Socialist Party lost its absolute majority in
 the Parliament and went into coalition with the Freedom Party.
 Several splinter groups also contested the election, including
 the Communist Party, but they did not receive sufficient support
 to elect candidates to the Parliament.
 Article VIII of the Austrian State Treaty states that Austria
 shall be ruled by a government based on secret, democratic
 elections.                      /
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No charges of human rights violations were brought by
 international or non-governmental organizations during 1983.
 Austria's first report on human rights under the International
 Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to the U.N. Human Rights
 Committee in 1983 was only briefly discussed and was essentially
 noncontroversial. Austria recognizes the competence of the
 human rights commission in Strasbourg for executing the European
 Convention. Austria concerns itself extensively with
 international human rights matters. Representatives of
 oppressed groups frequently visit Austria and meet with
 government officials and political leaders to explain the
 positions of their groups. For example, during 1983 groups from
 Turkey, Uganda, and several Latin American countries held
 various meetings in Austria about the human rights situations in
 these countries. Because of Austria's geographic positicn, such
 meetings frequently focus on the human rights situation in
 Eastern Europe. As an example, the World Congress on Psychiatry
 met in Vienna in 1983.
 Amnesty International is the major non-governmental human rights
 organization active in Austria. Freedom House rates the country
 "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Austria has an extensive public welfare program, the benefits of
 which are available to all citizens on a nondiscriminatory
 basis. These programs provide pensions for the retired, health
 benefits, and payments during periods of unemployment. The
 literacy rate of Austria's 7,574,000 (1983) population is nearly
 100 percent. The work force is highly skilled, producing a per
 capita gross national product of $10,270.90 (1981). Life
 expectancy at birth was 72.36 years in 1980. The infant
 mortality rate in 1983 was 12.7 per 1,000.
 Women participate fully in the electoral process and constitute
 53 percent of the Austrian electorate. De facto discrimination
 against women still exists in the political, social, and labor
 fields despite legislation enacted in 1977 and 1979 to reform
 the Family Law, thereby improving the situation of mothers and
 wives, and the Equality Law, which outlaws discrimination
 against women through unequal pay. Government statistics show
 men's earnings to be one-third higher than those of women with
 equal training and education. While 65 percent of male
 employees are promoted at least once in their careers, this is
 true for only 48 percent of women. The women's organizations
 within the established political parties remain the most
 important forums for women activists. Since 1979 two state
 secretaries--both women--have been responsible for women's
 issues within the Government.
 Population growth rate is only .01 percent. The overall primary
 school enrollment ratio was 99 percent in 1979 (99 percent for
 males and 98 percent for females). The calorie supply as a
 percent of normal requirements was 134.55 in 1977.
