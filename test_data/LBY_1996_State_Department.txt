 LBYA*
 The Great Socialist People's Libyan Aii6Jamahiriya is a dictatorship ruled by
 Colonel Mu'ammar AI-Qadhafi (the "Brother Leader and Guide of the Revolution7)
 who is aided by extragovernmental Revolutionary Committees and a Comrades Or-
 ganization. Libya's governing principlea are expressed in Qadhafi's "Green Book."
 Bor     g from Islamic andpan-Ab ideas, Qadafi has created a political system
 that purports to establish a "third wary superior to capitalism and Communism. He
 uses extrajudical killings and intimidation to control the opposition abroad and sum-
 maryjudcia prceeing tosuppress it at home. The Government exercises tight
 conto overethnicminorities, such as Berbers, and continues to repress banned Is-
 lamic grups.
 Colonel Qadhafi publicly called for violence against opponents of his regime after
 violent clashes between Islamic activists and security forces in Benghazi in Septem-
 ber 1995. Outbreaks of violence continued between government farces and Muslim
 militants. Two serious prison mutinies occurred in the past year, causing more
 bloodshed and prompting the Government to conduct intense military operations
 against suspected oppositionists.
 Libya maintains an extensive security apparatus, consisting of several elite mili-
 tary units, including Qadhafi's personal bodyguards; local Revolutionary Commit-
 tees; and People's Committees; as well as the newly formed 'Purification" Commit-
 tees. The result is a multilayered, pervasive surveillance system that monitors and
 controls the activities of individuals. The various security forces committed numer-
 ous serious human rights abuses.
 The Government dominates the economy through complete control of the country's
 oil resources, the principal source of foreign exchange. It uses part of the oil income
 for development, but much income has been lost to waste, corruption, and attempts
 to develop weapons of mass destruction.
 The human rights situation is poor. Citizens do not have the right to change their
 government. Security forces arbitrarily arrest, detain, and torture prisoners during
 interrogations or for punishment. The Government restricts the freedoms of speech,
 press, assembly, association, and religion. The Government also restricts basic work-
 er rights. Citizens do not have the right to a fair public trial, to be represented by
 legal counsel, to be secure in their homes or persons, or to own private property.
 Prison conditions are poor, and many political detainees are held or years without
 charge. Although there were no reports of mass expulsions of foreign workers and
 residents in 1996, the regime threatened to expel thousands of Palestinian residents
 in May. Traditional attitudes and practices continue to discriminate against women,
 and the Government discriminates against minorities. Female genital mutilation is
 still practiced in remote tribal areas.
 Libya continues to be subject to economic and diplomatic sanctions imposed by the
 U.N. Security Council in connection with the bombings of Pan Am flight 103 over
 Scotland in 1988 and the bombing of UTA flight 772 over Chad in 1989. The Gov-
 ernment took only limited steps to address the U.N. Security Council resolutions
 concerning the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 and UTA flight 722.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Violent clashes between the security
 forces and militant Islamist opposition groups increased during the year. The clash-
 es were predominantly concentrated in the eastern region of Libya and by some esti-
 mates, resulted in 600 deaths and 800 wounded during the year.
 In response to numerous attacs against the regime and a prison mutiny in
 Benghazi, the Government tightened security measures, made hundreds of arrests,
 and conducted an intense military campaign in the areas where insurrection oc-
 *The United States has no offidal presence in Libya. Information on the human rights situa-
 tion is thereire limited.

 curred. Government forces killed a number of people, but there were no definitive
 estimates of the total killed in these government attacks. On July 12, the Govern-
 ment officially stated that the actions were military exercises and operations against
 drug traffickers.
 The Government officially admitted that 8 people died and 39 were injured as a
 result of a July 9 riot that broke out in Tripoli after Qadhafi family bodyguards
 fired upon spectators at a soccer game who were shouting anti-Qadhafi slogans (see
 Section 2.b.). There were reports of up to 50 deaths, caused by the gunfire and the
 resulting crowd stampede.
 Security forces killed an undetermined number of persons while suppressing a
 prison mutiny that broke out on July 5 (see Section 1.c.).
 Qadhafi uses extrajudicial killing and intimidation to control the opposition
 abroad, and summary judicial proceedings to suppress domestic dissent. There have
 been reports of Libyan security forces hunting down and eliminating dissidents liv-
 ing abroad.
 A large number of offenses, including political offenses and "economic crimes," are
 punishable by death. A 1972 law mandates the death penalty for any person associ-
 ated with a group opposed to the principles of the revolution. Despite his longstand-
 ing stated intention, Qadhafi has not acted to abolish the death penalty for this of-
 fense. On July 15, a new law went into effect that applies the death penalty to those
 who speculate in foreign currency, food, clothes, or -housing during a state of war
 or blockade and for crimes related to drugs and alcohol.
 Islamic factions reportedly made one failed coup attempt, two failed assassination
 attempts on Qadhafi, and mounted three major attacks on Libyan security forces.
 The first major attack came on June 22, when 8 Libyan policemen were shot and
 killed by members of the Libyan Islamic Group at a training center near the city
 of Dirnah. On July 19 Muslim militants killed 26 members of an army convoy, and
 in mid-August 13 soldiers and one of Qadhafi's bodyguards were killed in attacks
 in the areas of Tripoli and Benghazi. An estimated 400 Islamic fundamentalists es-
 caped from the A-Kawaflyalh prison near Benghazi on March 24 and fled to the
 mountain region of Dirnah, where they clashed with security forces for several days.
 Libya continues to be subject to economic and diplomatic sanctions imposed by the
 U.N. Security Council in connection with the bombings of Pan Am flight 103 over
 Scotland in 1988 which klled 259 people on bard an d 11 people on the ground and
 the bombing of UTA flight 772 over Chad in 1989 which killed 171 people. These
 sanctions reqire that ibya fulfll the following onditions: ensure the appearance
 in a US. or Scottish court of those charged in the Pame Am 103 case; cooperate with
 Us ., British, and French investig ations into the Pan Am and UTA bombings; com-
 pensate the victims of Pan Am 103; and renounce terrorism and support for terror-
 ism.
 The Government took limited steps to address the U.N. Security Council resolu-
 tions concerning the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 and UTA flight 722. On March
 23, Qadhafi wrote a letter to French President Chirac pledgcooperation in re-
 solving the UTA bombing short of extraditing the suspects (which is against Libyan
 law) or coimpromising Libya's sovereignty. France's chief antiterrorism magistrate,
 Jean-Louis Brugiuere, visited Libya in an effort to investigate the incident and was
 expected to issue international arrest warrants for two suspects, bringing to six the
 number that he said he would prosecute. He indicated that the suspects would be
 tried without being present in court. Press reports identified the suspects as Libyan
 intelligence officials Abdesslam Issa Shibari, Abdesslam  Hamouda, and Abadallah
 Senousi (brother-in-law of Qadhafi); Libyan diplomat Abdullah Elazragh; and intel-
 ligence operatives Ibrahim Naeli and Musbah Arbas.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 The 1993 disappearance from Cairo of Libyan dissident Mansour Kikhia remained
 unresolved.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although Libya is aparty to the U.N. Convention against Torture and Other Cruel,
 Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, security personnel reportedly
 torture prisoners during interrogations or for punishment. Government agents peri-
 odically detain and reportedly torture foreign workers, particularly those from sub-
 Saharan Africa. Torture reports are difficult to corroborate because many prisoners
 are held incommunicado.
 Methods of torture reportedly include: chaining to a wall for hours; clubbing, elec-
 tric shock; the application of corkscrews in the back; lemon juice in open wounds;
 breaking fingers and allowing the joints to heal without medical care; suffocation
 by plastic bags; deprivation of food and water; and beatings on the soles of the feet.
 The law calls for fines against any official using excessive force, but there are no
 known cases of prosecution for torture or abuse.
 
 
 1338
 There is insufficient information to make a determination on overall prison condi-
 tions, but a mutiny on July 5 at the Abu Salim prison was caused by inmates pro-
 testing poor conditions. The prisoners went on a hunger strike and captured guards
 to protest the lack of medical care, overcrowding, and inadequate hygiene and diet
 provided at the facility. Security units were dispatched to suppress the uprising, and
 hundreds of people were left dead after the week-long incident, as many as 100 of
 them killed by security forces.
 The Government does not permit prison visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-By law the Government may hold detain-
 ees incommunicado for unlimited periods. It holds many political detainees incom-
 municado in unofficial detention centers controlled by members of the Revolutionary
 Committees. Thousands of political detainees, many associated with banned Islamic
 groups, are reported to be held in prisons throughout Libya. Many have been held
 for years without charge. Thousands of other detainees may have been held for peri-
 ods too brief (3 to 4 months) to permit confirmation by outside observers.
 Security forces intensified the campaign to arrest suspected members and sym-
 pathizers of banned Islamic groups and to monitor activities at mosques following
 numerous violent clashes. Some practicing Muslims have shaved their beards to
 avoid harassment from security services. Qadhafi has publicly denounced Libyan
 "mujaheddin" (generally, conservative Islamic activists who fought with the Afghan
 resistance movement against Soviet forces) as threats to the regime.
 The Purge Law of 1994 was established to fight financial corruption, black
 marketeering, drug trafficking, and atheism. Since the enforcement of the Purge
 Law began in June by the "Purification" Committees, scores of businessmen, trad-
 ers, and shop owners have been arbitrarily arrested and dozens of shops and firms
 have been closed on charges of corruption, dealing in foreign goods, and funding Is-
 lamic fundamentalist groups. As part of the campaign to implement the Purge Law,
 the wealth of the middle class and affluent have been targeted as well (see Section
 1.f.).
 The Government does not impose exile as a form of punishment; to the contrary,
 Qadhafi seeks to pressure Libyans working or studying abroad to return home. The
 Government arbitrarily expels noncitizens (see Section 6.e.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is not independent of the Govern-
 ment. There are four levels of courts: summary courts, which try petty offenses; the
 courts of first instance, which try more serious crimes; the courts of appeal; and the
 Supreme Court, which is the final appellate level. The private practice of law is ille-
 gal; all lawyers must be members of the Secretariat of Justice.
 Special revolutionary courts were established in 1980 to try political offenses.
 Such trials are often held in secret or even in the absence of the accused. In other
 cases, the security forces have the power to pass sentences without trial, especially
 in cases involving political opposition. In the past, Qadhafi has incited local cadres
 to take extrajudicial action against suspected opponents.
 According to Amnesty International, approximately 22 persons were convicted and
 imprisoned for political offenses during 1995.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government does not respect the right to privacy. Security agencies often disregard
 the legal requirement to obtain warrants before entering a private home. They also
 routinely monitor telephone calls.
 The security agencies and the Revolutionary Committees oversee an extensive in-
 formant network. Libyan exiles report that family ties to suspected regime oppo-
 nents may result in government harassment and detention. The Government may
 seize and destroy property belonging to "enemies of the people" or to those who "co-
 operate" with foreign powers. In the past, citizens have reported that Qadhafi has
 warned members of the extended family of any regime opponent that they risk the
 death penalty.
 The Purge Law of 1994 provides for the confiscation of private assets above a
 nominal amount, describing wealth in excess of such an undetermined nominal
 amount as the fruits of exploitation or corruption. In May Qadhafi ordered the for-
 mation of hundreds of "Purge" or "Purification" Committees composed of young mili-
 tary officers and students. The Committees, backed by thousands of Revolutionary
 Committees, implement the Purge Law. The "Purification" Committees began to en-
 force the Law in June and reportedly seized some "excessive" amounts of private
 wealth from the middle and affluent classes in Libya. The confiscated property was
 taken from the rich to be given to the poor, in an effort to appease the populace
 and to strengthen Qadhafi's power and control over the country.
 
 
 1339
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The authorities tolerate some difference of opin-
 ion in People's Committee meetings and at the General People's Congress, but in
 general severely limit freedom of speech. This is especially true with regard to criti-
 cism of Qadhafi or his regime. Infrequent criticism of political leaders and policies
 in the state-controlled media is interpreted as a government attempt to test public
 opiMon, or weaken a government figure who may be a potential challenger to Qa-
 The regime restricts freedom of speech in several ways: By prohibiting all political
 activities not officially approved, by enacting laws so vague that many forms of
 speech or expression may be interpreted as illegal; and by operating a pervasive sys-
 tem of informants that creates an atmosphere of mistrust at all levels of society.
 The State owns and controls the media. There is a state-run daily newspaper, Al-
 Shams, with a circulation of 40,000. Local Revolutionary Committees publish sev-
 eral smaller newspapers. The official news agency, JANA, is the designated conduit
 for official views. The regime does not permit the publication of opinions contrary
 to government policy. Such foreign publications as Newsweek, Time, the Inter-
 national Herald Tribune, Express, and Jeune Afrique are available, but authorities
 routinely censor them and may prohibit their entry onto the market.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Public assembly is permitted
 only with regime approval and in support of the regime's positions.
 Despite these restrictions, members of the Warfalla tribe staged several informal
 protests in 1995 to protest the regime's decision to carry out the death penalty
 against tribe members involved in the 1993 coup attempt. The Government re-
 sponded by arresting hundreds of tribe members and expelling others from the mili-
 tary and security forces. The death sentences had not been carried out by year's
 enu.
 A rare display of public discontent and resentment towards the Government oc-
 curred when a riot broke out during a soccer match in Tripoli on July 9. The unrest
 began when a contentious goal was scored by the team that Qadhafi's sons sup-
 ported and the referee called the play in their team's favor. The spectators report-
 edly started chanting anti-Qadhafi slogans after the referee made the call and Qa-
 dhafis sons and their bodyguards opened fire in the air, then on the crowd. The
 spectators panicked and stampeded out of the stadium and into the streets, where
 they stoned cars and chanted more anti-Qadhafi slogans. The Government officially
 admitted that 8 people died and 39 were injured as a result of the soccer riots, but
 there were reports of up to 50 deaths, caused by the gunfire and the stampede of
 the crowd.
 The Government limits the right of association; it grants such a right only to in-
 stitutions affiliated with the regime. According to a 1972 law, political activity found
 by the authorities to be treasonous is punishable by death. An offense may include
 any activity that is "opposed * * * to the principles of the Revolution."
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Libya is overwhelmingly Muslim. In an apparent effort
 to eliminate all alternative power bases, the regime has banned the once powerful
 Sanusiyya Islamic sect. In its place, Qadhafi established the Islamic Call Society
 (ICS), which is the outlet for state-approved religion as well as a tool for exporting
 the Libyan revolution. In 1992 the Government announced that the ICS would be
 disbanded; however, its director still conducts activities, suggesting that the organi-
 zation remains operational. Islamic groups at variance with the state-approved
 teaching of Islam are banned.
 Members of some minority religions are allowed to conduct services. Services in
 Christian churches are attended by the foreign community. A resident Catholic bish-
 op, aided by a small number of priests, operates two churches.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government imposed blockades on many cities in eastern Libya in
 reaction to the Islamic rebel attacks on military and police forces and the prison
 mutiny in Benghazi. The Government usually does not restrict the internal move-
 ment of Libyan citizens, except in the security areas. It requires exit permits for
 travel abroad and limits access to hard currency. A woman must have her husband's
 permission to travel abroad. Authorities routinely seize the passports of foreigners
 married to Libyan citizens upon their entry into Libya.
 The right of return exists. In fact, the regime often calls on students, many of
 whom receive a government subsidy, and others working abroad to return to Libya
 on little or no notice. Students studying abroad are interrogated upon their return.
 Some citizens, including exiled opposition figures, refuse to return. There have been
 reports of Libyan security forces hunting down and eliminating dissidents living
 abroad (see Section 1.a.).
 
 
 1340
 In September 1995, the Government expelled approximately 1,000 Palestinian
 residents to signal its displeasure with the signing of the Interim Agreement be-
 tween Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization. The Palestinians were
 forced to live in makeshift camps along the Egyptian border. The Government al-
 lowed the Palestinians living in the border camps to return to Libya, but over 200
 Palestinians elected to remain, hoping to travel to the West Bank and Gaza or reset-
 tle in Egypt. The Governments of Libya, Egypt, and Israel refused to accept the Pal-
 estinian refugees, leaving them stranded in the deteriorating and squalid conditions
 of the temporary border encampments.
 The Government threatened to expel thousands of Palestinian residents and
 workers in May and distributed questionnaires to identify and locate Palestinian
 residents. However, it did not act on the threat or undertake the mass expulsions
 of foreigners (see Section 6.e.).
 The Government is not a signatory to the 1951 United Nations Convention relat-
 ing to the Status of Refugees or the 1967 Protocol and, therefore does not grant
 asylum, first asylum, or refugee status to foreigners in Libya. The UN. High Com-
 missioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported that by April 1996 there were over 3,000
 refugees of concern to the UNHCR in Libya, including some 2,000 Somalis, 750 Eri-
 treans, 325 Sudanese, and 300 Ethiopians. The Government officially contacted the
 UNHCR Liaison Officer in Tripoli in 1995 in an effort to facilitate the repatriation
 of Arab and African refugees to their country of origin. The UNUCR assisted in the
 repatriation of 168 Eritreans and 129 Ethiopians in the first 4 months of 1996.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government. Major government de-
 cisions are controlled by Qadhafi, his close associates, and committees acting in his
 name. Political parties are banned. Qadhafi appoints military officers and official
 functionaries down to junior levels. Corruption and favoritism, partially based on
 tribal origin, are major problems, adversely affecting government efficieny.
 In theory political participation is guaranteed by the grassroots People s Commit-
 tees, which send representatives annually to the national General People's Congress
 (GPC). In practice the GPC is a rubber stamp that approves all recommendations
 made by Qadhafi.
 Qadhafi established the Revolutionary Committees in 1977. These bodies are com-
 posed mostly of Libyan youths who are charged with guarding against political devi-
 ation. Some Committees have engaged in show trials of regime opponents; in other
 cases, they have been implicated with killing opponents abroad. Te Committees ap-
 prove all candidates in elections for the GPC.
 There is no reliable information on the representation of women and minorities
 in the Government.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The regime prohibits the establishment of independent human rights organiza-
 tions. It created the Libyan Arab Human Rights Committee in 1989, but the Com-
 mittee has not published any known reports.
 The regime does not respond substantively to appeals from Amnesty International
 (Al) on behalf of detainees. In 1994 the regime described AI as a tool of Western
 interests and dismissed its work as neocolonialist. AI representatives last visited
 Libya in 1988.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-There is little information on the extent of violence against women. In
 general the intervention of neighbors and extended family members tends to limit
 the prevalence and scope of such violence. Abuse within the family is rarely dis-
 cussed publicly, due to the value attached to privacy in this traditional society. Liby-
 ans have been implicated in the purchasing of Sudanese slaves (see Section 6.c.).
 Women were granted equal status under law by the Constitutional Proclamation
 in 1969. Despite this legal provision of equality, many traditional attitudes and
 practices continue to discriminate against women. A woman must have her hus-
 band's permission to travel abroad (see Section 2.d.).
 Most observers agree that, with the advent of oil wealth in the 1970's, women
 have made notable social progress. Oil wealth, urbanization, development plans,
 education programs, and even the impetus behind Qadhafi's revolutionary Govern-
 ment have contributed to the creation of new employment opportunities for women.
 In recent years, a growing sense of individualism in some segments of society, espe-
 cially among the educated young, has been noted. For example many educated
 
 
 1341
 young couples prefer to set up their own households, rather than move in with their
 parents, and view pQlygyny with scorn. Since the 1970's, the level of educational dif-
 ferences between men and women has continued to narrow.
 In general the emancipation of women is a generational phenomenon: Urban
 women under the age of 35 tend to have more 'modern" attitudes toward life and
 have discarded the traditional veil; at the same time, older urban women tend to
 be more reluctant to give up the veil or the traditional attitudes towards family and
 employment. Moreover, a significant proportion of rural women still do not attend
 school and tend to instill in their chiidren such traditional beliefs as women's sub-
 servient role in society.
 Employment gains by women also tend to be inhibited by lingering traditional re-
 strictions that discourage women from playing an active role in the workplace and
 by the resurgence of Islamic fundamentalist values. Some observers have noted that
 even educated women tend to lack self-confidence and social awareness and seek
 only a limited degree of occupational and social participation with men.
 The ambiguous position of women is illustrated by Qadhafi's own attitudes and
 utterances. His development plans have made an effort to include women in the
 modern work force, yet he has criticized women's emancipation in the West, includ-
 in their employment gains.
 Khildren.-The Government has subsidized education (which is compulsory to the
 ae of 15) and medical care, improving the welfare of children in the past 25 years.
 However, declining revenues and general economic mismanagement have led to cut-
 backs, particularly in medical services. Some tribes located in remote areas still
 practice female genital mutilation (FGM) on young girls, a procedure that is widely
 condemned by international health experts as damaging to both physical and psy-
 chological health.
 People With Disabilities.-No information is available on the Government's efforts
 to assist people with disabilities.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Arabic-speaking Muslims of mixed Arab and
 Berber ancestry comprise 97 percent of the population. The principal non-Arab mi-
 norities are Berbers and Africans. There are frequent allegations of discrimination
 based on tribal status, particularly against Berbers in the interior and Tuaregs in
 the south. Qadhafi manipulates tribes to maintain his grip on power by rewarding
 some tribes with money and government positions and repressing and jailing mem-
 bers of the other tribes. Qadhafi also attempts to keep the tribes fractured by pitting
 one tribe against another.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Independent trade unions and professional associa-
 tions are prohibited, and workers do not have the right to join unions of their own
 choosing. The regime regards such structures as unacceptable "intermediaries be-
 tween the revolution and the working forces." They may join the sole official trade
 union organization, the National Trade Unions' Federation, which was created in
 1972 and administered by the People's Committee system. The Government pro-
 hibits foreign workers from joining unions.
 The law does not guarantee the right to strike. There have been no reports of
 strikes for years. In a 1992 speech, Qadhafi affirmed that workers have the right
 to strike but added that strikes do not occur because the workers control their en-
 terprises.
 The official trade union organizationplays an active role in the International Con-
 federation of Arab Trade Unions and the Organization of African Trade Union
 Unity. It exploits international trade union contacts to engage in propaganda efforts
 on behalf of the regime. The Arab Maghreb Trade UnionFederation suspended the
 membership of Libya's trade union organization in 1993. The suspension followed
 reports that Qadhafi had replaced all union leaders, in some cases with loyal fol-
 lowers without union experience.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.--Collective bargaining does not
 exist in any meaningful sense because the labor law requires that the Government
 must approve all a   ements.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-In its 1995 report, the Intor-
 national Labor Organization's (ILO) Committee of Experts stated that"  rsons ex-
 Uressing certain political views or views ideologically opposed to the estaished po-
 litical, social, or economic system may be punished with penalties of imprisonment
 mem  sinvolving *    an obligation to perform labor." The situation in 1996 re-
 mained largely the same. The 1995 ILO report also noted that public employees may
 be sentenced to compulsory labor L* * * as a punishment for breaches of labor dis-
 cipline or for participation in strikes, even in services whose interruption would not
 endanger the ife, personal safety, or health of the whole or part of the population."
 
 
 1342
 The Government informed the ILO that legislation was enacted to abolish these pro-
 visions and submitted a report to the ILO, but the ILO did not comment on it this
 year.
 There have been credible reports that the Government has arbitrarily forced some
 foreign workers into involuntary military service or has coerced them into perform-
 ing subversive activities against their own countries. Libyans have been implicated
 in the purchasing of Sudanese slaves, who are largely southern Sudanese women
 and children who were captured by Sudanese government troops in the war against
 the southern rebellion.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 of children is 18 years.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The labor force is about 1.2 million workers
 (including 161,000 foreign workers) in a population of 5.2 million. Wages, particu-
 larly in the public sector, are frequently in arrears. A public wage freeze imposed
 in 1981 remains in effect and has seriously eroded real income. The average wage
 appears inadequate to provide a worker and family with a decent standard o living.
 The average wage is about $900 per month (300 dinars) at the official exchange
 rate, but is only worth $100 at the unofficial exchange rate.
 The legal maximum workweek is 48 hours. The labor law defines the rights and
 duties of workers, including matters of compensation, pension rights, minimum rest
 periods, and working hours. Labor inspcors are assigned to inspect places of work
 for compliance with occupational health and safety standards. Certain industries,
 such as the petroleum sector, try to maintain standards set by foreign compames.
 The labor law does not accord equality of treatment to foreign workers. Foreign
 workers may reside in Libya only for the duration of their work contracts and may
 not send more than half of their earnings to their families in their home countries.
 They are subject to arbitrary pressures, such as changes in work rules and contracts
 and have little option but to accept such changes or to depart the country. Foreign
 workers who are not under contract enjoy no protection.
 The Government uses the threat of expulsion of their foreign workers as leverage
 against countries whose foreign policies run counter to Libya a. The Government ex-
 pelled approximately 1,000 Palestinian residents in late 1995 to signal its displeas-
 ure with the agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization,
 and in May the regime threatened to expel thousands of Palestinian workers for po-
 litical and economic reasons (see Section 2.d.).
 The regime had expelled thousands of foreign workers from Chad, Sudan, and
 Egypt by the end of 1995 claiming that they were in Libya illegally. Government
 fears of worker ties to Islamic extremist groups and the need to conserve foreign
 exchange may have motivated the wave of expulsions.
