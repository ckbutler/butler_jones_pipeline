 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES*
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy with a multiparty
 political system and free elections. There is no
 constitution, but a series of basic laws defines the
 responsibilities of government institutions. The legislature
 (the Knesset) can limit the government and force its
 dissolution. Israel has an independent judiciary. Public
 debate on issues of concern to Israelis is open and lively. A
 vigorous free press scrutinizes all aspects of Israeli life
 and politics.
 Since Israel's founding in 1948, it has been in a formal state
 of war with most of its Arab neighbors, except Egypt, with
 which it concluded a peace treaty in 1979. As a result of the
 1967 war, Israel has occupied the territories of the West
 Bank, the Gaza Strip, the eastern sector of Jerusalem, and the
 Golan Heights.
 Since its founding, Israel has experienced numerous terrorist
 incidents, within and outside its borders. In this atmosphere
 of hostility and threat, Israel has relied heavily on its
 military and related services for security and has retained
 many of the security-related emergency regulations from the
 preindependence British mandate period.
 Internal security is the responsibility of the general
 security service (Shin Bet), which is under the authority of
 the Prime Minister's office. The police are under the
 authority of a separate minister. The Israeli Defense Forces
 (IDF)--which include a significant portion of the Israeli
 adult population in either active duty or reserve status
 --also plays a role in maintaining internal security. The IDF
 is under the authority of a civilian Minister of Defense. The
 Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee reviews the
 activities of the IDF and the Shin Bet.
 Israel enjoys a relatively high standard of living. It has a
 predominantly market economy with substantial government
 regulation and subsidies for basic commodities. Economic
 policy has a strong social welfare orientation.
 Israeli citizens have a range of civil and other rights
 generally comparable to those in advanced Western  .
 democracies. Israel's Arab citizens have nonetheless not
 shared fully in the rights granted to, and the duties levied
 on, Jewish citizens.
 In 1989, as in 1988, Israel's most significant human rights
 problem has been its practices in confronting the Palestinian
 uprising in the occupied territories. (For detailed
 discussion, see the separate report on the occupied
 territories.)
 *Because the legal status of the West Bank, Gaza, and East
 Jerusalem and the political and human rights conditions differ
 sharply from those in Israel, the situation there is dealt
 with in a separate report following the report for Israel.

 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Political killings in Israel are neither practiced nor
 sanctioned by. Israeli authorities. In 1989 nearly 20 Israeli
 civilians were killed within pre-1967 Israel by Palestinians
 in circumstances that appeared to be related to the ongoing
 political conflict in the occupied territories. Approximately
 five Palestinians from the territories were killed within
 Israel by Israeli private citizens in what may have been
 indfrect retaliation for these incidents. Palestinians and
 Israelis apprehended for these acts were dealt with through
 the normal process of Israeli law.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of government-condoned disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Israeli laws and administrative regulations prohibit, and
 provide specific penalties for, such activities. However,
 where security concerns predominate, these strictures have
 been violated. (See the occupied territories report for a
 discussion of allegations of mistreatment of prisoners.)
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Israeli law and practice guarantee against arbitrary arrest or
 imprisonment. Writs of habeas corpus and other procedural and
 substantive safeguards are available. Defendants are
 considered innocent until proven guilty.
 Administrative detention, with no formal charge or trial, has
 in the past been imposed on Israeli citizens for security
 reasons under emergency regulations. Two Israeli Arabs were
 adminstratively detained in 1989. The Minister of Defense may
 issue a detention order for a maximum of 6 months. Within 48
 hours of issuance of such an order, a district judge must
 review the case and may confirm, shorten, or overturn the
 detention order. Failing review within the designated time
 period, the detainee must be released. The detainee may be
 represented by counsel and may appeal to the Supreme Court.
 The Government may withhold evidence from the detainee and
 counsel on security grounds.
 In 1989 Israel continued to hold most administrative detainees
 from the occupied territories in detention centers inside
 Israel. (For a full discussion of administrative detention of
 Palestinians, see the separate report on the occupied
 territ6ries.)
 Israel does not exile its citizens.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a hearing by an impartial tribunal with
 representation by counsel is guaranteed by law. The judiciary
 is independent and effectively insulated from political
 interference. All nonsecurity trials are open. According to
 
 
 1425
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 the Ministry of Justice, security cases may be tried before a
 military court or a civil court and may be partly or wholly
 closed to the public. The burden of justifying nonpublic
 proceedings falls to the prosecution. Defense counsel is
 present, even during closed proceedings, but may be denied
 access to some evidence on security grounds. According to the
 Ministry of Justice, in security cases in which access to some
 evidence is denied, that evidence is not presented to the
 court.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Privacy of the individual and the home are protected by law
 within Israel. Emergency regulations permit mail to be
 stopped, opened, and even destroyed on security grounds. A
 1979 law allows tapping of telephones for security reasons,
 with confirmation by the Prime Minister or Defense Minister.
 Interference with mail and the tapping of telephones are
 practiced infrequently.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 (See the separate report on the occupied territories.)
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Individuals, organizations, the press, and the electronic
 media freely debate a wide range of public issues and
 criticize government officials and policies, except where
 sensitive security-based considerations or other censorship
 provisions apply. Press articles dealing with
 security-related matters must be submitted to the military
 censor. Israel's Arabic-language press is censored more
 strictly than the Hebrew-language press. In 1989 a High Court
 of Justice ruling narrowed the range of material that could be
 censored on security grounds. Movies are occasionally
 censored if deemed pornographic, offensive to religion or
 social mores, or likely to disturb public order. Theater
 censorship was ended in 1989 for a 2-year test period. All
 newspapers are privately owned and managed. Most of the
 electronic media are run by the independent Israel Broadcast
 Authority, whose chief is appointed by the Government.
 Security regulations make it illegal to possess or distribute
 literature of an outlawed organization for purposes of
 encouraging support for that organization or its cause or
 publicly to express support for such an organization. There
 was no indication that anyone was prosecuted under this law in
 1989.   Provisions against maintaining contact with, or
 accepting support from, an outlawed organization apply to the
 media as well as individuals. In 1989 the license of an
 Arabic-language newspaper was revoked on the grounds of links
 to an outlawed organization.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Israelis representing almost any point of view are free to
 assemble and associate. The law and court rulings protect
 these rights. However, security regulations prohibit
 membership in, or contact with, outlawed organizations, their
 subdivisions, or their individual members. In 1989 an Israeli
 
 
 1426
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIEM
 peace activist was jailed for meeting with Palestine
 Liberation Organization (PLO) leader Yasser Arafat, eight
 Israelis were charged with meeting PLO members, and the 1988
 convictions of four others for & similar offense were under
 appeal. A Knesset member met publicly with Yasser Arafat, but
 his Knesset immunity protected him from prosecution.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Israel is a democracy. There are strong guarantees of freedom
 for all religious faiths. Approximately 82 percent of its
 citizens are Jewish. Muslims, Christians, and Druze, and
 members of other minority religions make up the remaining 18
 percent. Travel to visit religious sites or perform religious
 obligations in and outside Ilrael is widely permitted. In
 1989 Israel facilitated the pilgrimage to Mecca of over 5,000
 Israeli Muslims.
 Each recognized religious community in Israel has legal
 authority over its members in matters of marriage, legitimacy,
 inheritance, and conversion. Orthodox religious authorities
 have exclusive control over these matters in all sectors of
 the Jewish community, whether or not they are Orthodox.
 Missionaries are allowed to work in Israel. A 1977
 antiproselytizing law, prohibiting the offering and receipt of
 material benefits as an inducement to conversion, has not been
 employed.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Israeli citizens can move freely within Israel except in
 military or security zones, or in cases where they may be
 confined to their neighborhood or village by administrative
 order under emergency regulations. In 1989 two Israeli Arabs
 were confined in this fashion, but were later released.
 Israeli citizens are free to travel within the occupied
 territories, except in those sections temporarily declared
 closed military areas. (See the occupied territories report
 regarding the effect of Palestinian attacks on Israeli
 civilians, freedom of travel.)
 Israeli citizens are free to travel abroad and to emigrate,
 provided they have no outstanding military obligations or are
 not restricted by administrative order. In 1989 the Israeli
 Government renewed restrictions on the travel of one Israeli
 Arab political activist, without giving an official reason.
 Israel welcomes Jewish immigrants, including Jewish refugees,
 to whom it gives automatic citizenship and residence rights.
 It accepts back Israeli citizens who have emigrated. Israel
 has allowed the return of some Palestinians on the principle
 of family'reunification but has rejected the great majority of
 requests for return.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy, with a multitude of
 parties representing a wide range of political views.
 Relatively small parties regularly win seats in the Knesset.
 All adult Israeli citizens have the right to participate in
 the political process and to vote by secret ballot.
 
 
 1427
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Participation of eligible voters, including Israeli Arabs, in
 national elections is high by Western standards. In the 1988
 national elections, Israeli Arabs won 6 of 120 Knesset seats.
 Israeli citizens, including Israeli Arabs, actively
 participated in the 1989 local (municipal) elections.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights.
 Israel is responsive to international and nongovernmental
 interest in its human rights situation. It hosts and works
 with a delegation of the International Committee for the Red
 Cross. It permits regular visits by a wide range of private
 and international organizations concerned about human rights
 such as Amnesty International (AI), the Lawyers Committee for
 Human Rights, the International Labor Organization (ILO), and
 others. The Government routinely investigates and responds to
 human rights inquiries by such organizations as AI. The
 Ministries of Justice and Foreign Affairs have human rights
 offices.
 The number of local human rights and political action groups,
 already very active, expanded in 1989, primarily in response
 to the continuing uprising in the territories.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status.
 Women's rights in Israel are protected by the equal
 opportunity law, which forbids sex discrimination. For
 example, it requires employers to pay male and female workers
 equal wages for equal work. Other laws and regulations give
 protection to women employees regarding pregnancy, childbirth,
 and child care. The Government includes a senior adviser on
 the status of women, and the Civil Service Commission and
 several government ministries have officers responsible for
 women's rights. Nongovernmental women's organizations work
 actively in promoting women's rights and welfare. Women are
 drafted into the army but do not fill combat-related
 positions.
 Domination of personal status law by religious courts means
 that women are subject to restrictive interpretations of their
 rights in such crucial areas as marriage, divorce, and
 inheritance.
 The courts in Israel deal firmly with persons convicted of
 violence, including violence against women. Human rights
 groups, especially women's groups, are increasingly active in
 dealing with the issue of domestic violence against women, and
 the Government provides some funding for intervention
 activities.
 Israeli Arabs, who comprise approximately 18 percent of
 Israel's population, have made substantial'educational and
 material progress since the founding of Israel. A few have
 risen to responsible positions in the civil service, generally
 in the Arab departments of government ministries. The year
 saw the appointment of the first Arab woman judge. The
 Arabic-speaking community has access to local and foreign
 Arabic newspapers and magazines, internal and external Arabic
 television programming, and Arabic-language radio services.
 However, Israeli Arabs have not attained the same quality of
 education, housing, or other services as Israeli Jews.
 
 
 1428
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Relative to their numbers, they are underrepresented in the
 student body of most universities, and in higher level
 professional, academic, and business ranks.
 The Israeli Druze and Circassian communities, at their
 initiative, are subject to Israel's military draft, and some
 Bedouin Arabs serve voluntarily in special units. However,
 most Israeli Arabs are not subject to the draft, and few
 volunteer. Consequently, they have less access than do other
 Israelis to such social and economic benefits as housing and
 new-household subsidies, and government or security-related
 industrial employment, for which military service is either a
 prerequisite or an advantage.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Israeli workers and employers have freely established
 organizations of their own choosing. Israel has a powerful
 free trade union movement, the General Federation of Labor in
 Israel (Histadrut), and a much smaller rival federation.
 About 80 percent of employed Israelis (including 70 percent of
 employed Israeli Arabs) are members of Histadrut trade unions
 or are covered by its collective bargaining agreements.
 Histadrut is a vast service organization which also runs
 industries, banks, cooperatives and the country's largest
 health and child care systems. Histadrut's position as the
 preeminent representative of Israeli labor predates the
 establishment of the State of Israel and is not imposed by law.
 Histadrut's members democratically elect their national and
 local officers and those of its affiliated trade unions and
 women's organization, choosing between political party lists.
 Plant or enterprise committee members are elected
 individually.
 The right to strike is exercised frequently. There is a legal
 obligation to give 15 days' notice prior to a strike or
 lockout, unless otherwise specified in the collective
 bargaining agreement. Strikes often erupt without prior
 notice or Histadrut authorization, although Histadrut tries to
 maintain discipline with a central strike fund. The
 Government occasionally appeals to labor courts for
 back-to-work orders to restore essential public services while
 negotiations continue, but these orders are temporary and not
 always granted. Labor courts include employer and employee
 representatives. Strike activity in 1989 was relatively low;
 among the more important strikes were those by employees of
 Histadrut's health care system and by employees of the
 Histadrut-owned KOOR Industries.
 Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem have the same rights
 of labor association. While a number of such residents are
 members of Histadrut, at least 14 Arab unions independent of
 Histadrut also operate.
 Approximately 100,000 nonresident workers work in Israel.
 Most of them are Palestinians living in the West Bank and
 Gaza. While the total number of Palestinians working in
 Israel appears not to have changed significantly from 1988, a
 number of factors--entry permits required of Gaza workers,
 general strikes in the territories, and Israeli-imposed
 curfews--have had serious short-term effects on daily workers
 and have probably depressed the weekly average of hours worked
 per worker.
 
 
 1429
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Nonresident workers cannot be members of Histadrut. They are
 nonetheless entitled to union representation, and can join,
 vote for, and be elected to shop-level workers' committees in
 establishments where they number at least 20 or comprise at
 least 10 percent of the work force.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right of Israelis to organize and bargain collectively is
 enshrined in law and freely exercised. The majority union
 (generally Histadrut) is the exclusive bargaining agent.
 Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem have the same rights
 under Israeli law. The Arab unions operating in East
 Jerusalem conduct their own collective bargaining.
 Nonresident workers (primarily Palestinians) may not organize
 and bargain collectively on their own in Israel, but those
 that work in the organized sector are entitled to the
 protection of collective bargaining agreements and
 representation by the bargaining agent. 'The majority of these
 workers, however, work outside the legal hiring mechanism and
 lack this protection.
 There are no export processing zones in Israel.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Israeli citizens are not subject to forced or compulsory labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 By law, children under age 15 may not be employed. Those aged
 15 may not be employed if subject to compulsory education,
 except during vacations, or in apprenticeships, or with a
 permit from the Labor Minister under special conditions. The
 Minister may also allow an artistic performance by a child
 under 15, with safeguards. Employment of children aged 16 to
 18 is restricted to ensure time for rest and education. A
 Labor Inspection Service enforces these provisions, but ,
 enforcement may be lax in smaller, unorganized enterprises.
 Israeli labor exchanges in the West Bank and Gaza do not
 permit Palestinians under 17 to be employed in Israel.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Wage income in Israel is generally sufficient to provide
 workers and their families a decent standard of living.,
 Legislation in 1986 established a minimum wage at 45 percent
 of the average salary, calculated periodically. An October
 1989 adjustment raised it to $447 a month. Most wages and
 salaries are estabIished in collective bargaining agreements.
 The Labor Minister frequently uses the 1957 collective
 agreements law to extend private-sector wage settlements to
 the public sector and sectoral wage settlements to other,
 uncovered enterprises. Along with union representation,,the
 Labor Inspection Service effectively enforces labor, health,
 and safety standards in the wqrkplace.
 By law, maximum hours of work at regular pay are 47 hours per
 week, 8 per day, and 7 the day before the weekly rest, which
 must be at least 36 consecutive hours and should include the
 Sabbath. Exceptions may be approved by the Labor Ministry but
 may not exceed 10 hours per day, or an average of 47 hours per
 week. By national collective agreements, the public sector
 moved to a 5-day, 42.5-hour week in April 1989, while the
 
 
 1430
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 private sector established a maximum 45-hour week in August
 1988 afid an April 199- deadline for all firms to institute the
 5-day week.
 Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem have the same rights
 under Israeli law and union contracts and are entitled to the
 same working conditions as Israelis.
 About 33,000 of the West Bank and Gaza Palestinians working in
 Israel enter the job-market legally through Israeli employment
 service labor exchanges in the West Bank and Gaza. Employers
 pay-wages and social contributions for these workers to the
 service, which deducts taxes, employee social contcibutions,
 and a 1-percent union-fee, and-pays the balance to the
 workers. -The same percentage is deducted from the pay of
 Palestinians working clegally in Israel as is deducted from the
 pay of Israeli workers for social contributions. However,
 they do not receive the same benefits from the National
 Insurance Institute <NII, similar to U.S. social security),
 because, many NII benefits require residence in Israel.
 The-NII provides commuting workers with workers' compensation
 for occupational injury or illness and employer bankruptcy
 insurance. These workers are also entitled to maternity
 benefits, including free hospital care and 12 weeks' paid
 maternity leave, but only for births in hospitals in Israel.
 Nonresidents are ineligible for NII old-age, survivors', and
 disability pensions, unemployment compensation, or insurance
 for long-term care or injury in nonoccupational accidents.
 They are also ineligible for NII children's allowances, funded
 only by employer contributions, and for-NI-I-administered
 welfare programs funded by Israe-i-taxpayers through the
 budget.
 Because of these restrictions, only 1.2 percent of nonresident
 Palestinian workers' pay goes to the NII, compared to 5.35
 -percent for an Israeli. The other 4.15 percent is an
 equalizatien deduction which was established to keep labor
 -costs equivalent. This amount goes to a special finance
 minlstry-fundrto be earmarked for social, and development
 expeniitts-eszin the West Bank and Gaza.- Palestinians estimate
 -that this am-nnts to -hundreds of mllions of dollars since
 1970 and claim that -the Government of Israel has not accounted
 for -its use of the funds. Expenditures for the -territories
 are reviewed by-the KnessetJoint Committee for Defense and
 Finances, .but are not made-public.
 A report issued in December by the International Confederation
 of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) on the sociaL and economic
 conditions of West Bank and Gaza workers recommends that the
 social security system be-revamped so that those who work in
 Israel are able to-receive full social benefits or else be
 reimbursed 'for the -value of their. contributions which are
 deducted from gross wages.
 Nonresident Palestinian workers who are legally hired are
 covered'by the minimum wage law and by the larger system of
 social benefits granted through collective bargaining
 agreements. They are entitled to receive a pension through
 the Labor Ministry at age 65 after at least 10 years,
 employment in Israel, based on earnings and years worked,
 which is equivalent to Histadrut pensions granted to
 Israelis. They are also entitled to sick leave, severance
 pay, and paid vacations of 14 to 28 days per year, by law as
 well as by Histadrut contract.
 
 
 1431
 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Histadrut has sought to defend the rights of nonresident
 Palestinians who were dismissed for absences during the
 uprising, maintaining that military curfews and community-wide
 strikes are beyond their control. Histadrut has not been able
 to get large numbers reinstated but has worked to get many
 their severance pay. The labor federation has used plant-site
 visits, Arab-language broadcasts, fliers, and workplace posters
 to inform nonresident Palestinians of their legal rights and
 benefits. Histadrut began holding seminars on worker rights
 in 1988 for employees recruited through West Bank and Gaza
 labor exchanges.
 The majority of the nonresident Palestinians who work in
 Israel bypass the employment service hiring system, thereby
 losing social benefits but also avoiding taxes and social
 contributions for themselves and their employers. Their wages
 and working conditions are often below Israeli legal
 standards, particularly in seasonal agriculture and small
 restaurants, garages, and construction sites where many work.
 Enforcement of minimum wage laws is not stringent. In 1989
 the employment service carried out stricter enforcement of the
 requirement that they be hired through labor exchanges, but
 this has not halted the trend toward more Palestinians working
 in the informal sector. Employment service inspectors have
 begun fining employers $250 per illegally hired worker as an
 alternative to long drawn-out criminal court complaints.
 According to the regulations, nonresident Palestinian workers
 are not allowed to stay overnight in Israel without a permit.
 The pressures of strikes in the territories, the occasional
 closure of the territories, and Palestinian activist efforts
 in Gaza to resist Israeli imposition of entry permits for all
 Gaza workers have induced more Palestinian workers to stay
 overnight in Israel illegally, often in substandard
 conditions. In practice, relatively few of the estimated
 thousands who regularly stay overnight are detained by the
 police. However, police have recently stepped up efforts to
 enforce the law against those workers who lack overnight and
 entry permits.
 The 1989 report of the ILO Director General reviewed the
 situation of nonresident Palestinian workers in Israel. It
 reiterated its recommendations for action to combat illegal
 employment and eliminate inequalities with respect to
 benefits, working conditions, and job security. It called for
 restructuring the system of benefits so that workers*
 contributions would be used strictly for social security
 programs and not for other purposes.
 
 
 1432
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 This report differs from most other reports contained in this
 volume in one fundamental respect: whereas other reports
 describe the relationship between the government and the
 governed in countries over which the governments in question
 exercise sovereignty, this report deals with lands under
 foreign military occupation. The lands now known as the
 "occupied territories" were occupied by Israel in the 1967
 War. Israel has not been recognized to have sovereign rights
 over any of the occupied territories: the West Bank, the Gaza
 Strip, the Golan Heights, and East Jerusalem. Regarding East
 Jerusalem, Israel has asserted sovereignty and annexed it.
 The West Bank and the Gaza Strip are governed under Jordanian
 and British law, as modified by military orders. Israeli law
 and divilian administration have been extended to the Golan
 Heights.
 The United States considers Israel's occupation to be governed
 by the Hague Regulations of 1907 and the 1949 Fourth Geneva
 Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in
 Time of War. Israel denies the applicability of the Fourth
 Geneva Convention to the West Bank and Gaza, but states that
 it observes the Convention's humanitarian provisions in those
 areas.
 Since 1967, there have been episodic but sometimes intense
 outbreaks of violence within the occupied territories,
 reflecting ,alestinian opposition to the occupation. In
 December,1987, there was a dramatic outburst of civilian
 unrest and violence. This has continued throughout 1989 and
 has been far more widespread and intensive than at any time
 heretofore. This has led to a severe crackdown by the Israeli
 Defense Forces (IDF).
 The human rights situation in the occupied territories remains
 a source of deep concern to the United States. Overall, there
 were more Palestinian deaths in 1989 than in 1988. A total of
 432 Palestinians were killed in intifada-related violence in
 1989, of whom 304 were killed by Israeli security forces and
 settlers and 128 by other Palestinians; 13 Israelis, soldiers
 and civilians, were killed by Palestinians during 1989.
 This unrest and violence, known as the intifada, has as its
 minimum goal the end of Israeli occupation, a goal strongly
 supported by Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, The
 leadership of the uprising, known as the United National
 Leadership of the Uprising (UNLU), attempts to direct and
 coordinate intifada activities. As it developed, groups of
 young people which have formed in individual localities but
 are loosely associated with each other and coordinate their
 tactics have, throughout the occupied territories, enforced
 business shut-downs and strikes, and directed attacks at
 Israeli military patrols and Israeli travelers, particularly
 settlers, whose cars are routinely pelted with stones.
 Occasionally firebombs have been thrown. The security forces
 have responded with tear gas, rubber and plastic bullets, and
 metal bullets.
 Israeli occupation authorities have sought to end the intifada
 through widescale arrests, detention, raids on homes in which
 suspects were thought to reside, and more severe forms of
 punishment, including deportation. The rules of engagement of
 the Israeli Defense Forces provide for the use'of force in
 case of self-defense in life-threatening situations, in the
 arrest of a suspect to a crime if the suspect resists, and
 
 
 1433
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 dispersing a violent riot which endangers public order or the
 safety of soldiers. The rules allow the use of live fire only
 as a last resort and under defined procedures in these
 circumstances. The guidelines for the use of force stipulate
 that once force is no longer needed, it should no longer be
 applied. The Government of Israel makes clear to all forces
 serving in the occupied territories the need to adhere to the
 rules of engagement. However, violations of these rules have
 resulted in death and injuries. Only a relatively small
 number of such incidents have resulted in prosecution, and the
 sentences meted out have tended to be light.
 An important aspect of the situation in the occupied
 territories in 1989 has been the significant increase in
 violence by Palestinians directed at other Palestinians. This
 has taken a number of forms, including assassinations, other
 acts of violence, and threats of violence. This took place in
 an environment influenced by some statements by various
 Palestinian leaders and the Unified Command promoting violence
 (e.g., a call by one UNLU leaflet to use knives, hatchets, and
 Molotov cocktails), tough Israeli security measures, the
 breakdown in law enforcement against conventional crime, and
 factional differences among Palestinians. The Unified Command
 has not disassociated itself from the phenomenon of
 intra-Palestinian violence but has sought to curb that element
 not under its control.
 The strength of the Islamic fundamentalist Hamas movement has
 contributed to this intra-Palestinian violence and atmosphere
 of intimidation. Hamas opposes any reconciliation with
 Israel, and it would appear that its appeal, albeit still
 limited to a minority of the Palestinian populati6n, has also
 shaped intra-Palestinian tensions.
 Israel's open, democratic society enables widespread access to
 data on and investigations of human rights in the territories,
 notwithstanding IDF restraints applied there. Israel has
 designated officals in the Ministry of Defense with whom U.S.
 officials discuss specific allegations of human rights
 violations.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Political killing is not condoned by Israel. However, in 1989
 there were allegations that Palestinian activists were
 intentionally killed by Israeli security forces or
 Palestinians working for them. Israel categorically denied
 these charges.
 Israeli settlers killed 11 Palestinians during marches,
 patrols, retaliatory raids, and other incidents. The IDF
 condemned such vigilantism and attempted to stop it. Charges
 were brought against one settler leader in 1989 for the 1988
 slaying of a Palestinian, and he has been on trial. Suspects
 in other killings were released for lack of evidence after
 they failed to cooperate with police.
 Palestinian attacks against Israeli soldiers and civilians in
 1989 resulted in 13 deaths and 196 injuries. The authorities
 
 
 1434
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 investigated these cases and prosecuted suspects in some of
 them.
 During 1989, 128 Palestinians wdre killed by other
 Palestinians. Many were also wounded. There has been
 intimidation against some of those who are employed by the
 Civil Administration, and, in some cases, against some of
 those who have expounded the need for political compromise.
 Among those killed this year were a number of Arab policemen
 or local Arab village officials. Israelis state that a number
 of the victims of intra-Palestinian violence have been killed
 for seeking to express moderate views. Many of the victims
 were working with the Israeli security authorities, and
 ,Palestinians claim that some of them were armed and provided
 information leading to arrests of uprising activists.
 Palestinians state that other victims were habitual criminals
 or people killed due to private disputes.
 Some of these attacks and acts of intimidation were carried
 out by young Palestinian activists, often masked, who were
 members of the "strike forces" which enforce directives
 relating to the conduct of the uprising. However, some
 attackers were members of self-styled Palestinian gangs which
 operated autonomously. The emergence of gangs called the Red
 Eagles and Black Panthers in Nablus in the northern West Bank
 has been a new development of concern both to Israelis and to
 most of the Palestinian community; these gangs and other
 individuals have also engaged in acts of violence as vendettas
 or as settling scores not connected with the intifada.
 (For further discussion of casualties, see Sections l.c. and
 l.g.)
 b. Disappearance
 Israel does not sponsor or condone disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is forbidden by Israeli law, and Israeli authorities
 assert they do not condone its use in the occupied
 territories. IDF orders forbid the use of force after the
 detention of a suspect and the cessation of violent
 resistance. Nevertheless, reports continue of harsh and
 demeaning treatment of prisoners and detainees, as well as
 allegations of beatings of suspects and detainees, including
 beating during house searches, which is contrary to IDF
 rules. At least 10 deaths can be attributed to beatings.
 Palestinians and international human rights groups claim that
 other cruel practices--including enforced standing in one
 position for prolonged periods, hooding, sleep deprivation,
 and cold showers--have continued since being confirmed in the
 1987 report of the Landau judicial commission referred to in
 the 1988. Country Reports on Human Rights Practices. Physical
 and psychological pressures are particularly severe in
 incommunicado detention during investigation and
 interrogation.
 Most convictions in security cases are based on confessions.
 An attorney is normally not allowed to see a client until
 after interrogation is completed and a confession, if
 obtained, has been made. Individuals may be held up to 14
 days after arrest before the International Committee of the
 Red Cross (ICRC) is permitted access, which is often delayed.
 
 
 1435
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 According to IDF figures, 9,138 Palestinians were being held
 in IDF prison facilities as of January 1, 1990. Two military
 detention centers were added to the nine existing facilities.
 The Ketziot detention facility was expanded and improved, but
 serious overcrowding continued. Conditions at military
 detention facilities varied. Several prison riots and hunger
 strikes protesting conditions occurred. In March a prisoner
 in Gaza died while under Shin Bet interrogation. An Israeli
 investigation concluded that the cause of death was natural
 (an ulcer), and there is no presumption of mistreatment. The
 investigation also held that lax supervision may have
 contributed to the death, and a medical orderly has been
 disciplined. Another prisoner in Gaza died December 19 under
 interrogation in Shin Bet custody. An official autopsy
 concluded that death was caused by internal stomach bleeding
 brought on by a blow. Israel initiated an investigation into
 this incident.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 No new deportation orders were issued in 1989, but 26
 Palestinians (including 5 journalists and 5 labor leaders)
 were deported in 1989, many after a lengthy appeals process up
 to the Israeli High Court of Justice, under deportation orders
 issued in 1988. Two others avoided formal deportation by
 signing agreements to remain abroad and avoid political
 activities for 5 years. The deportation process is
 characterized by a lack of formal charges and the use of
 secret evidence not disclosed to the suspect or his attorney.
 The United States considers deportations to contravene Article
 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. The Israeli High Court of
 Justice has not accepted this view.
 Palestinians under deportation orders may appeal to the
 Israeli High Court. The Court has overturned no deportation
 orders.
 Administrative detention for alleged security reasons without
 formal charges was widespread in 1989. Israel maintains that
 administrative detention is used only against persons engaged
 in activities threatening security; however, in a number of
 cases persons appear to have been detained for nonviolent
 political activities. While the number of administrative
 detainees at any one time varies, IDF figures indicate that
 the number was 1,271 as of January 1, 1990. Most were
 detained under a 6-month order, although many orders have been
 renewed for a second or third time. In August the maximum
 length of detention under orders was extended to 12 months.
 District military commanders may order administrative
 detentions without formal charges'. A detainee may appeal the
 order to a military judge. Only a small percentage of orders
 is overturned on appeal. Secret evidence, not made available
 to detainees or their attorneys, is often used to support
 administrative detention orders. Rulings by military judges
 can be appealed to the High Court, which may review secret
 evidence, but there have been no reversals. According to the
 IDF, approximately 30 percent of detention orders were
 shortened or canceled on appeal in 1989 after portions of the
 detention period were served.
 The authorities continued to transfer detainees and prisoners
 convicted of security offenses from the occupied territories
 to facilities in Israel, particularly the Ketziot detention
 camp in the Negev Desert and Megiddo Prison near Afula in
 
 
 1436
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 northern Israel. Such transferd, in the view of the United
 States, contravene Article 76 of the Fourth Geneva
 Convention. However, the Israeli High Court dismissed a 1988
 petition brought by Ketziot detainees and held that the
 Convention's provisions could not be enforced by an Israeli
 court since they had not been enacted into Israeli law.
 Any soldier can arrest without warrant a person who has
 committed, or is suspected of having committed, a criminal or
 security offense. Persons arrested for common crimes in the
 occupied territories are usually provided the opportunity for
 bail, access to an attorney, and a statement of charges,
 although these rights are sometimes delayed. Individuals may
 be held in custody without a warrant for 96 hours, and may be
 held without formal charges for up to 18 days. The normal
 pretrial detention period is 60 days. A high court judge may
 approve unlimited 3-month extensions. Security detainees are
 usually denied bail and are routinely held without access to
 counsel for 18 days. Access may be denied indefinitely if
 officials believe granting it would impede the investigation.
 Many security suspects are arrested without warrants and may
 be so held for up to 96 hours. Denial of notification of
 arrest to immediate family members, attorneys, and consular
 officials is common and under law can be extended for up to 14
 days. Incommunicado detention for a period of 8 days is
 permitted with a court order. Detainees are often not told
 the reasons f-or their detention. In September Israel
 announced improved family notification procedures. However,
 the problem of delayed notification continued.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Palestinians accused of nonsecurity offenses are tried
 publicly in local courts by Palestinian judges, except where
 jurisdiction has been transferred by military order.
 Palestinians accused of security offenses, which are broadly
 defined and, as administered, cover Palestinian nationalist
 activity of a nonviolent character, are tried in Israeli
 military courts before panels composed of one or three
 judges. Charges are brought by military commanders. Suspects
 are entitled to counsel. In 1989 there were long delays
 before trial because military courts were overburdened by the
 large number of uprising-related security cases. An increased
 number of judges and prosecutors was inadequate to cover the
 workload.
 Most military trials are public, though acdess is controlled
 and in some cases limited. Consular officers are allowed to
 attend military court proceedings involving foreign citizens,
 but there have been delays in gaining admission. Acquittals
 are very rare in security cases. Most convictions in military
 courts are based on confessions. The absence of bail, long
 pretrial delays, and physical and psychological pressures
 increase the likelihood of confessions. These are usually
 recorded in Hebrew, which many defendants are unable to read.
 In April a military appeals court staffed by active duty and
 reserve military officers was established with branches in the
 West Bank and Gaza. Appeals from decisions by three-judge
 panels may be brought by the defendant or the prosecution.
 Cases heard by single-judge panels, which can impose prison
 sentences of up to 5 years, may be appealed only with the
 permission of the court. According to Israel's Judge Advocate
 General, the court heard 25 cases through mid-October in which
 it accepted 15 defense appeals and 7 prosecution appeals.
 
 
 1437
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Nonjudicial administrative orders of the military government
 may be appealed to area military commanders and to the High
 Court. The court almost never reverses Civil Administration
 or military orders based on security considerations.
 Israeli settlers in the occupied territories accused of
 security and ordinary offenses are tried in the nearest
 Israeli district court under Israeli law. These courts are
 presided over by professional judges, and standards of due
 process and admissibility of evidence are stricter than in
 military courts.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Military authorities may enter private homes and institutions
 without a warrant in pursuit of security objectives. Forced
 entries, which are a regular part of IDF operations, have
 resulted in beatings, destruction of property, and arrests.
 Military orders also authorize the authorities to occupy
 buildings, or parts of buildings, as military observation
 points. Security officials frequently questioned Palestinians
 about their political views, and temporarily detained people.
 Demolition and sealing are nonjudicial administrative
 punishments ordered by the area military commander.
 Demolition and sealing of houses in the occupied territories
 are carried out pursuant to Article 119 of the Defence
 (Emergency) Regulations of 1945. Under the regulations,
 military commanders may order the demolition or sealing of any
 house from which they suspect a firearm has been discharged or
 bomb thrown, or any house situated in an area, town, village,
 quarter, or street the inhabitants of which they are satisfied
 have committed offenses against the regulations. The Israeli
 High Court ruled in January that houses of stone-throwers
 could be demolished. In July the High Court ruled that houses
 rented by offenders could be demolished and that owners have
 48 hours to appeal a demolition order to the area military
 commander, who can waive this right in cases of "operational
 military need." Final appeals can be made to the High Court.
 The High Court has delayed orders but has not overturned any
 of them. In 1989, 170 Arab houses were demolished or sealed
 for security reasons (88 demolished, 82 sealed).
 Owners are not allowed to rebuild, making the punishment one
 of indefinite duration. House demolition as punishment is
 enforced only against Arab residents of the occupied
 territories. The United States believes demolition and
 sealing as punishment of families contravenes the Fourth
 Geneva Convention. Israel, however, holds that the Convention
 permits demolition under'imperative military considerations.
 The Israeli High Court has ruled that demolition is lawful in
 certain circumstances.
 Mail and telephone conversations are sometimes monitored.
 Telephone service to specific areas is sometimes interrupted
 by the authorities.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 While the rules of engagement set forth the limits within
 which force may be used, there were nonetheless a number of
 instances in which these limits were exceeded. IDF
 regulations permit use of live fire only when soldiers' lives
 are in real and immediate danger, to halt fleeing suspects, or
 
 
 1438
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 to disperse a violent riot. Only a specific attacker may be
 fired on; fire is to be directed at legs only; and fire may be
 directed at a fleeing suspect only if a serious felony is
 suspected, and as a last resort. Rules of fire were expanded
 in 1989 to allow firing at any fleeing masked individual.
 Soldiers may fire high-velocity ammunition only after
 exhausting other methods, including tear gas, rubber bullets,
 and warning shots.
 IDF guidelines often were not followed, resulting in avoidable
 deaths and injuries. Most Palestinians were killed by high-
 velocity rounds shot by the IDF or border police in the course
 of incidents involving stones, firebombs, and fleeing
 suspects. Many deaths and wounds were from bullets in the
 head'or upper body. Misuse of plastic and rubber bullets
 continued to result in death and serious injury. In January
 noncommissioned officers were authorized-to fire them. Tear
 gas was occasionally used in houses and enclosed spaces in
 violatiozi of instructions for its use, which can be
 potentially lethal.
 Estimates vary of the number of casualties from violence in
 the occupied territories. Figures compiled from press,
 Palestinian, hospital, international organization, and Israeli
 government sources indicate that in the occupied territories a
 total of 432 Palestinians were killed in 1989 (including the
 casualties'already described in Section l.a.: 1 Palestinians
 killed.by settlers, and 128 Palestinians killed by other
 Palestinians). Estimates of the number of Palestinians
 wounded varies from over 5,000 to up to 20,000. As also
 reported in Section l.a., 13 Israelis were killed by
 Palestinians and 196 injured in the occupied territories
 during 1989.
 According to the IDF, 435 cases of IDF conduct were
 investigated in 1989, of which 47 resulted in court-martial;
 some were dropped for lack of evidence, and others were sent
 to unit commanders for disciplinary action below the  _el of
 court martial. However, regulations often were not vigor   ly
 enforced, many cases of unjust killing did not result in
 disciplinary action, and punishments often were lenient. In
 May four members of an elite IDF unit were cleared of
 manslaughter charges and convicted on reduced charges of
 "causing grievous bodily harm" in the 1988 beating death of a
 Gazan. The court found their officers had issued "manifestly
 illegal orders" in authorizing the beatings, but there was no
 prosecution of the officers. The 9-month sentences of the
 soldiers were later commuted to 6 months.  The High Court of
 Justice on December 24 ordered the court-martial of an IDF
 colonel, who had resigned after the IDF had severely
 reprimanded him for ordering the breaking of bones of
 detainees. The IDF Judge Advocate General's office announced
 December 25 that another IDF colonel would be court-martialed
 for having shot to death a Palestinian resident of the Bureij
 refugee camp in Gaza. The official investigation of an
 incident in Nahalin in April 1989, which had resulted in five
 Palestinian deaths, acknowledged serious errors. Several
 Israeli security personnel involved in Nahalin were
 transferred and disciplined.
 There were several controversial incidents in 1989 involving
 the entry by Israeli security forces into Palestinian
 hospitals and clinics. Israel denies that it interferes with
 medical services and supplies as a matter of policy but
 acknowledges that at times its security forces enter hospitals
 
 
 1439
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 to pursue and arrest fleeing rioters or those suspected of
 security offenses. It denies allegations of mistreating
 patients or staff and asserts that Palestinians use hospitals
 as refuges for uninjured rioters. Palestinians deny this and
 charge that security forces in some cases used tear gas and
 beat patients and staff, in contravention of international
 law. Palestinians allege that security forces at IDF
 roadblocks deliberately held up ambulances transporting
 wounded. Israel charges that ambulances are used to transport
 uninjured security suspects.
 Israel, in response to a tax boycott, imposed a siege on the
 West Bank town of Beit Sahour. All access to the town was
 blocked for over 40 days, during which Israeli authorities
 seized merchandise and vehicles to pay outstanding tax bills.
 Israel claims these actions were justified by the tax
 boycott. Palestinians claim that certain Israeli tax
 practices are inconsistent with international law, including
 the imposition of a value added tax (VAT) and other taxes
 which did not exist before 1967, the summary seizure of
 private property, and Israel's failure to address whether the
 tax revenues were being utilized for the benefit of the
 population of the occupied territories.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 East Jerusalem is an active center of Arabic publication,
 including newspapers. There is no press elsewhere in the
 occupied territories. The Israeli authorities imposed tight
 restrictions on the Arabic press, citing broadly defined
 security reasons. Publications in East Jerusalem must submit
 to the military for prior censorship all copy relating to the
 security, public order, and safety of Israel and the occupied
 territories. Some reports and editorials related to the
 uprising and Palestinian political goals were permitted, but
 articles and editorials were routinely expurgated. Arabic
 translations of uprising-related news stories which had
 previously appeared in the Hebrew language press were
 routinely censored from the Arabic press.
 The display of Palestinian political symbols, such as flags,
 national colors, and graffiti, is punishable by fines,
 detention, or imprisonment. According to the IDF, very few
 persons were sentenced in 1989 solely for displaying
 nationalist symbols, although this charge may be levied along
 with other more serious charges for violent activity. Public
 expression of support for the Palestine Liberation
 Organization (PLO), its component factions, Muslim extremist
 groups (such as Hamas), and other banned organizations is
 prohibited.
 No broadcast media originate from the occupied territories.
 The authorities have jammed inflammatory radio broadcasts from
 neighboring countries. In August the use of fax machines in
 "the Gaza Strip was banned. A military order closing a
 prominent Palestinian press service was renewed, and two other
 Palestinian press services were closed.
 For alleged security offenses, Israeli security authorities
 administratively detained at least 20 journalists,
 interrogated numerous others, and raided newspaper offices.
 
 
 1440
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 A permit is required for publications imported into the
 occupied territories. Imported materials may be censored or
 banned for anti-Semitic or anti-Israeli content or support of
 Palestinian nationalism. In adaition to temporary
 restrictions on individual publications, there were temporary
 bans on the distribution of all East Jerusalem Arab newspapers
 in the West Bank and Gaza on four occasions. Possession of
 banned materials, such as uprising leaflets, is punishable by
 fine and imprisonment. The IDF periodically declared all or
 parts of the West Bank and Gaza closed military areas, one
 primary effect of which was to exclude journalists except
 under military escort. Reports by foreign journalists are
 subject to censorship under a system of self-regulation.
 Israel kept all Palestinian universities in the West Bank and
 Gaza closed throughout 1989, allegedly because they were
 contributing to violence. The vocational, secondary, and
 elementary schools in the West Bank, closed in January,
 reopened in July and August but were closed again in
 mid-November. Schools in Gaza and East Jerusalem were open
 for most of the school year. Alternate, off-campus classrooms
 organized by parents and teachers were banned on security
 grounds, although some continued to operate.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.
 Military orders ban public gatherings of 10 or more people
 without a permit. (No permits were requested in 1989.)
 Political parties and other groups, including some labor
 unions, viewed as political are banned. Private organizations
 must be registered, though some operate without licenses.
 Palestinian charitable, community, professional, and self-help
 organizations were permitted to operate unless their
 activities were viewed as overtly political or supporting the
 uprising. Persons involved in such activities were arrested,
 interrogated, administratively detained, or denied permission
 to travel.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is respected in the occupied territories.
 No group or sect is banned on religious grounds. Muslim and
 Christian holy days are observed. Both faiths operate schools
 and institutions (although religious schools were subject to
 the same extended closure as other West Bank schools).
 Religious publications circulate subject to the laws for
 publications detailed in Section 2.a.
 In the wake of a demonstration in the al-Aqsa mosque area in
 Jerusalem, which resulted in some worshipers at the Western
 Wall below being pelted with stones, the Israeli authorities
 restricted access to the Al-Aqsa mosque during the Muslim holy
 month of Ramadan and the Id al-Adha holiday. Security forces
 raided-mosques and confiscated mosque loudspeakers, claiming
 security reasons. There was no indication that such raids or
 arrests of Muslim clergy were directed at religious freedom
 but rather at political or security-related activities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Occupied Territories,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement was restricted periodically in the West
 Bank and Gaza by IDF curfews, which were often prolonged to
 discourage protest activities. Hundreds of curfews, some
 
 
 1441
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 lasting several weeks, were imposed. During curfews, people
 were usually allowed to leave their houses to obtain food and
 medical care for short, defined periods. These curfews caused
 severe hardship.
 All residents of the West Bank and/or Gaza were sometimes
 prevented from traveling to East Jerusalem or Israel. Peace
 advocacy groups from Israel were sometimes forbidden to visit
 Palestinian villages, for alleged security reasons.
 Thousands of Palestinians in the occupied territories travel
 abroad each year. Israel imposed travel restraints on some
 political activists and on family members of some deportees.
 There were cases in which young men were denied permission to
 travel unless they agreed to remain abroad for an extended
 time. Exit travel permits were delayed for some Palestinians
 returning abroad for work or study after visiting relatives in
 the occupied territories. According to figures from the
 Islamic Waqf, which supervises mosques and Islamic properties
 in the occupied territories, over 90 percent of the Muslims
 who applied were permitted to make the hajj. Palestinians
 claim that those denied permission were denied because of
 nationalist activity.
 There are no obstacles to emigration. Israel sometimes
 refuses to renew laissez-passers of Palestinians from the
 occupied territories who live or work abroad on the grounds
 that they have abandoned their residence, even though they may
 not have acquired foreign citizenship. Palestinians who
 obtain foreign citizenship are ordinarily not allowed to
 resume residence in the occupied territories. They are
 permitted to return as tourists only and sometimes are denied
 entry entirely. Enforcement of the 3-month limit for tourist
 visas for stays by Palestinians is uneven.
 Entry or residency permission is frequently denied spouses,
 relatives, and children following the emigration Of the head
 of the household. According to press reports, at least 100
 spouses were deported for lack of residence permits in 1989.
 Persons who marry Palestinians in the occupied territories
 generally are not allowed to take up residence there. Israel
 has also denied the return of former West Bank residents who
 were not present in the territories, for whatever reason, at
 the time of the 1967 census.
 Requests for family reunification far exceed the numbers of
 those granted. Palestinians say thousands of family
 reunification requests are pending. According to the
 Government of Israel, in 1988 and 1989 a total of 3,266 family
 reunification applications were filed for the West Bank, of
 which 695 were approved.   For Gaza, 278 applications were
 filed in 1988 and, through July 1989, 219 were filed. Figures
 on the number approved for Gaza are not available. Israeli
 officials acknowledge that family reunification is limited for
 demographic and political reasons and assert that the laws of
 occupation do not require Istael to permit immigration into
 the territories. Restrictions on residence, tourist visas,
 reentry, and family reunification do not apply to Jews
 resident in the occupied territories, whether or not they are
 Israeli citizens.
 
 
 1442
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government.
 The West Bank and Gaza are ruled under occupation by Israel's
 Ministry of Defense through a military governor and civil
 administration. Palestinians have no means to participate in
 significant policy decisions concerning land and resource use
 and planning, taxation, trade, and industry. Municipal
 elections were last held in 1976 in the West Bank, and most
 mayors elected then were later dismissed on security grounds.
 Palestinians appointed by Israel have filled most vacancies.
 Some appointed mayors have resigned or stopped working because
 of the uprising and, in some cases, threats from other
 Palestinians. One Israeli-appointed municipal secretary was -
 killed -by other Palestinians.
 East Jerusalem is governed as part of Israel. Arab residents
 of East Jerusalem are permitted to vote in municipal elections
 but have largely boycotted them. In the 1989 Jerusaiem
 elections, less than 5 percent of Jerusalem's Arab population
 voted.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights.
 Israel normally permits international human rights groups to
 visit the occupied territories. Israel cooperates with a
 number of such organizations, and officials are generally
 available for meetings on human rights issues. However, some
 of these organizations often complain that Israel's responses
 are inadequate, not all inquiries receive answers, and some
 groups' requests for meetings with officials or access to
 detention facilities are denied.
 Many local groups--Israeli, Palestinian, and mixed--are
 concerned with human rights.  Their publications and
 statements are generally allowed to circulate in the occupied
 territories.. They are allowed to hold press conferences.
 Individuals working for a prominent Palestinian legal rights
 organization were detained, beaten, prevented from traveling
 freely, and harassed at military checkpoints.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status.
 Israeli settlers in the occupied territories are subject to
 Israeli law, while Palestinians live under military occupation
 law. Under the dual system of governance applied to
 Palestinians--both Muslim and Christian--and Israelis,
 Palestinians are treated less favorably than Israeli settlers
 on a broad range of issues, including the right to due
 process, right of residency, freedom of movement, sale of
 crops and goods, land and water use, and access to health and
 social services. Israeli settlers involved in security
 violations have been treated far more leniently than
 Palestinians guilty of similar offenses. Offenses against
 Israelis are investigated and prosecuted more vigorously than
 offenses against Palestinians. Israelis have residency rights
 in the occupied territories under Israel's Law of Return,
 regardless whether they have foreign nationality.
 Israel continued to place land under its control for military
 purposes, roads, settlements, and other purposes which
 restrict use by Palestinians and discriminate in favor of
 
 
 1443
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Israeli settlers against Palestinians. Palestinians do not
 participate in the Higher Planning Council, which plans land
 use in the occupied territories and exercises planning powers
 transferred from local, municipal, and village councils in
 1971. Issuance of permits to Palestinians for house
 construction is tightly restricted.
 The Israeli Civil Administration provides basic services. In
 1989 such services were sharply reduced due to the economic
 disruption caused by the uprising and a Palestinian tax
 boycott. There was no public accounting of revenue and
 expenditure.
 Palestinians and persons of Arab descent entering the West
 Bank via the Jordan River bridges, regardless of citizenship,
 are subject to extensive searches, and many complain of harsh
 or humiliating treatment. Israel limits the funds visitors or
 residents may bring into the occupied territories for
 Palestinian use to about $300 per person per month unless
 Israeli authorities grant permission in advance. There are no
 limits on funds for Israeli settlers.
 There is no legal discrimination against women. Violence
 against women is not legally condoned. The participation rate
 of women in the labor force is low, and exists primarily in
 traditional professions and occupations, although there are
 exceptions. Women's societies flourish and play an important
 social role.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 The applicable sections for West Bank and Gaza Palestinians
 working in Jerusalem and Israel are contained in the country
 report for Israel. Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem
 have the same rights and are governed by the same law as
 workers in Israel.
 a. The Right of Association
 The labor law in force in the West Bank is Jordanian Law No.
 21 of 1960, as amended by military orders. It permits workers'
 to join unions without prior government authorization. It
 also permits the formation of unions by any group of 20 or
 more workers from the same trade or workplace, with prior
 government authorization. The International Labor
 Organization (ILO) Director General's report has noted that
 the Israeli authorities have approved no applications since
 1979. No petitions were submitted in 1989. Out of
 approximately 90 unions functioning in the West Bank, 31 are
 licensed.
 Israeli authorities, citing security concerns, actively
 discourage union activities in the West Bank. The authorities
 state that the West Bank umbrella federations and many
 individual unions are fronts for illegal political
 organizations rather than trade unions. Israel claims that no
 legitimate union activities are disrupted and that its actions
 are intended to prevent illicit political activity.
 More than 100,000 West Bank Palestinians, representing a full
 range of blue-collar and white-collar professions, were
 members of approximately 90 trade unions in 1989. Unions
 belong to one of three organizations, all calling themselves
 the General Federation of Trade Unions in the West Bank
 (GFTU). The largest GFTU claims membership in the
 
 
 1444
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions (ICATU),
 although the Tunis-based Palestinian Trade Union Federation
 (PTUF) is ICATU's affiliate of record. Two GFTU's have
 applied for membership in the International Confederation of'
 Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). There is no connection between any
 of the West Bank unions and the Government of Israel or the
 Israeli Histadrut Labor Federation.
 Military Order (M.O.) 825 of 1980 requires that Palestinian
 unions present lists of candidates for union office to the
 Civil Administration (CIVAD) for approval 30 days before
 elections. CIVAD has said that it will enforce M.O. 825 by
 disallowing the election of candidates not approved in
 advance. The order authorizes the CIVAD to remove from the
 lists any candidates who have b.een convicted of a felory or
 misdemeanor. Because Palestinian trade unionists fear that
 the CIVAD will use the order to exclude those candidates who
 have served in administrative detention, they refuse to adhere
 to the order.
 Like all organizations and individuals in the occupied
 territories, Palestinian labor organizations are subject to
 disciplinary measures for engaging in political activities.
 The premises of the GFTU in Nablus remained closed on the
 grounds they had been used for political rather than union
 activities. Union-related meetings of 10 or more persons must
 have the prior approval of the CIVAD.
 There has been no dissolution of unions by administrative or
 legislative action. Under prevailing labor law, unions have
 the right to strike only after submitting a complaint to the
 CIVAD for mandatory arbitration. No strikes have been
 authorized under this procedure. However, authorities have
 not interfered with unauthorized strikes called over strictly
 labor issues. More than 20 such strikes took place in the
 West Bank in 1989.
 Union leaders have been among those detained for alleged
 security offenses. GFTU leaders have been denied permission
 to travel to ILO conferences, but they and their
 representatives have been permitted to travel abroad at the
 invitation of labor organizations in other countries.
 Delegations from the ICFTU and foreign trade unions, in
 addition to the annual ILO mission, visited the West Bank in
 1989 and met with the GFTU leaders.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Collective bargaining is protected. The CIVAD does not record
 collective agreements because some unions and/or their leaders
 are not legally recognized. However, most union-employer
 agreements are honored without interference from the
 authorities. The only legal forum for labor grievances in the
 West Bank is the CIVAD's military court system. Palestinians
 view the system as unsympathetic and prefer to use the
 traditional technique of mediation by community notables.
 There are no export processing zones in the occupied
 territories.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced or compulsory labor in the occupied
 territories. Under existing law applicable to the occupied
 territories, there is no statutory ban on forced labor.

 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 Forced labor is, however, banned (except under certain
 exceptional circumstances) by the Fourth Geneva Convention.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 A 1978 military order raised the minimum working age in the
 West Bank and Gaza to 14, and there are no known instances of
 child labor in industry or construction.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 In the West Bank, Jordanian law allows a maximum workweek of
 48 hours, except for certain hotel, food service, and cinema
 employees, whose workweek is 54 hours. In Gaza, Israeli
 authorities amended this law to provide for a 45-hour workweek
 for day laborers and a 40-hour week for salaried employees.
 There is no effective enforcement of maximum workweek laws.
 There is no minimum wage provision in the West Bank or Gaza.
 The Ministry of Labor's inspection service is charged with
 enforcing health and safety standards in the West Bank and
 Gaza, but no inspections take place.
