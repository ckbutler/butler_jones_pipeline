 MONACO
 Monaco, with a population of 30,000, is a constitutional monarchy in which the
 sovereign Prince plays a leading role in governing the country. The Prince names
 the four-member Government, which is headed by a Minister of State, assisted by
 
 
 982
 Counselors of Government for the Interior, for Public Works and Social Affairs, and
 for Finance and the Economy. Each is individually responsible to the Prince. Legis-
 lative power is shared between the Prince and the popularly elected, 18-member Na-
 tional Council. There are in addition three consultative bodies, whose members are
 appointed by the Prince. These are the 7-member Crown Council, the 12-member
 Council of State, and the 30-member Economic Council, which includes representa-
 tives of employers and the trade union movement.
 The national police force has four branches, including an investigative one. Secu-
 rity duty and ceremonial representation are carried out by the "Carabiniers du
 Prince." All these forces are controlled by and responsive to government officials.
 The principal economic activities in Monaco are services and banking, light manu-
 facturing, and tourism.
 Individual human rights are provided for in the Constitution and respected in
 practice. The Constitution distinguishes between those rights that are guaranteed
 all residents and those that apply only to the 5,000 who hold Monegasque national-
 ity. The latter include free education, financial assistance in case of unemployment
 or illness, and the right to vote and hold elective office. The 1993 National Council
 elections brought a second political party into the Council for the first time. Women
 traditionally have played a less active role than men in public life, but this is chang-
 ing. Women currently hold both elective and appointive offices. The first female po-
 lice officers were hired in 1993.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Such incidents are unkown in
 Monaco.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no instances of disappearance or abduction.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Such practices are barred by the Constitution. These prohibitions are respected in
 fact. There is no public record of any complaint of police brutality.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution bars arbitrary arrest.
 Arrest warrants are required in all cases other than those in which the detainee
 is taken into custody while committing an offense. The detainee must be brougt
 before a judge within 24 hours to be informed of the reason for the arrest and 's
 rights under the law. Most detainees are released without bail, but an individual
 may be held in investigative detention if the investigating magistrate has reason to
 believe the person might flee or that his release would compromise the magistrate's
 investigation of the case. The initial 2-month period of detention may be renewed
 if necessary. Those detained have the right to counsel, at public expense if nec-
 essary.
 Attorneys have access to detainees. Family members may see the detainee at the
 discretion of the investigating magistrate.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Under the 1962 Constituion, the Prince delegated
 his judicial powers to an independent judiciary which renders justice in his name.
 The right oF fairr public trial is guaranteed in law and respected in practice. The
 defendant has the right to be present and the right to counsel, at public expense
 if necessary. As under French law, a three-judge tribunal considers the evidence
 amassed by the investigating magistrate and hears the arguments presented by the
 prosecuting and defense attorneys. The defendant en'oys a   resumption of inno-
 cence. Exercise of the right of appeal must be made within 10 Says in criminal cases
 and 30 days in civil ones.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The in-
 dividual's right of privacy in personal and family life, at home, and in correspond-
 ence is guaranteedby the Constitution and respected in practice.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and the Press.-Freedom of expression is guaranteed. The
 Monegasque Penal Code, however, prohibits public denunciat .ns of the ruling fam-
 ily. Several local periodicals are published in Monaco. Foreign newspapers an mag-
 azines, including editions of French papers that specifically cover news in the Prin-
 cipality, circulate freely. Foreign radio and television are easily received. The tele-
 vision and radio stations that broadcast from the Principality operate in accordance
 with French and Italian regulations. Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution gives
 Monegasque nationals the rights of peaceful assembly and association. Outdoor
 meetings require police authorization. Such authorization is not withheld for politi-
 
 
 983
 cal or other arbitrary reasons. Associations must be registered and authorized by
 the Government.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Roman Catholicism is the state religion. Free practice of
 all other religions is guaranteed in law and respected in fact.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Residents of Monaco move freely within the country and across its open
 borders with France. Monegasque nationals enjoy the rights of emigration and repa.
 triation. They can be deprived of their nationality only for specified acts, including
 naturalization in a foreign state. Only the Prince can grant or restore Monegasque
 nationality. On such questions, he is obliged by the Constitution to consult the
 Crown Council.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The fundamental difference between the Monegasque Constitution of 1911 and
 the 1962 Constitution which replaced it is that the latter cannot be suspended, nor
 can it be revised except by common agreement between the Prince and the National
 Council. The Prince plays an active role in government exercising his authority in
 conformity with the provisions of the Constitution and Monegasque law. Specifically,
 the Prince names the Minister of State (in effect, the Prime Minister) from among
 a list of names proposed to him by the French Government. He names as well the
 three Counselors of Government (of whom the one responsible for the interior is nor-
 mally a French national). Together the four compose the Government. Each is indi-
 vidually responsible to the Prince.
 Only the Prince may initiate legislation, although the 18- member National Coun-
 cil may send propsals for legislation to the Government for consideration. Passage
 of legislation an adoption of the budget require the assent of the Council. Elections,
 which take place every 5 years are fre and by secret ballot. All adult Monegasques
 have the right to vote. Two political parties are currently represented on the Coun-
 cil. There is one independent member.
 The Constitution provides for three consultative bodies. The seven-member Crown
 Council (composed exclusively of Monegasque nationals) must be consulted by the
 Prince regarding certain questions of national importance (ratification of treaties,
 dissolution of the National Council). He may choose to consult it on other matters
 as well. The 12-member Council of State advises the Prince on proposed legislation
 and regulations. The 30-member Economic Council advises the Government on so-
 cial, financial, and economic questions. One-third of its members come from lists
 prposd by die trade union movement and one third from those prepared by the
 employers' federation.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While the Government imposes no impediments, no local groups devoted to mon-
 itoring human rights exist. There have been no requests from outside groups to in-
 vestigate human rights conditions in Monaco.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides that all Monegasque nationals are equal before the law.
 It differentiates between rights that are accorded nationals (including preference in
 employment, free education and assistance to the ill or unemployed) and those guar-
 anteedto all residents (freedom of religion, inviolability of the home).
 Women.-Women are becoming increasingly active in public life. The Mayor of
 Monaco is a woman, as is one member of the National Council. Six of Monaco's 19
 lawyers are women, as are 6 of 41 physicians and 8 of 22 dentists. No comparable
 statistics are available for women in the business world, where women are not as
 well represented as in the professions. The law governing transmission of citizen-
 ship was recently revised to assure equality of treatment between men and women
 who are Monegasque by birth. However, women who acquire Monegasque national-
 ity by naturalization cannot transmit it to their children, whereas naturalized male
 citizens can. Violence against women is unusual. Marital violence is strictly prohib-
 ited. Married women may bring criminal charges against their husbands should
 such incidents occur.
 Children.-The Government is committed to protecting children's rights and wel-
 fare. Government subsidies to families with children begin with the birth of the first
 child.
 People with Disabilities.-The Government has mandated that public buildings
 provide for access by the disabled.
 
 
 Section 6, Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have been free to form unions since the end
 of World War ]I. Fewer than 10 percent of workers belong to unions, and relatively
 few of these are resident in the Principality. Unions are independent of both the
 Government and Monegasque political parties. At its origin, however, the
 Monegasque trade union movement was assisted by the French General Confed-
 eration of Labor (CGT), which has links to the Communist Party. The Constitution
 specifies that .:orkers enjoy the right to strike in conformity with relevant legisla-
 tion. Government workers, however, may not strike. Several small strikes took place
 in 1993. The Monegasque Confederation of Unions has requested the Government
 to join the International Labor Organization (ILO), which it has yet to do. The Con-
 federation itself sought membership in the European Confederation of Unions, but
 its initial application was refused, possibly because of its early association with the
 Communist CGT. A subsequent application was pending at year's end.
 b. The Right to Orqanize and Hargain Collecttvely.-The law provides for the free
 exercise of union activity. Workers are guaranteed by law the same salary received
 by comparable workers in the neighboring area of France plus 5 percent. They are
 free to negotiate higher wages with their employers if they can. Agreements on
 working conditions are negotiated between organizations representing employers in
 a given sector of the economy and the union representing workers in that sector.
 Antiunion discrimination is prohibited. Union representatives can be fired only with
 the agreement of a commission that includes two representatives of the emplayers'
 association and two representatives of the labor movement. Allegations that an em-
 ployee has been fired for union activity may be brought before the Labor Court,
 which can order, inter alia, the payment of damages with interest.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.--Such practices are outlawed in
 Monaco and do not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 is 16 years. Special conditions apply to the employment of workers aged 16 to 18.
 Attendance at school is mandatory to age 16. The attendance requirement is en-
 forced by the National Education, Youth, and Sports Agency.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legal minimum wage for full-time work .is
 $1,047 (6,180 French francs) per month. Most workers receive more than the mini-
 mum wage. The legal workweek is 39 hours. Health and safety standards are fixed
 by law and government decree. These standards are enforced by health and safety
 committees in the workplace and by the government Labor Inspector.
