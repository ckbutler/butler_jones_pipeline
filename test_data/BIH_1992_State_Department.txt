 BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
 Bosnia and Herzegovina, one of the six constituent republics of the former Social-
 ist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, was formally recognized as an independent State
 _in early Apri but swiftly fell victim to some of the most widespread and egregious
 human rights abuses witnessed in the past 50 years. Paramilitary forces (both Ser-
 bian and7Bosnian Serbian), armed and abetted by t ararmy of the former Yugo-
 lavia (JNA) and the political leadership of Serbia under Slobodan Milosevic, com-
 mitted the vast maority of these abuses against Bosnian Muslims. Limitations of
 space and the standardized format used in this report make it difficult to detail the
 true scope and horror of the atrocities committed by these Serbian forces. To be
 sure, members of other ethnic groups in the former Yugoslavia, including Croats
 and, to a much lesser extent, Bosnian Muslims, were respnsible for human rights
 violations directed in almost all cases against members o: other ethnic groups, par-
 ticularly Serbs. However, the atrocities of the Croats and Bosnian Muslims pale in
 comparison to the sheer scale and calculated cruelty of the killings and other abuses
 committed by Serbian and Bosnian Serbian forces against Bosnian Muslims, osten-
 sibly in defense of the interests of Serbs in Bosnia.
 Much of the earliest violence (predating recognition) was caused by paramilitary
 units from Serbia and Montenegro which carried out acts of terror and intimidation
 against non-Serbs. The war did not break out spontaneously but was consciously
 stimulated from the outside in the absence of any significant threat to the safety
 of the Serbian population. The greatest atrocity--the systematic shelling and starva-
 tion by siege of larg cities--was carried out by Serbian forces, which alone had both
 the means and the will to carry out such crimes against humanity. Civilians were
 the primary targets of military action, making a mockery of the Geneva Conven-
 tions. Accompanying abuses of individuals and groups of non-Serbs took almost
 every conceivable form of torture, humiliation, and killng. The policy of driving out
 innocent civilians of a different ethnic or religious group from their homes, so-called
 ethnic cleansing, was practiced by Serbian forces in Bosnia on a scale that dwarfs
 anthn seen in Europe since Nazi times.
 Bosnian politics had undeone growing ethnic polarization since the 1990 elec-
 tions which resulted in the three nationalist arties-the Muslim Party of Demo-
 cratic Action (SDA), the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), and the Serbian Demo-
 cratic Party (SDS)-forming a governing "partnership" under the leadership of
 President Albia Izetbegovic a Muslim. Muslims and Croats in the governing coali-
 tion wanted independence for Bosnia and Herzegovina, while Bosnian Serbs insisted
 it was their right to remain within "Yugoslavia." In January SDS leaders pro-
 claimed their own Serbian entity within Bosnia, claiming 70 percent of the territory.
 In a referendum on February 29-March 1, over 63 percent of the Bosnian elector-
 ate voted in favor of sovereignty and independence for the Republic. However, the
 SDS, led by Radovan Karadzic, boycotted the referendum, and on March 1 its armed
 followers erected barricades in Sarajevo. By the time Bosnia and Herzegovina
 achieved international recognition on April 6, Serbian paramilitary forces, reinforced
 by the JNA, had begun a campaign of terror in the eastern Bosnian town of
 Biebina, and the SDS was completing the withdrawal of its members from Bosnian
 institutions.
 By mid-April, Bosnian territorial defense forces blockaded .JNA installations in
 Sarajevo and elsewhere, demanding that the dNA turn over its weapons. In early
 May, the JNA announced it would withdraw from Bosnia and Herzegovina by May
 19, but in fact it pulled out no more than 15 percent of its personnel, asserting the
 rest were Bosnian Serbs and leaving behind an arsenal of heavy weaponry, includ-
 ing tanks and warplanes. SDS leaders began in A pil to create institutions (includ-
 ing "the Serbian Ar-my commanded by a former JNA general) for this entity, which
 they later named "the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina." Croatian na-
 tionalists led by Mate Boban, vice president of the HDZ and leader of the Croatian
 Defense Council (HVO), prbclaimed their own entity within Bosnia, which they
 called "the Croatia Community of Herceg-Bosna." Troop strength of the HVO is be-
 tween 20,000 and 30,000; many were trained in Croatia and received weapons from
 the Croatian Government. Beginning in April, SDS and former JNA forces seized
 territory in northern and eastern Bosnia, expelled much of the non-Serbian popu-
 lation in a systematic campaign of terror that became known as "ethnic cleansing,"
 and carried out massive artillery attacks against Sarajevo and other population cen-
 ters.
 In the early months of 1992, several thousand men belonging to the paramilitary
 Croatian Defense Forces (HOS) of the extremist Croatian Party of Right (HSP) were
 deployed in Western Herzegovina; many of these reportedly were Bosnian Croats
 
 
 720
 who joined the Croatian Armed Forces during the war there in 1991. When violence
 broke out in March in Bosanski Brod, regular units of the Croatian Armed Forces
 were enaged against Serbian paramilitary groups which were operating with JNA
 support. egular Croatian forces were also engaged against Serbian forces in subse-
 Wuent fighting in the "northern corridor" between Baqa Luka in the west and
 BIebjina in the east, and in Herzegovina, as far east as Trebinje. The Bosnian Gov-
 ernment has never objected to the presence of Croatian forces on its territory, how-
 ever, and has welcomed their support in resisting aggression against Bosnia by Ser-
 bia and Montenegro. Similarly, although the H VO is in fact controlled (through
 Mate Boban's hard-line faction of the HDZ) by Zagreb rather than Sarajevo and has
 clashed on several occasions with Bosnian Muslim forces, it is considered by the
 Bosnian Government to be part of the Bosnian Armed Forces.
 Bosnian forces were initially called the Territorial Defense Force; this was later
 altered to the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Croatian armed forces in
 Bosnia and Herzegovina include members of the Armed Forces of the Republic of
 Croatia as well as HVO.
 Many civilians were taken prisoner, primarily by Serbian forces but also by Cro-
 atian militias and the primarily Muslim Bosnian government forces, and held in
 p rison camps, often under the most brutal and inhumane conditions. While precise
 fgres were not available, the number of refugees from Bosnia exceeded 1.5 million
 more than one-third of the population, and the number of dead and missing reached
 into the tens of thousands. All of Bosnia and Herzegovina suffered terribly, but eth-
 nic Muslims were the most severely affected and accounted for the largest share of
 casualties and of displaced persons. As winter set in, Bosnia and Herzegovina faced
 a humanitarian disaster, as many tens of thousands of undernourished people with-
 out proper shelter faced possible death from starvation and exposure.
 As a result of the aggression against Bosnia, the U.N. Security Council (UNSC)
 on May 30 adopted Resolution 757, imposing comprehensive sanctions on Serbia/
 Montenegro, cutting off economic relations between them and all U.N. member
 states, while providing exceptions for food an medicines.
 U.N. peacekeeping forces (UNPROFOR) were present in Bosnia before Serbian
 forces unleashed the war there in April, since UNPROFOR headquarters for the de-
 ployment in Croatia was initially located in Sarajevo. While UNPROFOR head-
 quarters were subsequently withdrawn from Sar o a      ate Bosnian operation
 was authorized by Resolution 758, adopted on June 8, which extended the
 UNPROFOR's mandate and specifically sought to facilitate the reopening of Sara-
 jevo airport for the delivery of humanitarian relief on the basis of an agreement be-
 tween the Bosnian Government and Karadzic's SDS. In August the UNSC adopted
 Resolution 770, authorizing the use of "all necessary means to ensure the delivery
 of humanitarian relief in Bosnia. In October UNSC resolution 781 established a ban
 on military flights in the airs pace of Bosnia and Herzegovina, though by the end
 of the year agreement had not be en reached on enforcement of the ban.
 A staff report on "ethnic cleansing" in Bosnia issued in August 1992 by the US.
 Senate Foreign Relations Committee found there was prima_ facie evidence that Ser-
 bian forces had perpetrated war crimes and crimes against humanity, and an inter-
 national human rights organization's report on war crimes in Bosnia issued at the
 same time found prima facie evidence that genocide was taking place.
 In response to proliferating reports of gross human rights violations in Bosnia,
 particularly by the Bosnian Serb forces, the UNSC in August ado pted .Resolution
 771, caing on all parties to respect international humanitarian law, demanding
 unimpeded access for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and
 other international humanitarian organizations to all prisons and detention centers,
 inviting the submission to the USC of information concerning serious violations of
 humanitarian law in the former Yugoslavia, and asking the Sdecretary General to
 report to the Council on information received and possible measures to be taken.
 In October the Security Council established a Commission of Experts, chaired by ju-
 rist Frit Kalshoven, to investigate charges of war crimes in the former Yugoslavia.
 The United States Government has submitted to the United Nations summary re-
 ports of such atrocities, totaling over 50 pages and encompassing thousands of in-
 stances of killings, torture, rape, and other abuse, which themselves represent only
 a small fraction of the offenses committed. Illustrative examples of these abuses ap-
 pear in appropriate sections of this report.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-In the circumstances of the Bosnian
 war it ws dimcult to distinuish targeted kilings from killings resulting from in-
 
 
 721
 discriminate attacks. (See Section 1.g. for a description of large-scale war-related
 atrocities committed against civilians, including killings.) Before the outbreak of war
 in April, there were a number of killings that appeared to be politically or ethnically
 motivated. In January the head of the Muslim Bosnjak Organization (MBO-an op-
 position political party) in Bijeijina, Abdulah Kovacevic, was murdered. In February
 an ethnic Croat who headed the referendum commission in Glamoc was killed. In
 neither case were the killers apprehended. Some members of the MBO charged that
 Kovacevic was killed by Serbian paramilitary members in collusion with the JNA.
 It appears that the man killed in Glamoc was the victim of Serbian nationalists op-
 posed to the referendum on independence, but this has not been proven.
 In several instances, persons working for international organizations were killed
 in what appeared to be deliberate attacks. The ICRC delegate in Sarajevo, Frederic
 Maurice, was killed in June when his convoy came under fire as it entered the city.
 A Belgian member of the European Community (EC) monitoring mission was killed
 south of Mostar in April, appalrently in an attack by SDS forces. In August Amer-
 ican journalist David Kaplan was killed by a sniper while traveling in a motorcade
 in Sarajevo with "Yugoslav" Prime Minister Milan Panic. On September 3, an Ital-
 ian plane participating in the Sarajevo airlift was shot down west of the city; inves-
 tigators were unable to determine who fired on the aircraft. By October, five mem-
 bers of the UNPROFOR contingent in Sarajevo had been killed; in one incident, two
 French soldiers were killed by fire from Bosnian government positions.
 b. Disappearance.-In the chaos that accompanied the Bosnian war, the number
 of missing people reached into the tens of thousands, and only rough estimates of
 the total were possible. Bosnian government figures as of early October put the
 number of missing at 57,000, of whom about 8,500 were said to be children. There
 are no reliable figures for the number of persons missing as a result of the Bosnian
 war. (See Section l.g. for a description of the circumstances resulting in these dis-
 appearances.)
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 In prison camps operated by each faction-the Srbian SDS, the Croatian HVO, and
 the predominantly Muslim Bosnian Government--inmates were subjected to beat-
 ings, sometimes leading to death, intimidation, and other forms of inhuman treat-
 ment. In Serb-run camps, many prisoners were subjected to the most brutal forms
 of torture and murder their captors could devise. International observers formally
 ained access to some prison camps in July, including those operated by Serbian
 orces in northwest Bosnia (e.g., Omarska, Trnopolje, Majaca) and by the HVO in
 western Herzegovina (e.g., Liubuski, Capljina, Mostar). Later missions gained access
 to camps operated by the Bosnian Government where Serbian civilians were held
 (e.g., Konjic, Viktor Bubaj barracks in Sarajevo).
 Refugee accounts indicate that the mistreatment of prisoners in SDS camps ex-
 tended to beating and egregious forms of torture and mutilation, as well as killing.
 According to refugee accounts, in a number of SDS camps, physical mutilation of
 prisoners extended to deliberate disfigurement and excision of body parts. System-
 atic rape has been used, largely against the Muslim population, by the Bosnian
 Serbs as part of their "ethnic cleansing" campaign.
 At Keraterm, there were reports of murders of prisoners, with inmates forced to
 carry their bodies out and stack them on trucks to be transported elsewhere. At the
 Trnopoje camp, Serbian soldiers wandered through nightly, brutally beatings the
 male prisoners and randomly raping female prisoners. In Serbian camps near Foca,
 Muslim women were repeatedly raped, according to refugee accounts.
 In Livno and Tomislavgrad, Croatian paramilitary forces, which took over from
 civilian authorities in April, forbade Serbian residents to leave. In September the
 Thomson mission of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)
 inspected two sites in Livno where a total of 79 Serbs were incarcerated and appar-
 ently subjected to beatings. The mission reported that the three rooms holding pris-
 oners in the Livno police station were overcrowded and lacked heating and that
 there were signs that prisonrs had been beaten. The Thomson mission also visited
 the village of Rascani, in Toislavgrad district, where about 250 Serbs, mostly
 women and children, some of whom had been brought to Rascani after their homes
 were demolished, were held prisoner and subjected to abuse by Croatian national-
 ists. According to credible refugee accounts, FIOS forces were involved in the deten-
 tion and mistreatment of Serbian civilians, including the rape of female prisoners.
 Bosnian government authorities operating a prison in the Viktr Bubanj barracks
 in Sarajevo subjected Serbian prisoners to bestings; the facility also held a number
 of female prisoners, including some elderly women and one pregnant woman. Ac-
 cording to the account of a refugee who said she was imprisoned in the Bubanj bar-
 racks during July and August, women inmates there as well as men were subject
 
 
 722
 to beatings by the guards, and in one incident medical assistance was withheld from
 women prisoners injured by glass shattered by an exploding shell.
 Karadzic and his supporter, in addition. to denying charges of systematic and
 widespread  rape  of   us     woren by      osman  Serb forces, have made
 countercharges against Bosnian Muslim and Croatian forces. These outrageous inci-
 dents of violence against Serbian women are the by-product of war and not part of
 a campag   of "ethnic cleansing." The CSCE Thomson mission found that the HVO
 held 75 Serbs, half of them women, at the city prison. Prisoners were forced to work
 constructing bunkers and cleaning up rubble from Serbian shelling and were beaten
 if they refused, according to refugee accounts. According to refugee accounts several
 dozen Serbian women were raped while confined to their homes in Novi drad and
 other villages near Odzak by Croatian forces during June. According to these ac-
 counts, the rapes were committed by local Creats, not by members of regular Cro-
 atian Armed Forces, who were present in the area at the time.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The onset of fighting in many parts of
 Bosnia and Herzegovina and the virtual siege of Sarajevo rendered the criminal jus-
 tice system inoperable. In addition to instances of mass detention of civilians in
 prison camps (treated in Section 1.g. below), there were a number of cases of deten-
 tion of prominent individuals for political purposes.
 On his return to Sarvjevo from an international conference in April, Bosnian
 President Izetbegovic was abducted by the JNA, which offered his release in return
 for the guaranteed safe passage of Second Military District commander General
 Milutin Kukaac, who was in a blockaded JNA installation in the city. Both men
 were release  but there was a dispute between the two sides over the terms of the
 agreement.   e JNA attempted to withdraw a contingent of men and equipment
 from the barracks together with Kukanjac, and Bosnian forces fired on the with-
 drawing JNA column, killing as many as six JNA personnel.
 In September an ethnic Serbian writer and former member of the SDS, Vladimir
 Srebrov, was arrested near Sarajevo when he attempted to cross "Serbian Army"
 lines on a peace mission. Srebrov, a harsh critic of Radovan Karadzic, was forcibly
 removed to the Kula prison at the former JNA barracks at Lukavica, and the SD)
 threatened to try him for treason.
 On numerous occasions in Sarajevo, local police on their owninitiative detained
 prominent citizens of Serbian nationality for questioning. Senior Bosnian officials
 repeatedly intervened to obtain the release of detainees but were unable to prevent
 arrests from occurring.
 The Bosnian Government did not practice exile. The practice of "ethnic cleansing"
 y Serbian forces in Bosnia resulted in de facto exile for tens of thousands of non-
 Serbs (see Section 1.g.).
 e. Denial of Fair lubli, Trial.-In the context of the war, there was no guarantee
 of a fair public trial for the accused anywhere in Bosnia, regardless of whose forces
 were in control. By the summer of 1992, the authority of Bosnia's government insti-
 tutins generally was limited to a small area, including the cities of Sarajevo,
 Zenica, Tuzla, Grazde, Srebrenica, and Bihac, and surrounding areas. Even there,
 the civil justice system had collapsed along with civil government generally, and ef-
 fective power rested largely in the hands of Bosnian military authorities or militias,
 and the Bosnian Government's ability and inclination to protect the rights of citi-
 zens, particularly ethnic Serbs, declined steadily.
 In areas controlled by the HVO and "the Serbian Army," legal rights of non-
 Croats and non-Serbs, respectively, were severely abridged, as were those of all citi-
 zens who did not accept the legitimacy of the "governments" proclaimed by the para-
 military forces or who ran afoul of local militia leaders.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Efforts
 by republic and local authorities to monitor political activity were widespread in the
 period preceding the outbreak of war. The Bosnian Government admitted that it
 monitored telephone communications of SDS members in the Government when it
 publicized their conversations with political leaders in Serbia. Similarly, the police
 of the "Serbian Republic" monitored telephone conversations of citizens and interro-
 gated citizens about specific conversations, without attempting to conceal that
 eavesdropping was taking place.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Viwlations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Violations of humanitarian law and international conventions on the treat-
 ment of civilians in time of war were so egregious and systematic as to defy full
 description. Thece violations fell into several categories, including: indiscriminate
 attacks against civilians, including massacres; detention of civilians and the worst
 kinds of torture and killings of prisoners; forced movements of populations; and use
 of paramilitary groups, including criminals. Because of the extent of the violence in

 for which reliable information is currently available. Accurate figures for total cas-
 ualties are not available. In late December, a Bosnian government spokesman said
 that 130,000 people had been killed in the Bosnian war, including 8,000 residents
 of Sarajevo. Us. submissions to the United Nations to date on war crimes in Bosnia
 and Herzegovina reflect well over 25,000 deaths.
 While all sides were guilty of purposefully carrying out violence against civilians,
 attacks on population centers were a central feature of the behavior of the 'Serbian
 Army" and its paramilitary allies. Even after the passage of UNSC Resolution 770
 Serbian forces frequently prevented the delivery of humanitarian aid to cities an
 towns they were besieging and cut off basic services, including electricity and water,
 to the civilian population.
 From the beginning of the war in April, SDS paramilitary forces in the hills
 around Sarajevo bombarded the city causing heavy civilian casualties day after day.
 The 'Serbian Army's" assault killed thousands of innocent people and damaged or
 destroyed hospitals, schools, redidential buildings, mosques, churches, and all kinds
 of civilian facilities. The attacks on Sarajevo became even more brutal and frequent
 after May 19, when Ratko Mladic assumed the position of commander of the "Ser-
 bian Army" as well as direct supervision of the siege of the Bosnian capital. In July
 a University of Sarajevo demographer estimated the average daily death toll in Sa-
 rajev as a result of the attacks on the city at 17 persons; 70 percent of the dead
 were civilians, he calculated, and 10 percent were children. In addition to their at-
 tacks on Sarajevo with mortars, artillery, multiple rocket launchers, tanks, and
 other heavy weapons, the "Serbian Army" and former JNA forces also attacked the
 vital infrastructure of the city. In late July, outgoing telephone lines were made in-
 operable, although connections with the SDS stronghold in Pale (which is on the
 same interMity exchange) remained. SDS and former JNA forces later cut off the
 main water line and fired on electrical workers who attempted to repair trans-
 mission lines and restore power. Natural gas supplies were also periodically inter-
 rupted by Serbian forces.
 On April 19, the commander of JNA forces in Mostar, General Momcilo Perisic,
 bombarded the town in retaliation for the disappearance of two JNA pilots, despite
 pleas by diplomats in Belgrade to the JNA General Staff for restraint. By the time
 Perisic's forces withdrew, they had destroyed much of Mostar and killed many resi-
 dents. In their counteroffensive, Croatian forces also inflicted damage on parts of
 the city. In addition, JNA reservists wreaked havoc on Croatian and Muslim vil-
 lages in the Neretva valley, south of Mostar.
 JNA forces and Serbian irregular units began an assault on the northeastern city
 of Tuzla in May. The JNA oficer commanding the assault, Colonel Mile Dubajic,
 threatened to destroy Tuzla if Bosnian forces there did not release the prisoners of
 war (POW's) they held. While his forces did not destroy the town, they repeatedly
 shelled the city center, where tens of thousands of Muslim refugees from north-
 eastern Bosnia were sheltering. The JNA's successor, the "Army of Yujgoslavia" (Vd)
 has not prosecuted its personnel who appear to have been involved in war crimes
 in Bosnia.
 Among the weapons left for Karadzic's "Serbian Republic" by the JNA were war-
 planes based at Banja Luka, which were used in attacks on Gradacac, Jajee, Bihac
 Gorazde, and other towns. The air force of the "Serbian Army," under the command
 of General Zivomir Ninkovic, dropped cluster bombs in raids on Sarajevo and other
 places, and the commander of the Bahia Luka-based "First Krajina Corps" (the re-
 named Banja Luka Corps of the JNA), General Momir Talic, claimed in October
 that the Bosnian Serbs' planes were using napalm. The Bosnian Government has
 reported that territory under its control has been attacked with napalm by Serbian
 planes and the Bosnian Serb air force has this capability.
 As the war continued into the summer and fall, Serbian forces bombarded pre-
 dominantly Muslim and Croatian towns and villages throughout northern Bosnia,
 inflicting  en  civilian casualties and extensive destruction. In eastern Bosnia,
 they encountered stiff resistance from predminantly Muslim Bosnian forces in
 Gorazde and Srebrenica, and "the Serban Army" again applied the tactic of heavy
 shelling of civilian targets. In August the sie of  razde was lifted, but attacks
 on Srebrenica continued. Twice in the fall Serbian forces blocked convoys assembled
 by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) that were attempting to
 bring humanitarian aid to Srebenica but later bowed to pressure and allowed some
 convoys to get through.
 Regular Croatian forces shelled the town of Trebinje in August, and Bosian
 forces in Sarajevo fired shells at the town of Pale in September. However, there was
 no general pattern of Bosnian Territorial Defense or HVO assaults with heavy
 weapons on civilian targets.
 
 
 724
 As they seized towns and villags Serbian forces began ca ng out involuntary
 population transfers called "ethnic cieansing," particularly of the Muslim population
 in northern and eastern Bosnia. Hundreds of thousands of people were afected. In
 some cases, residents were coerced into signing away their property; in others, vil-
 lages were simply destroyed, and residents were either killed or rounded up to be
 sent to detention camps. In atcs b Serbian forces on towns along the Drina river
 in April and May, hundreds and pera     ousands of Muslim cvilans were killed.
 IDuring the, violence along the Drina, massacres were reported in Bje~ja,
 Bratunac, Zvornik, Foca, and elsewhere.
 Massive systematic rape, committed by Bosnian Serb military units and p rison
 guards, was used as an extension of 'ethnic cleansing" to terrify the population.
 Bosnian authorities claim that between 30,000 to 50,000 women have been raped
 since the onset of hostilities, while a December EC study put the figure closer to
 20000
 In addition to expelling non-Serbs from their homes, Serbian forces systematically
 destroyed the homes of Muslims who had fled. To a lesser extent, in areas of wes
 ern Herzegovina and other areas under Croatian control, many Serbs fled from their
 homes and in some cases their homes were then destroyed.
 In te northwest, Serbian forces cleared the districts of Bosanski Novi, Bosanski
 Petrovac, Priedor, Sanaki Most, Ijuc, and Kotor Varos. In late May, attacks by
 Serbian irregulars in northwest Bosnia caused many casualties in the district of
 Predor, the settlement of Kozarac, with a population of 25,000, was virtually de-
 stroyed. Many Muslim men were imprisoned while women and children were
 herded into freight cars and sent eastward. At Banja Luka, Serbian authorities re-
 fused to shelter the refugees or to allow citizens to bring food and water to them
 at the railway station. Bania Luka police claimed the Muslim women and children
 were being sent to Dobej (where fighting was under way) en route to Zenica, in
 central Bosnia, but it is uncertain how many arrived there. Some of the male family
 members of these deportees were killed in SDS and JNA attacks, while others were
 incarcerated in prison camps such as Omarska and Manjaca, where an unknown
 number were killed or otherwise died.
 Despite international condemnation of the practice of "ethnic cleansing" and
 promises by SDS leader Karadzic that it would stop, in September and October Ser-
 bian paramilitary forces continued to drive ethnic Muslims from their homes in
 Bosanski Petrovac, Prijedor, Kjuc, Kotor Varos, and other districts of northwestern
 Bosnia. Many Muslim refugees attempted to cross battle lines into Bosnian-held ter-
 ritory at Travnik; along the way they were harassed and robbed, and some never
 reached Travnik at all. On August 21, about 200 Muslim men were abducted from
 one such convoy and killed by Serbian paramilitary forces, according to credible ref.
 ugce accounts. A column of refugees left Bosanoki Petrovac in late September after
 an unknown number of Muslims there were killed. In October Muslim refugees fled
 the villages of Cela and Brezicani in the Prijedor district after an attack by Serbian
 paramilitary forces killed at least seven people. Also in October, violence erupted
 in Kotor Varos, and Muslim and Croatian villagers sought international protection
 to guarantee their flight into central Bosnia.
 "Ethnic cleansing" was not always carried out at gunpoint or under direct threat.
 The general atmosphere of violence and intimidation drove many people, whose eth-
 nic roup was not dominant in a given area, to flee. International aid officials stated
 in October that more than 100,000 Muslims and Croats were seeking to leave north-
 western Bosnia, which was largely under the control of the SDS. Although the
 Bosnian Government sought to prevent reprisals against Serbs in Sarajevo, the con-
 tinuing siege of the city increased ethnic tension; reports of violence against Serbs
 and aritrary arrest increased, and more and more Serbs sought to flee the city.
 Tensions were exacerbated by Bosnian government moves toward an alliance with
 Croatia, which fueled the fear of Serbs that they would lose their status as one of
 Bosnia's three constituent nationalities (together with Muslims and Croats). Al-
 though ethnic Serbs remained in the Bosnian presidency and government and were
 represented in the command of the Bosnian Armed Forces, all of the most senior
 figures in these structures were Muslims or Croats. Speaking in December, Bosnian
 Prime Minister Mile Akmadzic (a Croat) referred to the Muslim and Croatian na-
 tionalist parties (the SDA and the HDZ) as the legitimate representatives of the two
 respective nationalities, while implying that, since the Serbian nationalist party (the
 SDS) had been banned, the Bosnian Serbs do not have a corresponding "legitimate
 representative .
 By the end of 1992, the number of persons displaced by the war exceeded 1.5 mil-
 lion, more than one-third of Bosnia and Herzegovina's total population. In early
 July, a demographer estimated that half of Bosnia Herzegovina's Muslim popu-
 lation. one-fifth of its Croats. and somethinc lega than an-tp~nth nf itu . rrq hnA
 
 
 725
 been displaced by the war. The percentage of refugees among the Serbian popu-
 lation later rose considerably, including many refugees from 'the Serbian Republic.*
 Of the refugees, 45 percent were children and 30 percent elderly, with women mak-
 ing p he s*orite of the remaining one-quarter.
 As indicated in Section l.c., all sides held civilians in prison camps. Serbian forces
 confined thousands on non-Serbs, mostly ethnic Muslims, in "collection centers" as
 an adjunct to their campaign of "ethnic cleansing." The SDS held the majority of
 prisoners and subjected them to inadequate living conditions, beatings, torture,
 rape, and forced labor. In some camps, they executed prisoners, sometimes sum-
 marily and sometimes as the culmination of tortures carried out for the amusement
 of camp guards.
 About 3,000 men, women, and children were killed during May and June at the
 Brcko-Luka camp, which held approximately 1,000 civilian internees at any one
 time. Some 95 percent were ethnic Muslims, and the remainder were Croats. About
 95 percent were men. Until May the bodies were dumped into the Sava river.
 In late July, more than 100 died in an incident at the Keraterm prison in
 Prijedor. According to refugee accounts,a riot erupted on a hot evening in July,
 when men who had been deprived of water and were locked in a building that
 lacked ventilation panicked and tried to break out. Most of the victims were said
 to have suffocated in the crush of men trying to get out, while others were executed
 the next day for their part in the riot. When Western journalists visited Keraterm
 a few weeks later, they were prevented from examining that part of the facility
 where, according to refugee accounts, the executions had taken place. Two of these
 journalists said it appeared that the Serbian authorities there were cleaning a wall
 and adjacent area where prisoners had allegedly been shot.
 According to former inmates, 10 to 15 prsoners were killed each day at Omarska
 between   a and   ugust, and prisoners were also subjected to torture and mutila-
 tion. At the "Serbian Army" prison camp on Maiijaca, prisoners were also killed;
 local residents found the bodies of 25 prisoners near the camp in July, while a
 CSCE team that visited Madjaca in Augat and saw psoners who had been beaten
 with blunt instruments concluded that detainees hadbeen executed there beginning
 in late                         and consistent accounts given by a number of
 Bosnian refugees, it appears that Muslim women were raped systematically and re-
 peatedly while being held p risoner by Serbian forces in northern and southeastern
 Bosnia. The CSCE Thomson mission visited the village of Ripac, near Bihac, where
 about 60 Muslim inhabitants, mostly women and children, were denied freedom of
 movement and prevented from communicating with family members on the other
 side of the front line.
 Serbian civilians held in prison camps by Crats and Muslims were also subjected
 to violence. According to credible refugee accounts, at least 20 Serbian civilians were
 murdered in the Ce iici prison, operated by Muslim authorities near Konjic' the
 CSCE team which visited Celibici found circumstantial evidence of killings thiere.
 (See also Section I.e. on the treatment of inmates in prison camps.)
 The Bosnian Government has intervened to secure the release of Serbs arrested
 by police or paramilitary forces in Sarajevo bth in the case of individuals and of
 larger groups, as in one case where several hundred Serbian civilans were detained
 in the         a s um in Sarajevo. n addition, accordingto Serb who were held
 in prison camps run by Bosnian Muslims, some prison officials suspected of atroc-
 ities, such as the commander of the prison camp at Celebici, have been arrested by
 the Bosnian Government.
 Serbian civilians were the victims of violence by Croatian militias, by the pri-
 marily Muslim armed forces of Bosnia,   and yiCro nand Muslim irregulars.
 Bosnian forces reliv   the besieged town of Gorazde in August attacked columns
 of fleeing Serbs and killed a number of civilians, including women and children. Ser-
 bian rcfugees from Gorazde also assorted that some Serbian civilians were mur-
 dered in the town itself. Bonian irregular forces attacked Serbian villages in east-
 ern Bosnia during the summer and fall and in once incident near Milici in Septem-
 ber reportedly killed at least 28 Serbian villagers. Other credible refugee accounts
 indicate that the HVO in a Mostar prison beat and threatened Serbian civilians, in-
 eluding women and that some inmates died as a result of beatingSe or mistreatment.
 In the town of' Prozor in October, following a dispute between the HVO and local
 Muslims, the heavily armed Croatian forces went on a rampage directed against the
 Muslim population, killing civilians and destroying much of the town.
 Serbian attacks on Muslim and Croatian towns and villages in Bosnia were fre-
 quently spearheaded by .paramilitary "volunteers," including many citize ns of Serbia
 and Montenes   In partiular, tree paramiitary maders caried on actties pub-
 licly and with evident official support in Serbia.

 Zeliko Raznjatovic, a criminal wanted in several Western countries, is a para-
 military leader known by the name 'Arkan." Based in Belgrade, he took part in the
 fihting in Croatia in 1991. He led paramilitary forces in early April that murdered
 Muslim  civilians in Bijejina. He also participated in the seizure of the predomi-
 nantly Muslim town of Zvornik where his forces allegedly murdered civilians. He
 was known to travel on some occasions in JNA aircraft.
 Vojislav Seseli, a member of both the Serbian and "Yugoslav" parliaments and the
 leader of the Serbian Radical Party (SRSA) and its paramili ..  i, the Serbian
 Chetnik Movement (SCP), personally reviewed his SCP paramtiiy orces in Sara-
 jevo and in Herzegovina, traveling in some cases in JNA aircraft. His SCP forces
 were active in northern Bosnia and eastern Herzegovina where they were accused
 of killing civilians.
 Mirko Jovic, the leader of the Serbian National Renewal Party (SNO), whose
 paramilitary wing is known as the White Eagles, was photographed in August at
 Serbian artillery positions outside Gorazde. The White Eagles took part in the as-
 sault on Visegrad in April, in which Muslim civilians were murdered, as well as in
 other actions in many parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 In several areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina, followers of the Croatian nationalist
 extremist, Dobroslav Paraga, and his Croatian Party of Rights (HSP), formed units
 of the Croatian Defense Forces (HOS). Thousands of HOS troops were already in
 western Herzegovina in March, before the outbreak of heavy fighting in Bosnia and
 Herzegovina.
 All sides in the Bosnian war charged each other with widespread atrocities
 against civilians, but many of these could not be substantiated by international ob-
 server investigations. The practice of the SDS of issuing through the Serbian News
 Agency (SRNA) a flood of unfounded charges of crimes by Bosnian government
 forces, charges then picked up by the wire service Tanjug and other Serbian media,
 in fact made it mere difficult to sort out the real instances in which ethnic Serbs
 were the victims of atrocities. SRNA reported in September, for example, that 150
 Serbs had been killed in Bihac in the presence of U OFOR and ICRC personnel,
 a report that these two agencies subsequently said was untrue. An investigation by
 the UNPROFOR in Bihac failed to produce any evidence of such killings. For its
 part, the Bosnian Government made allegations concerning atrocities by "Serbian
 Army" forces and Serbian paramilitary forces without solid evidence, charges that
 damaged its credibility.
 The widespread incidence of violations of humanitarian law in the Bosnian war
 led the UNSC in September to adopt a resolution seeking the investigation of al-
 leged war crimes. The War Crimes Commission, established by the UNSC following
 its first meeting in November, announced that it would be investigating reports of
 violations of international humanitarian law in the former Yugoslavia and analyzing
 applicable law. The Commission noted that it had received information relevant to
 the investigation from several governments, including that of the United States.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Before the outbreak of the war in April, the
 Bosnian media and particularly Sarajevo radio and television, the major Sarajevo
 daily Oslobodjenje, and the independent television studio Yutel were widely re-
 garded as accurate and balanced. They displayed a critical stance toward all politi-
 cal parties and maintained a fair ethnic mix among their journalists. While the
 three major nationalist parties (the SDA, HDZ, and  S  ha earlier attempted un-
 successfully to place Sarajevo radio and television and Oslobodjenje under direct
 government control and effectively segregate them into three ethnic units, by early
 1992 SDA leaders were supporting the independence of the media, although critics
 charged this was only a tactical retreat and that Muslim nationalists too were V. iet-
 ly seeking to place the media under state control. The SDS remained bitterly critical
 of Sarajevo radio and television and Oslobodjenje, and, after Mate Boban took con-
 trol of the HDZ in February, it too renewed its demands for ethnically segregated'
 media. SDS paramilitary forces, with the support of the JNA, seized most Sarajevo
 television relay stations and reprogrammed them to relay Belgrade television
 braodcasts. When the siege of Sarajevo began in April, the radio and television stu-
 dios and the Oslobodjenje building came under heavy bombardment. After the war
 began, Sarajevo radio and television increasingly reflected government policy. The
 director of Sarajevo television, Nenad Pejic, left Bosnia in May, saying he was re-
 ceiving threats from all sides in the conflict. Oslobodjenje continued to operate as
 an independent voice; its editor-in-chief was a Muslim and the deputy editor-in-chief
 a Serb, and major Bosnian ethnic groups were represented on its staff.
 The SDS-created information ofice, SRNA (Serbian News Agency), produced a
 qtea'dv streram nf nrnnoaanda that was circulated widely bv Taniua. the officiallv
 
 
 727
 controlled Belgrade press agency, and other Serbian media. The reporting of the
 Bosnian Governments official news agency, BH Press, supported government poli-
 cies and interests.
 Individual journalists suffered reprisals from local authorities who did not ap-
 prove of their reporting or of their employer. The Oslobode je correspondent in
 Zvornik was murdered in April after Serbian paramilitary forces took control of the
 town. In Banjia Luka, Sarajevo television journalists were expelled from their offices,
 which were taken over by Serbian nationalists for a local television studio.
 Two journalists for the Belgrade daily Borba, Zeljko Vukovic and Natka
 Buturovic, received threats from all sides because of their nonpartisan reporting
 from Sarajevo. In September the Bosnian Interior Ministry issued warrants for their
 arrest on charges of spying for the JNA. Although the warrants were not with-
 drawn, the two journalists remained free and continued to file reports from Sarajevo
 until their departure for Belgrade in November. Bosnian authorities in July de-
 tained the Tanjug correspondent in Zenica, Milan Sabic, and held him prisoner for
 almost 3 monthsbefore they released him and let him depart for Belgrade in Sep-
 tember.
 Reporters faced great risks in covering the Bosnian war. At least 20 domestic and
 foreign journalists were killed in Bosnia during 1992, including American Broad-
 casting Corporation news producer David Kaplan, who was shot by a sniper in Sara-
 jevo in August. Western journalists covering the war said that some combatant
 forces targeted reporters. in June a Slovene journalist, Ivo Standeker, died after
 being wounded in the Dobrinja neighborhood of Sarajevo. A car attempting to bring
 him to a hospital in the city center was stopped by SDS paramilitary forces who
 took Standeker instead to Pale; he died 8 hours after being seized, never having re-
 ceived medical care.
 In Banja Luka, the lasat Bosnian town under SDS control the local radio and
 television spread nationalist propaganda, and only ethnic Serbs occupied editorial
 positions. (According to the 1991 census, the urban population of Banja Luka is al-
 most one-half Serb, while the population of the district is 55 percent Serb). The
 Banja Luka newspaper Glas followed a hard nationalist line but within that frame-
 work maintained a critical stance toward the local authorities.
 Schools and universities could not function normally in Bosnian towns under
 siege. In Sarajevo, many ethnic Serbian professors fled, some because of harassment
 due to their ethnic identity or political views, although many who left were harshly
 critical of SDS terrorism. In Bahia Luka, many professors were fired or removed
 from administrative positions because they were ethnic Muslims or Croats, and in
 June the local newspaper frankly proclaimed that the university in Banja Luka was
 to be "a Serbian university."
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Fundamental rights such as
 the right of association ceased to be observed when war broke out. Everywhere,
 pressure for conformity increased and the potential coat of dissent rose. The public
 prosecutor in Sarajevo declared the SDS illegal, although the Government quashed
 a similar initiative to ban the SDA and HDZ as well. In Banja Luka, SDA activists
 were subject to surveillance and frequent police interrogation, although they were
 allowed to meet with international observers.
 c. Freedom of Religion.--AII speaking the same language, the Serb, Croats, and
 Muslim Slays of Bosnia and Herzegovina are distinguished most obviously by their
 religion (Orthodox Christian Roman Catholic, and Muslim, respectively). The SDS
 indoctrinated its forces to believe they were fighting a religious war. Radovan
 Karadzic repeated this message many times, and Serbian fos systematically de-
 stroyed mosques and Catholic churches in many of the towns they captured. The
 mosque and Catholic church in the center of Prjedor were destroyed during the
 summer, not by shells in battle, but demolished intentionally with explosives. Simi-
 larly, the mosque in Celinac wvas destroyed, as was the Catholic church in Kotor
 Varos, where the local Catholic priest was forbidden to practice. In Visegrad, SDS
 paramilitary forces demolished a mosque in the center of the town after ocupying
 it, and in Foca Serbian ccudation forces destroyed the 5th-entury "Sarena  mu -
 ticlored) mosque. In Tuzla, the residence of the Serbian Orthodox bishop was at-
 tacked and considerable damage inflicted, presumably by Muslim or Croatian na-
 tionalists; local ofcials condemned the attack, but no arrests were made. Many
 other mosques, churches, and other religious buildings were damaged or destroyed
 in the shelling of Sarajevo, Mostar, and other towns by"the Serbian ar. and its
 paramilitary allies. There were also cases in which Serbian Orthodox churches were
 damaged or destroyed in the fighting and appear to have been deliberately targeted.
 The Serbian Orthodox bishop of Herzegovina declared in September that 15 church-
 es in his diocese had been destroyed n the districts of Mostar, Tomislavgrad, and
 Konjic, and that many Serbian viilages in Herzegovina had been destroyed and their
 
 
 728
 inhabitants imprisoned or killed by regular Croatian army units, ethnic Croatian
 forces from Western Herzegovina, and Bosnian Muslim forces.
 .Those who promoted the war encouraged religious hatred to motivate their fol.
 lowers. Leaders of the three principal religions condemned the violence but were un-
 able to rally their congregations to forgiveness and reconciliation. Most of Sarajevo's
 Jewish community fled the city during the early weeks of the SDS/JNA siege.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The war deprived most of the people of Bosnia of the right to move free-
 ly in their own country or across its borders; large numbers of people were either
 expelled from their homes or held hostage because of their ethnic affiliation. Every-
 where, mobilizations were declared which gave the authorities power to restrict the
 movement of most adults, other than the elderly. Serbs who wished to leave Sara-
 jevo or Muslims who wished to leave Baija Luka could be denied permission on the
 $rounds that they were subject to military duty. The northern corridor route cross-
 ing SDS-controlled territory between Banja Luka and the Serbian border was gen-
 erally closed to non-Serbs.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 On February 29-March 1, Bosnia and Herzegovina held a referendum on whether
 it should become a sovereign and independent state. Bosnian leaders had preferred
 to try to hold Yugoslavia together in some loose form, since they believed this pro-
 vided the best hope for stability and peace in their multiethnic republic. As it be-
 came clear that Croatia's independence would be recognized by the world commu-
 nity, these Bosnian leaders, including the Muslim and Croatian nationalist parties,
 all major opposition parties, and most independent intellectuals concluded that
 Bosnia must have the same status as Serbia and Croatia if Bosnia was to survive
 as a multiethnic society. The referendump roduced a vote of 63.4 percent of all eligi-
 ble voters in favor of independence. Staff members of the US. Congress' Commis-
 sion on Security and Cooperation in Europe who observed the referendum concluded
 in a published report that "citizens legitimately expressed their desire to be sov-
 ereign and independent.*
 The SDS organized a boycott of the referendum, and although its leader
 Karadzic, said his followers would not hinder those who wished to vote, many local
 governments under SDS control did not cooperate fully; in a few districts SDS offi-
 cials tried to prevent the vote from taking place. In addition, some SDS activists
 pressured ethnic Serbs not to vote, threatening that they would lose their jobs or
 suffer other sanctions. In Banja Luka, the local newspaper proclaimed on its front
 page that Serbs who voted (whether for or against) were "traitors" to their people.
 On March 1, as it became clear that the referendum was producing a majority yes
 vote, the SDS seized on the murder of a Serb in Sarajevo that day to throw up bar-
 ricades that paralyzed the city. The violence in Sarajevo in the first days of arch
 and the war the SDS forces unleashed the following month deprived Bosnian citi-
 zens of their right to determine their political future.
 The bicameral National Assembly comprised 240 seats of which 99 were filled by
 Muslims, 84 by Serbs, 50 by Croats, and 7 by others. ibis composition paralleled
 the breakdown in the population of 4,355,000, in which 43.7 percent were Muslim,
 31.3 Serbs, 17.3 Croats, and 7.7 others.
 The Republic's institutions, including the legislature, could not function, and effec-
 tive political power fell to those who had arms and men at their disposal. The
 Bosnian Territorial Defense Force, later renamed the Armed Forces of Bosnia and
 Herzegovina, controlled relatively little territory, and, as the war went on, it was
 increasingly taken over by ethnic Muslims. The Croatian militias the HVO and
 HOS, controlled western Herzegovina, parts of central Bosnia, and some territory
 along the Sava river in the north. More than half of Bosnia came under the control
 of SDS paramilitary gups and the former JNA forces that after May 19 referred
 to themselves as "the Serbian Army."
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violation of Human Rights
 The Bosnian Government, the SDS, and the Croatian militias all agreed in prin-
 ciple to allow international observers access to territory under their control to inves.
 tigate alleged human rights abuses and for other purposes. In practice, political au-
 thorities imposed obstacles, and the ongoing war made it difficult for international
 observers to carry out such investigations in many parts of Bosnia. While Radovan
 Karadzic responded to charges that his forces were operating concentration camps
 for non-Serbs by organizing group visits to SDS prison camps, journalists were not
 qranted full sacess to ruech site.s. For eramnle, inurnilist.q narticinatinq in an SrlS-
 
 
 729
 organized visit were prevented from inspecting an area of the Keraterm prison
 where executions allegedly took place; "Serbian Republic" police detained several
 journalists traveling independently when they attempted to visit the Batkovic camp,
 without prior notice; and journalists in general were not permitted private discourse
 with prisoners.
 Another urnalist was summarily expelled from Barua Luka when he asked "Ser-
 bian Army" officials for the autopsy report on a prisoner who died at Manjaca. The
 U.N. Special Human Rights Rapporteur, Tadeuaz Mazowiecki, was denied access to
 the Manjaca camp by "Serbian Army" officers in September, on the grounds that
 he had arrived there too late in the day and that preparations for his visit had not
 been made properly.
 All sides in the Bosian war viewed the work of international organizations
 through the prs of their political interests. The Government sometimes turned
 against the PROFOR becaus, in its view, the UNPROFOR would not clearly
 distinguish between aggressor and victim in the conflict. Karadzic and the SDS al-
 leged that UNHCR planes were not only ferrig food into Sarajevo but also smug-
 glinC arms to Muslim and Croatian forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Such obstrc-
 tionst attitudes rendered the work of international organizations both difficult and
 dangerous.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 All other forms of social tension were eclipsed by the ethnic hatred generated by
 the war to annex Bosnian territory to a "union of Serbian states." There have been
 widespread dismissals and intimidation of workers based on ethnicity and religion.
 Affiliation as an Orthodox Christian Serb, a Roman Catholic Croat, or a Muslim
 Slav became the crucial factor that determined if a person would keep a job or lose
 it, would remain at home or be driven out of it, and, all too often, would live or
 die. Support for a multiethnic society was eroded by violence, fear, and anarchy. The
 Bosnian war was especially tragic for the hundreds of thousands of citizens whose
 families included members of more than one ethnic group, a particularly common
 phenomenon among young, urban, and educated Bosnians. (In the 1991 census,
 240,000 Bosnians did not even offer an ethnic affiliation, but declared themselves
 to be "Yugoslavs.R)
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Legally, all workers are entitled to form or join
 unions of their own choosing without prior authorization and, up until Bosnia and
 Herzegovina's descent in early 1992 into war and economic chaos, this right was
 generally respected. Bosian workers had independent trade unions, and ournal-
 ists, teachers, and others were organized in independent professional organizations,
 which attempted through mass actions both to address labor issues and to promote
 peace during the tense early months of 1992. The activities of unions were curtailed
 severely by the war and the collapse of the economy. Although statistics on the size
 of the organized work force are unreliable, the bulk of Bosnian workers were prob-
 ably members of the semiofficial Council of Independent Trade Unions of Bosnia
 and He    regovina (CiH). Throughout 1991 and into 1992, new trade unions were
 formed as the centralized national structure eroded, but the old union umbrella or-
 ganization continued to be able o toffer some material benefits to members, such as
 pirferential access to lower cost commodities from government reserves, which the
 flitlin  a independent unions were unable to do.
 e right to strike is recognized and was exercised in early 1992 prior to the out-
 break of hostilities.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-This right is guaranteed for-
 mallyby Bosnian law, but Western-style collective bargaining had yet to take hold,
 as the management of state-owned (or "socially owned) enterprises had not been
 given, and had not taken, responsibility for collective bargaining. Some agreements
 were negotiated with the seiofficial Chamber of Economy but proved unsatisfac-
 tory for lack of clear authority and manaement responsibility. Privatization of "so-
 cial propertyi was another problem in which the rights and interests of workers
 were not well defined or understood. Ethnically motivated disissals and curtail-
 ment of union activities increased in the context of the war. There are no export
 processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Lbor.-Bosnian law prohibits forced labor,
 and it was not known to occur beore the war's outbreak.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 is 16, although in villages and farm communities younger children often assist with
 family aericultural work. The victimization of children is a horrifying aspect of the
 
 
 730
 Bosnian war, and there were credible reports of the employment of children for mili-
 tary functions, including reconnaissance and running messages.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Minimum wages are guaranteed, but delays
 and partial payments were pandemic even prior to the outbreak of fighting, due to
 the collapse of the Bosnian economy. Serbia had imposed an embargo on food deliv-
 eries, including shipments that had already been paid for. Banks had neither hard
 currency nor local currency, and purchasing power dropped to a fraction of its 1990
 level. Formally, sick leave and other benefit programs were generous, and regula-
 tions on occupational health and safety were adequate, although enforcement was
 lax. In the context of the war, however, formal guarantees are worth very little; the
 economy of the entire Republic has been destroyed by the war and there have been
 widespread dismissals and intimidation of workers based on ethnicity and religion.
