 MALTA
 Malta is a constitutional republic with a parliamentary
 government elected by universal suffrage. The President,
 Agatha Barbara, is head of state, and the Prime Minister,
 Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici, is head of government. Former Prime
 Minister Dom Mintoff, who resigned December 22, 1984, has long
 dominated Maltese foreign and domestic policy and retains
 considerable influence. As a former British colony, Malta is a
 member of the Commonwealth and continues to follow many British
 traditions.
 The Maltese Constitution states that every citizen is entitled
 to fundamental individual rights and liberties regardless of
 race, color, creed, sex, place of origin, or political
 opinion. The threat to these generally observed standards
 emanates from Malta's intensely partisan political disputes
 which affect important institutions such as the judiciary, the
 national broadcasting system, hospitals, schools, and the Roman
 Catholic Church. These disputes were reinforced by the outcome
 of the December 1981 election in which the Nationalist Party
 won 51 percent of the popular vote, but the Labor Party took a
 majority of parliamentary seats owing to the redrawing of
 electoral districts. As a result, Nationalist Party members
 boycotted Parliament, and the party also began a boycott of
 products advertised on TV Malta. In April 1982 the Speaker of
 the Maltese House declared the Nationalist members unseated,
 and the Government proceeded to treat the Nationalist Party as
 an *illegal party.'
 Although the Nationalists returned to Parliament in March 1983
 as part of an agreement of "national reconciliation," political
 tensions remained high. In November 1983, hundreds of police
 searched the headquarters of the Nationalist Party and a
 warehouse owned by party sympathizers for an illegal
 transmitter used by the opposition after it had been denied
 access to government-controlled radio and television stations.
 Some arms were found at both locations. Tension eased somewhat
 as the Nationalist Party on January 1, 1984 announced the end
 of the boycott against TV-advertised products.
 The focus in 1984 has been primarily on the Roman Catholic
 Church. In August the Government insisted that private schools
 provide tuition-free education and suspended the licenses of
 eight Church-operated schools and one private school. At the
 same time, the teachers' union decided to strike over
 longstanding grievances about working conditions and salaries.
 Declaring that such a strike would be illegal, the Government
 threatened that striking teachers would be locked out of the
 schools. The strike began at the end of September 1984. The
 Church closed all its schools in protest over the Government's
 suspension of the licenses of some of them. At the climax of a
 week of public demonstrations, several hundred Labor Party
 supporters led by then Senior Deputy Prime Minister and
 Minister of Education Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici held a street
 rally in Valletta which ended with an assault on the law courts
 and the Archibishop's offices. This unprecedented physical
 attack on the Catholic Church resulted in a meeting between
 Prime Minister Mintoff and Archbishop Mercieca, the first in
 many years.   In mid-November, a settlement was reached whereby
 the Church was allowed to open and operate its schools
 tuition-free for the remainder of the academic year, although
 the basic issue remains unresolved. The court has not yet
 rendered judgment on the legality of the Government's
 suspension of the licenses of the Church schools, and

 MALTA
 Church-state relations remain very strained. The principle of
 freedom of religion, at least as applied to Church-sponsored
 schools, is perceived to be in question.
 On October 10, 1984, a one-day strike was called by the
 Confederation of Trade Unions in support of the ongoing strike
 by the Movement of United Teachers. The Confederation claimed
 that 27,000 workers participated in the strike, making it the
 largest in Malta's history. The teachers returned to work on
 November 13 after the Government agreed to lift the lockout.
 The Government reassigned many returning teachers to new
 schools.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There have been no known incidents of political killing
 sanctioned by the Government or opposition groups during 1984.
 b. Disappearance
 No cases of disappearance are known to have occurred in 1984.
 In earlier instances which have only recently come to light,
 Lino Cauchi, an accountant, disappeared in 1982, and the case,
 which was under police investigation, has not been resolved.
 In 1981 Louis Bartolo, under arrest on charges of murdering a
 Labor party activist, disappeared without trace from prison
 along with a foreign prisoner.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment
 or Punishment
 The Maltese Constitution prohibits inhuman or degrading
 punishment. During 1983 the police were accused of carrying
 out inhuman or degrading treatment of prisoners. In one case a
 physically handicapped individual testified that during
 interrogation he was hit on the neck and threatened with being
 hung from the ceiling. Other injuries of prisoners during
 interrogations have been widely publicized. The Government has
 explained these by claiming that Ilegally permitted force' was
 used when prisoners were uncooperative.
 In a previously unreported incident, the body of Nardu Debono,
 who had been in police custody, was found under a bridge in
 1980. The Government has still not conducted an investigation.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or detention is provided for in
 the Constitution and respected in practice. There are no known
 political prisoners or persons in political exile. Persons can
 be, and often are, held by the police for 48 hours of
 .questioning" without being charged. On several occasions
 during the past few years prominent opposition figures have
 been held under this provision, then released and rearrested
 immediately after leaving the police station. Although this
 process could, in theory, continue indefinitely, the total time
 of detention in practice has not exceeded 3 or 4 days. The
 right of habeas corpus is also guaranteed by the Constitution.

 MALTA
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A fair public trial before an impartial court is guaranteed in
 the Constitution. The judicial system is independent, except
 in the method of assigning duties to judges, and includes an
 appeals court.
 The Court Reform Act of 1981 limits the jurisdiction of the
 courts in the area of oversight of administrative actions by
 the Government. Defendants may not use lawyers in cases before
 the Industrial Tribunal, which has exclusive authority in
 disputes regarding workers' rights. Nor may civil servants be
 represented by lawyers in cases held before the public service
 commission. Plaintiffs in law suits versus the Government,
 e.g., constitutional cases on human rights, cannot avail
 themselves of lawyers who are members of Parliament, although
 the Government can.
 In 1984, the Catholic Church and the Federation of Parent
 Teacher Associations filed two independent actions against the
 Government because of its suspension of licenses for certain
 private schools. The Constitutional Court convened after
 delays in excess of those allowed by the Constitution but has
 not yet rendered judgment on appeals by the Government on
 decisions handed down by the civil court. Under pressure, most
 of the judges were either disqualified, or disqualified
 themselves, from hearing these cases in the civil court. The
 judge who finally agreed to hear the case resigned under
 pressure from the Government--including passage of a
 parliamentary motion--and the case has not proceeded. There
 remain a number of civil and human rights cases where judgment
 has not yet been issued by the Constitutional Court. During
 1984 there have been several statements by senior government
 officials that perhaps the time had come to do away with
 existing courts and establish "people's courts.'
 At the same time there have been several significant cases in
 1984, as in previous years, in which the courts have delivered
 judgments against the Government. But the courts have not
 provided redress or remedies in several of those decisions.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Protection of the privacy of the home is guaranteed in the
 Constitution. Most police searches require warrants which are
 issued only after proper administrative review. However, any
 police officer above the rank of subinspector may carry out a
 search without a warrant. The postmaster general employs
 several people to ensure that postcards, periodicals, and other
 publications which might be regarded as pornographic are
 confiscated and destroyed.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are guaranteed by the Constitution. They are
 also respected in practice, with the single and highly
 significant exception of radio and television broadcasting.
 The constitutional provision for an independent broadcast
 authority to oversee the impartial operation of the media has
 been ignored since 1982. In early 1984 the Nationalist Party
 dropped its ban on products advertised on government-controlled
 
 
 1043
 MALTA
 media, and these media resumed coverage of Nationalist Party
 activities. This coverage, however, remains far from
 evenhanded.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right to peaceful assembly is guaranteed by law. Although
 police permits are generally given for political meetings and
 other public activities by the opposition Nationalist Party,
 there have been several notable exceptions. In October 1983
 the Christian Democrat Students' Association applied for a
 permit to hold an outdoor exhibit; the police denied the permit
 and the exhibit was not held. The Students' Association sued
 the police, claiming that their constitutional right to free
 speech and assembly had been denied. The court, which took
 almost a year to render judgment, sustained the Students'
 Association's claim, but the judgment was moot since the event
 which was to have been marked by the exhibit had passed. In a
 similar case involving an exhibit at the National Museum, the
 court ruled that the Museum had acted impartially in denying
 the students space to show their exhibit.
 Trade unions and other interest groups freely exercise the
 right to set up associations. The largest labor organization,
 the General Workers' Union, is closely tied to the Malta Labor
 Party. There are also several independent unions.
 In September 1984, the teachers' union directed its members to
 strike. The Government immediately responded by locking out
 all teachers in government schools who refused to sign a
 declaration that they would not follow the union directive.
 The opposition joined the teachers' union in charging-that this
 action was a denial of the right of association. Teachers
 returned to work on November 13 in return for a Government
 assurance that the lockout would end and that they would not be
 required to sign any anti-union declaration. The majority of
 teachers who had participated in the strike were transferred.
 Additionally, a number of student-workers at the University of
 Malta, who had followed their union's direction to participate
 in the strike, were suspended. They were reinstated after
 signing a declaration pledging not to interrupt their studies
 again with industrial action.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The right to practice the religion of one's choice in Malta is
 constitutionally guaranteed. The overwhelmingly dominant
 religion (99.9 percent) is Roman Catholicism, although there
 are small groups of Protestants, Muslims, and Jews. The
 current Government, however, has a pronounced anti-clerical
 bias. It is engaged in continuous battle with the Catholic
 Church over the latter's property and accounts. As part of its
 plan to provide free education for all Maltese children, the
 Government suspended the licenses of eight Church schools.
 Although the schools have been allowed to operate for the
 remainder of the academic year, their long-term future is
 uncertain.
 In 1983, the Government enacted the Devolution of Certain
 Church Property Act, which provided a mechanism for the
 Government to take over a significant portion of the Catholic
 Church's wealth. The court has ruled, in a case brought by the
 Church against the Government, that this law is
 
 
 1044
 MALTA
 unconstitutional and therefore null and void. The Government
 is appealing this decision.
 Beginning with the requirement that education in Church schools
 be provided free of charge, and later adding other conditions
 which the Catholic Church felt would result in a basic change
 in the nature of its schools, the Government announced in
 August 1984 that it was suspending the licenses of eight
 Church-run secondary schools. Popular protests against this
 action were organized by the opposition and by the Federation
 of Parent Teacher Associations, galvanizing the polarization of
 Maltese society to an unprecedented decree. An interim
 agreement permitted Church schools to reopen on November 19.
 The schools will operate tuition-free throughout the 1984-85
 academic year while negotiations continue toward a long-term
 solution.
 The Government's activity in Church-state relations has taken
 on an increasingly intrusive'pattern and is perhaps the single
 most important human rights development during 1984. The
 continuation of such intrusion could call into question the
 integrity of the principle of freedom of religion, at least as
 this applies to Church-sponsored schools.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Neither domestic nor foreign travel is circumscribed. Freedom
 of movement, foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation are
 guaranteed, and that guarantee is respected in practice. Due
 to an imbalance in bilateral trade with Italy, the Government
 imposed a restriction forbidding Maltese travelers to Italy
 from taking any foreign exchange. This effectively prevents
 most Maltese from going to Italy.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 There is a high degree of participation in the political
 process in Malta. In the last parliamentary elections (1981),
 more than 95 per cent of registered voters actually voted.
 Almost everyone is "politicized," including young school
 children who often come home chanting slogans of one party or
 another. Under the Maltese system, a party may gain control of
 a majority of parliamentary seats without having obtained a
 majority of the popular vote. This occurred in 1981. Since
 Labor members are usually required to vote consistently with
 the wisnes of their leader, that person exercises considerable
 influence despite wide public participation in elections. On a
 number of occasions in 1984 the then senior deputy prime
 minister made public statements implying that elections might
 not be held in the future. The opposition has charged that
 this most fundamental political right, that of the citizens to
 change their government, has been threatened.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No requests are known to have been made for outside
 investigations of alleged violations of human rights in Malta.
 Amnesty International does not discuss Malta in its 1984
 report. Freedom House in its 1983-84 report called the
 Government 'increasingly anti-democratic' and rates Malta
 
 
 1045
 MALTA
 partly free.' In 1984, Maltese citizens established two human
 rights groups, one named Hielsa (Free), and another calling
 itself the Committee for Democracy. There has been no official
 reaction to the formation of these groups, the first of their
 kind.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Constitution declares that availability to all citizens of
 the highest levels of education and social welfare are
 fundamental aims of government. Both the Government and the
 opposition state their commitment to the pursuit of these aims
 and to the support of the basic rights to own property, to work
 with just conditions and remuneration, to maintain a standard
 of living adequate for health and well-being, and to receive
 universal education. In 1982, the gross national product per
 capita was $3,797. The population in 1984 was 356,000.
 Unemployment is 9.4 percent, according to government
 statistics. Maltese public education is free and open to all.
 The literacy rate is nearly 90 percent, and education is
 compulsory to age 16. The primary school enrollment ratio in
 1979 was 96 percent. General standards of health care in Malta
 are high. In 1984, life expectancy at birth was 72.54 years,
 and infant mortality is 13.4 per 1,000 live births. Government
 programs in health care have concentrated on providing
 inexpensive health care services to the largest possible
 proportion of the population. A prolonged 7-year old labor
 dispute between the Government and the medical association has
 led many Maltese doctors to leave the country. The Government
 also withdrew licenses/support for the remaining Church-run
 private hospitals, which were consequently forced to close.
 Women participate freely in social and political life and
 continue to expand their economic role, although they are
 underrepresented in the professions and management. There are
 traditional legal limitations on women's property rights within
 marriage, which derive from traditional Maltese social values.
 Limitations on public sector employment of married women were
 removed in 1981. Strong private sector demand for female labor
 has ensured a very low level of unemployment among women.
 Women constitute about 27 percent of the labor force. Public
 economic and social services are extended on a
 nondiscriminatory basis.
