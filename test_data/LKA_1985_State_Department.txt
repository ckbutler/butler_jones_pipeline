 SRI LANKA
 Sri Lanka is a multiparty democracy. Its Constitution,
 adopted in 1978, provides for a strong executive president who
 is independent of the unicameral parliament. Both are elected
 by universal adult suffrage, with members of parliament to be
 selected in future general elections on the basis of a system
 of proportional representation. The Constitution also
 provides for an independent judiciary and the rule of law.
 When the 1978 Constitution came into effect, the then Prime
 Minister and leader of the United National Party (UNP), J. R.
 Jayewardene, became President.
 A developing country, Sri Lanka has achieved a high quality of
 life despite low per capita income which in 1984 still stood
 at only $340. Tea exports are Sri Lanka's largest source of
 foreign exchange earnings. Other agricultural products and
 textiles are also major exports. Approximately 60 percent of
 Sri Lanka's productive capacity is state-owned or controlled,
 the result of large-scale nationalization in the early
 1970's.
 Sri Lankans are ethnically and religiously diverse: 74 percent
 are Sinhalese, mostly Buddhists; 18 percent are Tamils,
 predominantly Hindus; 7 percent are Muslims of varying ethnic
 origins; the remainder consist of Malays, some descendants of
 European colonists, and a small number of aboriginals, the
 Veddahs. Of the Tamil population, two-thirds are so-called
 "Ceylon Tamils" whose presence on the island dates back many
 centuries. The rest are "Indian Tamils," who were recruited
 in India during the last century to work on the tea
 plantations. Under the British colonial administration prior
 to 1948, Ceylon Tamils held a disproportionate share of
 influential positions in government service, the police, the
 professions, and commerce. With independence, Sinhalese
 political leaders sought to redress what their community
 regarded as an imbalance in favor of Ceylon Tamils; typical of
 their efforts was the so-called "Sinhala-Only" Act of 1956
 which made Sinhalese the sole official language of the
 country. For Tamils, the Act stood for government-sanctioned
 discrimination against them. However, Tamil was designated a
 "national" language by the 1978 Constitution and its use in
 government, education, and the courts is specifically
 protected in the Constitution.
 A growing Tamil conviction that they do not enjoy political
 rights equal to those of the Sinhalese majority led some
 moderate political leaders and frustrated Tamil youths to
 conclude, by the mid-1970's, that separation of the
 Tamil-majority areas of the island into an independent Tamil
 state or "Eelam" was the only solution. The political leaders
 renamed their party the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF)
 and contested the 1977 elections on a platform of
 independence, winning all 14 seats in the heavily Tamil
 Northern Province and two seats in the Eastern Province, which
 has a sizable Tamil minority. Many militant Tamil youths
 turned to armed struggle and to terrorism as their way of
 attaining Eelam. Their targets have been government security
 forces, officials, Sinhalese civilians and Tamils who do not
 support their cause. Government security forces have not
 succeeded in their efforts to end separatist violence. Poorly
 prepared for the task, they have sometimes retaliated against
 innocent Tamil civilians.
 
 
 1378
 SRI LANKA
 Despite the TULF's advocacy of separatism, from 1977 onwards
 it sought to negotiate with the Government a political
 resolution of Tamil grievances. TULF members lost their seats
 in Parliament in 1983 after they refused to swear allegiance
 to the Sri Lankan unitary state, as required by a
 constitutional amendment enacted that year. By-elections to
 fill these seats have been postponed because of the unsettled
 security situation in the North and East, and as a result
 Tamils living in those constituencies are currently without
 representatives in Parliament. There are currently three
 Tamil United National Party members of Parliament and three
 Tamils in the cabinet, including the leader of the Ceylon
 Workers Congress (CWC), a labor union-cum-political party
 which represents the interests of Sri Lanka's Indian Tamil
 community.
 Throughout 1984 an All-Party Conference sought to develop a
 political compromise based on the devolution of certain powers
 to local government bodies. The process ended in stalemate in
 December 1984 when the TULF rejected the Government's
 proposals for devolution, and the Government subsequently
 withdrew them. During early 1985, both sides stepped up their
 attacks, with the Government mounting a series of military
 operations in the north and east in an effort to locate the
 Tamil separatists and their facilities and to eliminate them.
 The murder by Tamil militants of 146 mostly Sinhalese
 civilians in an attack on the Buddhist sacred city of
 Anuradhapura in May shocked the nation and led to renewed
 efforts to find a negotiated settlement to the communal
 problem. With India's help, a "cessation of hostilities"
 between the major militant groups and the Government was
 arranged, and face-to-face talks were begun in Bhutan; these
 broke down in August in the face of mounting ceasefire
 violations by both sides. The talks revealed a wide gap
 between Tamil demands and the concessions that the Government
 was prepared to make. Indirect exchanges between the
 Government and representatives of the Tamil separatists
 continued sporadically through the end of the year, but
 violence resumed at previous levels as intercommunal fighting
 spread to the multiethnic Eastern Province. The "cessation of
 hostilities" remained in effect only nominally, while a
 multiethnic ceasefire monitoring committee endeavored to
 investigate reports of violations by both sides. Its reports
 at the end of the year concluded that both sides had been
 guilty of violations.
 As in previous years, controversy over the actions of the
 security forces has been a major source of tension. Their
 numbers are relatively small: 18,000 in the police and 21,000
 in the armed services. They once had a considerable number of
 Tamils among their ranks, and as recently as 1984 the senior
 police officer was a Tamil. But by 1985 no more than 5.
 percent of police personnel were Tamils; in the armed services
 virtually 100 percent of enlisted ranks are now Sinhalese.
 The Government has admitted that breaches of discipline among
 the security forces have occurred and some measures have been
 taken to punish wrongdoers. A major problem has been the
 tendency of the security forces, when attacked, often by land
 mines planted by the separatists, to strike out
 indiscriminately at the civilian population. There are
 indications that the landmines are deliberately placed in
 civilian areas so as to provoke these retaliatory attacks by
 
 
 1379
 SRI LANKA
 the security forces. Civilians in disputed areas often fear
 both the security forces and the militant separatists.
 Some traditional rights remained restricted in 1985 because of
 the continuing insurgency. The Prevention of Terrorism Act
 (PTA), instituted as a temporary measure in 1979 and made
 permanent in 1982, gave the Government special powers to
 arrest without warrants and to detain for long periods without
 bail or charges those suspected of acting against the State.
 Emergency regulations, promulgated under the state of
 emergency which has been in effect since May 1983, have given
 the police broad powers, including the power of preventive
 detention. At midyear, however, the Government relaxed some
 restrictions adversely affecting residents of the north and
 east by lifting curfews and easing enforcement of security
 zones. Some detainees held under the PTA were released, while
 others were formally charged. In addition, formal press
 censorship was lifted in July.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The death toll, mostly in the north and east, from politically
 motivated violence arising from the communal conflict rose
 again in 1985. The Government estimated that 1,078 persons
 were killed due to ethnic violence. Of these, 885 were
 civilians, 75 police, and 118 members of the armed forces.
 Continuing violence throughout the year was punctuated by a
 number of particularly serious incidents of violence by both
 sides. While conclusive evidence is often lacking, the
 following are instances in which security forces allegedly
 attacked innocent civilians. On May 9, after a landmine
 explosion the previous day in which an army major was killed,
 members of an army patrol allegedly killed 43 young Tamil
 males in Velvetitturai on the Jaffna Peninsula. On May 15, a
 ferry enroute to the Jaffna Peninsula was stopped and 26
 Tamils were killed by a group of men armed with knives and
 blunt instruments; survivors of the attack claim to have
 recognized several of their attackers as members of a nearby
 Sri Lankan naval detachment; on the basis of a high-level
 naval inquiry, the Government has reported that there was no
 evidence that naval personnel had been involved. Members of
 the local home guards were identified by survivors as the
 perpetrators of an incident June 3 outside of Trincomalee on
 the east coast in which a bus was stopped and 13 Tamil
 passengers shot dead. On August 16, near Vavuniya in the
 north-central part of the country, members of an army patrol
 who had escaped injury from a landmine explosion moments
 earlier allegedly undertook reprisals against nearby Tamil
 civilians, reportedly killing as many as 100 people. The
 Government initiated an inquiry and reported that 22 were
 killed when army reinforcements arriving on the scene "acted
 without restraint," and that it was taking disciplinary action
 against the officer in charge of the reinforcements. On
 November 16 four policemen were killed in the east coast town
 of Batticaloa when a landmine detonated under their jeep.
 According to witnesses, police subsequently shot and killed
 nine local civilians.
 
 
 1380
 SRI LANKA
 In the few cases in which investigations have revealed that
 the security forces have acted improperly, the Government has
 maintained that it was unable to obtain adequate evidence to
 prosecute. It has instead dealt with misbehavior
 administratively. In 1985, four servicemen were "discharged
 with ignominy," and inquiries or disciplinary proceedings were
 being conducted against other members of the security forces
 allegedly implicated in such incidents as the deaths of Tamil
 civilians in Velvettiturai in May and in Vavuniya in August.
 In 1985, more than in previous years, Tamil militants targeted
 civilians in addition to the security forces. Typically
 Tamils accused of collaborating with the Government were tied
 to a lamp post or telephone pole with a sign noting their
 alleged crime, and then shot. According to Government
 figures, 61 Tamils were killed in this manner. The militants
 also assassinated several prominent members of Jaffna's Tamil
 community, including a school principal and two former members
 of parliament, for allegedly being traitors to the cause of
 Tamil Eelam. Militants were also responsible for setting the
 explosives which on January 19 destroyed most of the Yal Devi
 express train from Jaffna to Colombo, killing 29 soldiers and
 11 civilians. Tamils attacked police stations in Jaffna and
 Mannar in April and May respectively, killing close to 50
 police. On May 3 guerrillas attacked a naval base, an army
 camp, and a police station on the Jaffna Peninsula.
 Whereas most previous attacks against civilians had been
 directed against members of their own ethnic community, Tamil
 militants on May 14 attacked Sinhalese civilians in and near
 the ancient Sinhalese capital of Anuradhapura, killing 146
 persons, including 21 women and 14 children. It is widely
 believed that this incident of terrorism was in retaliation
 for the alleged killing of 43 young Tamil males in
 Velvettiturai by army personnel 5 days earlier. Tamil
 militants are also credited with attacks on the Eastern
 Province village of Namalwatte on November 7 in which 10
 Sinhalese civilians were killed and an attack September 16 on
 the Buddhist temple in Thirukunamadu, also in the Eastern
 Province, in which 2 Buddhist priests and 3 pilgrims were shot
 dead.
 b. Disappearance
 Although no accurate statistics are available, reported
 disappearances rose during 1985. There were a number of
 reports of the disappearance of young Tamil males who had been
 arrested and taken in for questioning by the security forces.
 In a practice once limited mostly to the Jaffna Peninsula,
 police and military patrols operating in the north-central and
 eastern-coastal parts of the country also began making
 large-scale arrests and detentions of young Tamil males as the
 insurgency spread to those areas. Amnesty International
 estimated in October that 180 such detainees had "disappeared"
 in "recent months." Some of those detained were later
 discovered by their families to be in detention at police
 stations or in army detention camps. Others have not been
 found. In several instances, relatives or organizations
 seeking information about the missing say they were told the
 individual had never been arrested, or had been released and
 departed for terrorist training outside the country, or had
 been shot while trying to escape. The Government estimated
 that 60 civilians and members of the security forces were
 abducted by Tamil militants and are presumed to have been
 
 
 1381
 SRI LANKA
 killed. The most prominent case of disappearance in 1985
 involved Father Mary Bastian, a Tamil Catholic priest in the
 western-coastal Mannar area. On January 5-6, an army patrol
 searching for guerrillas opened fire in the vicinity of his
 church, reportedly killing eight persons. According to some
 eyewitnesses, among those killed was Fr. Bastian. His body
 was never found and a government investigation reportedly
 failed to find evidence that security forces had killed him.
 At year's end, seven Sinhalese pilgrims travelling to a
 Catholic shrine in northwestern Sri Lanka were reportedly
 abducted by militants; their whereabouts remain unknown.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution guarantees that "no person shall be subjected
 to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
 punishment," and in 1982 the Government submitted to the U.N.
 a unilateral declaration opposing the use of torture.
 There have been persistent reports of torture or ill-treatment
 by military and police of persons detained under the
 Prevention of Terrorism Act. Amnesty International published
 a special report in October on torture in Sri Lanka. The
 report cites affidavits submitted by alleged victims, as well
 as statements by doctors who claim to have treated the victims
 and said that they were able to corroborate their allegations
 of ill-treatment. The Amnesty International report noted that
 torture victims are most often those detained for political
 offenses, either radical leftist Sinhalese or Tamils accused
 of collaborating with the separatists. The Government states
 that, because the alleged victims are not identified in the
 report, it is unable to respond to specific allegations of
 torture or to pursue inquiries into individual cases.
 Amnesty International also alleged that ill-treatment of
 detainees usually occurs in military camps or police stations,
 but is rarely reported in prisons, where regular criminals are
 held. The Government has stated that no police officers have
 been convicted of causing physical harm to persons in police
 custody.
 Prison conditions in Sri Lanka are not good, particularly in
 pretrial detention centers, many of which are old and
 overcrowded. In prisons for convicted prisoners, however,
 there is less overcrowding. The Government has begun
 construction of a new prison which is scheduled for completion
 in several years.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution stipulates that no person "shall be arrested
 except according to procedure established by law" and that an
 arrested person must be informed of the reason for his
 arrest. Within 24 hours, an arrested person must be brought
 before a magistrate who may authorize bail or, for serious
 crimes, continued detention. A suspect may be detained up to
 three months without bail, or longer if a court so rules.
 Persons convicted of criminal offenses may be sentenced to
 .rigorous imprisonment," (hard labor) under which they are
 compelled to work.
 There are exceptions to the normal rules for a person detained
 under the emergency regulations or under the Prevention of
 
 
 1382
 SRI
 Terrorism Act. Under the state of emergency, first declared
 in May 1983 and renewed monthly by Parliament since then, the
 President reissues each month the emergency regulations by
 gazette notification. The regulations give extraordinary
 powers to the police to use preventive detention on persons
 suspected of planning to commit offenses or to arrest
 individuals suspected of having committed a wide variety of
 crimes. Detainees under these emergency regulations can be
 held for up to 90 days on orders of the Attorney General,
 after which time the suspect must be produced before a
 magistrate. The magistrate is not empowered to investigate
 the case, but under the regulations he "shall" remand the
 detainee to a prison, where he can be held indefinitely. Bail
 may be granted at the discretion of the Government.
 The Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) provides that any person
 arrested under this law must be produced before a magistrate
 within three days unless the Minister of National Security
 orders the suspect to be detained for a period of three
 months. Such an order may be renewed for a period of up to 18
 months. The terms of detention are set out in this order;
 detainees do not have the same rights as other prisoners
 regarding' visits by family, access to lawyers, food, and other
 conditions of incarceration.
 The PTA and emergency regulations were used extensively in
 1985 to detain large-numbers of persons, mostly Tamil youths,
 especially in the north and east. The Government has reported
 it arrested 1,878 persons under the PTA. Of those, 880 had
 been released at-year's end. According to local human rights
 activists, there were 55 detainees,;as of November, who had
 been held without charges under the PTA for more than the
 legally permissible 18 months. In five cases, the Government
 chose to redetain them under the emergency regulations. The
 others were to be released, but at year's end only 8 of the 50
 had been released and 1 charged under the PTA; the other 41
 remained in custody.
 Several observers reported that a common practice of the
 security forces is to round up all-young men between the ages
 of 16 and 35 within about a square mile radius of the site of
 a terrorist incident. Those detained under the PTA are
 questioned and some are released, while others are taken to
 detention facilities. Relatives may write to the Defense
 Ministry. and ask that the case of-their family member be
 reviewed. The review is conducted by a three-man advisory
 board which considers the evidence, interviews the police and
 the detainee, and makes a recommendation. Many of the cases
 reviewed have led to a recommendation for immediate release,
 but it frequently takes several months for the process of
 review and release to be completed.
 The Constitution empowers the courts of appeal to issue writs
 of habeas corpus, and relatives of persons arrested under the
 PTA or the emergency regulations have brought several habeas
 corpus suits over the past few years. In no instance where
 the-court inquired into the detention and disappearance while
 in police custody of a suspect detained under these measures
 have the results been publicly released.
 There is no forced labor in Sri Lanka, other than for
 criminals sentenced to rigorous imprisonment.
 
 
 1383
 SRI LANKA
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Generally speaking, an accused person is entitled to a fair
 trial in open court, is represented by counsel of his choice,
 and is apprised of the charges and evidence against him.
 Accused persons tried in the high court are provided an
 attorney if they need one, but no attorney is provided by the
 Government for defendants tried in other courts.
 Although trial by jury is the custom, juries are not provided
 in trials under the Prevention of Terrorism Act on the grounds
 that jury members could be intimidated. Although the PTA has
 been in effect since 1979, and hundreds of people arrested
 under its terms, there had been only three trials under the
 act by mid-1985. Of those detained under the PTA who have
 been released, the large majority were held for a period of
 months and then set free without charges ever having been
 brought. The most publicized case of the trial of a PTA
 detainee, which began in November 1984, involved Father
 Aparnam Singarayar, who was arrested in November 1982 and
 charged with two offenses in February 1983. His trial on the
 first charge, that of withholding information from the police
 in a bank robbery case, was still under way at the end of 1985.
 The independence of the judiciary is constitutionally
 guaranteed. The Chief Justice and all judges of the Supreme
 Court, courts of appeal, and high courts are appointed by the
 President. The Chief Justice and two Supreme Court judges
 comprise a Judicial Service Commission which appoints,
 transfers, and dismisses all lower court judges.
 The judicial system in the northern Jaffna Peninsula has
 virtually ceased functioning due to intimidation by the Tamil
 militants. For most of 1985, police in the area have not
 performed their normal law enforcement activities and judges
 have tried only a few cases.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government respects individual privacy and the sanctity of
 the family and the home, and the judiciary has a good record
 of upholding rights to privacy in those cases which reach a
 high court. Ordinarily, search and arrest warrants are
 required in order to enter private premises. Under the
 Prevention of Terrorism Act, however, police officers above a
 certain rank and less senior officers authorized by them in
 writing may, without a warrant, enter and search any premises
 and seize "any document or thing" when there is a presumption
 or evidence of support for, or involvement with, unlawful
 activity. Critics claim that police and military personnel
 often enter the homes of Tamils without cause.
 Monitoring of telephones is not known to be a common practice,
 despite allegations by some critics of the Government that it
 taps their telephone lines.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees "freedom of speech and expression
 including publication," but it also permits these guarantees
 to be restricted "as may be prescribed by law in the interests
 
 
 1384
 SRI LANKA
 of national security." Sri Lankans are generally free to
 express their views in private but may be prosecuted under the
 emergency regulations for making certain kinds of remarks in
 public. Press censorship was in effect for five months in
 1985 on articles relating to terrorist activities, security
 operations, and communal matters. After formal censorship was
 ended on July 18, the Government asked the media to exercise
 restraint in publishing information on security-related
 subjects, and a measure of self-censorship was apparently
 practiced. In November, restrictions were placed on the
 publication of press reports on the activities of the
 Ceasefire Monitoring Committee.
 The Government adopted on March 31 a more restrictive policy
 regarding issuance of press credentials to foreign
 correspondents. Sri Lankan diplomatic missions were
 authorized to review a correspondent's past reporting or that
 of his journal for fairness and accuracy before a visa and
 press credentials were issued. In practice, however, many
 foreign journalists entered the country in 1985 on tourist
 visas.
 There also were some instances in 1985 in which individuals
 were prosecuted for their statements. A Canadian citizen of
 Sri Lankan descent, who was chairman of the citizens committee
 of the east coast town of Kalmunai, was charged in May with
 sedition for making certain statements, principally repeating
 to a foreign journalist a report he had given to the police
 about an alleged atrocity by the security forces. The
 Government accused him of relaying rumors and argued that it
 was irrelevant whether the rumors were true. One person,
 arrested after distributing leaflets at a demonstration by
 university students, was held for several days, then released.
 Although the Government controls the country's largest
 newspaper chain and owns the radio and television services, a
 variety of independent newspapers and journals provide a full
 range of viewpoints on foreign policy and most domestic
 matters. Many small circulation periodicals published by
 opposition political parties operate in an unrestricted manner.
 Academic freedom is generally respected. In January 1985, the
 Parliament passed a bill amending the Universities Act of
 1978. The amendments, among other things, provided for more
 government control over the selection of the senior university
 administrators, the vice chancellors. Critics charged that
 the amendments undermined the country's system of free higher
 education and restricted academic freedom by unduly increasing
 government influence. There were several demonstrations,
 sometimes violent, against the amendments in February and
 March. The Government responded by closing several
 universities temporarily and arresting or forcibly dispersing
 protestors in some instances. The Government also temporarily
 extended press censorship to matters pertaining to
 postsecondary education.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of assembly and
 association and the right to form and join trade unions. Sri
 Lanka has an abundance of private associations, devoted to the
 promotion of business, professional, educational, religious,
 charitable, and humanitarian causes, which are free to
 maintain ties with international bodies. However, there are a
 
 
 1385
 SRI LANKA
 few restrictions on free assembly and association. One
 leftist political party, the Janatha Vimukti Peramuna (JVP),
 has been proscribed since 1983. Under the emergency
 regulations, the President (or his designee) is empowered to
 prohibit public meetings which would be "likely to cause a
 disturbance to public order or promote disaffection."
 In practice, the police issue permits for outdoor, public
 meetings or processions and special permission is required for
 use of a loudspeaker. The question of whether to issue a
 permit is left to the discretion of the superintendent or
 assistant superintendent of an area, who may refuse a permit
 if he anticipates a breach of peace; in 1985 the practice of
 issuing permits sometimes appeared inconsistent. For example,
 one group advocating a peaceful settlement to Sri Lanka's
 communal conflict had several requests for demonstration
 permits denied. In contrast, a group of political and
 religious leaders opposed to continuation of the peace talks
 with Tamils received a permit for a public meeting.
 Worker rights are recognized and protected by law. Any seven
 workers may form a union, draw up their own procedures, elect
 their own representatives, and formulate programs. Workers
 are expressly granted the right to bargain collectively. When
 workers and employers are not able to resolve a dispute, there
 is an arbitration system which involves Labor Department
 officers. These officers are stationed throughout the country
 to assure that employers fulfill their legal and contractual
 obligations to workers and to be available for arbitration in
 minor local disputes.
 Excepting public service employees, workers are free to strike
 in Sri Lanka and have done so frequently. Under the emergency
 regulations, the President may declare any business to be an
 essential service, making a strike illegal. During 1985, the
 Government used this power to terminate strikes or other job
 actions several times. In the case of public service
 employees as well as workers in "essential services," the
 Government generally agreed to discuss grievances with a labor
 representative. A group of the 8,000 workers who were fired
 during a strike in 1980 brought a complaint against the
 Government in 1983 before the International Labor Organization
 Committee on Freedom of Association. In its session of
 May-June 1985, the Committee urged the Sri Lankan Government
 to do its utmost to reinstate those workers who had been
 without employment since 1980 and to conclude as rapidly as
 possible the trials of five trade union leaders who had been
 charged in connection with the 1980 strike.
 Over 1,000 labor unions and federations together represent
 about one-third of the 6.9 million-strong labor force.
 Workers in the nonplantation agricultural sector and most of
 those employed in small businesses, as well as workers in the
 free trade zone, are not represented by unions. Employees in
 the zone participate in labor-management company
 associations. Although there are a few independent unions,
 most of the largest worker organizations are affiliated with
 political parties, frequently operate as arms of those
 parties, and play a significant role in the political
 process. Since worker organizations' party affiliations are
 fixed, their memberships fluctuate depending on which is the
 governing party. Despite constraints arising from their
 political affiliations, Sri Lankan unions have been effective
 
 
 1386
 SRI LANKA
 in improving conditions for workers. Many unions maintain
 ties with international labor federations and trade
 secretariats.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although the Constitution establishes Buddhism as the official
 religion and requires the Government "to protect and foster"
 Buddhism, it also guarantees the right of all Hindus, Muslims,
 and Christians to practice their religions freely. Most
 members of the majority Sinhalese ethnic group are Buddhists,
 while most Tamils are Hindu. There are Christians from both
 groups. Religious differences generally are not a basis for
 discrimination. Sri Lankans of every faith are free to
 maintain links with coreligionists in other countries, as well
 as to undertake religious travel.
 Two cabinet ministers are assigned the additional portfolios
 of Minister of Muslim Affairs and Minister of Hindu Affairs to
 deal with issues involving those minority religions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution guarantees every citizen "freedom of movement
 and of choosing his residence within Sri Lanka" and "freedom
 to return to Sri Lanka." These guarantees are generally
 honored. The present Government removed exit visa
 requirements imposed by its predecessor and now permits
 virtually unimpeded emigration and foreign travel. Many Sri
 Lankans have taken advantage of this policy to seek jobs
 abroad. According to some estimates, there were 180,000 Sri
 Lankans working abroad in 1985.
 Some Sri Lankans, predominantly young male Tamils, have sought
 refugee status or political asylum abroad on the grounds that
 they are members of a persecuted minority. Despite the
 freedom to return cited in the Constitution, in 1985 there
 were a few cases of returning Tamils being arrested on arrival
 and detained for a period of days. Those detained either had
 traveled on forged passports or were suspected of narcotics
 offenses. The Government has said it does not take legal
 action or discriminate against those returning to Sri Lanka
 when their applications for asylum have been refused.
 Refugees or displaced persons from other countries are
 generally denied entry to Sri Lanka. The Government does not
 permit refugees to stay in the country even while they are
 seeking permanent residence elsewhere.
 Due to concern that Tamil terrorists were frequently crossing
 from southern India to northern Sri Lanka via the Palk
 Straits, the Government adopted a series of measures beginning
 in April 1984 which progressively restricted freedom of
 movement in that area. Expanding on the maritime surveillance
 zone imposed in April 1984, in November of that year the
 Government announced a prohibited zone along some 200 miles of
 Sri Lanka's northern coastline. It also imposed a security
 zone in the entire Jaffna Peninsula. These measures
 restricted free movement in the area to a considerable extent
 and made it virtually impossible for the large number of
 fishermen resident in that area to earn their livelihood.
 These restrictions as well as nightly curfews in the north
 were gradually relaxed during the late spring of 1985. The
 
 
 1387
 SRI LANKA
 curfew was terminated in July, but the restrictive zones
 remain technically in effect under the emergency regulations.
 As a result of these various restrictions as well as the
 threat or fear of becoming involved in the spreading communal
 violence, large numbers of Sri Lankans were displaced from
 their homes in 1985. According to some estimates, during the
 period 1983-1985 more than 100,000 Sri Lankan Tamils sought
 refuge in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The Government
 estimates that as of year's end some 46,000 persons were
 housed in refugee camps in Sri Lanka with another 94,000
 having sought refuge elsewhere in the country (with friends or
 relatives). Of the total estimated 140,000 displaced persons,
 88,000 are Tamils, 49,000 are Sinhalese, and the remainder
 Muslim. The continued unsettled security situation has made
 it difficult for these people to return to their homes.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Sri Lanka is an open, working, multiparty democracy. Citizens
 enjoy universal adult suffrage, and voter turnout is generally
 over 80 percent. Traditionally, the UNP and the other major
 political party, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), both of
 which draw their following mainly from the Sinhalese majority
 community, have alternated in forming governments. The
 current UNP government came to power in the general elections
 of 1977, gaining 51 percent of the popular vote and 83 percent
 of the seats in Parliament. The UNP government formulated a
 new Constitution, adopted by Parliament in 1978, which
 established the office of a directly elected executive
 president and provided for a proportional representation
 system in future parliamentary general elections.
 Jayewardene became the first President under the 1978
 Constitution and was returned to office in the presidential
 election of October 1982, gaining 53 percent of the popular
 vote. General elections to Parliament due in 1983 were not
 held. Instead, citizens went to the polls in a referendum
 held in December 1982 to vote on a constitutional amendment to
 extend the term of the 1977 Parliament from 6 to 12 years.
 Restrictions were imposed on the activities of opposition
 parties during the referendum campaign, and some voting
 irregularities were reported. The amendment was approved with
 54.5 percent of the votes and Parliament's term now runs until
 August 1989. UNP candidates have won most of the by-elections
 held since 1977, including the two held in 1985. President
 Jayewardene's United National Party now holds 140 out of 153
 occupied seats in Sri Lanka's unicameral legislature.
 Sri Lanka's political parties represent a variety of political
 views. Most opposition parties function freely, several
 operate their own newspapers, and the activities of their
 leaders are covered by the media. One party, however, the
 extreme leftist Janatha Vimukti Peramuna (JVP), has been
 proscribed since July 1983 for alleged involvement in communal
 riots during the last week of that month. In addition, the
 civic rights of the leader of the SLFP, Mrs. Sirimavo
 Bandaranaike, were suspended in 1980 for a period of seven
 years on the grounds that she exceeded her authority during
 her tenure as Prime Minister from 1970-77. Until her pardon
 on January 1, 1986, the suspension of her civic rights
 prevented her from serving in Parliament and campaigning on
 behalf of her party's candidates in elections.

 SRI LANKA
 Tamils, who comprise approximately 18 percent of the country's
 population, are primarily represented by two parties. The
 Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) claims to speak for the
 Ceylon Tamils resident in the north and east, and the Ceylon
 Workers Congress (CWC) represents the Indian Tamils. The
 President of the CWC serves as a minister in the present
 Government.
 Indian Tamils, who make up about one-third of the country's
 Tamil population, are descended from Tamils brought from India
 in the 19th century to work on the plantations. They do not
 qualify for Indian citizenship under Indian law and were
 denied citizenship under Sri Lankan law at independence.
 Under a 1964 agreement between the governments of Sri Lanka
 and India to address the problem of 1 million "stateless"
 Indian Tamils, many were repatriated to India or granted Sri
 Lankan citizenship. When the agreement expired in 1981, there
 were an estimated 94,000 Indian Tamils, plus their offspring
 born since 1964, who remained "stateless." The Government
 estimates that the total number of stateless Indian Tamils is
 currently around 150,000 persons. The Sri Lankan Government
 has stated its intention to grant citizenship to those
 remaining stateless.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is sensitive to adverse reports on its human
 rights situation but generally does not interfere with
 investigations. Senior government officials frequently make
 themselves available to visitors looking into human rights
 issues. There were several special reports on human rights in
 Sri Lanka in 1985.
 A representative of the Human Rights Standing Committee of the
 Law Association for Asia and the Western Pacific (LAWASIA)
 visited Sri-Lanka on a factfinding mission in February. The
 mission's report concluded that the situation had deteriorated
 since LAWASIA's last report in 1983 due to the escalating
 violence and the erosion of democracy and the rule of law.
 Also in February, two members of the British parliamentary
 human rights group visited Sri Lanka and concluded that "in
 the present situation human rights are being violated or
 infringed to a substantial extent."
 The chairman of the Australian parliamentary amnesty group
 visited Sri Lanka in June and presented his findings, an
 update of his initial report of June 1984, to the Emergency
 Committee on Sri Lanka, an informal international group of
 human rights activists. He found the ethnic conflict to be
 destroying the economy, violating human rights and
 undermining the progress of development programmes supported
 by many governments over many years." In October an Amnesty
 International newsletter included a special report on torture
 in Sri Lanka, based on affidavits and doctors' reports on the
 victims. The Government follows a practice of not responding
 to Amnesty International reports, which it says do not
 identify victims of alleged abuses and are based more on
 hearsay than hard information.
 In its 1985 Report (covering the year 1984), Amnesty
 International expressed concern about reports of random
 
 
 1389
 SRI LANKA
 killings of noncombatant Tamil civilians by members of the
 security forces; the detention of Tamils, members of left-wing
 opposition parties, and students under legislation permitting
 long-term detention without charge or trial; reports of
 widespread torture of detainees; and deaths in custody.
 Freedom House rated Sri Lanka "partly free."
 The International Committee of the Red Cross has a branch in
 Colombo which has been active in rehabilitation projects.
 Several local nongovernmental organizations monitor human
 rights in Sri Lanka. They collect information from families
 of victims or members of citizens' committees near the site of
 alleged incidents. Their periodic reports and appeals for
 change, however, are generally not addressed by the
 Government. Some attorneys represent defendants pro bono in
 those human rights cases which reach the courts.
 At the end of 1985, the Government was considering a proposal
 to establish a Civil/Human Rights Commission modeled on U.S.
 institutions which would be empowered to mediate grievances.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Sri Lanka's population of 16,334,000 is growing at an annual
 rate of 1.8 percent. The high rates of growth (over 6
 percent) in the gross national product (GNP) Sri Lanka enjoyed
 from 1978-81 have decelerated somewhat in recent years (5.2
 percent in 1984). The balance of payments situation
 deteriorated in 1985 due to a fall in tourism, lower world
 prices for tea, and the economic and social disruptions caused
 by the island's continuing ethnic strife. Lower government
 revenues and greatly increased defense spending have produced
 a record budget deficit which is expected to fuel inflation
 and contribute to depreciation of the currency. Development
 expenditures may also be curtailed to reduce the deficit.
 Under the current Government's market-oriented economic
 policies, the expansion of the private sector has been
 encouraged. Foreign investment has been welcomed but most has
 gone into the tourist and textile industries. Sri Lanka's
 rapidly growing textile exports now constitute its third
 leading earner of foreign exchange. Unemployment, chronically
 severe, was estimated at 11.7 percent in 1981, down from a
 postindependence high of 24 percent in the mid-1970's.
 Agriculture, contributing nearly a quarter of GNP and
 employing almost half of all Sri Lankan workers, is the
 largest and most important of the country's economic sectors.
 Lowlands are farmed by smallholders raising rice, fruits,
 coconuts, and vegetables, while the central hill country
 produces tea, largely in government-owned estates, and
 rubber. In 1984 Sri Lanka was very nearly self-sufficient in
 rice and overall was a net agricultural exporter. However,
 lower tea prices and production difficulties in the
 government-owned estates hurt the agricultural sector in 1985.
 The ambitious Mahaweli scheme, a series of modern dams and
 irrigation systems aimed at providing hydroelectric power and
 watering large tracts of underutilized arid land, has become a
 bone of contention in the current ethnic troubles. Some
 Tamils object to government settlement policies that are
 altering traditional local ethnic balances in newly irrigated
 areas. Militant Tamils have attacked Sinhalese settlers in
 some sections of the Mahaweli scheme.

 SRI LANKA
 Citizens have the right to acquire, hold, and dispose of
 property, but each individual may own only 1 house and no more
 than 50 acres. The Government permits noncitizen residents,
 except "stateless" Indian Tamils, to own property.
 Sri Lanka's quality of life is higher than that of countries
 of equal income. Life expectancy at birth is 69.9 years. The
 infant mortality rate is 28.4 per 1,000 live births. The
 calorie supply as a percentage of requirements is 98.4 percent
 (1977) and in 1980 one of three Sri Lankans had access to safe
 water (65 percent urban, 18 percent rural). Although a
 majority of Sri Lankans are poor by developed country
 standards, there is virtually none of the starvation-level
 poverty experienced in some other developing countries. Sri
 Lanka's free public health care system is generally good by
 Third World standards, though it is frequently plagued by
 shortages of medicines and modern medical equipment. In 1983
 there were 280 hospital beds and 13 doctors per 100,000
 population.
 ,Sri Lanka provides free education from primary school through
 university level. The primary school enrollment ratio is 102
 (male 104, female 99). The overall adult literacy rate is 87
 percent and is constituted as follows: males 91 percent,
 females 81 percent, rural 84 percent. Nearly 18,000 students
 (44 percent female) are enrolled in Sri Lanka's 8 universities.
 Under Sri Lankan labor laws, employment of children under age
 12 is prohibited. Those between age 12 and 14 are called
 child workers and may not be employed in industry or dangerous
 occupations; employment of young persons between 15 and 18 is
 subject to certain restrictions. Employees under age 18
 cannot be .required to work outside of specified hours. In
 addition, employers are required to provide annual leave, rest
 periods, and meal breaks. In practice, however, there is a
 child work force, probably numbering at least several
 thousand, who work illegally in Sri Lanka, mostly at jobs in
 rice cultivation, as domestics, or as street peddlers.
 Efforts to address this problem have been hampered by the fact
 that, in some cases, child workers are a major source of
 family income.
 There is no minimum wage, but wage boards for 34 different
 trades set minimum wages and working conditions. Actual wages
 and working conditions generally exceed these minimums. Most
 permanent, full-time workers are covered by laws which provide
 that they shall work no more than 45 hours per week, no more
 than 9 hours per day or more than 5 1/2 days per week, and
 that they will receive a-14-day paid holiday annually.
 Workers in the unorganized agricultural sector are not covered
 by these or any labor laws, although the Government may
 investigate individual complaints.
 Women have equal rights under the law, including equal
 property and inheritance rights. The various ethnic and
 religious groups have-their own strictures, however, which
 place some limitations on women. Some Tamil families believe
 their women members should not be seen working in public.
 Some Muslim women are discouraged by members of their
 community from seeking higher education or employment. Some
 women fill important posts in the civil service, the
 professions, and business, but the majority are found in
 manual and semiskilled jobs and in the home. Women vote in
 large numbers but otherwise play a more limited role than men

 SRI LANKA
 in the political process. There are currently six women
 members of Parliament, including one woman minister of cabinet
 rank. Sri Lanka had the world's first woman Prime Minister.
 The caste system is reportedly breaking down among Buddhists,
 but it remains important when marriages are arranged, and it
 continues to be widely observed among Hindu Tamils. Members
 of virtually all of Sri Lanka's ethnic minorities occupy
 prominent positions in all walks of public and private life,
 but since independence the Sinhalese majority has steadily
 strengthened its relative position of influence in most
 sectors of society. The miniscule Veddah population in 1985
 became even more thoroughly assimilated into larger Sri Lankan
 society. A number of hunting and gathering Veddah communities
 were provided with land on which to begin settled agriculture,
 and a few former hunters were offered jobs in national parks
 and reserves.
