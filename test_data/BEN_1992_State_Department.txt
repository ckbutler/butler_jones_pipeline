 BENIN
 In 1992 the Republic of Benin consolidated the democratic institutions of the new
 Government chosen in multiparty, free and fair elections in 1991. The executive,
 legislative, and judicial branches engaged in public sparring over matters of na-
 tional interest, such asprivatization of state-owned enterprises, but by midyear a
 presidential majority had been formed within the National Assembly.
 Benin's armed forces of approximately 8,000 personnel are under the direction of
 a civilian Minister of Defense, while the 1,500-man police force is under the Min-
 ister of the Interior. The one-dominant Beninese miit ary forces continued to main-
 tain a low profile in 1992, and an attempt by a disaffected army captain to lead
 a mutiny faied to obtain significant civilian support and ended in failure. The ques-
 tionable commitment of the military establishment to democratic change remains a
 cause of concern, as many of the coup plotters have escaped with help and fled the
 country. The Constitution provides for members of the Beninese armed forces, as
 well as civilian officials, to disobey the orders of military superiors if obedience
 would result in serious human rights violations. The Government's goal is to keep
 the armed forces professional and depoliticized. All Cabinet members are civilians.
 Total military expenditures for 1989, the last year for which the U.S. Arms Control
 and:Disarmament Agency conducted a detailed analysis, were $33 million. The Gov-
 ernment has implemented a voluntary release program to reduce the size of its
 armed forces, which should lead to spending reductions.
 Benin's underdeveloped economy is based largely on subsistence agriculture cot.
 ton production, regional trade, and small-scale offshore oil production. In accordance
 with World Bank and International Monetary Fund agreements, Benin has under-
 taken an austerity program for thespurpose, among others, of privatizing many
 state-owned enterprises, reducing fiscal expenditures, and deregulating trade. Benin
 suffers from a bloated and inefficient bureaucracy, high debt-servicing charges, and
 widespread unemployment.
 The human rights situation in Benin was good in 1992. The Government contin-
 ued to respect the fundamental human rights provided for in the 1990 Constitution.
 There were no political detainees or prisoners. Several well-known officials of the
 previous regime were tried publicly and convicted of corruption and theft. Others
 were convicted in public trials of common-law offenses in connection with election
 
 
 violence in 1991. The head of the now-disbanded Presidential Guard is still being
 held on charges of torture but has yet to be tried. Others accused of torture and
 murder under the old regime were arrested in 1992 and were awaiting trial at
 year's end.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killin.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killing.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution forbids torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. Public
 attention still focused on past incidents and on bringing to justice those who com-
 mitted acts of torture under the old regime. There were no reports of torture in
 1992. The former head of the Beninese intelligence apparatus, which carried out
 acts of torture under the old regime, and a deputy were arrested in September on
 charves of murder and at year's end were awaiting trial.
 Prison conditions in Benin remained harsh and characterized by extensive over-
 crowding as well as lack of sanitation and medical facilities. The prison diet is gross-
 ly inadequate, and malnutrition and disease are common among prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-With the release of the remaining politi-
 cal prisoners in 1990, arbitrary arrest and detention ceased to be practiced by the
 Government. Procedural safeguards against arbitrary arrest include a constitutional
 provision forbidding detention of more that 48 hours without a hearing by a mag-
 istrate, whose order is required for continued detention. There were credible reports
 that this limit was occasionally exceeded due to slowness of administrative process-
 ing of arrest files. According to a local human rights group, when such cases come
 to its attention and it lodges a protest, such detained individuals are promptly re-
 leased. There were no reports of incommunicado detention.
 The Constitution contains a provision prohibiting the Government from exiling
 any Beninese citizen, and exiles have returned to Benin in large numbers since the
 change in government and a 1990 presidential amnesty.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Benin's legal system is based on French civil law
 and on local customary law. A civilian court system operates on the national and
 provincial levels. Military disciplinary councils deal with minor offenses by military
 members but have no jurisdiction over civilians. Judges in civil courts are career
 magistrates, appointed by the President, and administratively they come under the
 Ministry of Justice. However, under the Constitution, officials are answerable only
 to the law in carrying out their duties and may not be removed.
 Serious crimes are first presented to an investigating magistrate who decides
 whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant a trial. A defendant has the right
 to be present at his or her trial and to be represented by an attorney, at public ex-
 pense, if necessary. In February the President and the Minister of Justice com-
 mented publicly about the timing of a particularly notorious criminal case involving
 a former Minister of State. Despite some protests that such high-level comment
 about a case under adjudication could prejudice the judicial process, it was generally
 conceded that the subsequent trial was a fair one.
 Under the Constitution, the highest courts are the Constitutional Court and the
 Supreme Court, which is the court of last resort in all administrative and judicial
 matters. The role of the Constitutional Court, which has yet to be actually formed,
 is to pass on the constitutionality of Beninese laws, and thus to act as the main
 judicial counterweight to the legislative and executive branches ofmgovernment.
 Until the Constitutional Court is seated in late 1992 or early 1993 its functions are
 assumed by the High Council of the Republic, a transitional body created by the
 1990 National Reform Conference. The Constitutional Court has a mandate to deter-
 mine the constitutionality of laws that may violate fundamental human rights. The
 Constitution also provides for a High Court of Justice-which also remained un-
 formed in 1992--to preside over cases of crimes committed against the nation by
 the President or by members of the Government.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of private property and of the home. Police
 are required to obtain a judicial warrant before entering a private home. In August
 the Beninese Human Rights Commission publicly protested as an abuse of legal
 process a police-assisted pretrial seizure of property and the consequent shutting
 down of a Cotonou business fnra in a civil dispute. The matter was referred to a
 civil court, and the business later reouened, albeit after a 6-week delay. There were
 
 
 no other reported violations of this requirement. There were no reports of govern-
 mental interference with private correspondence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion and of the press and other media. These rights were respected in 1992.
 Beninese freely discussed politics, both in public and private forums.
 In one case, President Soglo sued a private journalist for libel in a combined civil
 and criminal action. A court found the journalist at fault, sentenced him to a 6-
 month prison term, and ordered him to pay a symbolic fine. Although this case
 might have constituted a warning to the media, strongly worded public debate con-
 tinued. Observers described the trial as fair. Another journalist was given a sus-
 pended sentence of 6 months in jail for "unauthorized publication" of details of the
 allegations made in the original article.
 The Government continued to own and operate the most influential media, the
 local radio and television stations, and one daly newspaper, but official journalists
 continued to cover sensitive matters and to criticize the Government. The press car-
 ried extensive details on the abortive military mutiny in August. The press and tele-
 vision carried widely diverging views on Benin's internal debate over privatization
 of state enterprises. However, three government journalists were allegedly trans-
 ferred to new positions for having written or broadcast information which displeased
 the Government.
 There was no censorship of foreign books or artistic works. Foreign periodicals
 were widely available on newsstands, and much of the population listens to foreign
 broadcasts on short wave radio. In general academic freedom is enjoyed in schools
 and in the sole university. University professors are permitted to lecture freely in
 their subject areas, conduct research, and draw independent conclusions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution recognizes
 the rights of peaceful assembly and association. These rights were generally re-
 spected in 1992. Permits are required for use of public places for demonstrations,
 and associations are required to register. Both permits and registrations are rou-
 tinely granted. However, in March, in the wake of violence at the university cam-
 pus, the Minister of Interior banned a public meeting about the university situation
 sponsored by the Benin Human Rights League. The Government's stated reasons for
 its action were public safety and the fact that the required permit had not been
 sought.
 Multiple political parties as well as numerous religious and cultural associations
 exist. The Government did not take any actions against nonregistered organizations
 for failure or refusal to register.
 c. Freedom of Religion.--Christianity, Islam, and traditional religions coexist in
 Benin, and adherence to a particular faith does not confer any special status or ben-
 efit. Religious ceremonies and shrines of all faiths are protected by law. There are
 no restrictions on religious ceremonies, teachings, foreign clergy, or conversion to
 any religion.
 Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, and Repatriation.-
 Domestic movement is impeded somewhat by the presence of police, gendarmerie,
 and customs roadblocks throughout the country. In 1991 the Government disman-
 tled these roadblocks, but they reappeared in 1992. Ostensibly present for the pur-
 pose of enforcing automotive safety and customs regulations, many of these check-
 points serve as a means for officials who man them to exact bribes from travelers.
 Travel outside Benin is not restricted for political reasons; those who travel abroad
 may return without hindrance.
 Benin welcomes refugees and helps to integrate them into Beninese society if they
 choose not to return to their country of origin. Refugees who marry Beninese are
 entitled to citizenship. Benin is host to a number of refugees from the political crisis
 in Togo, but few register as such with authorities. Nearly all Chadian refugees have
 returned voluntarily to their homeland.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Benin in 1992 consolidated its new democratic institutions following the 1991
 elections in which President Nicephore Soglo was elected President and a new Na-
 tional Assembly was installed. There was some tension throughout the year between
 President Soglo and the National Assembly. There are 22 parties represented in the
 Assembly, many led by former presidential candidates, and no party holds a major-
 ity. By midsummer, Soglo was able to form a coalition, effectively giving him a ma-
 jority and thus calming the debate. The Constitution provides for a 5-year term of
 
 
 office for the President (who is limited to 2 terms) and a 4-year term of office for
 N atiunal Assembly members (who may serve an unlimited number of times).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several Beninese nongovernmental organizations monitor human rights; they in-
 clude the Human Rights Commission, the Study and Research Group on Democracy
 and Economic and Social Development, the Association of Christians Against Tor-
 ture, and the League for the Defense of Human Rights in Benin. In contrast to the
 attitude of the former authoritarian government, which considered outside inves-
 tigation into human rights unwarranted interference in Benin's internal affairs, the
 current Government has welcomed international and nongovernmental scrutiny of
 human rights in Benin.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination based on the above factors is prohibited in the Constitution and
 by law, and in practice the Government generally respected these prohibitions. How-
 ever, women continue to experience some societal discrimination and violence. Gov-
 ernment efforts to combat these practices have not been wholly effective.
 The Constitution specifically states that women are by law the equals of men in
 the political, economic, and social spheres. The Government officially encourages op-
 portunities for women, and 2 of 20 cabinet ministers are women. Beninese women
 also play a major role in the commercial sector. In rural areas, however, they tradi-
 tionally have occupied a subordinate role and are responsible for much of the labor
 on subsistence farms. In particular, women have not enjoyed the same educational
 opportunities as men. In some parts of the country, families are reluctant to have
 their daughters educated at all.
 While no statistics are available, violence against women, including wife beating,
 occurs even though it is prohibited by law. Cases are sometimes reported in the pri-
 vate press. Police and courts are reluctant to intervene in cases of domestic violence,
 considering such affairs to be family matters. Women's groups, as well as medical,
 legal, and religious personnel are aware that female circumcision is carried out; one
 reliable non-Beninese source estimates that up to 50 percent of Beninese women
 have undergone the procedure. Conventional wisdom has been that the practice ex-
 isted primarily in the north, but it has recently become evident that it is more wide-
 spread in the southern areas than previously believed. Efforts of a small Beninese
 nongovernmental committee on women's and children's welfare to reduce the prac-
 tice through educational measures have thus far met with only limited success.
 Among women's groups, the Association of Women Jurists has taken an active role
 in educating women about their legal rights. Some infants born with deformities
 and therefore deemed to be sorcerers, reportedly are killed at birth in some rural
 areas. Benin has a long history of regional rivalry. This led to violence during the
 1991 elections, when northerners supporting ex-President Kerekou's candidacy
 clashed with southerners. These clashes were most severe in northern cities and led
 to at least one death. In January, a number of persons were convicted of acts of
 violence in the north during the 1991 elections. In September there were demonstra-
 tions in some areas of the north by persons seeking amnesty for those convicted of
 election-related violence. Subsequent to President Sglo's election, southerners have
 reasserted their traditional claim to power, and relatively few northerners have
 been appointed to senior governmental positions. This fact, as well as the general
 lack of economic development in the north, have led to increased dissatisfaction with
 the Government. The southern third of the country, which was favored during the
 colonial period, has about two-thirds of Benin's population and is itself divided
 among various ethnic and religious groups.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The December 1990 Constitution gives workers the
 freedom to organize, join unions, meet, and strike, and those rights are respected
 in practice. Benin's labor force of about 2 million is primarily engaged in agriculture
 (80 percent), with less than 2 percent of the population involved in the modern
 (wage) sector. Approximately 75 percent of these modern sector wage earners belong
 to organized labor unions.
 In 1974 all preexisting unions were absorbed into a single trade union center
 which for 17 years was the designated mass organization of a single-party Marxist
 regime. This heretofore sole center, the National Workers' Union of Benin (UNSTB),
 declared its independence from the former ruling party in 1990 and now claims 26
 nationwide affiliated unions in Benin. The Confederation of Autonomous Unions, a
 .      ..-,d ,argcr feduration rormcd in 1991, reprcscnts an additional 23 unions,
 mostly in the Aublic sector. In February a new wrouo. the National Federation of
 
 
 Public Administration Trade Unions was formed, drawing members from the other
 two umbrella organizations.
 There were a number of labor actions in 1992 including strikes of petroleum
 workers, airline workers, and civil servants. The Government took no action to im-
 pede either these strikes or labor union demonstrations. In general unions and
 their memberships are not targets of human rights abuses in Benin. However, the
 Secretary General of UNACOB, a national driver's union, and four associates were
 convicted in September of inciting violence and insulting police officers. They were
 given suspended sentences of a year's imprisonment anda fine. The case arose
 when the union officials challenged the actions of police officials at a nighttime
 roadblock. They maintain their innocence of the charges, which have been appealed
 to a higher court.
 Confederations and individual unions have the right to affiliate with international
 labor movements. In 1990 the UNSTB disafliliated from the Communist-dominated
 World Federation of Trade Unions, and in March 1992 it affiliated with the Inter-
 national Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Beninese Labor Code
 provides for collective bargaining, which occurred in 1992 on such issues as assist-
 ance to laid-off workers and retirement benefits. The Code is basically copied from
 the French colonial labor code. Individual labor unions are authorized to negotiate
 with employers on labor matters and represent workers' grievances to both employ-
 ers and the Government, with the latter often voluntarily acting as arbitrator. The
 Labor Code prohibits employers from taking union membership or activity into ac-
 count when making decisions on hiring, work distribution, professional or vocational
 training or dismissals. There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by the Labor Code and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code prohibits the em-
 ployment or apprenticeship of children under the age of 18 in any enterprise. How-
 ever, enforcement by inspectors from the Ministry of Labor is limited, and child
 labor does occur, particularly in rural areas, where children below the age of 14
 often work on family farms. Some child labor occurs in urban areas, primarily in
 the informal sector. For example, street vendors of newspapers, petroleum products,
 and foodstuffs are frequently under the age of 16.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government administratively sets mini-
 mum wage scales for a numer of occupations. Most of those actually employed in
 the wage sector earn a good deal more than the lowest minimum wage, which was
 last set in 1984 and is sufficient only to provide rudimentary food and housing for
 a family. It must be supplemented by subsistence farming or small trade in the in-
 formal sector if a family is to enjoy a decent living.
 For the wage sector, the Labor Code establishes a workweek varying between 40
 hours (nonagricultural employees) and 56 hours (security guards), depending on the
 TS  e Government supports policies designed to improve the conditions of workers
 in both the agricultural and industrial sectors. The Labor Code establishes health
 and safety standards, but enforcement by inspectors from the Ministry of Labor and
 Social A airs is limited.
