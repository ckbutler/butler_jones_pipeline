 COSTA RICA
 Costa Rica has been a functioning constitutional democracy for
 almost 4 decades. The Government consists of three
 independent branches: executive, legislative, and judicial.
 Free and fair elections were held last in February 1982;
 nearly 80 percent of eligible voters participated. The
 tradition of alternating political parties in every election
 except one since 1948 continued and President Luis Alberto
 Monge of the National Liberation Party (PLN) defeated the
 candidate of the incumbent UNIDAD coalition. The President is
 constitutionally prohibited from succeeding himself, as are
 members of the Legislative Assembly. The 57 deputies in the
 Assembly are elected at the same time as the President and for
 the same 4-year term. The two major political parties now
 campaigning for elections in February 1986 are the National
 Liberation Party and the United Social Christian Party. A
 leftist coalition presently holds four seats in the
 Legislative Assembly. Included in the coalition is the
 Communist Party, which freely participates in the political
 process.
 Both police and national defense functions are performed by
 the Ministry of Public Security's Civil Guard and the Ministry
 of Government's Rural Guard in the countryside. The Judicial
 Police, charged with investigating crimes, is an entity of the
 judicial branch directly responsible to the Supreme Court.
 None of these entities has been associated with human rights
 violations.
 In Costa Rica's mixed economic system, the right to hold
 private property is legally protected, and approximately 70
 percent of the gross national product is produced by the
 private sector. Several government-owned autonomous agencies
 provide goods and services; the public sector is the nation's
 largest employer with around 20 percent of the work force.
 While inflation has been largely brought under control,
 unemployment and underemployment continue to be problems,
 especially among the young.
 Costa Rica abolished its standing army in 1949. The country's
 security forces, which are subject to civilian control, are
 few in number and inadequately trained and equipped. With the
 persistence of troubled relations with Nicaragua and
 consequent fear of internal subversion, there is widespread
 popular support for upgrading the Civil and Rural Guards.
 There is no significant public support for creating a
 professional armed force.
 Costa Rica has maintained its excellent human rights record
 over the past year. The Monge administration continued to
 demonstrate sensitivity to the need to protect basic human
 rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Neither the Government nor any other official entity has used,
 abetted, or condoned killing as a political weapon.
 
 
 COSTA RICA
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no known incidents of abductions, secret
 arrests, or persons held clandestinely by any agency of the
 Government.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution states that "no one shall be submitted to
 cruel or degrading treatment nor to life imprisonment. A
 statement obtained through violence shall have no value."
 These injunctions are respected in practice. Prisoners are
 treated humanely in Costa Rican prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There have been no known violations in this area. There are
 no detentions for expression of dissenting opinions. Warrants
 are required for both searches and arrests; the Constitution
 requires that an arraignment take place within 24 hours of
 arrest. Bail is provided for. These requirements are
 strictly enforced. There is no preventive detention.  It is
 unconstitutional to exile a citizen. Habeas corpus and amparo
 are honored in practice. The judiciary is fully independent
 and effective.
 The Constitution prohibits and there are no known instances of
 forced or compulsory labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is widely recognized as fair and independent.
 Accused persons may select their own attorneys; access to
 counsel is guaranteed, with free public counsel provided for
 defendants without means. The right to an open, impartial
 trial is guaranteed and honored in practice. The right to
 bail is provided for in law and is observed in practice.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There have been no reported instances of extralegal invasions
 of privacy conducted by, or with the knowledge of, agencies of
 the Government over the past year.
 Section 2 Respect For Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution specifically guarantees freedom of speech and
 press. These freedoms are fully respected in practice. Two
 Communist parties publish weekly newspapers, and the media
 report news and information spanning the political spectrum.
 There are three privately owned television stations and
 numerous radio stations, which pursue independent editorial
 policies. The media freely air differences with, and
 criticism of, the Government. There is no evidence of either
 collusion or repression. Terrorist activities are fully
 covered.
 Foreign journalists have challenged the Costa Rican courts'
 refusal to recognize their credentials which would allow them
 
 
 477
 COSTA RICA
 to practice their profession in Costa Rica. The issue,
 involving the Costa Rican National Journalists Association's
 right to accredit reporters, was heard before the
 Inter-American Court on Human Rights in September 1985. On
 November 14, the Court declared that a Costa Rican law
 requiring membership by journalists in the
 government-sponsored journalist college was incompatible with
 the Freedom of Information Guarantee of the Inter-American
 Human Rights Convention. The decision, which is consultative
 and nonbinding, was unanimous. The Government of Costa Rica
 has not indicated yet how it will respond to the Court's
 decision.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Constitutional guarantees of freedom of assembly and
 association are fully respected in practice.
 Workers have the right to organize and the right to
 association by organized labor as defined by the International
 Labor Organization (ILO) is fully honored. Unions are
 independent of government control. About 15 percent of the
 work force is organized into unions, primarily in the public
 sector and on banana plantations. Unions are free to maintain
 relations with recognized international bodies such as the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the ILO.
 Several major unions, including those representing banana and
 public service workers, are controlled by Communists, whose
 influence in organized labor is disproportionate to their
 overall influence in Costa Rican society.
 Procedures for collective bargaining and arbitration of labor
 disputes are prescribed in law and followed in practice. The
 country's Labor Code states that when one-third of the workers
 in an operation are union members, the employer must conclude
 a collective agreement, if requested. The Labor Code also
 permits employees to set up permanent grievance committees to
 handle both individual and collective disputes. When labor
 disputes arise, the first attempt at a solution is made by the
 Office of Conciliation of the Ministry of Labor in San Jose
 (or the Labor Inspector if the dispute is outside the
 capital). If conciliation fails, the case goes to a Labor
 Court which must approve a planned strike or lockout before
 the strike legally can begin. Public sector strikes are
 illegal. Unions have complained that the process of having a
 strike declared legal is complicated, time-consuming, and
 often unsuccessful. In 1985, there were only seven strikes,
 each court-approved, each of minimal economic significance.
 Both democratic and Communist unions displayed their
 dissatisfaction with government-mandated price hikes and
 delays in salary increases by participating in a number of
 peaceful demonstrations, including the traditionally
 antigovernment May Day Parade, which is fully tolerated by the
 Government.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed in the Constitution and
 observed in practice. Roman Catholicism is the official state
 religion, but other religious groups have significant numbers
 of adherents who participate without prejudice in the social
 and political life of the nation (a non-Catholic can be
 elected President of Costa Rica). Foreign missionaries and
 clergy freely enter Costa Rica. There are no restrictions on
 proselytizing.

 COSTA RICA
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no unusual restrictions on traveling within the
 country or abroad. Emigration is not restricted. A citizen's
 right of return is guaranteed. Costa Ricans and foreigners
 are free to live anywhere within the national boundaries.
 Costa Rica has supported multinational refugee programs and
 has accepted many thousands of refugees from Cuba, other
 Central American countries, and South America. The continuing
 large influx of Nicaraguan refugees has seriously strained
 national resources, but there has been no move toward
 repatriation.
 The Constitution specifically prohibits the Government from
 repatriating any non-Costa Rican who may be subject to
 political persecution in his own country. Costa Rica has
 traditionally afforded political asylum to exiled dissident
 groups of various political orientations.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Costa Rica is ruled by a Government elected by its people.
 The Constitution provides for a free, open, and competitive
 electoral system, and this provision is scrupulously honored
 in practice. The integrity of elections--generally regarded
 as unimpeachable--is overseen by the independent Supreme
 Electoral Tribunal. No political party is outlawed or
 excluded from the electoral process; no party has dominated
 the affairs of the nation; no eligible voter is deterred from
 participating in elections; no ethnic, economic, or other
 group dominates; no segment of the citizenry is excluded from
 the political process. Individuals can and do petition their
 elected representatives for legislative redress and assistance
 with government bureaucracies.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 A strong supporter of international and private human rights
 organizations, Costa Rica has extended a permanent invitation
 to the Inter-American Human Rights Commission to visit
 whenever it wishes. Costa Rica was one of the first countries
 to ratify the American Convention of Human Rights. It has
 accepted the jurisdiction of the Inter-American Institute
 Court of Human Rights, which is based in San Jose, and hosts
 the Inter-American Institute of Human Rights. Costa Rican
 Government officials at the highest level participate in and
 actively support the human rights activities of both the
 Institute and the Court. Several major international human
 rights conferences sponsored by the Institute have been held
 in San Jose. Overall, Costa Rica has been in the vanguard in
 the promotion of human rights institutions.
 Freedom House rated Costa Rica "free." Amnesty International
 1985 Report (covering the year 1984) expressed concern over
 the August 1984 arrest of members of the National Patriotic
 Committee of Alajuela during a protest demonstration. Amnesty
 International's concern was based on the possibility that the
 detainees were ill-treated while in custody and that the basis
 for their detention may have been fabricated.

 COSTA RICA
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The population of 2,644,000 is growing at a rate of 2.6
 percent annually. Per capita gross national product (GNP) is
 $1,289.
 Economic problems currently facing Costa Rica stem from the
 nation's vulnerability to changes in the prices of its major
 exports (coffee, bananas, and sugar) as well as the nation's
 heavy importation of oil, raw materials, consumer durables,
 and foodstuffs, and external borrowing from public and private
 lenders. A government austerity program has succeeded in
 lowering the inflation rate and restoring positive GNP growth,
 but higher prices for consumer goods and constraints on wages
 have increased hardships to large sectors of the population.
 Government efforts to meet the society's economic and social
 needs are made on a nondiscriminatory basis.
 Unemployment, officially calculated at 6.5 percent, is
 unofficially 8 to 10 percent. Underemployment, affecting as
 much as 20 percent of the population, is particularly acute
 among recent university graduates frustrated over their
 inability to find employment in their fields of study. The
 steadily increasing number of refugees from Nicaragua has
 further aggravated the employment situation. In addition to
 the 23,000 mostly Salvadoran and Nicaraguan refugees in Costa
 Rica receiving financial assistance from refugee relief
 organizations, the Government estimates there are 250,000
 illegal aliens seeking to blend into the already overburdened
 economy; approximately half of this number are Nicaraguans.
 Despite its myriad problems, Costa Rica's per capita GNP was
 the highest in Central America in 1984. Economic progress,
 however, is not uniformly distributed. Severe poverty exists
 in some outlying areas, while development has been most
 noticeable in the central plateau surrounding the capital of
 San Jose.
 Life expectancy at birth is 74.1 years. The rate of infant
 mortality is 19 per 1,000. Primary school enrollment is over
 100 percent of the school-age population because Costa Rica
 has universal education, and 90 percent of adults over the age
 of 14 can read and write. The ratio of caloric supply to
 nutritional requirements is 118 percent; 84 percent of the
 population has access to safe water.
 The 1949 Constitution defines the normal hours of the workday,
 remuneration for overtime, days of rest, and annual vacation
 rights. It specifies compensation for discharge without due
 cause, the right to a minimum wage, and special protection for
 women and minors. The minimum working age is 12, with special
 protections in force for workers under 15. A national wage
 board (composed of three members each from government,
 management, and labor) sets minimum wages and salaries for
 every occupation in every industry, including agriculture.
 The Constitution sets normal work hours at 8 hours for daytime
 and 6 hours for nighttime work, with weekly totals of 48 and
 36 hours respectively. Ten-hour days are permitted for work
 not considered unhealthful or dangerous, but weekly totals may
 not exceed 48 hours. Nonagricultural workers receive an
 overtime premium of 50 percent of regular wages for work
 performed in excess of the daily work shift. Agricultural
 
 
 480
 COSTA RICA
 workers are not paid overtime if they voluntarily work beyond
 their normal hours.
 A 1967 law governs health and safety at the workplace.
 Industrial, agricultural, and commercial firms with 10 or more
 workers are required to have a joint safety committee. The
 law allows the Government to inspect workplaces and to fine
 employers for violations. However, a shortage of labor
 inspectors, especially outside San Jose, limits the Ministry's
 ability to ensure that minimum conditions of safety and
 sanitation are always maintained.
 Increased population pressures and economic decline have
 greatly influenced peasant demands for agricultural land.
 Groups have organized, in some cases with Communist support,
 to invade both private and public lands. Squatting, although
 illegal, continues to be a major problem given the
 government's inability to prevent it and to implement an
 effective and equitable land reform system.
 The role of women, although still primarily domestic, is not
 limited in Costa Rica. Women are represented in all
 professions, in the highest ranks of organized labor, in the
 private business sector, and in the Government (occupying
 prominent positions in the legislature, as well as in the
 executive branch and the judiciary). Women and minority
 groups participate freely in Costa Rica's elections.
 Costa Rica's population includes some 30,000 West Indian
 Blacks and 25,000 Indians. English is the second language of
 the country primarily because it is spoken by the Caribbean
 Blacks. Most of the Indians speak Spanish and live in a
 traditional manner on 19 reserves throughout the country.
 Because most live in remote areas, they often lack access to
 schools, health care, electricity, and potable water. The
 Government is currently involved in programs to provide
 primary education to the Indians and to buy out "islands"
 within the Indian reserves which are owned by non-Indian
 people.
