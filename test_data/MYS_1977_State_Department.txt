 MALAYSIA
 Malaysia is governed under a parliamentary system modeled
 generally along British lines. A national front coali-
 tion of parties dominates parliament at the present time.
 There is a small but vocal opposition which criticizes
 the government regularly. Free and honest elections are
 held at intervals of no longer than five years. A multi-
 racial society of politically dominant Malays and eco-
 nomically involved Chinese and Indians, Malaysia has
 experienced severe communal violence in its past including
 racial rioting in May of 1969 during which hundreds were
 reported to have died. Malaysia has been engaged in an
 armed struggle with the Malayan Communist Party (CPM)
 since 1948. The insurgency has included assassinations
 and acts of terrorism as well as guerrilla warfare. Com-
 munist insurgency and the threat of renewed communal
 conflict have been cited by the Malaysian Government as
 justification for legislation which makes legal the arrest
 and detention without trial of persons suspected of
 subversive activity or of other activities that threaten
 general civic order.
 Over the past twenty years of independence, and despite
 the demands posed by the communist insurgency, Malaysia
 has made major economic strides and social progress with
 the result that it is one of the more prosperous countries
 in Asia.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Torture is neither practiced nor condoned by the Govern-
 ment of Malaysia.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment is neither practiced
 nor condoned by the Government of Malaysia but individual
 instances of mistreatment by civil law enforcement of-
 ficers occasionally occur.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest of Imprisonment
 Arrest and imprisonment have occurred without benefit of
 (253)
 
 
 254
 trial or the right of habeas corpus. The presence of
 the CMP threat and racial tensions have been cited by
 the government as justification for the perpetuation
 and use of emergency regulations originating under the
 British. These regulations legalize arrest and detention
 without open trial of persons suspected of subversive
 activity or other actions detrimental to the domestic
 tranquility of the country. The regulations, known
 as the Internal Security Act (ISA) and the Emergency
 (Public Order and Prevention of Crime) Ordinance, 1969,
 (E.O.), providefor preventive detention for up to two
 years. A detention order under the ISA can be renewed.
 A person detained under the emergency laws has no re-
 course to the courts in the ordinary sense, but as soon
 as possible after arrest must be told the reason and
 given a chance to argue the case. If detention is con-
 tested, it must be heard within three months by a three-
 man advisory board. If the detention continues, the
 case is periodically reviewed by the Appeals Board. In
 most cases, the use of the Internal Security Act appears
 to follow a cycle of arrest, detention, recantation and
 restoration to public respectability. The Emergency
 Ordinance, while enacted in the wake of the May 1969 racial
 disturbances, has in practice been most often used against
 narcotics traffickers and other serious criminals in the
 absence of strong conspiracy laws. The normal pattern
 for enforcing the E.O. is two years imprisonment followed
 by two years of "restricted residence" in a remote area
 of the country.
 In addition to the ISA and E.O., the government also makes
 use of the Emergency (Essential Powers) Ordinance of
 1969. This is the enabling legislation for the Essential
 (Security Cases) Regulations of 1965, which restrict the
 rights of the accused in "security case" trials by
 allowing in-camera trial, unidentified witnesses and a
 presumption of guilt.
 The Amnesty International Report of 1977 states that
 several hundred men and women are being held without
 trial for political reasons, many having been held for
 periods of eight and, in some cases, thirteen years.
 While several hundred people are known to be detained
 in Malaysia, only a few are believed to be held on
 political, as contrasted with security and criminal,
 grounds.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Public trial and a fair hearing occur in all but a small
 
 
 255
 minority of cases. As previously noted, persons detained
 for security reasons and certain types of criminals are
 held and provided hearings under special procedures out-
 side the ordinary court system (see l.c.).
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is the general rule,
 with the exception of cases related to security legis-
 lation. In its counter-insurgency effort against the
 Communist Party of Malaya, the Government of Malaysia
 makes extensive use of its powers under the Internal
 Security Act to enter and search the homes of suspects.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Over the past twenty years of independence, and despite
 the demands posed by the communist insurgency, Malaysia
 has made tremendous economic strides with the result
 that it is one of the most prosperous of the developing
 countries (third in all East Asia in per capita GNP,
 after Japan and SingapQre). It has amply demonstrated
 its concern for raising the standard of living of all
 citizens as well as conducting what amounts to a coali-
 tion government along communal lines. Alleviation of
 rural poverty in all its aspects is the main thrust of the
 Third Malaysia Plan announced in mid-1976 and logically
 follows earlier developmental efforts which concentrated
 on the broadening of essential services and industrial
 infrastructure. Active government programs exist to
 improve health care, education, housing and rural
 nutrition.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties Including:
 a.   Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Tensions between ethnic Malay and Chinese citizens
 resulted in race riots in 1969 and the suspension of
 parliamentary democracy for two years. Since then, cer-
 tain "sensitive" topics related to ethnic grigins or privi-
 leges may not be discussed in public or in parliament.
 
 
 256
 A state of emergency was proclaimed during the communal
 rioting in accordance with existing law and continues
 to be in effect. The Emergency Laws are designed to
 reduce the risk of communal violence by forbidding any
 public exacerbation of racial tensions.
 The press as a consequence is constrained. The activities
 and statements of opposition political figures and
 domestic politics are reported. While there is no formal
 censorship, other than the constitutional prohibitions
 against discussion of certain ethnically loaded topics,
 the press is circumspect in its treatment of the govern-
 ment and is mindful of the need for annual renewal of
 publishing licenses.
 WhileMalaysia is officially Muslim the government does
 not discriminate against other religious faiths.
 The Malaysian Government permits normal trade union activ-
 ity although labor legislation does circumscribe union
 behavior. There are around 350 trade unions with a total
 of about 500,000 members. Most of the unions are mem-
 bers of the Malaysian Trade Union Congress, an active
 member of the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions. The freedom to strike exists and is used.
 b.   Malaysia in general observes freedom of domes-
 tic and foreign movement, including emigration. However,
 freedom to travel between Peninsular Malaysia and the
 Borneo states of Sabah and Sarawak is constitutionally
 subject to control by the federal and state governments.
 Persons wishing to travel abroad must obtain passports
 which have been denied in a few cases.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Malaysia is a parliamentary democracy generally along
 the British model, with a prime minister and cabinet
 responsible to parliament. The head of state is a con-
 stitutional monarch, a king who is elected for a five-
 year term by the Sultans of West Malaysia from among
 their own members. The bicameral parliament consists of
 a senate (with both appointed and elected members) and
 an elected house of representatives, where a small
 but vocal opposition criticizes the government regularly.
 Legislative power is further divided between federal and
 state legislatures. State executive administrations
 
 
 257
 attend to matters of local concern. Free and honest
 elections on the basis of universal adult sufferage
 are held as spdcified by the constitution. Domestic
 political life is vigorous within the constraints of the
 communal basis of politics, including some restrictions
 on political expression.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Interna-
 tional and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights.
 The Department is not.aware of any requests to investigate
 human rights conditions in Malaysia. The cases of several
 inaividuals detained in Malaysia without trial have
 been raised in the U.S. and elsewhere. Malaysian news-
 papers report on violations of legal standards and act
 as informal ombudsmen--as does the opposition within
 the Malaysian Parliament and the very active bar
 association.
