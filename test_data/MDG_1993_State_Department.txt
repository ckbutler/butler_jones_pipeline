 MADAGASCAR
 Albert Zafy became President of Madagascar in March after defeating incumbent
 President Didier Ratsiraka in a runoff election determined by international observ-
 ers to have been generally free and democratic. Legislative elections followed in
 June, and the new National Assembly, representing a spectrum of political parties,
 convened in August to choose Francisque Ravony, Vice Prime Minister of the pre-
 vious unelected transitional government, as Prime Minister. Ravony's Government
 took over from the transitional government, led by Guy Willy Razanamasy, which
 was formed in late 1991 following mass protests against incumbent President Didier
 Ratsiraka who had ruled for 16 years.
 Like the political system, the security forces have been going through a period of
 transition. Mixed commands of military, gendarmerie, and the national police are
 now responsible for internal security and arc under civilian control. During the
 year, the army slowly assimilated the 1,800-man Presidential Security Guard, which
 ad been loyal to ex-President Ratsiraka and responsible for some violence aimed
 at upsetting the electoral process in 1992. In April mixed commands, acting under
 
 
 159
 orders from President Zafy and then-Vice Prime Minister Ravony, intervened in
 Antsiranana (Diego Suarez) to round up more than 90 extremists, notably arresting
 several army officers accused of involvement with "Federalists" (Ratsiraka's support-
 ers). On June 1, a similar group of combined security forces successfully expelled
 Federalist militants who had taken over provincial administration buildings in
 Toliara (Tulear). There were no reports of physical mistreatment of detainees by the
 security forces.
 Despite some political and economic reforms, living standards have deteriorated
 in recent years. The economy remains highly dependent on agriculture, and the
 long-run prospects for traditional export products such as vanilla and coffee are not
 encouraging. The outlook for tourism, manufacturing, mining, and fishing is more
 positive, but to date these activities have played a relatively minor role in the econ-
 omy. Smuggling of vanilla, gold, precious stones, and cattle is of gwing concern.
 Unemployment and underemployment are serious problems in Madagascar, espe-
 cially among the young (about 60 percent of the population is under age 25).
 The human rights situation improved with the holding of two free and fair elec-
 tions and the installation of a new President, a new National Assembly, and a new
 Government. Citizens freely exercised freedoms of speech, press, and assembly, al-
 though there remained some self-censorship by the media. Despite this progress,
 there were a number of human rights abuses, notably in the extrajudicial actions
 by the pro-Ratsiraka militants in seizing administrative buildings in Toliara, which
 resulted in at least two deaths. Other violence between Federalists and pro-Zafy
 militants (Active Forces or Forces Vives) in Diego Suarez Province in March and
 April also left a small number dead. Other abuses centered on ineffective law en-
 forcement, which resulted in increased vigilante extrajudicial actions, including
 summary executions, and on the weak and overburdened judicial system in which
 the accused, primarily because of long delays, often do not receive due process.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-There were no known political
 killings by government forces. However, there were extrajudicial killings in the  -
 litically motivated violence between Federalist and Active Force supporters in the
 north (Antsiranana) and south (Toliara) coastal areas. Tensions between these two
 rups were high in the context of the presidential election cam p aign which pitted
 Alert Zafy against Didier Ratsiraka. In these two areas especially, the supply and
 availability of illegal firearms helped spark violence and lawlessness. Victims of
 physical and material damage were usually known political activists. Political mili-
 tants, thugs, and organized criminals no doubt used the cover of political unrest to
 settle personal scores in some cases. In restoring order in Antsiranana and Toliara
 provinces, government forces did not use excessive force and reportedly detained
 those arrested in humane conditions.
 In March gendarmes killed two unarmed German scientists who apparently were
 suspected of poaching at night in Garagantasy Forest Reserve near Mahajanga. A
 gendarme was also killed in the encounter, presumably accidently by his own men,
 and another German was seriously wounded. Investigation into the killings, while
 not conclusive, suggests the gendarmes used excessive force.
 Continued crime and inadequate law enforcement resulted in increased instances
 of civilian vigilantes taking summary retribution against alleged criminals. In an ef-
 fort to cope with rising insecurity in the countryside, the President and transitional
 government officials encouraged the use of village-level mutual security pacts,
 known as "dina," which are administered by local traditional leaders (see Section
 i.e.). Officials attempted to conform dina punishments to codified law but failed to
 prevent some extrajudicial executions of suspects who were not allowed adequate
 defense or due process rights.
 The Government's investigation into the killing of more than 30 demonstrators by
 guards at then-President Ratsiraka's Tavoloha Palace on August 10, 1991 was still
 p ending at year's end, and no arrests or convictions had resulted. Nor had there
 been an official report on the shooting by soldiers on March 31, 1992, at the Na-
 tional Forum (Constitutional Convention) in Antananarivo which left six pro-
 Ratsiraka supporters dead.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no permanent disappearances in 1993 and no ac-
 knowledged cases of unsolved abductions or disappearances; however, unsubstan-
 tiated rumors and accusations of disappearances following the August 1991 con-
 frontation at Tavoloha Palace persist. The Government is not actively investigating
 this case.
 
 
 160
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution provides for the inviolability of the person. However, credible re-
 ports indicate that dina trials in remote areas used various ordeals, even torture,
 in determining guilt.
 Conditions in prisons are harsh and life threatening. The diet provided is inad-
 equate, and farmily members must augment inmates daily food rations, in some
 cases after bribing guards. Those prisoners without relatives in the prison vicinity
 sometimes go for days without food. Each prisoner has on average less than one
 square meter of space. Prisoners, estimated at 23,000, suffer a wide range of medi-
 cal problems that are not routinely treated, including malnutrition, infections, ma-
 laria, and tuberculosis, which are exacerbated during the winter months. There
 have been an unknown number of deaths resulting from these conditions.
 Women in prison have suffered abuses, including rape, as inmates in unsegre-
 gated prison confinement. A number of children live in the prisons with their moth-
 ers, suffering the same deprivations, and some guards conspire with female inmates
 to promote prostitution. The Government permits prison visits by the International
 Committee of the Red Cross, the Malagasy Red Cross, and religious and charitable
 organizations. On at least one occasion, even the media were permitted access to
 prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Legal safeguards against arbitrary arrest
 and detention are not always observed. According to the law, in a criminal case, the
 detainee must be charged or released within 3 days of arrest. An arrest warrant
 may be obtained but is not always required. Generally, defendants in criminal cases
 are charged formally within the specified time frame and, upon being charged, are
 allowed to obtain an attorney. Counsel is available, and court-appointed counsel is
 provided for indigents. Bail may be requested by the accused or by his attorney im-
 mediately after arrest, after being formally charged, or during the appeal process.
 Denial of bail may be appealed. The Penal Code provides for a determination of ha-
 beas corpus.
 Despite these legal provisions, average pretrial detention time exceeds 1 year, and
 3 or 4 years of detention is common, even for crimes for which the maximum pen-
 alty may be 2 years or less. Prisoners may wait years in prison only to be found
 not guilty, with no recourse. According to reliable estimates, around 60 percent of
 the prison population is in pretrial detention. By law, persons suspected of activity
 against the State may be detained incommunicado for 15 days, subject to indefinite
 extension if considered necessary by the Government.
 The Government held more than a dozen political and security detainees at year's
 end.
 At his inauguration in March, President Albert Zafy announced a general am-
 nesty restoring all political and civil rights to prisoners or exiles condemned for po-
 litical reasons under the regime of Didier Ratsiraka. The sole beneficiary of this am-
 nesty was Major Richard Andriamaholison who had been condemned in 1981 for
 plotting against Ratsiraka and was exiled to France in 1990. He returned to Mada-
 gascar in time to win a seat in the National Assembly in June.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution adopted in 1992 provides for an
 independent judiciary, and, in practice, the judiciary seems to function without
 undue influence from the executive. However, excessive pretrial detention of the ac-
 cused results in the denial of due process. To deal with this problem and purport-
 edly to assure the independence of the judiciary from the executive and legislative
 branches, Prime Minister Ravony appointed a new Government in August which,
 for the first time since independence, ad no Ministry of Justice. Instead, he created
 the position of a Minister responsible directly to him to act as a liaison with the
 judiciary.
 Trials are public, and defendants have the right to be present, to confront wit-
 nesses, and to present evidence. Defendants enjoy a presumption of innocence under
 the Penal Code.
 The judiciary has three levels of courts: lower courts for civil and criminal cases
 carrying limited fines and sentences; a Court of Appeals which includes a criminal
 court for cases carrying sentences of 5 years or more; and a Supreme Court. The
 judiciary also has a number of special courts designed to handle specific kinds of
 cases under the jurisdiction of the higher courts. A Constitutional High Court, with
 a separate and autonomous status, is a body for review of laws, decrees, and ordi-
 nances and for certifying election results.
 Traditional institutions, known as dina, technically handle only civil matters
 within and between villages; in practice, the dina are used increasingly in criminal
 cases because of the practical inadequacies of the formal police and judicial systems.
 Decisions by dina are not subject to procedural protection of due process or to judi-
 
 
 cial review, and their authority depends upon a customary consensus to abide by
 their rulings. Punishments are severe, sometimes including capital punishment.
 Military courts have jurisdiction over most cases that the authorities judge as in-
 volving national security. It includes acts constituting a threat to the nation and its
 political leaders, invasion by foreign forces, and riots that could lead to overthrow
 of the Government. In exceptional cases, civilians may be tried in the military
 courts if charged with breaking military laws. Military courts, like civilian courts,
 provide for an appeal process and are presided over by civilian magistrates.
 In September the Government prosecuted nearly 90 people, arrested in April for
 rebellion and lawlessness in Antsiranana, in civilian court in Antalaha (Antsiranana
 Province). As with similar cases in 1992, the Government tried them under criminal
 as opposed to security or treason statutes. The press complained of lack of access
 and information, but the authorities broadcast the proceedings over loudspeakers
 outside the limited confines of the courtroom (except for testimony involving 16 ac-
 cused minors). Nine court-appointed lawyers defended the accused, and the court ac-
 quitted nearly 50 of the defendants and gave 19 others suspended sentences. The
 court sentenced one minor to 30 months in prison for his part in the killing and
 mutilation of an Active Forces activist. The court sentenced 20 Federalist and Active
 Forces extremists to prison terms ranging from 3 to 15 years. A dozen soldiers
 awaited trial for their role in the Antsiranana lawlessness.
 In the case of the 36 Federalists arrested in June when government security
 forces freed government buildings under Federalist occupation, they were charged
 with incitement to rebellion against the Government, illegal entry into and destruc-
 tion of government and private properties, acts of violence, and illegal possession
 of weapons. They were tried in a civilian court in December in the town of Ihosy
 (Toliara province), and the trial was open to the public. Five lawyers defended the
 accused, and the court gave 1-year suspended sentences to 16 defendants, sentenced
 2 defendants in absentia to 14 months' imprisonment, and acquitted 17. Eighty-
 year-old Monja Jaona, the leader of the Federalists in Toliara, was among those sen-
 tenced; he was promptly amnestied.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 home is inviolable by tradition and law, and the State does not intervene in the pri-
 vate aspects of the lives of the people. The law requires judicially issued warrants
 to search houses, and there are reportedly few abuses. One case involved the arrest
 in June of two minors b a gendarme who was acting on behalf of a private individ-
 ual without a court order. Tis case received extensive publicity, and the minors
 were released.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion, communication, and press and forbids press censorship; these provisions were
 largely respected. People speak freely, and debate in the National Assembly was
 open and lively. The print media openly criticized both the Government and the op-
 position. Opposition groups, trade unions, professional associations, and others have
 regular access to the press.
 There is still a legacy of self-censorship among journalists, most of whom do not
 aggressively investigate stories or cite names, in part because Malagasy culture as-
 ires to be nonconfrontational, and in part because they cannot count on being
 backed effectively by their editors and publishers. Journalists often use pen names
 to avoid identification. They publicized complaints after the Minister of Culture in
 the transitional government warned that it was not their business to investigate the
 extent and nature of property owned by government officials outside of Madagascar.
 State-owned Radio-Television (RTM), the most important means of reaching the
 public, continued to feature discussion programs and debates on political and other
 public policy subjects, and the political content of its newscasts was largely factual.
 National television, however, was exhorted by the Presidency to provide more com-
 plete and eulogistic coverage of President Zafy's public appearances. Television also
 broadcasts French network news live via satellite each evening. All films and video
 tapes shown in public must first be approved by the Interior Ministry, according to
 a law dating from the previous republic.
 Along with state radio, there are now at least five private radio stations. The pri-
 vate stations also cover political subjects and have sometimes been critical of the
 Government. There have been no reports of threats to academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Some legal restrictions remain
 on the right of assembly and association. Municipal permits, usually granted, are
 required before holding public meetings but may be denied if government officials
 believe that the meeting poses a threat to the State or endangers national security.
 Officially established security zones are off limits to demonstrators. The prolifera-
 
 
 tion of political and nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) indicates a more re-
 laxed attitude toward freedom of association. There are more than 60 political par-
 ties and 900 NGO's.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion. The
 Government is secular, and there is no discrimination on the basis of religious affili-
 ation. Between 40 and 50 percent of the population adheres to Christian beliefs,
 with the remainder following traditional Malagasy beliefs, Islam, and other faiths.
 Missionaries and clergy are permitted to operate freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There is no formal restriction on travel within the country; however, do-
 mestic security concerns do effectively restrict travel. All Malagasy must obtain offi-
 cial approval for trips outside the country. All residents of Madagascar (Malagasy
 and foreign) require exit visas issued by the Ministry of Interior. There is no refugee
 population in Madagascar.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Madagascar concluded more than 2 years of political transition, which was initi-
 ated by largely peaceful mass demonstrations against the previous regime of Didier
 Ratsiraka in 1991. In February citizens elected a new President by direct universal
 suffrage and secret ballot, and in March Albert Zafy began a 5-year term; he would
 be elgble to serve a second 5-year term, if reelected. The new President's primary
 constitutional responsibilities are national defense and foreign policy.
 Citizens also voted in June for a 138-member National Assembly, but despite
 strong media and other efforts to inform the public about the election and the com-
 plicated distribution of seats, voter turnout was only about 55 percent, considerably
 down from earlier nationwide ballots (constitutional referendum and presidential
 elections) held in the previous 10 months. The Constitutional High Court, which
 rules on all elections, nullified results for four assembly seats because of procedural
 irregularities and fraud. Special elections filled these four seats in September.
 In its first order of business, the National Assembly elected Francisque Ravony
 Prime Minister, who immediately formed a new Government after consultations
 with President Zafy. The Active Forces constitute a block of about 65 votes in the
 National Assembly. Most of the remaining members of the 138-member body have
 organized an alliance know as the group-of-6 (G-six).
 The Prime Minister and his Cabinet, not the President, executes legislation. The
 President and his Government, provided they act in concert, may dissolve the Na-
 tional Assembly. The National Assembly may pass a motion of censure and req ire
 the Prime Minister and his Government to step down. The Constitutional High
 Court must review the constitutionality of every law before it is promulgated. The
 selection of the Senate must await the formation of local governments in 1994 since
 two-thirds of the Senate will be elected by local legislatures and one-third appointed
 by the President, all for 4-year terms.
 There are no legal restrictions against women participating in politics, but in
 practice men dominate. One cabinet position is held by a woman, and women hold
 only 6 percent of the legislative seats; in the judiciary they have somewhat higher
 representation.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 By law, human rights groups are considered to be political groups and must reg-
 ister with the Government. Nongovernmental human rights groups exist but are
 largely inactive. Although the new Constitution provides for the establishment of an
 independent organization charged with promoting and protecting human rights,
 none has yet been established. The Government did not penalize or repress anyone
 for criticizing its human rights record. It has been slow, however, to carry out inves-
 tigations of salient cases of violence, notably the August 1991 killings at lavoloha
 Palace.
 The Government is receptive to visits by international human rights groups. The
 International Committee of the Red Cross made periodic visits and was regularly
 granted access to prisoners United Nations organizations, including the Inter-
 national Labor Organization (ILO), operated freely and extensively in Madagascar.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits all forms of discrimination and groups that advocate
 ethnic or religious segregation.
 Women.-There is societal discrimination against women, less so in urban areas
 where women have an important, if secondary, role in the business and economic
 
 
 life of the country, with many of them managing or owning business concerns or
 filling management positions in state industries. However, women in rural areas
 face greater hardship, bearing the responsibilities of raising a family while also en-
 gaging in farm labor or other subsistence activities. In education, women's participa-
 tion in secondary and higher studies is lower than that of men. Madagascar has a
 high literacy rate (88 percent for men, 73 percent for women).
 Under the law, wives have an qual say in choosing where a married couple will
 reside, and they receive a more or less equitable distribution of marital property in
 divorce cases. In the case of the death of a husband, a wife inherits one-half of the
 joint marital wealth. A widow receives a pension; however, a widower does not.
 According to various sources, including magistrates, journalists, and women doc-
 tors, violence against women, such as wife beating, is not widespread. In the rare
 cases where physical abuse is detected, police and legal authorities do intervene, al-
 though there is no law dealing specifically with violence against women, except in
 cases of rape. Women have been victims of rape in prisons.
 Children.-There is no pattern of official or societal abuse against children. The
 Government's expenditures on children's welfare, even as a proportion of total budg-
 etary resources available, is low. In a context of extreme poverty, schooling is often
 sacrificed so that children might work in farming chores, hawking newspapers, or
 begging. The U.N. Children's Fund and other children's advocacy groups are active,
 and there are Malagasy associations for the protection of children and youth which
 raise very modest contributions for child welfare projects.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Madagascar is inhabited by over 12 million
 people. The Malagasy are of mixed Malayo-Polynesian and African origins and are
 made up of 18 distinct groups based on regional and ancestral affiliation and some
 linguistic differences. None of these groups constitutes a majority of the population.
 Long-term historical processes of military conquest, ethnic domination, and political
 consolidation, however, have traditionally favored the political and economic status
 of highland ethnic groups of Asian origin over the coastal groups of more African
 descent. The centralized planned economy of the previous regime reinforced the con-
 centration of economic and political power in the highland, capital area. This situa-
 tion has contributed to ethnic tensions between the two groups. Ethnic or regional
 solidarity can also be a determining factor in hiring practices.
 An Indo-Pakistani community o about 20,000, primarily engad in commerce,
 has beenn Madagascar since the early part of this century. Few, however, have
 been able to obtain Malagasy citizenship, since it is customarily bestowed matrilin-
 eally through native Malagasy women. Their shops have often been targets for vio-
 lent attack during civil disturbances. While there were few such incidents in 1993,
 the Indo-Pakistanis remained a frequent target of mistrust and criticism.
 People with Disabilities.-Physically disabled individuals are not subject to dis-
 crimination   iuedtion and in the provision of other state services, but nor are
 they the beneficiaries of special enabling or protecting legislation. The Government
 has not enacted legislation or otherwise provided for accessibility for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right ofAssociation.-The Malagasy in both the public and private sectors
 have the right in law (the 1975 Labor Code and the 1992 Constitution) and in prac-
 tice to establish and join labor uniens of their own choosing without prior authoriza-
 tion. Unions are required to register with the Government, and registration is rou-
 tinely granted. However, the labor force of 4.9 million is mostly agrarian (80 per-
 cent), and unionized labor accounts for only about 5 percent of the total.
 There are a number of trade union federations, and many are affiliated with polit-
 ical parties. In practice, however, formal public and private sector unions have not
 played a major role politically or economically in recent years. The transitional gov-
 erment, in place for most of 1993, exercised very limited control over organized
 labor.
 The Labor Code and the new Constitution provide for the right to strike, even in
 export processing ("free trade ) zones. Those providing essential services-police,
 firefighters, hospital workers-have only a limited right to strike. There were occa-
 sional strikes in 1993, but none was officially declared illegal, and most were re-
 solved by negotiations foby informal arbitration by high government officials, in-
 cluding the President. Laws and regulations prohibit retribution against strikers
 who a  ere to legal procedures for striking. Unions and workers were not directly
 targeted for human rights abuses, nor was there any apparent retribution against
 strikers and leaders.
 Unions may and do freely affiliate with and participate in international bodies
 and may form federations or confederations.
 
 
 164
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Both the 1975 Labor Code
 and the 1992 Constitution provide for the right to bargain collectively. The Code
 states that collective bargaining may be undertaken between management and labor
 at either party's behest. Collective bargaining agreements exist but are not common,
 and the Government is often involved in the bargaining process in part because of
 the large number of public sector employees in organized abor. The minimum wage
 is set by the Government. Other wages are set by the employers with individual em-
 ployees, sometimes below the minimum wage. When there is a failure to reach
 arment, the Ministry of Labor convenes a committee of employment inspectors
 who attempt to resolve the matter. If this process fails, the committee refers the
 matter to the chairman of the Court of Appeals for final arbitration. No such cases
 reached the Appeals Court in 1993.
 The Labor Code formally prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers against
 union members and organizers. In the case of antiunion activity, the union or its
 members may file a petition in civil court challenging the employer.
 Labor laws are applied u.1iformly throughout the country, including in free trade
 zones. Labor inspectors visit industrial work sites with some regularity but mostly
 in the capital region.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is explicitly prohib-
 ited by the Labor Code and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code describes a child
 as any person under the age of 18. The legal minimum age for employment is 14
 and the use of child labor is prohibited in those areas where there is apparent and
 imminent danger. The Government tries to enforce these child labor laws in the
 small wage sector through inspectors from the Ministries of Civil Service, and Labor
 and Social Security. However, in the large subsistence sector, many young children
 work with their parents on family farms at much earlier ages. Similarly, in the
 urban areas many children earn money hawking parking spaces, newspapers or
 other wares, and by carrying water and begging.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code and its enforcing legislation
 re'be the workin conditions and wage scales for employees which are enforced
 the Ministryof Labor and Social Security. The law distinguishes between agricul-
 tural and nonagricultural work. There is a 44-hour workweek in nonagricultural
 and service industries. There are also provisions for holiday pay, sick and maternity
 leave, and insurance.
 There are several administratively determined minimum-wage rates in Madagas-
 car, depending upon employment skills, starting with $23 a month (45,000 Mala-
 gasy francs) for unskilled workers. This wage is inadequate to ensure a decent
 standard of living, and such workers must supplement their incomes through sub-
 sistence agriculture, petty trade, or reliance on the extended family structure. Given
 insufficient enforcement measures, official wage rates are sometimes ignored as
 high unemployment and extreme poverty lead workers to accept salaries below the
 legl wage.
 Tfhe Labor Code has rules concerning building and operational safety, machinery
 and moving engines, lifting weight limits, and sanitation standards. Ministry of
 Labor and Social Security inspectors visit industrial work sites, and violations of
 Labor Code rules are subject to inspection reports. Lack of resources effectively in-
 hibit inspectors traveling regularly beyond the capital region. If cited violations are
 not remedied within the specified time frame, the violators may be legally charged
 and subject to penalties. Nevertheless, in some sectors protective measures are lack-
 ing due to the expense of even minimal protective clothing and other protective de-
 vices. To date, there have been no published reports on occupational health hazards
 and accidents, although there is clear evidence that these hazards exist. There is
 no explicit right allowing workers to remove themselves from dangerous work with-
 outJeopardizing their continued employment.
 The ILO has cited the Government within the past year for failure to observe ILO
 conventions and standards in workplace safety.
