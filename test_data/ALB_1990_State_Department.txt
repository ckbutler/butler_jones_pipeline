 ALBANIA*
 Albania, which-proclaims itself a People's Socialist Republic,
 is ruled by a Marxist-Leninist dictatorship. President Ramiz
 Alia, head of the Communist parfy known as the Albanian Party
 of Labor (APL) since 1985, is the focus of political power and
 authority. In 1990 the APL launched a program of self-
 described democratization which included limits on the terms
 of office of high government and economic officials, measures
 to decentralize the economy, and provisions to reform the
 penal code and amend the electoral law. In December the
 leadership announced that the formation of independent
 political organizations would be permitted and allowed one,
 the Albanian Demodratic Party (DP), to register officially.
 The DV was also allowed to publish its own newspaper.
 A large, effective security service, the Sigurimi, helps
 maintain the APL in power through repressive controls which
 severely limit the Albanian people's basic human rights and
 fundamental freedoms. The excesses of the Sigurimi were
 highlighted by Ismail Kadare, the prominent-author, in his
 written discussion of the novel "The Knives."
 In 1990, in order to counter the declining growth rate, the
 Government moved to decentralize the economy. Small-scale
 private enterprise began to be encouraged, some agricultural
 workers were given larger plots of land for individual
 farming, and enterprises gained the power to set their own
 wage levels and bonuses for workers who exceed production
 targets.
 In the human rights area, the Government took some steps away
 from the repressive pratices of the past. It eased its
 persecution of religious activity and decriminalized
 "religious propaganda," allowing some religious services to be
 held without official interference. The judiciary is not
 independent, and there is no recourse for abuses committed by
 the Government. Amendments to the penal code adopted in 1990
 include the right to eounsel, the right of appeal, and the.
 right to- a speedy triaI-  The death penalty was abolished for
 23 crimes (it remains in effect fQr Ii others, including
 embezzlement of Socialist property) and banned in the case of
 women. The Ministry of Justice, abolished in 1967, was
 reestablished in 1990 to put in place a new court system as
 part of a judiciaI reform program. Restrictions on travel
 abroad were liberalized, and thousands of passports-were
 approved, although passports reportedly were still denied in a
 number of instances. No foreign broadcasts, including those
 .of the Voice of America, were jammed.. The legislature
 appointed a commission to revise the 1976 Constitution. There
 are no provisions to safeguard freedom of speech, press,
 assembly, and association. In 1989 the United Nations Human
 Rights Commission publicly censured Albania for its human
 rights record and for its failure to cooperate with the
 Commission. The United Nations Secretary General visited
 Albania in 1990 to discuss a number of issues, including human
 rights.
 * Because the United States has not had diplomatic relations
 with Albania since 1939, it is-difficult to comment
 authoritatively on conditions in Albania.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 No evidence came to light of political killings by the
 authorities during 1990. However, in demonstrations to
 protest general living conditions that took place in Tirana in
 late June and again on July 2, security forces used force,
 including gunfire, to suppress the demonstration and disperse
 the crowds. The exact number of injuries and deaths is
 unknown, but some foreign diplomats and Albanian citizens
 estimated that there were between 30 and 50 deaths among
 demonstrators; Greek sources estimated 400 deaths. Thousands
 of demonstrators took refuge in European embassies.
 Until late in the year, border guards continued to use deadly
 force to stop Albanian citizens from trying to flee the
 country and reportedly killed a number of them during 1990
 (see Section 2.d.).
 b. Disappearance
 There is no recent information available on whether
 disappearances occur.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The criminal code prohibits the use of physical or
 psychological force during investigations and provides
 penalties for those found guilty of such use. Nevertheless,
 former political prisoners often have reported that they were
 tortured, beaten, or otherwise ill-treated during investigative
 proceedings to force them to make confessions. Albanian
 investigators have allegedly resorted to threats and beatings
 to obtain confessions or collaboration. In the absence of
 independent means of investigation, it is difficult to
 corroborate such reports. U.S. Senator DeConcini was refused
 permission to visit a jail during a trip to Albania in 1990.
 In the past, private international humanitarian organizations
 have reported harsh prison conditions in Albania, including a
 severe hard-labor regime with inadequate food and clothing,
 long-term solitary confinement, cramped cells without room to
 lie down, and unheated, unfurnished cells lacking any sanitary
 facilities. The Burrel prison and Spac, Ballsh, and Qafe e
 Barit labor camps, in particular, have been noted for their
 harsh conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution provides that no one may be arrested without
 court or prosecutorial approval or be sentenced to jail
 without a court verdict or for an act that is not a crime.
 The penal code, however, is explicitly ideological and
 officially characterized as a "weapon in the class struggle."
 Its provisions defining political offenses are loosely
 formulated, allowing the courts to.interpret them broadly to
 punish whomever the regime desires.
 According to Amnesty International (AI), political detainees
 lacked adequate legal safeguards during pretrial
 
 
 1083
 ALBANIA
 investigations. By law, investigations into crimes against
 the State must be-completed within 3 months, but extensions
 are easily-obtained, andzno effective maximum period of
 investigation is enforced Most investigations into political
 offenses are completed.within 4 months, but AI has charged
 that some investigationshave dragged-on for more than a
 year. Political.detainees have been held in solitary
 confinement for up to 6-months during pretrial investigations
 .without access to lawyers or relatives.
 The penalcode.provides that-accused persons must be informed
 when investigation of their cases is concluded and be allowed
 to examine all.the evidence to-be brought against them.
 Usually., however, the accused is not allowed to examine all
 the materials and is shown onlyza copy of the indictment.
 Investigators are-:theoretically bound by procedural rules, and
 the accused may appeal an investigation's finding if
 investigators violate proper procedures, but these controls do
 not appear to be effective.
 In May-the-legislature voted to amend the penal code to
 provide for the right-to a legal defense, the right to- appeal
 a case, and. the right to a speedy trial, The new provisions
 - for a legal defense and the right of appeal have been
 t:implemented to a degree, according to Western observers.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judicial system includes the Supreme Court and regional
 and district courts. Like- all organs of the State, the-
 judicial system is totally controlled by-the APL. In. 190z the
 Ministry of Justice, which had been abolished in 1967, was
 reestablished with the mandate reportedly to supervise the
 courts and a program of judicial reform.
 AI reported that persons accused of political crimes lack
 adequate legal safeguards during their trials. Until May,
 when the penal code- was amended, defendants at political
 trials usually were denied defense counsel and had to conduct
 their own defense. Major trials of state officials have been
 closed when it suited the purposes of the regime, but most
 political trials of ordinary citizens have been held in open
 court. There-have been no known acquittals in political
 trials.
 Leaving Albania illegally is no longer considered treason and
 punishable by death but, according to Article 127 of the Penal
 Code (as revised in-199Q), is punished wit. "reeducation
 through work or loss of freedom of up to 5- years-"
 The penal code provides that banishment (generally to a state
 farm or enterprise) or internment may be imposed
 administratively, without trial; for up to 5 years on persons
 whom the authorities consider a threat to the Communist system
 and on the families of fugitives. A 1988 decree also provides
 for "internment and exile-as administrative measures."
 The number of political prisoners is unknown. They are
 -believed to include 300 members of the pre-World War II elite,
 as well as those condemned for pro-Soviet, pro-Chinese, and
 other unacceptable views. Many persons are serving sentences
 for expressing dissatisfaction with conditions in Albania or
 for trying to flee the country. Former political prisoners
 reported that the Ballsh and Spac labor camps during the early
 1980's held about 1,200 political prisoners each. Some 300
 
 
 1084
 ALBANIA
 more were imprisoned at Burrel, and others were held in
 Tarovic, Kosovo, and Tirana prisons.
 In a February 21 interview with the official Albanian party
 paper Zeri i Popullit, Minister of Internal Affairs Simon
 Stefani, who was later dismissed, claimed there were 3,850
 prisoners, criminal and political, in "penal settlements and
 reeducation stations." Stefani further claimed that of this
 total those convicted for activity to overthrow the regime
 through violence totaled 83 people. A refugee leaving Albania
 in 1990 after spending 23 years in Albanian prisons estimated
 the number of political prisoners held in Albanian jails at
 900 to 950.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution proclaims the inviolability of the home and
 the privacy of correspondence, but at the same time it
 provides that these and other civil rights are subordinate to
 the general interest and may not be exercised in opposition to
 the Socialist order. The authorities can, and do, violate the
 privacy of the home to achieve their ends. The Government
 also uses its pervasive informer network fully to police the
 lives of Albanians.
 Contact with the outside world is carefully monitored.
 Albanian citizens are required to report to the police any
 contact with foreigners, but many welcome casual contact with
 foreign tourists. In 1990 direct telephone communications
 with the United States were opened. After 1986 it became
 significantly easier for Albanian citizens to receive letters
 and packages from relatives abroad. Although the Government
 does not jam foreign broadcasts, it remains illegal to receive
 radio and television broadcasts from abroad.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution states that citizens enjoy these freedoms but
 may not exercise them in opposition to the Socialist order.
 Any citizen who publicly criticizes the Government is subject
 to swift and severe reprisals under an article of the
 Constitution which forbids antistate agitation and propaganda.
 All news media are government controlled and never criticize
 the State and party leadership or their policies. However,
 there are indications that media criticism of some aspects of
 Albanian society, such as the pervasive problem of corruption,
 has increased. In December the Government announced that
 newly registered political parties would be able to publish
 their own newspapers, and one began publishing in January
 1991. Art and literature are also subject to state control
 and censorship. There is no academic freedom, and the
 authorities manipulate scholarly inquiry and publications for
 political purposes.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The security police deal severely with unauthorized group
 activities or those that appear to'be in opposition to the
 leadership. A few independent associations or groups began to
 organize in December. It is not clear how much autonomy the
 Government intends to grant to newly formed political parties
 
 
 1085
 
 ALBANIA
 and to religious groups.  On July 31, a legislative decree
 established the freedom to assemble but with strict limits on
 meetings and sanctions against violators.
 On December 9, students in Tirana demonstrated ostensibly
 against electricity shortages but also demanded political
 liberalization. The Government responded by agreeing to the
 formation of independent political organizations, and one- new
 party, the Albanian Democratic Party, composed of intellectuals
 and students, was founded and legally registered.
 In other areas of the country, the Government reacted harshly
 against other demonstrators. Reports indicated that in
 Kavalje, Elbasan, and other cities the army was used to stop
 demonstrations. Some demonstrations included attacks on
 public buildings, the looting of stores, and the burning of
 police cars and other vehicles. Others were reportedly
 peaceful. Although reportedly there were no casualties
 connected with these events, official sources stated that 157
 demonstrators were arrested. A number of them were convicted,
 and some received sentences of. more than 10 years'
 imprisonment. Leaders of the new opposition forces have
 accused police of torturing those arrested; defense lawyers
 deny these charges.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Public religious activity in Albania is expressly prohibited
 by the Constitution and by government policy. One Roman
 Catholic priest in Shkoder, however, celebrated a series of
 masses and stated that the Catholic Church would seek the
 return of its confiscated property. Historically, about 70
 percent of all Albanians were Muslim, nearly 20 percent were
 Orthodox, and a little more than 10 percent were Roman
 Catholic. Estimates of the number of Jews in Albania range
 from 500 to 2,500. In the second -half of the year, there were
 several reliable reports of religious services being held
 without official interference.
 In 1967 the Government proclaimed Albania the 'first atheist
 state in the world, abrogated all laws dealing with church-
 state relations, and began actively to eradicate all vestiges
 of religion. More than 2,100 mosques, churches, monasteries,
 and other institutions were closed, their fixed assets were
 seized without compensation, and many religious leaders were
 persecuted, imprisoned, or even executed. All religious
 literature was banned, as were any personal manifestations of
 religious belief or practice. In 1975 a Iegislative decree
 stipulated that names for newborns were to be chosen from a
 list of names without religious overtones. At the same time,
 a number of geographical names with religious significance
 were changed. While a few outstanding historic churches and
 their religious art are being restored as museums, most
 churches and mosques have been converted to other uses.
 In May the People's Assembly (legislature), declaring that the
 State is separated from religion and the question of religious
 belief is a matter of conscience for every individual, amended
 the ban on religious practice. The law permits Albanians to
 practice their religion individually but leaves in place a ban
 on collective worship, legalizing what had become the practice
 in recent times. Most Mosques and churches remain closed,
 although a few are reportedly being used by. congregations
 without official approval. Despite years of antireligious
 pressure, some Albanians continued to practice their faith in
 
 
 1086
 ALBANIA
 their homes, particularly in villages and in more remote
 areas. The United Nations in 1989 criticized the lack of
 religious freedom in Albania.
 In 1989 several Roman Catholic priests were reportedly
 released from prison. There are currently no Roman Catholic
 priests in prison. Priests are instead confined to their
 villages and kept under surveillance.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution does not guarantee freedom of movement. As
 part of the reforms passed by the People's Assembly on May 8,
 Albanians obtained the right to acquire passports for foreign
 travel. Thousands of Albanians took advantage of this right
 and applied for passports; while many were able to travel,
 there continued to be reports that passports were denied to
 some applicants.
 Some Albanian citizens attempting to flee the country without
 passports were shot by border guards. In one incident, a
 6-year-old girl was killed near Lake Shkoder when fleeing with
 a group of 29 persons. In another, two ethnic Greek Albanians
 were reportedly killed while trying to cross into Greece. The
 number of refugees crossing the borders increased
 significantly during 1990. Some 4,700 Albanians who took
 refuge in European embassies during and after the July
 demonstrations were allowed to leave Albania for central and
 Western Europe.
 During his May visit, U.N. Secretary General Perez de Cuellar
 raise withr Albanian officials the case of the 6-member Popa
 family who had sought political asylum in the Italian Embassy
 in 1985 and had remained there for over 4 years. The Albanian
 authorities finally permitted their emigration to Italy.
 The May 8 law stipulated that defection by an Albanian "should
 be considered not as a betrayal of the homeland but as an
 illegal border tresspassing." Illegal border crossing is
 punished "with reeducation through work or loss of freedom for
 up to 5 years," according to Article 127 of the Penal Code as
 revised.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 No such right existed in 1990. The system of government is a
 Communist dictatorship, headed by Ramiz Alia in his capacity
 as First Secretary of the APL and Chairman of the Presidium of
 the People's Assembly. The Constitution establishes the APL
 as the sole political entity and Marxism-Leninism as the only
 political ideology. The APL is governed internally by the
 principle of "democratic centralism," under which
 decisionmaking power is concentrated in the hands of a small
 elite.
 In a sign of potential political change, the People's Assembly
 on November 15 approved a new electoral law that calls for
 multicandidate elections and provides that any party or social
 organization, legally registered association, or individual
 may propose a candidate. In December the Government announced
 that independent political parties could be established and
 could present candidates for the legislative elections which
 were scheduled for March 31, 1991. Following this
 
 
 1087
 
 ALBANIA
 announcement, the Albanian Democratic Party was the first
 independent party to register with the Ministry of Justice.
 Earlier in 1990, the Government had approved a law to limit
 the terms of office of high-ranking officials (up to deputy
 minister) to 5 years. Those affected include government
 officials and top plant management in industry, agriculture,
 and construction. If their work is approved by the "masses,"
 they may be reelected to a nonconsecutive 5-year term.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government denies violating human rights and refuses to
 cooperate with any investigation of allegations to the
 contrary, including investigations by the United Nations-Human
 Rights Commission, although it invited the U.N. Secretary
 General and U.S. Congressmen from the Helsinki Commission to
 visit Albania. During their visits, they met with government
 leaders. The Government does not reconize the one domestic
 human rights group formed in December.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language or Social Status
 Greeks are the largest ethnic community, but smaller numbers
 of Serbs, Macedonians, Vlachs, Gypsies, and Jews also live in
 Albania. Estimates of the size of the Greek population vary
 from 59,000 (from an official Albanian census) to as high as
 400,000 (from groups promoting the interests of ethnic Greeks
 in Albania.)
 The Constitution grants national minorities "guaranteed
 protection and development of their culture and popular
 traditions, the use of their mother tongue, and its teaching
 in the schools, and equal development in all fields of social
 life." .There are-restrictions onthe extent to which
 minorities may exercise their cultural, educational, and
 linguistic rights. While Greeks and Macedonians may be
 educated in their mother tongues through the primary level,
 there are no official radi- or television programs in these
 languages. A Greek-language newspaper, Laiko Vima, is
 published in the southern town of Argyrokastro. Cross-border
 ties between Albania and Greece increased significantly after
 the 1987 visit to Albania of the Greek Foreign Minister, and
 relatives and friends of the Greek minority in Albania are
 being permitted to send remittances to Albania.
 Several reports indicate persecution, harassment, and
 discrimination against minorities solely because of their
 ethnic status.
 Scholars of the Albanian language have noted that northern
 Albanians, who historically spoke the Gheg dialect of their
 language, have been educationally disadvantaged by the
 adoption of "unified literary Albanian," basically a version
 of the Tosk dialect, spoken in southern Albania. Most,
 although not all, members of the leadership of the APL are
 Tosk speakers and of Muslim background.
 The Constitution states that women shall enjoy equal rights
 with men in work, pay, holidays, social security, education,
 sociopolitical activity, as well as in the family.
 Information on the extent to which these- rights are exercised
 
 
 1088
 ALBANIA
 is not available. Women participate equally in obligatory
 labor and military service programs. No information is
 available on the extent to which violence against women is
 practiced or what, if anything, the regime has done on the
 issue.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.
 Workers do not have the right to associate freely. Nearly all
 Albanians belong to trade unions that are part of the United
 Trade Unions of Albania (UTUA), an arm of the APL. These
 unions have no significant independent voice in the field of
 labor relations, but they play a key role in indoctrinating
 and propagandizing the workers, in maintaining labor
 discipline, and in organizing the periods of so-called
 voluntary manual labor in which all Albanians are expected to
 take part. A seat is reserved for the UTUA as an affiliate of
 the Communist-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions, but
 the Albanians have not participated in this organization since
 the mid-1960's. Albania withdrew from the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) in 1967.
 Despite the lack of a right to strike, a brief strike
 reportedly occurred in Berat in the spring of 1990, when,
 according to press reports, about 2,000 textile workers
 protested against low wages.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers do not have the right to organize freely and to
 bargain collectively. There are no special economic zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Little information on forced labor is available. In 1971 the
 ILO Committee of Experts, which still considers Albania bound
 by those ILO Conventions it had ratified before its
 withdrawal, noted that provisions of the Labor Code of 1966
 restricted workers' ability to choose and terminate
 employment. It is believed that one form of punishment is
 internal banishment to a labor camp. The prisoners do not
 have a choice of work but are paid for their labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 According to the Labor Code of 1980, amended in 1981, the
 minimum age for employment of children is 15. Those under 16
 years of age may not work more than 6 hours per day.
 Information on enforcement of this law is unavailable.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 According to the Labor Code, the workweek is 48 hours.
 Pregnant women, children under 16 years of age, and persons
 with a doctor's certificate may not work between 10 p.m. and 6
 a.m. Women, young persons under 18 years of age, and those
 with a doctor's certificate are prohibited from working
 underground. Rorkers in arduous and dangerous jobs are
 provided appropriate protective clothing and special food
 rations. The Labor Code contains regulations pertaining to
 occupational health and safety, but there is no available
 information on the effectiveness of enforcement. Minimum wage
 information is not available.
