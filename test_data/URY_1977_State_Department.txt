 URUGUAY
 
 Uruguay's long tradition of democracy and respect for
 human rights has been severely battered in recent years.
 An urban guerrilla group, the Tupamaros, began the cycle
 of violence with a brutal campaign of urban terrorism,
 marked by assassinations, kidnappings and other violent
 acts. The Tupamaros aimed for an extreme left revolution
 that would overthrow the democratic system, but instead
 provoked harsh repression'and the eventual military
 takeover.
 The military, which took over the counter-guerrilla campaign
 from the police in 1972,had largely eliminated terrorism
 as a significant force by 1974-75. Nonetheless over
 time the military dismantled the democratic system, closinq
 Congress, ousting the elected president, severely restricting
 press and political liberties, and setting up an authoritarian
 reqime.
 The Tupamaros- have been-d-scredited -and -broken--up- but -
 repression continues. The Government consistently
 denies that torture and other inhumane-methods.are
 condoned by official policy.-- But -t the-same timethe
 Uruguayan authorities at least implicitly excuse these
 measures on the grounds that combating subversion requires
 extraordinary methods.
 The fact that terrorism and harsh government repression
 are aberrations in Uruguayan history argues for an
 eventual return to respect for human rights and democracy.
 The military-civil regime has announced an intention to
 move toward carefully controlled elections in 1981.
 There have been hints of change in respect of the regime's
 repressive practices,-but little real improvement.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture was used extensively in the anti-Tupamaro terrorist
 campaign. The use of torture has declined significantly
 since the early 1970s but there are reports, some clearly
 reliable, that torture is still used, particularly in the
 early stages of detention. Amnesty International, among
 others, charges that torture continues to be extensive
 and to affect individuals from all walks of life, but
 there is no way of confirming the extent of the practice.

 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Psychological abuses of detainees during the initial
 interrogations appear routine. Prisoners are often
 isolated, hooded, threatened, and made physically
 uncomfortable. Once this stage is passed and the
 detainee is brought before a military judge for
 disposition of his case, conditions usually improve
 markedly. In general, prison conditions are judged to
 be satisfactory, and are better for political detainees
 than for common criminals.. Prisoners do not appear to
 be mistreated by guards. There have been infrequent
 but credible reports of extra-legal summary execu-
 tions ("disappearances*).
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The legal, bases for arrest established by the National
 Security Law of 1972 and the Emergency Security Measures
 of 1973 as further amplified in 1975, suspend guarantees
 agairfst, arbitrary arrest and imprisonment.
 The-Government:'of-Uruguay officially lists-2;366 national
 security prisoners as of October 1977, a significant
 figure in this small country (slightly over 3,000,000
 population). Amnesty International has repeatedly
 estimated as many as 5,000 political prisoners in
 Uruguay- but there is no way to confirm these figures.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Political offenses are tried in military courts under
 military law. The Uruguayan court system under both the
 Ordinary Penal Code (OPC) and the Military Penal Code
 (MPC) relies on written proceedings in pre-trial
 investigation, arraignment, trial, and sentencing stages
 of the judicial process. Terrorism, subversion and other
 *crimes against the nation" are subject to the MPC.
 Confessional evidence has been 'the basis for almost all
 convictions for national security offenses. It is not
 unusual for a judge, who rules on the basis of written
 briefs, civil or military, never to confront the
 accused face-to-face. The evidence, arguments and
 records of such proceedings under OPC and MPC are not
 open to the public or press, though the MPC appeals
 process provides for a public hearing.
 Attorneys have less opportunity to make an effective
 defense under the MPC than under the OPC. According to
 the Emergency Security Measures, a person accused of
 subversive activities should go before a military judge
 
 
 214
 within ten days (24 hours for a person under the OPC).
 There are lengthy delays both in informing the accused
 of the precise charges and before judicial proceedings
 are started (as opposed to the 48 hour limit under
 the OPC). Under the MPC attorneys are not permitted
 access to their clients during the pre-trial investiga-
 tion. Once the accused is turned over to a military
 judge for possible-arraignment, lawyers are permitted
 access to their clients but only in the presence of
 the authorities (lawyers see clients in private
 under the OPC).
 When a person held on national security grounds
 completes his sentence, the authorities sometimes
 continue to detain the individual.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Uruguayan Government practice under the current Emergency.
 Security Measure& retricts-guarantees-with. respect to
 inviolability of the home of persons who they say are
 suspected of terrorism- subversion or other crimes against
 the nation. Wholesale raids, as in the Tupamaro period,
 and subsequent round-ups of Communists, have subsided.
 Currently, invasions of homes by security forces are
 infrequent and reportedly do not involve looting or
 other abuses.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 Per capita income for this generally middle-class country
 is about $1,300, high for the region. Despite inflation,
 occasional shortages and a continuing reduction of real
 income, the overwhelming majority of the population is
 adequately fed. There are various Government-sponsored
 community feeding programs for the poor. Housing is
 not a major development priority since for years the
 Government has allotted substantial resources for
 subsidized housinq to middle and lower classes.
 Health care, as a result of many years of heavy public
 investment, is extensive and accessible to the entire
 population, is free to the poor (nominal costs for
 others) and is adequate. Likewise, public educational
 opportunities are accessible to the entire population.
 In recent years development priorities have focused
 on the productive sectors, agriculture and industry,
 which were neglected in the past.
 
 
 215
 Uruguay's recent fiscal improvements have been accom-
 plished at a social cost which has fallen heavily on
 lower income qroups, but income distribution remains
 among the most equitable in the hemisphere.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Freedom of the press is severely restricted. Direct
 public criticism of the Uruguayan Government is subdued
 and infrequent. Attacks against the armed forces are not
 tolerated. The media operates under a system of self-
 censorship with guidelines established by the authorities.
 The Emergency Security Measures have been used to pro-
 hibit the dissemination of other than official news
 releases or commentary on "subversives" and Government
 operations -gainst-them. -
 The non-Marxist press, continues to publish. It has
 been affected by recent governmentactions. During
 1977 the monthly Busqueda was suspended for two
 issues-and the daily newspaper El Dia for ten days
 for separate published items judged critical of
 Uruguayan authorities or actions. Additional measures
 were taken against El Dia, including the temporary
 expulsion of its edlt~or-nd suspension of its import duty
 exemptions for thirty days. Journalists are frequently
 questioned and warned about stories they-have written,
 and newspaper directors detained as a show of
 displeasure.
 The Government generally respects the constitutional
 guarantees relating to freedom ot religion. There have
 been conflicts between the Government and some groups
 affiliated with religious organizations, including
 liberal Catholic groups.
 Freedom of assembly is severely restricted. Political
 meetings cannot be held and meetings and elections of
 officers of all clubs and associations are strictly
 controlled. Such meetings must be approved well in
 advance by security authorities who pass judgement
 on the agendas and lists of participants. Non-Communist
 unions continue to function within restrictions imposed
 by the Government, such as the need to obtain prior
 approval for meetings, agendas, elections and organizing
 
 
 activities. The use of right to strike, recognized by
 the Government, is discouraged in practice.
 Institutional Act No. 7 provided the Government
 with a powerful tool to control the activities of
 government employees, previously guaranteed virtually
 lifetime job security, by providing means for their
 summary termination. Estimates of the number of
 employees terminated under the provisions of the Act
 since enactment in July. 1977 vary widely.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,- Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no general restrictions with respect to
 freedom of movement within Uruguay, foreign travel and
 emigration. The Government has, however, in most cases,
 denied persons detained for political offenses the
 exercise of the constitutional right to leave the country
 instead-of serving their sentences. The Government argues-
 that many such persons who were permitted to leave the
 country returned clandestinely and renewed th-eir-activ--
 ties, or were active in overseas campaigns.against the
 Government. Foreign travel and emigration may be denied
 to persons suspected of past or present "undesirable
 association."
 c.. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Freedom to participate in the political process does
 not now exist. In the meantime, Institutional Act
 No. 4 has deprived thousands of persons, including
 most acknowledged leaders of the traditional
 political parties, of their political rights for up
 to 15 years. While their headquarters remain open
 and the political parties retain "elected officers,
 they are not permitted to function effectively.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Interna-
 tional and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 In the past the Uruguayan Government accepted outside, inde-
 pendent investigations of alleged human rights violations.
 Amnesty International together with the International
 Commission of Jurists conducted an on-site investigation
 
 
 217
 in 1974. Prior to that date, the International Red
 Cross was permitted to visit prisoners. The International
 Labor Organization (ILO) conducted two inquiries into
 the labor situation, the latest in 1977.
 The Government of Uruguay has taken a hostile attitude to
 proposals for outside impartial inquiries. In the past,
 Uruguay denounced the OAS's Inter-American Human Rights
 Commission, whose competence and responsibility in such
 matters is fully established in international law through
 the instruments of the Inter-American System. This rigid
 attitude may now be under review by the Uruguayan Govern-
 ment.
