 ETHIOPIA
 Ethiopia continued its transition from a unitary to a federal system of govern-
 ment. Prime Minister Meles Zenawi leads the Government of the Federal Demo-
 cratic Republic of Ethiopia, which was elected in 1995 to replace a transitional gov-
 ernment that was established following a long and brutal civil war. Most opposition
 groups boycotted the elections, and candidates affiliated with the dominant party
 within the transitional government, the Ethiopian Peoples' Revolutionary Demo-
 cratic Front (EPRDF) won a landslide victory in national and regional contests. The
 EPRDF is in turn dominated by the Tigray Peoples' Liberation Front (TPLF). The
 judiciary is weak and overburdened, but showed increased signs of independence.
 New federal regions, organized along ethnic lines, are increasingly autonomous,
 with greater local control over both fiscal and political issues. A history of highly
 centralized authority, great poverty, the recent civil conflict, and unfamiliarity with
 democratic culture all combine to complicate the implementation of federalism. The
 federal Government can not yet protect constitutional rights at the regional level,
 especially when local authorities are unwilling or unable to do so. Local administra-
 tive, police, and judicial systems remain weak in many regions.
 Responsibility for internal security continued to shift from the military forces to
 the police in most regions. Throughout the year, military forces conducted low level
 operations against the Oremo Liberation Front (OLF) in parts of the Oremo regional
 state. The national police organization is subordinate to the Ministry of Justice.
 Some local officials and members of the security forces committed human rights
 abuses.
 The economy is based on smallholder agriculture, with more than 85 percent of
 the population living in rural areas under very poor conditions. Per capita gross na-
 tional preduct is estimated at $120 per year. Real economic growth in 1996 was 7
 percent. Coffee accounts for about 60 percent of exprt revenues. The Government
 continued to implement an internationally supported economic reform  pregram de-
 signed to liberalize the economy and bring state expenditures into balance with rev-
 enues.
 The Government took a number of steps to impreve its human rights practices,
 but serious preblems remain. Security forces sometimes beat or mistreated detain-
 ees, and arbitrarily arrested and detained citizens. Prolonged pretrial detention is
 a problem. The  uciary lacks sufficient staff and funds, and consequently most citi-
 zens are denied the full pretections previded for in the Constitution. The Govern-
 ment restricts freedom of the press and detained or imprisoned 14 journalists. At
 years end, most were accused or convicted of inciting ethnic hatred or publishing
 false information in violation of the 1992 Press Law. The Government limits free-
 dom of association and refused to register several nongovernmental organizations
 (NGO's), but otherwise did not prevent them from operating. Societal discrimination
 and violence against women and abuse of children remain problems; female genital
 mutilation is nearly universal. Societal discrimination against disabled persons is a
 problem.
 The Government intensified measures to create a national, apolitical army by re-
 placing thousands of demobilized Tigrayan soldiers with recruits from other ethnic
 groups. It implemented a training program in military justice and undertook pro-
 grams to enhance the professional capacity and improve the performance of military
 personnel. It sought to strengthen the judiciary; additional civil and criminal judges
 were trained and assigned to regional courts, while efforts to eliminate judicial mal-
 feasance resulted in the dismissal of many others. The Government sought to en-
 hance transparency and accountability by publishing in state media several detailed
 reports of officials who were jailed or dismissed for abuse of authority, corruption,
 and violations of human rights. Governmental transparency, however, remains a
 problem. In October the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense was dis-
 missed from all official posts for corruption.
 
 
 The trial of the first group of defendants accused of war crimes under the brutal
 Marxist regime of Colonel Menitu Haile Mariam (1974-1991), which began in De-
 cember 1994, continued through the year. In December approximately 1,200 addi-
 tional detainees were charged with war crimes.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Idling.-There were no confirmed reports of
 extrajudicial killings by government security forces. However, unconfirmed reports
 alleged that the Government was responsible for extrajudicial killings in parts of
 Oromiya regional state related to actions directed against the OLF.
 In September a court convicted in absentia and sentenced to death three Egyptian
 Islamic militants for the attempted assassination of Egyptian President Hosni Mu-
 barak in June 1995. Mubarak was unhurt, but two policemen were killed.
 The Islamic extremist group AlIttihad AlIslami claimed responsibility for three
 hotel bombings in which several people were killed, as well as for an attempt on
 the life of Minister of Transport and Communications Abdulmejid Hussein. The
 Minister was wounded and two bodyguards were killed. In November the Ar'ittihad
 terrorist cells believed responsible for these actions were uncovered. The trial of
 those arrested continued at year's end.
 The execution style killing in October of two foreigners in separate incidents in
 Dire Dawa is still under investigation. Banditry remained a serious problem in some
 parts of the country. Bandits, often heavily armed, killed civilians, police, and ol-
 diers during robbery attempts. While government critics frequently ascribe political
 motives to bandit activity, most evidence suggests that these activities are primarily
 economically motivated.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no confirmed reports, but numerous unconfirmed
 reports, of alleged disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits the use of torture and mistreatment of prisoners. Never-
 theless, there were numerous credible reports that security officials sometimes beat
 or mistreated detainees. Government media published occasional reports of officials
 who were jailed or dismissed for abuse of authority and violations of human rights.
 Prison conditions are not generally life threatening and meet minimal inter-
 national standards. Overcrowding, however, remains a serious problem. Prisoners
 are often allocated less than 2 square meters of sleeping space in a room that may
 contain up to 200 people. Prison food is adequate. Prisoners are typically permitted
 daily access to prison yards. Visitors are permitted, and many prisoners receive reg-
 ular deliveries of food and other supplies from family members. Female prisoners
 are housed separately from men, and rape does not appear to be a problem.
 There were credible reports that the army sometimes used military camps for the
 temporary detention and interrogation of OLF fighters and alleged supporters.
 The Government permits independent monitoring of prison conditions, military
 camps, and police stations by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
 and often by diplomatic missions. However, the ICRC does not have immediate ac-
 cess to government facilities and must either request permission or notify the gov-
 ernment each time it wants to visit. Granting prison access is now the responsibility
 of regional governments. In most regions, permission to visit detention facilities is
 routinely granted.
 There were several diplomatic visits to prominent detainees accused of war crimes
 who were held by the Special Prosecutor's Office (SPO), including Abera Yemane-
 ab, Mamo Wolde, and Mekonnen Dori, who bore no signs of mistreatment by prison
 authorities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution and both the Criminal
 and Civil Codes prohibit arbitrary arrest and detention, but the Government does
 not always respect these rights in practice.
 Under the Criminal Procedure Code, any person detained must be charged and
 informed of the charges within 48 hours and, in most cases, be offered release on
 bail. Those persons believed to have committed serious offenses may be detained for
 15 days while police conduct an investigation, and for additional 15-day periods
 while the investigation continues. Some offenses, such as murder and treason, are
 not bailable. In practice, and especially in the regions, people are often detained
 without warrant, frequently not charged within 48 hours, and-if released on bail-
 never recalled to court. Nationwide, thousands of criminal suspects remained in de-
 tention without charge or trial at year's end. Most often these detentions resulted
 from the severe shortage and limited training of judges, prosecutors, and attorneys.
 
 
 Federal and regional authorities arrested and detained hundreds of persons with-
 out charge or trial for activities allegedly in support of armed opposition groups. The
 vast majority of these took place in the Oromo regional state, In typical cases, secu-
 rity forces arrested and heldthese persons incommunicado for several days or weeks
 before eventually releasing them. Moat detainees were accused of participating in
 armed actions by the OLF. Some 93 persons who were among a large group of OLF
 fighters detainedin 1994 continued to be held.
 in December the SPO fied charges against approximately 1,200 of the 2,000 per-
 sons jailed and accused of war crimes under the previous regime. Some of the de-
 fendants have been in pretrial detention for 5 years.
 Exile is illegal and is not used.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the federal courts showed increased signs of judicial independence.
 Consistent with the 1994 Constitution, the Government continued to restructure
 the judiciary toward a decentralized federal system comprised of courts at the dis-
 trict and regional levels. In May the Government appointed 56 federal court justics.
 A judicial administrative commission was established to oversee the performance of
 the federal judiciary. The Federal High Court and Federal Supreme Court adju-
 dicate cases involving federal law, transregional issues and national security and
 hear both original and appeal cases. The regional judiciary is increasingly autono-
 mous. District (wore), higher and supreme courts have been established, mirror-
 ing the structure of the federal judiciary. Regional supreme courts may be delegated
 authority by the federal courts to hear some federal cases. The Government may
 delegate some of the war crimes trials to supreme courts in the regions where the
 crimes were allegedly committed.
 The military services have undertaken a sweeping overhaul of the military justice
 system. Foreign assistance is being used to train soldiers in topics which include ju-
 dicial and nonjudicial punishment and the conduct of soldiers during military oper-
 ations.
 The Government's goal is a decentralized system that brings justice closer to the
 people; in practice, however, severe shortages of adequately trained personnel in
 many regions, as well as serious financial constraints, combine to keep the judiciary
 weak and overburdened and to deny mast citizens the full protections provided for
 in the Constitution. Hundreds of individuals were detained, especially in the Oromo
 and Somali regions, without chre  Man were ultimately released without expla-
 nation or appearance before a judge. Such cases at times may reflect arbitrary ac-
 tions on the part of heavy handed local officials, but also result from a shortage of
 trained and cornpetent prosecutors and judges. The Government established re-
 dional offices of the Mimitry of Justice to monitor local judicial developments, but
 at    .    presene in the regions remains limited. Anecdotal evidene suggests
 that some local officials intearet decentralization to mean that they are no longer
 accountable to any higher authority, even within their own regions.
 The Government is making concerted efforts to identify and train replacements
 for many lower court judges. Many judges were hastily appointed in 1991 and were
 subsequently dismissed for corruption, incompetence, or abuse of authority. The
 Government, aware of the severe lack of trained staff in the judicial system, began
 in 1995 to place greater emphasis on training new judges and prosecutors. Senior
 government officials charged with judicial oversight estimate that the creation of a
 truly independent and skilled judicial apparatus will take several decades. The Gov-
 ernment has welcomed foreign financial and technical assistance.
 Pending passage by regional legislatures of laws particular to their region, all
 judges are guided exclusively by the Federal procedural and substantive codes.
 Trials are public, and defendants have the right to a defense attorney. The Govern-
 ment established a public defender's office to provide legal counsel to indigent de-
 fendants, although its scope remains severely limited. The law does not allow the
 defense accessto prsecutorial evidence before the trial.
 The Constitution provides legal standing to some preexisting religious and cus-
 tomary courts and gives federa an regional legislatures the authority to reognize
 other courts. By law, both parties to a dispune must agree before a case may be
 heard by a customary or religious court. Sharia (Islamic) courts hear religious and
 family cases involving Muslims. In addition, some traditional courts still function.
 Though not sanctioned by law, these courts resolve legal disputes for the majority
 of citizens who live in rural areas and who generally have little access to formal
 judicial systems.
 The SPO was established in 1992 to create an historical record of the abuses dur-
 ing the Mengistu government and to bring to justice those criminally responsible for
 human rights violations. The trial of the first group of defendants charged with
 crimes against humanity during the former regime began in 1994 and continued
 
 
 93
 intermittently through the year. Court appointed attorneys represent many of the
 defendants, following claims that they could not afford an adequate defense. Of the
 73 defendants, the Government is trying 21 in absentia, including Colonel Mengistu
 Haile Mariam, the former dictator now in self-exile in Zimbabwe. In December ap-
 proximately 1,200 additional detainees were charged with war crimes. Senior gov-
 ernment officials expressed growing frustration with the slow pace of the work of
 the SPO. Local court observers believe that the remaining trials, once they begin,
 may last several years. Legal observers expect relatively few additional cases to be
 brought, with many defendants charged and tried collectively in each instance.
 All Arhara People's Organization (AAPO) Chairman Professor Asrat Woldeyes
 and four other AAPO leaders were convicted in 1994 of planning armed action
 against the Government at a 1993 meeting. Asrat was also convicted of "incitement
 to war" in connection with a speech he made in 1992. He was sentenced to a total
 of 5 years' imprisonment. He still faces charges stemming from a May 1994 prison
 escape in Debre Berhan in which several guards were killed. Asrat is reportedly in
 good health.
 Authorities arrested Dr. Taye Wolde Semayat, chairman of the Ethiopian Teach-
 er's Association (ETA), in August upoa his return from a trip abroad. Taye has been
 formally charged with leading an Amhara extremist organization that planned and
 carried out attacks against foreigners, including the attempted murder of a diplomat
 and a grenade attack on a diplomatic compound in Addis Ababa. The Government's
 case against Taye is not linked to his activities on behalf of the ETA. Taye's trial
 continued at year's end.
 Opposition groups and the Ethiopian Human Rights Council allege that some of
 the persons detained by the SPO, as well as some other detainees, are held for polit-
 ical reasons. The Government denies that it holds political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 requires judicial search warrants, but in practice they are seldom obtained outside
 Addis Ababa, as local governments vary in their understanding and practice of
 democratic norms. In Dire Dawa, for example, there were credible reports that some
 neighborhood officials searched residences without possessing warrants.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-While the Constitution and the 1992 Press Law
 provide for the right to free speech and press, the Government often used legal
 mechanisms to restrict press rights in practice.
 Journalists may fall victim to vague provisions of the Press Law concerning pub-
 lishing false information or inciting ethnic hatred, and some journalists practice
 self-censorship. There were 14 journalists under government detention at year's end;
 most were accused or convicted of inciting ethnic hatred or publishing false informa-
 tion.
 The editor of a private newspaper received a 6-month suspended sentence for not
 delivering two copies of the newspapr to the Ministry of Information, as specified
 by the Press Law, even though the breach had occurred a year earlier. In a similar
 case, the editor of a government magaine was fined about $80 for the same offense.
 According to a number of sources, the whereabouts of one independent editor have
 been unknown since March; a second allegedly missing editor later turned up in
 Germany.
 At year's end, four journalists were serving sentences of from 6 months to 2 years.
 Four journalists were fined for their offenses, most for being unable to produce guar-
 antors for bail. Ten journalists remained in detention without charge; six journalists
 were released after completing jail terms; and 13 others were free on bail. Bail for
 journalists is sometimes set at unreasonably high levels, often much more than
 their annual salaries.
 The private press, which is often irresponsible, frequently reports that govern-
 ment forces or regional officials commit human rights abuses. Most private press ac-
 counts, however, are too imprecise to verify.
 In general, the Government continued to deny access by private journalists to gov-
 ernment press conferences, calling into question official affirmations of support for
 a responsible and dynamic free press. In December, however, for the first time, the
 Government invited several private newspapers to cover a major government press
 conference. One senior minister granted unprecedented interviews to several private
 newspapers. Critics note that the Press Law requires the Government to be acces-
 sible to those seeking information, but the Government more typically continued to
 ignore this provision. It usually denied access to information, even to government
 journalists. Both private and government journalists wrote extensively about prob-
 lems of access to information. Most, but not all, government officials refuse to speak
 to the private press, even to confirm or deny an allegation.
 
 
 Citizens are generally free to discuss publicly any topic they choose. A number
 of groups critical of the Government held press conferences and public meetings
 without apparent retribution.
 Only about 1 percent of citizens regularly read any newspaper or magazine, and
 citizens outside Addis Ababa have extremely limited access to the print media. As
 a result of poor management, market forces, and government harassment, only
 about nine weekly newspapers appear regularly. Foreign journalists continued to
 operate freely and ofen wrote articles critical of government policies. They or their
 local affiliates were granted greater access to government officials than were local
 journalists.
 Much of the private press continues to lack professionalism in its reporting. To
 address this problem, the Ministry of Information and Culture established the Ethi-
 opian Mass Media Training Institute in April. In June the Government invited 10
 private newspapers to participate in a 2-month training course, but only 2 attended.
 Radio remains the most influential medium in reaching those who live in rural
 areas. The Press Law allows for private radio stations, but the only nongovernment
 radio license granted so far has been to Radio Fans, a station operated by the ruling
 EPRDF party. The Government operates the sole television station. It rescinded a
 previous ban on ownership of private satellite receiving dishes and dropped import
 restrictions on facsimile machines and modems. Internet access is unrestricted.
 The official media, including broadcast, wire service, and print media, are legally
 autonomous and responsible for their own management and partial revenue genera-
 tion, although they continue to receive government subsidies. Government reporters
 practice self-censorship but have, at times, questioned official policies. In April the
 Government created a Press and Information Department to act as official spokes-
 man and to implement a new information policy which will guide contacts among
 government, the press, and the public. At year's end, the office was not yet fully
 functioning.
 Academic freedom is respected. Students at Addis Ababa University, who have not
 been allowed to have a student council since 1993, were invited to elect representa-
 tives to a student committee following demonstrations in late 1995. In general, how-
 ever, political activity is not encouraged on university campuses.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly, and the Government generally permitted groups to
 assemble during the year. Organizers of political meetings or demonstrations must
 notify the Government in advance and obtain a permit. Permits are required only
 for large meetings and are routinely granted. A number of large public demonstra-
 tions protesting various government actions took place in Addis Ababa. Protesters
 demonstrated against rent increases, an end to foodsubsidies, military pensions, the
 detention of Professor Asrat, government plans to commemorate the centennial of
 the victory at Adwa, and the policies of the Orthodox Patriarch. The Addis Ababa
 Municipal Government granted permits for each of these demonstrations, and there
 were no reports of violence.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association and the right to engage in
 unrestricted peaceful political activity. Government procedures for registration of
 NGO's were changed, and a number of policy issues regarding NGO's remain un-
 clear. Primary responsibility for NGO registration now rests with the Ministry of
 Justice (MOJ), which has not yet issued written procedures. In 1995 the Govern-
 ment revoked the registration certificates of 47 domestic and international NGO's.
 It has refused to grant new registration to several of these NGO's despite their at-
 tempts to obtain it. The Ethiopian Human Rights Council, which the Government
 asserts is primarily a political organization, has applied for, but has not been grant-
 ed, registration as an NGO.
 The Government requires political parties to register with the National Election
 Board (NEB). Parties that do not participate mn two consecutive national elections
 are subject to deregistration. There are about 60 organized political parties. Of
 these, eight are national parties, and the remainder operate only in specific regions.
 In July the NEB granted registration to the Council of Alternative Forces for Peace
 and Democracy in Ethiopia (CAFPDE) as a national party. CAFPDE has announced
 its intention to establish branch offices in several regions and has launched its own
 newspaper which is highly critical of government policies. The NEB also registered
 the opposition OromoNational Congress as a politicalparty.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides edom eedom of religion, includ-
 ing the right of conversion, and freedom of worship exists in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement, including the right
 of domestic and foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation. Citizens may freely
 
 
 change their residence or workplace. Citizens and residents are required to obtain
 an exit visa before departing the country.
 Exit visas are issued routinely, except to persons with pending court cases or un-
 paid debts.
 All Ethiopian Jews (Falashas and Beta Israel) who wanted to emigrate to Israel
 are believed to have departed. The status of thousands of Feles Mora (Ethiopians
 who claim forced conversation to Christianity from Judaism during the past 100
 years, but who have not been accepted as Jews by the Isranli Rabbinate) remains
 unresolved. Israel is handling Feles Nora applications on a case-by-case basis, and
 the two governments have agreed to grant about 110 visas per month for family re-
 unification.
 According to both the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and foreign
 diplomats, the Government treats asylum seekers fairly and cooperates with the
 UNHCR and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees and returning
 citizens. It provided first asylum to more than 360,000 refugees this year; most are
 from Somalia and Sudan. There were no reports of forced expulsion on those having
 a valid claim to refugee status. Ethiopia is host to a total of approximately 400,000
 refugees; most are from Somalia and Sudan.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 This right was exercised for the first time in Ethiopian history in 1995. However,
 most opposition groups chose to boycott the elections, despite a widespread finding
 that opposition participation was possible. Boycotting parties claimed that the Gov-
 ernment impeded their ability to participate in the political process. Concerted ef-
 forts by Western governments to promote dialogue and political reconciliation be-
 tween the Government and several key opposition groups leading up to the elections
 were not successful. Nevertheless, observers organized by Western donor govern-
 ments, the Organization of African Unity, and a coalition of domestic NGO's judged
 the elections to be generally free and fair, although they cited numerous irregular-
 ities. The boycott was one factor leading to an overwhelming victory by candidates
 of the better funded and better organized EPRDF over candidates of the relatively
 weak and poorly organized opposition parties and independent candidates.
 Political participation remains closed to a number of organizations that have not
 renounced violence and do not accept the Government as a legitimate authority.
 These groups include Medhin, the Coalition of Ethiopian Democratic Forces, the
 Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party, the Oromo Liberation Front, and several
 smaller Somali groups.
 Neither law nor practice restricts the participation of women or minorities in poli-
 tics. While women's status and political participation are greater than ever, women
 are minimally represented in the Council of Ministers and among the leadership of
 all political orghizations. Only 1 of the 15 members of the Council of Ministers is
 a woman; 2 other women hold ministerial rank, and a number of others hold senior
 positions. There are only 18 women among the 660 members of Parliament, and 4
 of the 23 judges on the Federal High Court are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights organizations include the Ethiopian Human Rights and Peace Cen-
 ter, the Ethiopian Conirss for Democracy, Action Professionals Association for the
 People, the Ethiopian Womens' Lawyers Association, and the Inter-Africa Group.
 These groups are primarily engaged in civic and human rights education, legal as-
 sistance and trial monitoring. The Ethiopian Human Rights Council, a self-pro-
 claimed human rights monitoring organization, continues to operate without legal
 status as an NGO, since the Government considers it primarily a political organiza-
 tion.
 The Government allows visits by the ICRC and international human rights groups
 and permits them to operate and travel freely, although prior approval is required
 from regional governments for prison visits. The ICRC conducts regular visits to de-
 tention centers throughout the country. While access has generally been excellent,
 access to some sites in the Oromo and Somali regions was a problem. The Govern-
 ment has encouraged human rights groups and foreign diplomats to observe the war
 crimes trials since court proceedings began in 1994. Delegations from Human Rights
 Watch/Africa, the Committee to Protect Journalists, Reporters sans Frontieres, and
 the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights all visited during the year. Representa-
 tives from these organizations held substantive discussions with a number of senior
 government officials, including Prime Minister Meles Zenawi. Officials of the Fed-
 
 
 96
 eral Security Authority have generally been responsive to requests for information
 from the diplomatic community.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that all persons are equal before the law. The law pro-
 vides that all persons should have equal and effective protection without discrimina-
 tion on grounds of race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, na-
 tional or social origin, wealth, birth, or other status. The Government, however, has
 not yet put fully into place mechanisms for effective enforcement of these protec-
 tions.
 Women.-The Constitution provides for the equality of women, but these provi-
 sions are often not applied in practice. Domestic violence, including wife beating and
 rape, are pervasive social proble. ie  women have recourse to the police and
 the courts, societal norms and limited infrastructure inhibit many women from
 seeking legal redress especially in remote areas.
 Although women played a prominent role (including service in combat) during the
 civil war and hold some senior government positions, in practice women do not enjoy
 equal status with men. The law considers men and women to be equal, but tradition
 and cultural factors place the husband as head of the household: in practice, men
 typically hold land tenure and property rights for all the family. Discrimination is
 most acute in the rural areas, where 85 percent of the population lives, and where
 women work more than 13 hours per day fulfilling household and farming respon-
 sibilities. In urban areas, women have fewer employment opportunities than men,
 and the jobs available do not provide equal pay for equal work. In 1993 the Govern-
 ment launched an initiative to promote the equality of women. As a result, statutes
 were changed, women's concerns were factored into the Government's development
 planning, and women's affairs desks were established in each of the ministries.
 Children.-The Government has encouraged the efforts of domestic and inter-
 national NGO's that focus on children's social, health, and legal issues. However,
 with daunting development challenges and severely limited resources, direct govern-
 ment support beyond efforts to provide improved health care and basic education
 remains limited.
 Societal abuse against young girls continues to be a serious problem. Almost all
 girls undergo some form of female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely con-
 demned by international health experts as damaging to both physical and psycho-
 logical health. Clitorectomies are typically performed 7 days after birth, and the ex-
 cision of the labia and infibulation, the most extreme and dangerous form of FGM,
 can occur any time between the age of 8 and the onset of puberty. FGM is not spe-
 cifically prohibited, although it is officially discouraged, and the Government has
 been very supportive of the National Committee on Traditional Practices in Ethio-
 pia, w    is edicated to eradicating FGM. Nevertheless, early childhood marriage
 is common in rural areas, with girls as young as age 9 being party to arranged mar-
 riages. The maternal mortality rate is extremely high, due in part to food taboos
 for pregnant women, early marriage, and birth complications related to FGM, espe-
 cially from infibulation.
 Many thousands of street children live in Addis Ababa. These children beg, some-
 times as part of a gang, or work in the informal sector in order to survive. Govern-
 ment andprivately run orphanages are unable to handle the number of street chil-
 dren, and younger children are often abused by older children. There are credible
 reports that children are maimed or blinded by their "handlers" in order to raise
 their earnings from begging. Abandoned infants are often overlooked or neglected
 at hospitals and orphanages, and those children found to be HIV-positive are taken
 to an Addis Ababa orphanage where very limited medical care is available.
 People With Disabilities-The Constitution stipulates that the State shall allocate
 resources to provide rehabilitation and assistance to the physically and mentally
 disabled. Limited government resources restrict action in these areas. The Amihara
 Development Association operates a semigovernental project to provide vocational
 training to disabled war veterans in Bahir Dar. A similar center has been estab-
 lished by the Tigray Development Association in Mehle. In 1994 the Government
 passed a law mandating equal rights for the disabled, but has nt yet put into place
 mechanisms to enforce this law. Cultural attitudes toward the disabled are often
 negative. The Government does not have sufficient resources to mandate access to
 buildings or government services for persons with disabilities, and people with
 minor disabilities sometimes complain of job discrimination. An official at the gov-
 ernment's rehabilitation agency estimated that, partly as a result of the long civil
 war, there are more than 5 million disabled persons in the population of about 56
 million.
 
 
 97
 Religious Minorities.-Accurate information on the complex relationships among
 Ethiopia's religious groups is difficult to obtain, especially because religious dif-
 ferences are often related to ethnic distinctions. Religious tensions between Chris-
 tians and Muslims, particularly in certain regions (most notably the Oromiya and
 Somali regions) persist, and anti-Christian sentiment is sometimes fueled by histori-
 cal perceptions of Christians as elite. According to reports from NGO's, tension at
 the local level between and among Christians and Muslims has led to incidents of
 harassment, intimidation, and in some cases, violence.
 NationallRacial/Ethnic Minorities.-There are more than 80 ethnic groups. Al-
 though all these groups have had some influence on the political and cultural life
 of the country, Amharas and Tigrayans from the northern highlands have played
 a dominant role. Some ethnic groups such as Oromos, the largest single group, claim
 to have been subjugated during this period by Amharas and Tigrayans. In an at-
 tempt to address these concerns, the Government has established a federal system
 with political boundaries drawn along major ethnic lines. With federalism, for exam-
 ple, citizens of the Oromo region now have greater say over their own affairs and
 resources than at any time in the past century. Primary school students are increas-
 ingly being taught in their local languages, consistent with the new constitution.
 The military services have continued their efforts to recruit ethnic minorities at all
 levels. The demobilization of an additional 25,000 Tigrayan soldiers was completed,
 and these troops were replaced by recruits from other ethnic groups. All new re-
 cruits are screened as potential officer candidates, and those who qualify are offered
 officer training. As regional militia were disbanded, the Government integrated over
 3,500 militia members into the national defense forces. The military services also
 welcomed back 7,000 soldiers who had served under the previous Marxist regime
 and who have important technical skills. These soldiers andformer militia members
 are often permitted to retain their previous grade, up to the rank of colonel. Six of
 the military's nine general officers are non-Tigrayans.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Only a small percentage of the population is in-
 volved in wage labor employment, which is largely concentrated in urban areas. Ap-
 proximately 85 percent of the work force lives in the countryside, engaged in sub-
 sistence farming.
 The Constitution and the 1993 Labor Law provide most workers with the right
 to form and join unions and engage in collective bargaining, but only about 250,000
 workers are unionized. Employees of the civil and security services (where most
 wage earners are found), judges, and prosecutors are not allowed to form unions.
 Workers who provide an "essential service? are not allowed to strike. Essential serv-
 ices include a large number of categories such as air transport, railways, bus serv-
 ice, police and fire services, post and telecommunications, banks, and pharmacies.
 There is no requirement that unions belong to the Confederation of Ethiopian Trade
 Unions (CETU), which was established in 1993. CETU includes nine federations or-
 ganized by industrial and service sector rather than by region. In December 1994,
 the Government decertified CETU following a 30-day probationary period given to
 permit CETU to resolve serious internal management disputes. At year's end, CETU
 offices remained closed despite a court ruling that there were procedural violations
 in the Government's action to seal the CETU offices. The offices remained closed
 in part because the member trade unions have been unable to agree among them-
 selves on a unified structure to govern CETU's assets and offices. By year's end,
 most CETU member federations were preparing to reorganize their organizations
 and were expected to receive government recognition of a new CETU. The Labor
 Law stipulates that a trade organization may not act in an overtly political manner.
 The Labor Law explicitly gives workers the right to strike to protect their inter-
 ests, but it also sets forth restrictive procedures that apply before a legal strike may
 take place. These apply equally to an employer's right to lock out workers. Strikes
 must be supported by a majority of the workers affected. The Labor Law prohibits
 retribution against strikers. Both sides must make efforts at conciliation, provide at
 least 10 days notice to the Government, include the reasons for the action, and in
 cases already before a court or labor bard, the party must provide at least a 30-
 day warning. If an agreement between unions and management cannot be reached,
 the Minister of Labor may refer the case to arbitration by a Labor Relations Board
 (LRB). The Government established LRB's at the national level and in some regions.
 The Minister of Labor and Social Affairs appoints each LRB chairman, and the four
 board members are composed of two each from trade unions and employer groups.
 Some efforts to enforce these regulations are made within the formal industrial sec-
 tor.

 Independent unions and those belonging to CETU are free to affiliate with, and
 participate in, international labor bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is pro-
 tected under the Labor Law and under the Constitution, and it is practiced freely
 througbout the country. Collective bargaining agreements concluded between 1975
 and the prmu~gation of tbe 1993 Labor Law are covered under the 1975 Labor
 Code and remain in force. Labor experts estimate that more than 90 percent of
 unionized workers are covered by collective bargaining agrements. Wages are nego-
 tiated at the plant level. The law probibits antiunion dicrmiation by employers
 against union members and organizers. There are grievance procedures for bearings
 on allegations of discrimination brought by indivduals or unions. Employers found
 guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union
 activities.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution proscribes slav-
 ery, which was officially abolished in 1942, and involuntary servitude. There are no
 reports of slavery. The Criminal Code specifically prohibits forced labor unless by
 court order as a punitive measure.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Under tbe Labor Law, the mini-
 mum age for wage or salary employment is 14 years; children between the ages of
 14 and 18 years are covered by special provisions. Children may not work more than
 7 hours per day; work between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.; work on public holl-
 .days or rest days; or perform overtime work. While some efforts to enforce tbese reg-
 ulations are made within the formal industrial sector, large numbers of children of
 all ages grow and harvest crops outside most government regulatory control in the
 countryside, or work as street peddlers in the cities.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no minimum wage in the private sec-
 tor. However, since 1985 a minimum wage has been set and paid to public sector
 employees, by far the largest group of wage earners. This public sector minimum
 wage is about $16 (105 Ethiopian birr) per month, which is insufficient to provide
 a decent standard of living for a worker and family. According to the Office of the
 Study of Wages and Other Remunerations, a family of five requires a monthly in-
 come of $61 (390 Ethiopian birr). Thus, even with two minimum wage earners, a
 family receives only about half the income needed for adequate subsistence.
 The legal workweek, as stipulated in the Labor Law, is 48 hours, consisting of
 6 days of 8 hours each, with a 24-hour rest period. However, in practice, most em-
 ployees work a 40-hour workweek, 5 days of 8 hours each.
 The Government, industry, and unions negotiate to set occupational health and
 safety standards. However, the Inspection Department of the Ministry of Labor and
 Social Affairs enforces these standards ineffectively, due to a lack of human and fi-
 nancial resources. Workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous sit-
 uations without jeopardy to continued employment.
