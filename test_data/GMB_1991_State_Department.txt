 THE GAMBIA
 The Gan6ia is a parliamentary democracy-with an elected
 president and legislature. Except for a coup attempt in 1981,
 The Gambia has had a history of political stability under the
 leadership of its only President since independence in 1965,
 Sir Dawda Jawara. His ruling People's Progressive Party (PPP)
 has dominated the unicameral Parliament, but several opposition
 parties participate in the political process, including two
 parties formed in 1986.
 The Gambia has a small army with an attached naval unit
 organized and trained by British officers. Its gendarmerie
 forces, formerly headed by Senegalese officers, are now under
 the control of, and responsive to, Gambian civilian leadership.'
 The.Gambia's estimated population of 784,000 consists largely
 of subsistence farmers growing rice and groundnuts (peanuts),
 the country's-primary export crop. In 1991 TheGambia
 continued its stringent economic reform program in'cooperation
 with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
 The Gambia has made particular efforts to promote observance of
 human rights, which are constitutionally protected and
 generally observed in practice. In 1991 the death of a person
 in police custody led to a swift investigation, arrests, and
 trials of police officials.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 -Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom-from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reported political killings. However, on August
 2, a longtime Senegalese resident in The Gambia, Mom6dou
 Jarjue, was detained on suspicion of theft by three Criminal
 Investigation Division (CID) officers of the Gdbian police.
 According to witnesses, the CID officers beat Jarjue
 continuously through.the night and denied him food, water, and
 medical attention. Jarjue died the next moriing.
 The police immediately began an investigation, personally
 directed by the Minister of the Interior and the new Inspector
 General of Police, and the three CID officers were detained by
 the Gambian gendarmerie. In addition officials of the African
 Centre for Democracy and Human Rights Studies conducted an
 independent investigation of the incident and filed their
 report with the Attorney General's office. Late in August the
 police completed their investigation, and subsequently the
 Attorney General announced that the three CID officers would be
 arraigned before the Supreme Court and charged with murder aid
 assault. The trial began on October 1 and was continuing at
 year's end, with the press providing full coverage of the
 proceedings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance.
 c.' Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other cruel, inhuman,
 and degrading punishment. Except for the Jarjue case (Section
 
 
 142
 THE GAMBIA
 l.a.), there were no known instances of torture or mistreatment
 of detainees in 1991.
 Prison conditions are severe, and in the past there have been
 occasional reports of mistreatment of prisoners. After the
 death of several inmates in 1988 due to inadequate diet, a
 presidential commission on prison conditions investigated the
 occurrence and its recomnendations led to prison reforms.
 There have been no further reports of such incidents since the
 reforms. The Government allows prison visits by local Red
 Cross representatives and by close family members.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Based on British legal practice, well-developed constitutional
 and legal procedures govern the arrest, detention, and? trial of
 persons accused of crimes. Under these procedures, a detained
 persbn must be brought to trial within I week of arrest. This
 waiting period, however, may be extended twice, making 21 days
 the maximum period of detention before trial. In fact, due to
 overcrowded court schedules, the detention period can be much
 longer.
 There were no political detainees being held at the end of
 1991. There are some self-exiled opposition elements who would
 be arrested for suspected involvement in the 1981 coup attempt
 if they returned to The Gambia, e.g., the alleged leader of the
 plot, Kukoi Samba Sanyang.
 In February President Jawara amnestied the last 35 people
 imprisoned for criminal convictions relating to the 1981 coup
 attempt. Two of the recipients had been convicted of high
 treason and condemned to death.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There are three kinds of law in-The Gambia: general, Shari'a
 (Islamic), and customary law. Shari'a law, governing Muslims,
 is observed in marriage and divorce proceedings. Customary law
 covers marriage and divorce for non-Muslims, inheritance, land
 tenure and utilization, local tribal government, and all other
 traditional civil and social relations. General law, based on
 English statutes and modified to suit the Gambian context,
 governs criminal cases and trials and most organized business
 practices. If there were a conflict between general law and
 Shari'a, general law would prevail.
 The Constitution provides criminal defendants with the
 traditional rights of the English legal system, such as
 presumption of innocence, the right of the accused to be
 informed promptly of the charges, and the right to a public
 trial. If released on bail, an accused person may face charges
 indefinitely, since there is no maximum time limit for
 completing the investigation and bringing the case to trial.
 Appeals normally proceed from the Supreme (trial) Court to the
 Court of Appeals, the country's highest tribunal.
 Judges are appointed by the Government, but the judiciary
 operates independently and is free of government interference.
 Because of the shortage of legal professionals in The Gambia,
 the legal system is staffed in part by judges and prosecuting
 and defense attorneys from other English-speaking countries
 having the same basic legal system as The Gambia.
 
 
 143
 THE GAMBIA
 In 1968"a journalist, Sana Mannfeh, accused four cabinet
 ministers of corruption, for which he was subsequently tried in
 Magistrate's Court on charges of libeling three of them. In
 that trial lhe was'acquitted on t!wo counts and convicted of the
 third.. The Government appealed the'decision to the Supreme
 Court, which overturned the acquittals. Manneh then appealed
 to the Court 6f Appeal (The Gambia's highest court), which,
 based on a technicality, reversed the Supkemie Court's ruling on
 December'5. The prosecution failed-to give oral notice of its
 intent'to appeal after the announcement of the Magistrate
 Court's judgment, as prescribed by. Gambian'law.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home. or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides guarantees,-which are respected in
 practice, against arbitrary search of person and property. It
 does-permit a'search'to which a suspect submits voluntarily or
 if it is reasonably required in the interest of national
 defense or public welfare. Under the Gambian criminal code,
 search warrants based on probable cause are issued by
 magistrates upon application by the police. The code also
 specifies that police may condudt a search of a private
 residence while a crime-is in progress. There are a few
 checkpoints in the'country where the police and military
 periodically stop and search drivers and vehicles.
 The rights of family are of great importance in The Gambia's
 conservative Muslim society. Marriage, the raising of
 children, and religious instruction are regulated by a
 combination of personal preference and ethnic and religious
 tradition. The Government does not normally intrude in family
 matters. There is no effort to censor or control personal
 correspondence or bommunications.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties" Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and press.
 While opposition parties have been relatively inactive since
 the 1987 elections, members freely express their opinions about
 the Government'and ruling party.
 The Government does not attempt to censor published materials,
 whether they originate within or outside the country. In
 practical terms, The Gambia, with its small, mainly rural,
 largely illiterate, multilingual population, does not support
 an active press, though this is slowly changing. The
 Government and the PPP have newspapers which are published on a
 biweekly 6r monthly basis.
 There are several independent, intermittently published,
 mimeographed newssheets and, more'recently, one monthly
 newsmagazine. Both the opposition and the independent press
 are openly critical of the Government. There is, however, some
 degree of self-censorship in the government-owned media, which
 exercises restraint in reporting criticism of the Government.
 During the Manneh libel trial, Radio Gambia and the official
 press ceased coverage after the first week of the trial.
 There is no television in The Gambia, although Senegalese
 broadcasts can be received. The Government dominates the media
 through Radio Gambia.' TWo commercial radio stations, one of
 which opened in 1991, 'primarily broadcast music. Foreign
 
 
 144
 THE GAMBIA
 magazines and newspapers are available in The capital. There
 is no university in The Gambia.
 During 1991, Parliament passed the National Press Council Act,
 which establishes a council to oversee the activities of
 journalists. The Act originated in response to journalists'
 requests for legislation governing press affairs. The council
 will be required to prepare a code of conduct and will have the
 power to judge journalists with respect to breaches of this
 code, reprimand them if the council rules against them, and
 impose fines. While the President assented to the bill on
 June 27, it has not been published; therefore it is not yet law.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 In general, there is no interference with the freedom of
 assembly and association which is provided for in the
 Constitution. The Government almost always grants permits for
 peaceful assembly but requires that these meetings be open to
 the public. Permits for assembly are issued by the police and
 are not denied for political reasons. The permits regulate
 times, places, use of loudspeakers, and the authority to block
 traffic for a parade. The only banned organization in the
 Gambia is the Movement for Justice in Africa, which was
 suspected of involvement in the 1981 coup attempt. The law has
 been amended so that any future bans would be by judicial
 decision rather than a presidential decree. The State must now
 apply to a court for a banning order, citing specific grounds
 for the request. There were no requests to ban any
 organization in 1991.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The constitutional provisions of freedom of conscience,
 thought, and religion are observed in practice. The State is
 secular, although Muslims constitute over 90 percent of the
 population. The schools provide instruction in the Koran for
 Muslim students. Christians, both Catholic and Protestant,
 freely practice their religion. There is a small Baha'i
 community in Banjul. Missionaries are permitted to carry on
 openly and freely their various mission-related activities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution provides for freedom of movement, subject to
 conditions protecting public safety, health, and morals. There
 is no restriction on freedom of emigration or freedom of
 return. Because of historic and ethnic ties with the
 inhabitants of Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Sierra Leone, and
 Mauritania, people tend to move freely across borders, which
 are poorly marked and difficult to police.
 The population of Liberian refugees registered in The Gambia
 increased by almost 150 percent from 1990 to 1991. At the end
 of 1991, approximately 180 Liberians living in The Gambia were
 registered with the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR). An even larger number are unregistered. The
 UNHCR does not have an assistance program in The Gambia. It
 has transported interested Liberians unable to receive help
 through family or friends to countries where UNHCR relief
 programs are ongoing. Since the settlement of the Casamance
 insurgency in southern Senegal, many of the Casamancais
 refugees who had settled in The Gambia to escape the turmoil
 have begun to return home. While there were a reported 326
 
 
 4I45
 
 THE GAMBIA
 Senegalese refugees in The Gambia, the number could well have
 been higher during the conflict given the fluid movements
 across The Gambia-Senegal border. Senegalese refugees in The
 Gambia were not receiving international assistance.
 Late in 1990, a human rights group reported that the Gambian
 authorities had forcibly repatriated 10 Casamancais (Senegalese
 nationals) from The Gambia to Senegal. The group claimed that
 their return to Senegal placed them in danger of torture and
 death at the hands of Senegalese security forces. The
 Government responded that the Senegalese in question had not
 requested asylum in The Gambia and had entered the country
 illegally, so they were deported by Gambian immigration
 officials. The Government stressed that it was well aware of
 its obligations under the Geneva Convention on the Status of
 Refugees.
 Section 3 Respect.for political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to.Change Their Government .
 Citizens have the right to change their government through
 peaceful means. 'The President and the Members of Parliament
 are popularly elected, as are the district councils and the
 chiefs, who' exercise traditional authority in the villages and
 compounds. Presidential and parliamentary elections are held
 every 5_years., -Citizens must be at least 18 years of age to
 vote. Balloting issecret. and measures are employed to assure
 that illiterate voters understand the choices and voting
 procedure, '
 A functioning multiparty system exists, even though the
 People's Progressive Party under the leadership of President'
 Jawara has been-in power since independence. The principal
 opposition-party,, the National Convention Party (NCP), contests
 both national and district elections. In'the March 1987
 presidential and parliamentary elections, campaigning was
 vigorous, active, and open to all parties. The ruling PPP won
 by an overwhelming majority and now holds 31 of 36 elective
 seats in the Parliament. The NCP was the only opposition party
 to win- seats.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is responsive to charges of human rights
 violations and has established the African Centre for Democracy
 and Human Rights Studies to promote greater respect for human
 rights in Africa through research into and documentation of
 human rights problems and through workshops and conferences.
 It permits visits of international human rights organizations
 to'observe the condition of.detainees and the trial process.
 Early in 1991, the United Nations Human Rights Commission
 (UNHRC) made a routine investigatory stop in The Gambia. The -
 Gambia is an active member of the UNHRC and of the Organization
 of African tnity's (OAU) Commission on Human and Peoples'
 Rights. It took the initiative in persuading the OAU to locate
 the OAU Commission. which opened in June 1989, in Banjul. In
 May the African Centre for-Democracy and Human Rights Studies
 hosted a human rights training conference for upper level
 magistrates from Francophone African countries.

 THE GAMBIA
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution states that all persons in The Gambia are
 entitled to "fundamental rights and freedoms" regardless of
 "race, place of origin, political opinions, colour, creed, or
 sex." There is no officially sanctioned'discrimination based
 on race, sex, religion, language, or social status. The
 Gambian population is overwhelmingly Muslim and rural, with 85
 percent living in villages, and there is considerable emphasis
 on the collective aspects of rights and privileges. There is
 no evidence of discrimination in employment, education, or in
 other areas of Gambian life on religious grounds.
 Traditional views, especially about the role of women in
 society, are changing, but very slowly. Marriages are still
 most often arranged, and Muslim tradition allows for polygamy.
 Women are disadvantaged educationally, with females comprising
 about one-third of the students in primary school, and
 one-quarter of the high school students.
 Domestic violence occurs, and female circumcision is practiced,
 reinforced by traditional beliefs. Until recently, the
 Government has been passive in attempting to counter these
 practices. However, the Women's Bureau in the Office of the
 President conducts an ongoing campaign in both the rural and
 urban areas to make women aware of their legal rights in
 respect of divorce and custody of children, property matters,
 and in cases of assault. The Bureau holds workshops on female
 circumcision to inform women of its negative effects and to
 discuss the religious and traditional ties to the practice. It
 also publishes a quarterly magazine on women's issues, which it
 distributes throughout the country. The Women's Bureau
 conducted a study in 1990 of women's rights, including specific
 questions on domestic violence, but data from this study had
 not been released by the end of 1991.
 To reinforce the efforts of the Women's Bureau, the World Bank,
 in conjunction with several other donors, initiated the Women
 In Development project in October 1990. This project will run
 for 6 years with the objective of improving the health and
 income generation capacities of Gambian women.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 In October 1990, the Government passed the Labor Act of 1990,
 the first labor act since independence, which applies to all
 workers except civil servants. The Act specifies that workers
 are free to form associations, including trade unions, and
 provides for their registration with the Government. Police
 officers and the military are specifically prohibited from
 forming unions and from going on strike. Members of the civil
 service can neither form unions nor strike.
 The Labor Act of 1990 authorizes strikes, but it specifies that
 a union must give the Commissioner of Labor 14 days' written
 notice before beginning an industrial action (28 days for
 essential services). Furthermore, upon application by an
 employer to the Supreme Court, that body may prohibit an
 industrial action which is ruled to be in pursuit of a
 political objective, or an action which is in breach of a
 collectively agreed procedure for the settlement of industrial
 disputes that has not been exhausted. Because of these
 
 
 THE GAMBIA
 provisions, government conciliation efforts, and the poor
 bargaining strength of the unions, few strikes actually occur.
 The -last strike was'that of the Bakers' Association in August
 1990, which demanded (successfully) an increase in the
 controlled price of bread.
 Less than 20 percent of the work 'orce is engaged in the modern
 wage sector of the economy, where unions are normally active.
 The Gambian Workers' Confederation (GWC) and the Gambian
 Workers Union (GWU) are the two main independent and-.competing
 umbrella organizations, and both are recognized by, and have a
 good working relationship with the Government. Unions
 exercise the right to affiliate internationally and there are
 no restrictions on workers' ability to participate in
 international fortuns.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Labor Act of 1990 provides workers the right to organize
 and bargain collectively. Although trade unions are small and
 fragmented, collective bargaining does take place. The Labor
 Department registers the collective bargaining agreements
 reached between the unions and management. The Act also sets
 minimum standards for contracts in the areas of hiring,
 training, terms of employment, wages, and termination of
 employment. The Act states that "any term of a contract of
 employment prohibiting an employee from becoming or remaining a
 member of any trade union or other organization representing
 workers.. .shall be null and void." Otherwise, the Government
 does not interfere in the bargaining process. There are no
 export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Criminal Code prohibits compulsory labor, and it is not
 practiced in The Gambia.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The official minimum age for employment is 18. There is no
 compulsory education legislation and, because of the paucity of
 secondary school opportunities, most children complete their
 formal education by age 14 and informally enter the work
 force. The Labor Commissioner is charged with receiving
 employee labor cards, which include a person's age, but
 enforcement inspections rarely take place for lack of funding
 and inspectors. Control of child labor does not apply to
 customary chores on family farms or street trading.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 By law minimum wages and hours of work are determined by joint
 industrial councils (commerce, artisans, transport, the port
 industry, agriculture, and fisheries), which have �
 representation from employees, employers, and government.
 These minimum wages do not provide for a decent standard of
 living. Moreover, only 20 percent of the labor force is
 covered by minimum wage legislation, the remainder being
 privately employed, chiefly in agriculture. Most Gambians do
 not live on one worker's earnings and rely on the extended
 family system, usually including some subsistence farming.
 The maximum legal workweek is 48 hours within a period not to
 exceed 6 consecutive days. Allowance is made for half-hour
 lunch breaks. For the private sector, there are four 8-hour
 
 
 148
 THE GAMBIA
 days with half days on Fridays and Saturdays, making a 40-hour
 workweek. Government employees are entitled to 1 month's paid
 leave after 1 year of service; private sector employees receive
 between 14 and 30 days of paid annual leave, depending on their
 length of service.
 The Labor Act provides-a list of occupational categories and
 specifies safety equipment that an employer must supply to
 employees.working in these categories. Under the Factory Act,
 the Minister of Labor is given authority to regulate factory
 health and safety, accident prevention, and dangerous trades
 and to appoint inspectors to ensure compliance. However, this
 system is less than fully satisfactory because of a shortage of
 inspectors.
