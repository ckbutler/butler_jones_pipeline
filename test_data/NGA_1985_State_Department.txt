 NIGERIA
 On August 27, 1985, military officers overthrew the
 20-month-old government of Major General Muhammadu Buhari and
 installed Major General Ibrahim Babangida as President.
 Babangida was Chief of the Army Staff in the Buhari
 government, which had itself seized power from a civilian
 government in December 1983. A 28-member Armed Forces Ruling
 Council (AFRC) is the main decisionmaking organ of the
 Government, while a 22-member Federal Cabinet presides over
 the Government's executive departments. Military governors,
 appointed by the President and assisted by executive councils,
 head Nigeria's 19 state governments. The 1979 Constitution
 remains partially in effect, but significant provisions,
 namely those guaranteeing such democratic features as free
 elections and political parties and such fundamental
 individual rights as due process and habeas corpus, are
 suspended. In December 1985, the Babangida Government
 'thwarted a coup plot by disgruntled military officers. The
 plot was widely condemned by the Nigerian public.
 Courts-martial of those suspected of involvement were pending
 at the end of the year.
 Legislation at both the federal and state levels continues to
 be promulgated by decree. All decrees are exempt from
 challenge in the courts and under the previous military
 government some decrees had ex post facto effect. The
 Government enforces its authority through the federal security
 apparatus: the national police, the military, and the
 Nigerian Security Organization (NSO). No separate law
 enforcement agencies exist at the state and local levels.
 Nigeria, with an estimated 100 million people, is Africa's
 most populous country. It has a mixed economy in which the
 Government plays a major role in important sectors. In
 October, the military Government declared a 15-month state of
 "economic emergency" in an effort to revitalize Nigeria's
 sluggish economy. It pledged a reduction of bureaucratic and
 administrative fetters on the economy in order to encourage
 new private investment. The Government also announced that it
 would rely on market forces to induce more efficient resource
 allocation, revitalize moribund industries, and stimulate
 production of palm oil, cocoa, and other commodities that
 Nigeria relied on for foreign exchang before the oil boom of
 the 1970's.
 The new Government moved quickly to demonstrate its commitment
 to human rights. It repealed a controversial decree that
 inhibited press freedoms, named a panel to review the
 remaining decrees of the previous government, formed a
 committee to review the cases of all current and former
 detainees, as well as those previously sentenced by military
 tribunals, and named a prominent, outspoken human rights
 advocate as Attorney General and Minister of Justice. Since
 the coup, the Government has released approximately 150
 persons detained without charges and released or remanded to
 the criminal court system common criminals detained by the
 NSO. The traditionally independent judiciary remains intact,
 although its authority continues to be limited by the
 existence of military and special tribunals created by decree
 in 1984. During the first half of 1985, these tribunals
 convicted civilians of crimes defined by the provisions of
 certain military decrees.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1
 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There is no evidence of killing for political motives. No
 former officeholder or politician ousted by either recent
 military government and tried by military tribunals has
 received the death penalty.
 b. Disappearance
 There are no known instances of politically motivated or
 government-instigated disappearances in Nigeria during 1985.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There were no confirmed reports of torture in 1985. Some
 detainees interviewed after the August coup accused the
 Nigerian Security Organization (NSO) of using torture or
 degrading practices against them prior to the coup. Those
 allegations were under investigation at the end of 1985. A
 portion of the 1979 Constitution which is still in effect
 outlaws torture and the mistreatment of prisoners. Nigerian
 law provides that such excesses be dealt with in criminal or
 civil proceedings. There are reports of crowded and austere
 prison conditions and mistreatment, including brutality. The
 opening to public view, following the August coup, of the
 NSO's main detention center confirmed these reports and
 revealed the presence of many detainees held without charges
 for as long as 18 months.
 Under the terms of Decree 20, Special Tribunal (Miscellaneous
 Offenses) Decree, which continues in effect, the previous
 government extended the death penalty in 1984 to a number of
 crimes including arson, tampering with oil pipelines or
 electric or telephone cables, illegal import or export of
 mineral ore, dealing in narcotics, illegally dealing in
 petroleum products, counterfeiting, and armed robbery even
 when no death or injury occurs. Three cocaine traffickers
 sentenced to death by a special tribunal were executed in
 April. Two of the three committed their offenses prior to the
 issuance of Decree 20. The press reported widespread public
 criticism of these executions by groups of lawyers, judges,
 and women, among others. Since then, other offenders have
 been sentenced to death for drug trafficking, but there have
 been no further known executions for this offense.
 Subsequently, the Chief of General Staff announced in November
 that there would no longer be a death penalty for convicted
 drug traffickers. Executions for armed robbery occurred in
 1985 under both governments, which justified these punishments
 as necessary to restore order and discipline in society.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The arbitrary arrest and prolonged detention of persons,
 including foreigners, continued in 1985. The State Security
 (Detention of Persons) Decree, issued as Decree no. 2 in 1984
 and still in force, allows for the detention of persons
 
 
 240
 NIGERIA
 suspected of acts prejudicial to state security or harmful to
 the economic well-being of the country. The number of persons
 detained under this decree, which suspends the constitutional
 guarantee of the right to habeas corpus and cannot be
 challenged in any court of law, is unknown. Among the
 foreigners detained under this decree have been several
 Americans, some of whom were held for several months before
 being granted consular access or having charges filed against
 them. One American detained in 1984 for three months without
 consular access, and held nine months before charges were
 filed, was acquitted in January by a special tribunal and
 released. After the August coup, the new Government
 discovered that some common criminals had been detained
 without being charged under this decree, some for longer than
 sentences appropriate to their crimes would have required.
 Both governments in power in 1985 released some persons
 detained under the state security decree. Some of the
 released persons have had to pay fines, and others must report
 regularly to the Nigerian Security Organization. Since
 August, the criminal suspects discovered in detention have
 been turned over to the criminal court system or released.
 Among the many persons still detained are former President
 Shehu Shagari, his Vice President Alex Ekwueme, former Head of
 State Muhammadu Buhari, and his Chief of Staff Tunde
 Idiagbon. The postcoup Government has established a panel to
 review the cases of all current and former detainees, as well
 as those previously sentenced by military tribunals. The new
 Government has also established a panel to review all decrees
 of the previous government, including the State Security
 Decree. In December, the Government announced formation of a
 third judicial commission which will be tasked with examining
 cases of persons held in custody under Decrees 2 and 3 and of
 persons who have been conditionally released since the August
 coup.
 The military Government does not use forced labor as a means
 of political coercion or as a sanction against free
 expression. Nigeria's 1979 Constitution provides that "no
 person shall be held in slavery or servitude; and no person
 shall be required to perform forced or compulsory labour."
 The latter excludes community service programs and "normal
 communal or civic obligations for the well-being of the
 community." This exception is relevant to special
 environmental clean-up campaigns launched by the Buhari
 government that required both government and private sector
 employees to devote specified amounts of volunteer time
 cleaning the areas surrounding their places of employment.
 No one has been exiled. The current Government has said that
 self-exiled former politicians are free to return home with
 the caveat that those suspected of crimes will be subject to
 prosecution.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Provisions of the 1979 Constitution still in force guarantee
 persons charged with crimes a fair public trial in civilian
 courts within three months from the date of arrest.
 Cumbersome administrative procedures and inefficiency
 sometimes extend this time period. The Constitution also
 guarantees notification of charges and access to legal
 counsel. Such trials are public and adhere to
 constitutionally guaranteed individual rights. The new
 
 
 241
 NIGERIA
 Government has assured the judiciary of independence from the
 executive branch. In capital cases, the Government provides
 counsel for indigent defendants. In other cases, indigents
 must rely for counsel on the Nigerian Legal Aid Society, which
 has limited resources.
 Decrees promulgated by the previous government, which are
 currently under review, removed certain crimes from the
 jurisdiction of the civilian judicial system and subjected
 those charged with these crimes to secret trial by specially
 constituted tribunals. Decree 3, Recovery of Public Property
 (Special Military Tribunals), places persons suspected of
 corrupt practices or of otherwise contributing to the
 country's economic adversity under the jurisdiction of special
 military tribunals, chaired by military officers with a
 federal or state high court justice as a legal advisor.
 Decree 20 brought persons accused of crimes such as currency
 violations, accusations against public officials, arson,
 import and export of certain goods, destruction of public
 property, and use or possession of drugs under the
 jurisdiction of other tribunals in which federal or state high
 court justices headed panels of military and police officers.
 According to the decrees, all tribunal verdicts are subject to
 review by the ruling military council which can confirm,
 overturn, or reduce the penalties with no further appeal
 allowed. Convicted defendants have generally received the
 21-year sentences prescribed by the decrees, but the Supreme
 Military Council reduced the severity of some sentences upon
 review. Despite decree provisions prohibiting appeal of
 tribunal convictions, the Government established in November
 two panels to review the cases of all persons convicted under
 Decrees 3, 7, and 20 with a view to upholding, reducing, or
 overturning the convictions. Distinguished and experienced
 judges were named to head the panels that will function
 essentially as courts of appeal.
 The Nigerian Bar Association continued in 1985 to urge its
 members to boycott corruption trials because of the presence
 of members without legal training on the tribunals, the
 requirement that the corruption trials be held in camera, and
 the absence of a right of appeal. Some lawyers have ignored
 the Bar Association's position and represented the accused.
 While procedural norms appear to be followed by the tribunals,
 some defendants have had little time to consult a lawyer or to
 prepare a defense.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Nigerian society is generally free of arbitrary interference
 by the State in the private lives of citizens. The modified
 Nigerian Constitution guarantees rights of privacy in the
 home, correspondence, and oral electronic communications.
 General surveillance of the population by the State is not
 practiced in Nigeria. There is no political enforcement of
 social, cultural, or religious codes. Forced entry into homes
 by police and security officials is not generally permitted
 without the authorization of the judiciary. However, the
 police and members of the Nigerian Security Organization have
 occasionally entered homes and offices without a warrant when
 seeking evidence in corruption cases.
 
 
 242
 NIGERIA
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The modified Nigerian Constitution guarantees freedom of
 expression and the press. The Government fully restored these
 freedoms immediately after the August coup with the repeal of
 Decree 4, the Public Officers (Protection Against False
 Accusation) Decree, which had made it an offense for any
 person to publish a statement, rumor, message, or report about
 a government official that was false or designed to subject
 the government to ridicule. Two journalists convicted in 1984
 under provisions of this decree were released from prison in
 early 1985 after serving their one-year sentences. Following
 the repeal of Decree 4, the Government released five other
 journalists who had been detained under Decree 2, the State
 Security (Detention of Persons) Decree. There is no direct
 government censorship of the media, including of books, but
 there was evidence of self-censorship by all media while
 Decree 4 was in force. Prior to the August 27 coup, private
 newspapers claimed that the government discriminated against
 them in the allocation of newsprint. These complaints ceased
 after the coup.
 Among the vast array of Nigerian daily newspapers is one
 jointly owned by the federal and several northern state
 governments. Another is owned 60 percent by the federal
 Government. Four national dailies with large circulations are
 privately owned. Some state governments operate their own
 newspapers. In some states, privately owned dailies compete
 with state papers. There are also no restrictions on
 ownership of other forms of print media. The Constitution,
 however, reserves the right to own and operate radio and
 television stations for the federal and state governments.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political parties, provided for in the 1979 Nigerian
 Constitution, remain banned. A 1984 decree authorizes the
 Government to dissolve any other group considered to have
 objectives similar to those of a political party. Just prior
 to the August coup, the Buhari government banned public
 discussion of the country's political future and arrested some
 journalists and others for allegedly defying the law. In
 February, the previous government banned the Nigerian Medical
 Association (NMA) and the National Association of Residential
 Doctors (NARD) during a strike by doctors in government
 hospitals that was crushed by this and other tough government
 measures. This banning remained in force at the end of 1985.
 The National Union of Nigerian Students (NUNS) remained banned
 and its offshoot organization, the National Association of
 Nigerian Students (NANS), is not recognized by the
 Government. NANS' leaders were, however, found to be not
 guilty by a regular court in January of meeting for an
 allegedly illegal purpose five months earlier. In July, the
 Nigerian National Police arrested six NANS student leaders at
 the University of Port Harcourt for holding an unauthorized
 meeting. Following sympathy demonstrations on the Port
 Harcourt campus and at the University of Ibadan, the police
 arrested more students and temporarily closed the two campuses.
 Nigeria has ratified International Labor Organization (ILO)
 Conventions 87 (Freedom of Association and Right to Organize)
 and 98 (Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining).
 
 
 243
 NIGERIA
 Nigerian trade union, social, and professional organizations
 are guaranteed the right of association by the 1979
 Constitution. On the international level, government policy
 since 1975 has limited union freedom of association to the
 ILO, the Organization of African Trade Union Unity, and its
 affiliated Pan-African Labor Federations. Membership is
 prohibited in such international bodies as the World
 Federation of Trade Unions and World Confederation of Labor,
 but "fraternal relations" with foreign trade unions and
 secretariats are permitted as long as there is no formal
 affiliation.
 Nigeria has 42 industrial unions, one senior staff
 association, and one professional association that comprise
 the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), the country's single
 central labor body. Nigeria's industrial union leaders are
 democratically elected and independent of government control.
 Thanks to mandatory dues checkoffs, most of the larger
 industrial unions are financially independent. Some unions,
 especially small ones, however, are reportedly in serious
 financial difficulties following three years of depressed
 economic conditions. All Nigerian workers 16 years or older
 may join trade unions, except members of the armed forces and
 designated employees of essential government services at the
 federal, state, and local levels. Employers are obliged to
 recognize trade unions and, since 1978, must pay a dues
 checkoff for employees who are members of a registered trade
 union. The establishment of closed shops is prohibited.
 Nigerian law and practice generally provide that the terms and
 conditions of labor will be determined by collective
 bargaining agreements between management and trade unions.
 However, in 1984 the previous government imposed a national
 wage freeze and virtually ordered the NLC trade unions to
 suspend collective bargaining negotiations for one year; the
 latter order was allowed to lapse in 1985 but the wage freeze
 was extended. On November 1, the new Government ordered
 specified wage cuts for all employees in government ministries
 and bodies, government-owned companies, and educational
 institutions without regard to preexisting contracts, and
 without effective consultation with the affected trade
 unions. The pay cuts were extended into the private sector
 following government consultations with the Nigeria Labour
 Congress (NLC) on November 22. The Government also set up a
 tripartite committee of government, private sector employers,
 and the NLC to consult on future emergency economic measures,
 and a decree issued on November 11, the National Economic
 Emergency Decree, grants the Government broad authority until
 December 1986 to issue orders pertaining to "labour matters
 generally," including issues pertaining to trade disputes.
 Industrial disputes ordinarily are governed by the 1976 Trade
 Disputes Decree, which provides for various conciliation and
 mediation measures by an industrial arbitration panel and a
 national industrial court. Strikes and lockouts are forbidden
 while disputes are under consideration by these bodies. In
 theory this means that most strikes are illegal, but in
 practice government intervention has varied widely. In
 previous years, several hundred work stoppages annually were
 the norm, whereas only 69 occurred between May 1984 and May
 1985. This sharp reduction reflected both the weakened
 bargaining position of unions during depressed economic
 conditions and the impact of warnings by the ousted government
 that it would not tolerate industrial indiscipline.
 
 
 244
 NIGERIA
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Constitutional provisions of freedom of religion, religious
 practice, and religious education are generally respected
 throughout the country. There are reports of harassment of
 Christians by state officials in the Muslim North in the form
 of excessive bureaucratic requirements for church construction
 projects and occasional refusal of permission to build. There
 are no restrictions on numbers of clergy trained nor on
 contacts with coreligionists in other countries. Religious
 travel, including the Hajj, is permitted and in some cases
 officially supported. Missionaries and foreign clergy are
 permitted to enter Nigeria but their activities are not
 encouraged. In June, the federal Government issued a decree
 requiring licensing of religious services outside churches and
 mosques.
 Nigeria's population is approximately one-half Muslim and more
 than one-third Christian, with the remainder being mostly
 adherents of traditional beliefs. Interreligious marriages
 occur frequently. Islam and Christianity compete for converts
 and influence throughout much of the country, especially in
 the belt of states between the predominantly Muslim North and
 the predominantly Christian South. Polarization between
 Christian and Islamic communities most often occurs where a
 "religious difference" is associated with geographic or ethnic
 differences. There were no reports of incidents between the
 two communities in 1985. Despite the religious dominance of
 Islam and Christianity, non-Muslim/non-Christian minority
 communities generally live under peaceful conditions
 throughout the country.
 The 1982 ban on the Muslim Maitatsine sect remains in effect.
 The group still exists, however, and was behind the April 1985
 disturbances in the northern town of Gombe. Police moved
 against the rioters, who had threatened to set Gombe on fire
 unless their leader was released, and killed an estimated 100
 people, about half of them Maitatsine followers. An almost
 equal number were reportedly killed indiscriminately by the
 rioters themselves. While Nigeria's Constitution prohibits
 "secret societies," the restrictions against the Muslim
 Maitatsine sect represent the only publicized example of
 proscription of a religious sect in Nigeria.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Nigeria's Constitution entitles citizens "to move freely
 throughout Nigeria and to reside in any part thereof." The
 same provision states that "no citizen of Nigeria shall be
 expelled from Nigeria or refused entry thereto or exit
 therefrom." In general, these provisions have been observed.
 Some of the detainees released in 1985, however, must report
 periodically to the Nigerian Security Organization. Police
 checks on streets and highways impede but do not prevent
 travel.
 The ease of foreign travel has been affected by stringent
 government restrictions on the amount of Nigerian currency
 that may be converted for use outside the country and by the
 fact that Nigeria's land borders have been closed since April
 1984. In January, the government lifted restrictions limiting
 new passports to students or to persons going abroad for
 official business or emergency medical treatment. At the same
 
 
 NIGERIA
 time it reduced the validity of newly issued passports from
 five to two years. In June, the previous government issued a
 decree authorizing the Minister of Internal Affairs to cancel
 any passport for specific reasons including the "public
 interest." There are no reports that this decree has been
 applied. Nigerians continue to travel abroad in large numbers
 and many thousands are studying abroad. Exit visas are not
 required to leave the country.
 There has been no forced resettlement of Nigerian citizens,
 but there was a mass expulsion of foreign citizens in 1985.
 In mid-March, the government ordered illegal aliens to
 regularize their status or leave the country by May 10. As in
 1983, the government cited illegal employment of aliens and
 the high crime rate as reasons for the measure. An estimated
 700,000 persons were affected, and, according to the Ministry
 of the Interior, more than half of this number actually left.
 To facilitate the movement of the aliens, Nigeria opened its
 land borders for one week. Lengthy administrative procedures,
 lack of coordination with neighboring countries, and
 inadequate transport resulted in an estimated 25,000 persons
 being caught without adequate food, water, shelter, or
 sanitary facilities at the Benin-Nigerian border when it
 closed again May 10. According to press accounts, several
 aliens were killed when the police moved in to quell a riot at
 the border camp before the aliens were moved to the Lagos
 airport transit camp. The government denied that any deaths
 had occurred.
 The previous government's expulsion order did not pertain to
 an estimated 240,000 persons who had moved into northern
 Nigeria to escape the effects of the severe Sahelian drought
 in Chad and Niger. Nor did the measure affect bona fide
 refugees. Nigerian law and practice permit temporary refuge
 and asylum in Nigeria for political refugees from other
 countries. Nigeria supports and cooperates with the work of
 the Lagos office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees.
 No known penalties have been levied on Nigerians who have
 emigrated, settled abroad, or acquired another nationality.
 However, Nigeria does not recognize dual nationality, and
 naturalization in another country does not release Nigerians
 from Nigerian laws.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Armed Forces Ruling Council (AFRC), a 28-member group of
 military officers headed by President Babangida, is the
 highest political authority in Nigeria and the principal
 decisionmaking body in the Government. It replaced the
 defunct Supreme Military Council (SMC) of the overthrown
 government. There is no legislative body, and political
 parties are prohibited. The AFRC promulgates all laws by
 decree, and all decrees are exempt frcem challenge in any court
 of law. The President appoints a ff.:eral cabinet, currently
 comprised of 22 military and civilian ministers in almost
 equal numbers, which presides over the executive departments.
 Military governors head the 19 state governments. Each state
 has an executive council of military and police officers and
 some civilian commissioners. Together with the President, the
 19 state governors constitute a National Council of States.
 
 
 246
 NIGERIA
 The new Government announced in October that in 1986 it would
 present a political plan for the future governance of the
 country, but it has made no explicit statements about
 returning Nigeria to civilian rule or holding elections within
 a multiparty framework as occurred in 1979 and 1983.
 Although no formal political structures exist to allow popular
 input into political decisionmaking, the new Government has
 stated that it intends to govern in the interest of the people
 and has taken steps to solicit popular opinion on crucial
 issues. For example, the Government threw open to public
 debate the question of whether Nigeria should accept an
 International Monetary Fund (IMF) stabilization agreement.
 The public debate was conducted primarily in the media, in
 forums of Nigeria's multitude of professional organizations
 and associations, and before a specially constituted
 government panel. Nigeria's foreign policy and its future
 political system will be debated in a similar manner in 1986.
 The composition of the current Government reflects greater
 ethnic and religious diversity than any government in the
 recent past. However, there are currently no women on the
 AFRC or in the federal cabinet, although some women serve as
 commissioners in state governments.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigations of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Even during a period which has seen the suspension of
 democratic government and the conduct of extrajudicial trials
 held in secret, Nigeria remained a relatively open society.
 Amnesty International maintains an office in Lagos and
 circulates a monthly newsletter. Its annual human rights
 reports receive prominent coverage in the press, including its
 1985 report.
 The human rights committee of the Nigerian Bar Association
 (NBA) monitors the domestic human rights situation and has
 consistently gone on record against human rights abuses. It
 spoke out against the creation of military and special
 tribunals to try civilians, criticizing their composition and
 their secrecy, and has called on NBA members to boycott those
 trials chaired by military men instead of trained judges. The
 Government has not taken action against the organization for
 this stand. In fact, the newly appointed Attorney General and
 Minister of Justice is the ex-chairman of the NBA human rights
 committee.
 The Amnesty International 1985 report (covering 1984) inter
 alia expressed concern that political prisoners were tried by
 tribunals using procedures which fell short of internationally
 recognized standards. It also noted that many of the 111 or
 more people executed in 1984 had been convicted by tribunals
 which did not permit any judicial appeal. Freedom House rates
 Nigeria "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Nigeria's population is estimated at 100 million. With 47
 percent of the population currently under 15 years of age and
 an estimated growth rate of 3.2 percent per year, the total
 population may double within the next 20 years. The World
 Bank estimated 1983 per capita gross national product (GNP) at
 
 
 247
 NIGERIA
 $770. This is a drop of almost $100 from 1982, reflecting the
 general economic downturn and population increases. The
 figure has probably continued to decline. The per capita GNP
 figure can also be misleading, as oil exports account for most
 of the country's revenue, and a large part of the rural
 population is only marginally involved in Nigeria's cash
 economy.
 In the past three years, Nigerians have had to adjust to
 reduced petroleum revenues, steep inflation, and a decline in
 economic activity. Particularly affected has been the
 capital, Lagos, where inadequate facilities for water,
 electricity, housing, and other services have been
 overwhelmed. Poor urban dwellers face high unemployment,
 squalid living conditions, rising costs, and serious crime.
 Nevertheless, the fruits of development, such as road
 networks, public health facilities, public school systems,
 airports, electrification, and mass communications, are more
 accessible to urban dwellers than to the rural majority who
 are still dependent on agricultural production.
 There is virtually no starvation in Nigeria. Although
 economic difficulties continue to create periodic shortages of
 imported foodstuffs, good rains in 1985 are likely to produce
 bumper crops in some areas following several years of poor
 harvests. The World Bank estimates that the average Nigerian
 receives 98 percent of daily nutritional requirements.
 Nevertheless, as in most developing countries, the possibility
 of malnutrition still exists and was reported in northern
 Nigeria before the harvest. Life expectancy at birth is 50
 years, while infant mortality is estimated by the World Bank
 at 135 per 1,000 live births. The adult literacy rate was
 estimated at 34 percent in 1980. The World Bank estimated
 that primary school enrollment in 1979 was 88 percent of the
 relevant age group.
 A 1984 decision to reduce the number of educational facilities
 at all levels and to impose fees and abolish subsidies at some
 levels is also reflective of the policy of the new
 Government. Five federal universities and all private
 universities have been closed while plans for additional state
 universities have been dropped. Many primary and secondary
 schools have been closed or merged, while polytechnical
 colleges have been reduced in number. Almost all states
 require school fees for secondary school students, and federal
 subsidies for room and board have been abolished. It is too
 soon to tell whether these measures have had any significant
 impact on enrollment figures.
 The 1974 labor decree forbids industrial and commercial
 employment of children under 15, and restricts other child
 labor to home-based agricultural or domestic work. The decree
 also provides a number of special health and safety provisions
 to protect young and female, workers, in addition to general
 provisions with respect to hours of work and occupational
 health and safety. It allows the apprenticeship of youth
 13-15 under specified conditions, including a written contract
 approved by a government labor officer.
 Normal working hours in. commerce and industry are 40 hours
 weekly, with 2 to 4 weeks annual leave. Nigeria's minimum
 hourly wage for commerce and industry is about $1.40, one of
 the highest in Africa. Employers must compensate injured
 workers and dependent survivors of those fatally injured in
 
 
 248
 NIGERIA
 industrial accidents. The 1974 Labor Decree and the Factories
 Act provide for government establishment and enforcement of
 occupational health and safety standards under the Ministry of
 Employment, Labour, and Productivity.
 Women in Nigeria have always had economic power and have
 exerted influence in the society through women's councils or
 through their family 1onnections. There has been a dramatic
 increase in the number of women who have university degrees
 and who have become professionals, including teachers,
 lawyers, doctors, judges, senior government officials, media
 figures, and business executives. The new Government has
 named the first woman Vice Chancellor of one of the country's
 universities. But the status of women remains ambiguous.
 Despite a degree of economic independence, women suffer'legal
 discrimination, experience social inferiority, have virtually
 no representation in the political arena, and are commonly
 discriminated against in employment. The pattern and specific
 features of discrimination against women vary according to the
 ethnic and religious diversity of Nigeria's vast population.
 In some states husbands can prevent their wives from obtaining
 employment or passports. In many states a widow cannot
 inherit her husband's property, which in the absence of
 children usually reverts to the husband's family. Women do
 not receive equal pay for equal work. Male professionals
 receive fringe benefits not extended to their female
 counterparts. Female circumcision, which has never become a
 major public issue, is still practiced in many areas.
 There is no systematic discrimination among Nigeria's diverse
 ethnic and religious groups, although tensions among them do
 exist and tradition imposes considerable pressure on
 individual government officials to favor members of their own
 ethnic, regional, or religious group. Laws do not favor one
 group over another. To the contrary, there is generally a
 conscious effort to strike a balance among different groups in
 key governmental positions and decisions.
