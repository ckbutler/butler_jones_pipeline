 SOUTH AFRICA
 South Africa's governing institutions and society continued to consolidate the
 democratic transformation initiated by the historic 1994 elections. The Government
 comprises ministers from the African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom
 Party (IFP).With the June 1996 withdrawal of the National Party (NP) from the
 Government of National Unity, the Parliament took on a more central role in na-
 tional debate. In addition to the 3 major parties, the 400-member National Assem-
 bly includes the Democratic Party (DP), the Freedom Front (FF), the, Pan Africanist
 Congress (PAC), and the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP). The new Con-
 stitution came into effect in February. The judiciary, including the Constitutional
 Court, is independent.
 The South African Police Service (SAPS) has primary responsibility for internal
 -security, although the Government continues to call on the South African National
 Defense Force '(SANDF)-to provide support for the SAPS in internal security situa-
 tions. The SAPS continued its major restructuring and transformation from a pri-
 
 
 317
 marily public order security force largely dedicated to enforcing apartheid laws, to
 a more accountable, community service oriented police force. The SANDF and the
 newly created SAPS border control and policing unit share responsibility for exter-
 nal security. The civilian authorities maintain effective control of the security forces.
 However, some members of these forces committed human rights abuses.
 South Africa has a diversified and productive economy whose mainstays are man-
 ufacturing, mining, and agriculture (augmented by service support industries),
 which make up 24 percent, 8 percent, and 5 percent, respectively, of the country's
 GDP of $126.3 billion (543 billion Rand). Ownership of wealth remains highly
 skewed. Officially, unemployment is just under 30 percent, although large numbers
 of people, particularly blacks, are employed informally in retail or small-scale manu-
 facturing operations. The economy is driven largely by market forces, although a
 few key industries remain tightly controlled, including power generation, petroleum,
 and mining. The Government's "Growth, Employment and Redistribution" macro-
 economic proam provides a framework for economic restructuring to achieve en-
 hanced growth. The numerous social and economic problems that developed largely
 during the apartheid era are expected to persist for many years.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, and the
 laws and newly independent judiciary provided an effective means of dealing with
 instances of individual abuses. However, problems remain in several areas. Some
 members of the security forces committed human rights abuses, including torture,
 excessive use of force during arrest, and other physical abuse. Deaths in police cus-
 tody and as a result of excessive force remained problems. The Government has
 taken action to investigate and punish some of those involved. In April the Govern-
 ment established an Independent Complaints Directorate to investigate deaths in
 police custody and deaths as a result of police action. Prisons are seriously over-
 crowded. The judiciary is overburdened, and lengthy delays in trials are a problem.
 Discrimination against women and the disabled continued. Violence against women
 and children remained a serious problem. There were hundreds of political and
 extrajudicial killings, and political violence remained at about the same level as in
 the previous year, both in KwaZulu/Natal and countrywide. Vigilante action and
 mob justice remained a problem.
 The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), created to investigate apartheid-
 era human rights abuses, make recommendations for reparations for victims, and
 grant amnesty for full disclosure of politically motivated crimes, completed its
 human rights hearings by the end of the year and increased its focus on adjudicat-
 ing the more than 7,000 amnesty applications received by the Commission. Steps
 were taken to extend both the period covered by the amnesty and the amnesty ap-
 plication deadline. Parliament continued to revise or repeal discriminatory legisla-
 tion and to bring other laws into line with the new Constitution. For example, laws
 which establish racial equality in the provision of child-maintenance grants, provide
 security against eviction for long-time occupants of rural land, and officially repeal
 the death penalty were passed during the year.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Police use of excessive force during
 apprehensions resulted in numerous deaths, and deaths in police custody remain a
 problem. In April the Government established an Independent Complaints Direc-
 torate (lCD) to investigate deaths in police custody and deaths as a result of police
 action. In November the ICD reported 441 deaths as a result of police action. Of
 these deaths, 428 occurred while in police custody, and 13 occurred as a result of
 police action. These figures represented a dramatic increase over the estimated 1996
 number of deaths in police custody (32 for the year). The increase may be due to
 new statutory requirements for the SAPS to report all such cases to the ICD. The
 ICD's report lists the subcategories under deaths in police custody to include natu-
 ral causes, suicide, injuries in custody, injuries prior to custody, and possible neg-
 ligence. The vast majority of deaths that occurred as a result of police action in-
 volved shootings by the police during the course of arrest.  -
 The two nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) that follow, political and
 extrajudicial deaths in South Africa showed different trends in their figures for
 1997. The Human Rights Committee (HRC) reported that political violence resulted
 in 1,228 deaths from January to November. The South Africa Institute for Race Re-
 lations (SAIRR) reported 425 politically motivated killings during the first 11
 months of 1997, compared with 683 for the same period in 1996.
 The peaceprocess continued in KwaZulu-Natal. A special provincial bilateral IFP-
 ANC Peace Committee met regularly, seeking a settlement that would end political
 
 
 318
 violence. The IFP and the ANC, as the parties with the largest numbers in the pro-
 vincial Parliament, had the majority of the members on the Portfolio Committee on
 Safety and Security that intervened regularly at scenes of potential conflict to facili-
 tate peaceful solutions.
 Political killings in KwaZulu-Natal remained a major problem and were persistent
 in certain areas. For example: on July 22, five ANC activists, including two who had
 been elected to the city council less than 24 hours before, were killed in a late night
 raid on their dwelling near the town of Richmond. On January 3, four people were
 killed in a massacre in the southern part of the province and an IFP leader who
 was a key figure in the Midlands peace process was killed. Shootings and killings
 continued sporadically through the year near Inchanga, halfway between Durban
 and Pietermaritzburg. The build-up of a large police and military presence in the
 region had a stabilizing effect, resulting in a quiet end to a very violent 1997.
 Charges against the six accused murderers of Zulu princess Nonhlanhla were with-
 drawn by the provincial attorney general after three witnesses were killed. The at-
 torney general cited lack of evidence as the reason for the release of the accused.
 Police apprehended two suspects in connection with three January bombings near
 the northwest province town of Rustenberg. The bombs, which wounded two individ-
 uals, struck a mosque, a post office and a general store. Their cases have not yet
 been tried.
 Vigilante action and mob justice remained problems . . . People Against Gang-
 sterism and Drugs (PAGAD), a self-proclaimed Islamic-oriented community-based
 organization calling for stronger action by the Government and police against crime
 and drugs, continued to engage in acts of intimidation and violence against sus-
 pected drug dealers and gang leaders. Vigilante violence pitting supporters of
 PAGAD against dg-dealing gangsters in Cape Town continued in 1997. PAGAD's
 earlier tactics of mob justice and mass marches gave way to almost weekly drive-
 by shootings and gasoline-bomb attacks on homes of suspected drug dealers.
 PAGAD supporters were also the victims of alleged gangster reprisal. Approximately
 17 people were reported killed and 60 were reported wounded in more than 159
 PAGAD-gang clashes during the year, including 13 pipe bomb attacks in the month
 of November alone. Some of these incidents, however, were likely intergang, or
 PAGAD factional violence. Police made only limited progress in bringing the per-
 petrators of this violence to justice. In October three men were charged with eight
 offenses, including murder, for the Worcester bombings. All were sentenced to 4 life
 terms plus 88 years.
 There were occasional reports of killings linked to the continued practice of witch-
 craft in some rural areas. In the Northern province, where traditional beliefs re-
 garding witchcraft remain strong, officials reported dozens of killings of people sus-
 pected of witchcraft. The Government has instituted educational programs to pre-
 vent such actions.
 Police arrested five individuals, including three escaped rightist terrorists, sus-
 pected of having perpetrated the Christmas Eve 1996 bombing in the western Cape
 town of Worcester that resulted in four deaths. Their cases have not yet been tried.
 No charges have been filed to date in the case of the 1994 killing of former Dutch
 Reformed Church Moderator Johan Heyns; this situation is unlikely to change. Dur-
 ing the bail hearing of an unrelated case in October, information came to light that
 Mr. Terence Psarrakis, the late business partner of brothel owner Johan
 Badenhorst, hired an assassin to kill Professor Johan Heyns. The investigation into
 the new allegations is continuing. At this point, it appears that the killing may not
 have been politically motivated.
 The TRCs investigative unit continued to pursue a number of cases of alleged po-
 litical or extrajudicial killings committed in previous years that have been brought
 to its attention through TRC hearings. Testimony was heard during amnesty or spe-
 cial events hearings on a number of these high-profile killings, including the 1993
 assassination of South African Communist Party (SACP) leader Chris Hani, the
 1977 torture and murder of Black Consciousness leader Steve Biko, and the 1989
 killing of 14-year-old activist Stompie Seipei. By year's end, no findings had been
 made by the TRC in these cases.
 In August three of the four men arrested for the 1981 murder of Durban attorney
 Griffiths Mxenge, including the leader of the attack, Dirk Coetzee, were granted am-
 nesty by the TRC. The fourth, former security policeman Joe Mamasela, became a
 witness for the State and expects to receive immunity from prosecution.
 The amnesty application of retired SAP Colonel Eugene de Kock has not yet been
 adjudicated. De Kock was found guilty on 89 charges, including6 counts of murder,
 and sentenced in October 1996 to 2 life sentences plus an additional 212 years' im-
 prisonment.

 b. Disappearance.-There were no new reports of politically motivated disappear-
 ances caused by government authorities or agents. Starting in April 1996, the TRC
 heard public testimony regarding numerous politically motivated disappearances be-
 tween 1960 and 1993. Investigations into a number of these disappearances were
 subsequently begun by the TRC's investigative unit, as well as by the relevant pro-
 vincial attorney general in some cases. As a result, a number of victims, mostly ex-
 ldieration movement soldiers, had been located and their bodies exhumed by year's
 end.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution's Bill of Rights provides for the right not to be tortured, to be free
 from all forms of violence from either public or private sources, and the right not
 to be treated or punished in a cruel, inhuman, or degrading way. However, police
 tortured and otherwise abused suspects and detainees including, beatings, suffo-
 cation with rubber tubing, electric shock, and rape. Broad efforts to reform police
 practices have substantially reduced such activities, and the ICD (see Section L.a.)
 investigates reports of police misconduct and corruption. Also, NGO's conducted sev-
 eral human ights education programs for the SAPS.
 The SAPS has continued to undergo sweeping, positive changes, including the in-
 stitution of reforms designed to create partnerships between local police forces and
 the communities they serve. Resignations and retirements of senior police officials
 have permitted the infusion of new personnel at senior levels, from both inside and
 outside the SAPS; these appointments have also served to further affirmative action
 within the SAPS. President Mandela appointed South African Breweries head
 Meyer Kahn as the first civilian head of the SAPS, effective on August 1, to address
 serious management problems that have inhibited transformation of the SAPS.
 Former police captain Jeffrey Benzien testified before the Truth Commission that
 he, as a member of a SAPS unit, had tortured detained antiapartheid activists.
 However, former senior government officials denied in testimony before the TRC
 that the Government had authorized or condoned the use of torture in any of its
 police units.
 Prison conditions generally meet minimum international standards; however,
 overcrowding remains a serious problem. The Government permits independent
 monitoring of prison conditions, including visits by human rights organizations.
 The year saw the commissioning in Pretoria of the first of several planned "C-
 MAX" prisons. The C-MAX prison is designed to hold South Africa's most dangerous
 criminals. Human rights groups have raised serious concerns regarding C-MAX, in-
 cluding the Government's criteria for transferring prisoners from other prisons to
 C-MAX and the restrictive, solitary conditions of the prison itself.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Bill of Rights prohibits detention
 without trial. It also provides that every detained person has the right to be in-
 formed promptly of the reasons for detention; to be informed promptly of the right
 to remain silent and the consequences of not remaining silent; to be charged within
 48 hours of arrest; to be detained in conditions of human dignity; to consult with
 legal counsel at every stage of the legal process; to communicate with relatives,
 medical practitioners, and religious counselors; and to be released with or without
 bail, unless the interests of justice require otherwise.
 Courts and police generally acted in good faith to respect these rights, although
 there was a growing problem with bringing detainees to trial. According to the HRC,
 prisoners wait on average for 6 months to be tried in the regional courts and 6
 months to 1 year in the high courts; however, in extreme cases detention can extend
 to up to 2 years. This problem is due in large measure to the overburdened judici-
 ary, which has more cases than it can handle efficiently, and insufficient staff and
 resources. New laws were passed which mandated minimum sentences and the re-
 fusal of bail in most cases for certain serious offenses. Some human rights groups
 expressed concern with parts of the new laws, saying that they would harm judicial
 independence and limit civil liberties.
 There were no reports of forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent and
 impartial judiciary subject only to the Constitution and the law, and the Govern-
 ment respects this provision in practice.
 Under the Constitution, the Constitutional Court is the highest court for inter-
 reting and deciding constitutional issues, while the Supreme Court of Appeal is the
 ighest court for interpreting and deciding nonconstitutional matters. Generally,
 cases are initially heard in magistrates courts and high courts.
 Judges try criminal cases. The jury system was abolished in 1969. The presiding
 judge or magistrate determines guilt or innocence.
 The Constitution's Bill of Rights provides for due process, including the right to
 a fair, public trial within a reasonable time of being charged and the right to appeal
 
 
 320
 to a higher court. It also gives detainees the right to state-funded legal counsel
 when "substantial injustice would otherwise result." In practice, the law functions
 as intended. A general lack of information on-the part of the accused regarding their
 rights to legal representation and the Government's inability to pay the cost of those
 rights (in a March report, Justice Minister Omar expressed concern over 35,6000
 unpaid lawyers accounts), are continuing problems.
 The Government and legal bodies have acted to redress historic racial and gender
 imbalances in the judiciary and the bar. The ranks of judges, magistrates, senior
 counsels, and attorneys are now more reflective of society, although they still fall
 far short of a representative composition.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or- Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 The Constitutional Land Court'and the Commission on Restitution of Land Rights
 were established by the 'edistribution of Land Rights Act" of November 1994. The
 Court's mission is to settle cases previously vetted and evaluated by the Commis-
 sion. Claims can only be filed for land dispossessions following promulgation of the
 Natives Land Act of 1913. The various forms of compensation offered to claimants
 are the return of the original land, deed to another piece of land, financial remu-
 neration, or preferential access to government housing. A deadline of December
 1998 was set for. receiving claims. There is no deadline for completion of the claim
 settlements, and the pace at which cases are mbving is particularly slow. Out of a
 total of 18,000 cases submitted by the end of the year, only 13 have been formally
 settled. A provision passed by, Parliament in late 1997 was aimed at speeding up
 the process of allowing out-of-court settlements negotiated' with the Ministry of
 LandAffairs.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedoms of
 speech and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. Sev-
 eral apartheid-era laws that remain in force pose a potential threat to the media.
 The me'dia offer a broad'range of news, opinion and analysis, and criticize both
 the Government and the opposition. Coverage of news and expression of opinion is
 vigorous, although some journalists believe that self-censorship is a problem. While
 the majority of professional broadcast media outlets are still state owned, their edi-
 torial independence appears genuine and the Government continued steps to end its
 monopoly over the electronic media.
 In 1997 a black-owned investment consortium acquired control of the country's
 leading black-oriented newspaper and of a major, traditionally white-oriented pub-
 lishing business, thereby making major inroads into the historic monopoly of white
 South Africans over both print and electronic media. Black South Africans are also
 gaining access to the media through community radio and in upper-level manage-
 ment positions at the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC).
 The SABC controls all free broadcast television and the majority of major radio
 outlets. The SABC was once seen as the Government's voice, but it is now in the
 midst of a historic reorganization and change of direction. Although it is still state
 owned, the SABC maintains its editorial independence from the Government. SABC
 news programming offered balanced coverage of the Government and the leading op-
 position parties.
 Although slowed by financial scandal, the Independent Broadcast-Authority (IBA)
 continued the incremental process of disassembling the Government's historic mo-
 nopoly over electronic media. During the year, the IBA began to grant licenses to
 private commercial radio broadcasters, several of which were on the air by midyear.
 The commercial stations join the approximately 70 nonprofit, community stations
 that were licensed and began broadcasting in 1995 and 1996. Although some parties
 (notably potential commercial broadcasters) have complained about the slow
 progress, the IBA's work has begun to bring real competition to the country's air-
 waves for the first time. Still pending, and behind schedule, are IBA actions to li-
 cense private commercial television stations.
 Several laws remained in effect that permit the Government to restrict the publi-
 cation of information about the police, the national defense forces, prisons, and men-
 tal institutions. Another law remains in force that could be used to compel reporters
 to reveal their sources. While these laws were not often employed, they were still
 perceived by journalists as a threat to freedom of the press. In July the Denel Cor-
 poration (a parastatal arms manufacturer) invoked an apartheid-era law in an un-
 successful attempt to stop the media from publishing the name of a potential client
 
 
 321
 state. Journalists report that police officers often threaten to invoke apirtheid-era
 laws in order to restrict coverage of crime scenes and investigations.
 The South African Board of Censors reviews and passes judgment on written and
 graphic materials published in or imported into South Africa. The Board of Censors
 has the power to edit or ban books, magazines, movies, and videos, and regularly
 exercises that power, although with restraint. A government task force, created to
 recommend means by which the Government could improve its ability to commu-
 nicate through the media, suggested that the Government reorganize its national
 communication service. The task force's report was greeted with relief by some in
 the media who feared a more sinister government desire to exercise greater control
 over the press.
 There are no official restrictions on academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice.
 The Government is a party to the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to
 the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. In 1996 the Government signed a
 Memorandum of Understanding with the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR) on standardization of regional refugee policies, which is de-
 signed to shift more responsibility for handling refugee flows onto first-asylum coun-
 tries in the region.
 The Government cooperates with the UNHCR and other humanitarian organiza-
 tions in assisting refugees. The Government provides first asylum, granting appli-
 cants the right to work and study. Over 17,000 asylum seekers were registered by
 the Government in 1997. Approximately 30 percent of applicants received refugee
 status, which confers work and study privileges, in 1997. About 70 percent of the
 thousands of illegal immigrants deported during the year came from Mozambique.
 Despite numerous procedural safeguards, energetic efforts to combat a mounting il-
 legal immigration problem occasionally resultedin wrongful deportations.
 Parliament passed an Amnesty Billin 1996 permitting certain illegal aliens who
 have lived in South Africa for 5 years or more to become legal residents. By the No-
 vembr 1996 deadline, about 200,000 individuals had applied for amnesty. Govern-
 ment amnesty statistics indicate an approval rate of approximately 50 percent. Sp-
 arate amnesty programs were instituted for mine workers and Mozambican refu-
 gees, benefiting about 350,000 people.
 Section 3. Respect for Potitical Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercised the right to change their government in 1994 elections that ob-
 servers deemed to be substantially free and fair. The new Constitution went into
 effect on February 3. Under its terms, the countiy retains a bicameral Parliament,
 an executive state presidency and an independent judiciary, including a constitu-
 tional court.
 The current 400-member National Assembly was retained under the new Con-
 stitution, although the numbor of Membrs of Parliament may be reduced to 350
 from 400 in the future. A new National Council of Provinces (NCOP), consisting of
 six permanent and four rotating delegates from each of the nine provinces, replaced
 the former Senate as the second chamber of Parliament. The NCOP, created to give
 a greater voice to provincial interests, must approve legislation that involves shared
 national/provincial competencies according to a schedule in the Constitution. An 18-
 member Council of Traditional Leaders, which the Constitution accords an advisory
 role in matters of traditional law and authority, was inaugurated on April 18.
 Two parties, the ANC and the IFP, continued to share executive power following
 the National Party's pullout from the Government of National Unity (GNU) and pro-
 vincial executives in June 1996. This arrangement is expected to continue until elec-
 tions in 1999, because the new Constitution does not provide for power sharing in
 the executive. President Nelson Mandela continued in office as Executive Head of
 State in 1997, with Thabo Mbeki as the sole Executive Deputy President. The ANC
 continued to fill 24 of the 27 cabinet positions.
 Elections for local councilors, including those in metropolitan councils, town coun-
 cils and rural councils, were completed in June. New framework legislation for local
 government was introduced in the 1997 parliamentary session.
 There are no legal impediments to women's participation in government. Over
 one-fourth of the National Assembly members are women, while in the NCOP, 8 of
 
 
 322
 the 54 permanent delegates are women. Women continued to fill approximately one-
 quarter of committee chair slots, as well as the Speaker and Deputy Speaker posi-
 tions in the National Assembly. Women hold 4 of 27 ministerial positions, as well
 as 8 of 14 deputy ministerial slots.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are generally cooperative and responsive to their views. Many organizations now
 participate in governmental bodies seeking to gather public input and to fashion
 policies related to human rights.
 Under its 1995 enabling legislation, the TRC is empowered to look into apartheid-
 era gross human rights abuses committed between 1960 and 1993; to grant amnesty
 to perpetrators of a broad range of politically-motivated crimes, and to recommend
 compensation for victims of human rights abuses. The TRC continued to operate
 freely throughout its second year. The TRO was scheduled to submit its final report
 by March 1998. However, due to the volume of work, an extension was approved
 authorizing the TRC to continue operations through April 30, 1998, and. to submit
 its report to President Mandela by July 31, 1998. The TRC's Amnesty Committee
 was authorized to continue its work through June 30, 1998. Extensions were also
 approved for the period for which amnesty could be granted (through May 10, 1994)
 and for the period during which amnesty applications could be submitted (through
 'September 30, 1997). More than 7,000 applications-had been received by that date.
 In addition, to the- continuation of human rights hearings, the TRC heard testi-
 mony in 1997 from political parties, the legal and medical professions, the media,
 -religious organizations, -and others about their respective roles during the apartheid
 era.-,In, September the TRC served subpoenas on 20individuals, including former
 'South Africa defense force and police service officials and military commanders of
 both the PAC and ANC, to testify about the roles of armed forces and the State Se-
 curity Council. A number of these officials testified voluntarily.
 In hearings before the Commission, both senior former government and liberation
 movement representatives conceded that human rights abuses had been committed
 by individuals acting on their-own, but they denied that abuses had been authorized
 at the highest levels. A number of former government officials, notably former cabi-
 net members 1Pik Botha, Roelf Meyer, and Leon Wessels, acknowledged that senior
 officials should have done more to be aware of and curb these abuses.
 Former state president P.W. Botha failed to respond to two TRC subpoenas to ap-
 pear before the Commission, stating that TRC concerns would be addressed in his
 written submission.
 A number of parties complained of'political bias by the Commission. The IFP for-
 mally withdrew its cooperation from the Commission in- midyear although individual
 IFP members did submit statements to the TRC. In September the National Party
 settled out-of-court a dispute over allegedly biased comments made by TRC officials
 following the submission of testimony by former state president, F.W. de Klerk. De-
 spite these incidents, TRC officials continued to stress that the Commission's man-
 date was to investigate human rights abuses committed by all parties, and that all
 parties are bound by the legislation's amnesty provisions.
 � To date, amnesty has been granted to a range of applicants, including former
 members of the ANC and PAC armed wings, to former security force officials, as
 well as to members of conservative xightwing groups, including the Afrikaner
 Weerstandbeweging (AWB).- More, than 1,500 applications for amnesty had been
 turned down by midyear, including both ANC and former security force members,
 the majority of these because the act in question was determined not to have had
 a political objective.
 Many of the more high-profile amnesty cases, including the murders of SACP
 leader Chris Hani and U.S. student Amy Biehl and the bombings of Khotso house
 and COSATU house, had not been adjudicated by year's end. Both the NP and the
 Democratic Party challenged the decision in November by the TRC's Amnesty Com-
 mittee to grant amnesty to 37 former liberation movement members, many of whom
 are currently senior government officials. At year's end, the TRC was reviewing
 legal counselon whether or not to request judicial review of the Amnesty Commit-
 tee's decision in that regard.
 The TRC also announced a reparations policy for victims of human rights abuses
 and submitted proposals to the Cabinet. Details of implementation and funding
 were still under consideration by year's end.
 The government-created Human Rights Commission is tasked with promoting the
 observance of fundamental human rights at all levels of government and throughout
 
 
 the general population. The Commission also has the power to conduct investiga-
 tions, issue subpoenas, and hear testimony under oath. While commissioners were
 named in late 1995, the Commission's powers were not formally determined until
 May 1996. Its operations have been hampered by red tape, budgetary concerns, the
 absence of civil liberties le *slation, several high-level staff resignations, and con-
 cerns about the Commission s broad interpretation of its mandate.
 The Office of the Public Protector functioned throughout the year. Its role is to
 investigate abuse and mismanagement by the Government. The Office faces severe
 resource constraints, as the number of complaints continues to increase. In its high-
 est profile case, the public protectorate examined the leak of matriculation examina-
 tions in 1996. These examinations are given during the final year of secondary edu-
 cation as a prerequisite for university admittance. The Office prepared a follow-up
 report on the irregular funding of the AIDS-education play "Sarafina If." In 1996
 the Government had indicated that it would accept the recommendations of the in-
 quiry, some of which were critical of government action.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on grounds of race, sex, religion, disabil-
 ity, ethnic or social origin, color, age, culture, an age, sex, pregnancy, or marital
 status. Legal recourse is available to those who believe they have been discrimi-
 nated against, but entrenched attitudes and practices, as well as limited resources,
 limit the practical effect of these protections.
 Women.-There is a high rate of violence against women. Newspapers report that
 every 6 days a woman is killed by her husband or boyfriend . According to a 1996
 study conducted by the NGO People Opposing Women Abuse, the figures for re-
 ported rape have risen consistently each year, from 32,000 cases in 1994 to nearly
 37,000 in 1995. According to government statistics, 50,481 rapes were reported in
 1996 (the last year for which figures are available), resulting in 4,100 convictions.
 Police sources believe that a majority of rapes are unreported.
 The Prevention of Family Violence Act of 1993 defines marital rape as a criminal
 offense, and it allows women to obtain injunctions against their abusive husbands
 and partners in a-simpler, cheaper, and more effective manner than under previous
 legislation. However, the implementation process is inadequate as the police are
 generally unwilling to enforce this act. As a consequence, a limited number of
 women pressed complaints under the law, despite government and NGO efforts to
 increase public awareness of it.
 Given the high incidence of violence against women, the Government pledged in
 1995 to establish centers for battered women. By mid-year a few government grants
 to NGO's to open shelters had been authorized; however, other NGO-sponsored shel-
 ters were facing closure or cutbacks due to lack of donor funding. The SAPS created
 new police units in 1996 dealing specifically with domestic violence, child protection,
 and sexual violence, which are intended in part to increase victims' confidence in
 the police, resulting in more victims coming forward to report such crimes. In July
 the TRC conducted a special hearing on abuses suffered by women under apartheid.
 Discrimination against women remains a serious problem despite legal and con-
 stitutional advances and government attention. For example, the Constitution pro-
 vides for "customary law" to be enforced "when applicable," subject to constitutional
 provisions. Under some of these laws, women were prevented from owning land and
 inheriting property. The new Interim Protection of Informal Land Rights Act pro-
 tects persons who have insecure and informal rights and interests in land; many
 women are in this category. Some steps were taken to achieve greater economic ad-
 vancement for women, such as establishing an investment fund.
 The Office on the Status of Women, which was established in 1996 and is located
 in the Deputy President's Office, is intended to coordinate gender desks in each de-
 partment. These desks are charged with reviewing department policy and develop-
 ing strategies to ensure integration of gender concerns in policy and planning. They
 also undertake investigations of reported gender discrimination.
 The 1996 Commission on Gender Equality Act established a government body to
 promote gender equality and to advise and make recommendations to Parliament
 on any legislation affecting women. The legislation gives the Commission authority
 to investigate allegations of gender discrimination, including the power of "search
 and seizure." In early 1997, after consultation with Parliament, the President
 named the 12 members of the Commission. Operations began in March, despite a
 first-year budget that failed even to cover commissioners' salaries. In August the
 Commission issued its first report stating that the structures established to protect
 women's rights were "fragile" and lacked resources.

 The Women's National Coalition (formed in 1994) includes more than 90 women's
 groups from labor, political parties, religious groups, trade unions, cultural and so-
 cial interest groups, and business and prfessional bodies.
 Polygyny continues to be practiced by several ethnic groups. However, generally
 only the first marriage is registered under civil law; subsequent marriages are con-
 ducted under traditional rites. Exacting a bride price ("loboa is also a traditional
 practice of some ethnic groups.
 Children.-The Constitution stipulates that children have the, right "to security,
 education, basic nutrition, and basic health and social services. The Government
 remains firm in its commitment to provide these services, and has made some
 progress toward developing the mechanisms for delivering them. However, the de-
 mand for such services far outstrips the resources currently available.
 The Schools Bill, passed by Parliament in 1996, aims to achieve greater edu-
 cational opportunities for black children. It mandates compulsory education from
 ages 7 to 15 a single syllabus, and more equitable funding. The Government is de-
 ploying teaciers from predominantly white to predominantly black schools in order
 to reduce student/teacher ratios in disadvantaged schools, and to redistribute fund-
 ing from relatively rich to relatively poor school districts. Student populations on
 university campuses are becoming more representative of the country's racial pro-
 file, with previously all-white universities reaching out to recruit students from
 black and colored townships.
 Social programs known as "Presidential Initiatives," which were included in the
 former Reconstruction and Development Program, continue to receive government
 . support. These initiatives.offer free health care to pregnant women and to children
 under 6 years of age, and provide nutritious meals tor primary school children.
 Violence against children remains widespread. Reported cases increased 65 per-
 cent between 1993 and 1995.
 The increase- in. reported cases can be attributed to the creation of special units
 to deal with these crimes, growing emphasis on children's rights, and increased at-
 tention to the problem by the public and the media. However, a lack of coordinated
 and comprehensive strategies to deal with such crimes continues to impede the de-
 livery of needed services to young victims. The murder in July of a 7-year-old girl,
 allegedly at the hands of the man who was out on bail for raping her, shocked the
 nation and highlighted the need for greater government attention to violence
 -against children. The South African Law Commission reported in August that few
 abusers are convicted and that laws dealing with child abuse are largely "ineffec-
 tive."
 Child prostitution is on the rise, primarily in Cape Town, Durban, and Johannes-
 burg. An increase in the number of children living on the streets has contributed
 to the growing number of child prostitutes. The child sex industry has become in-
 creasingly organized, with children either being forced into prostitution or exploited
 -by their parents to earn money for the family.
 Female genital mutilation, which is widely condemned by international health ex-
 perts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is traditionally prac-
 ticed in some remote areas, although it is not thought to be widespread. Traditional
 circumcision of teenage boys results in the hospitalization, mutilation, or even death
 of several youths each year.
 The law permits detention of 14- to 18-year-old juveniles awaiting trial for serious
 crimes such as rape and murder. The number of such juveniles in detention in-
 creased from 2,013 in 1995 to 3,962 in April. In August 1996, Correctional Services
 Minister Sipo Mzimela initiated a national debate on the incarceration of juveniles
 by claiming that 62 percent of the 398 juveniles awaiting trial in top security jails-
 some as young as 12 years--should not be there because they were being tried on
 relatively minor charges. South African law states that any child under the age of
 14 must be released within 24 hours into the custody of a parent or guardian when
 possible. In prior years, this law caused great strains in provincial shelters or re-
 sulted in children running away from pretrial care, usually back to the streets and
 the drugs and crime. In 1997 the Government built the first of at least five planned
 "places of safety." These special shelters protect children as they await trial and en-
 sure that they do not run away before their day in court.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis
 of disability. Society continues to promote an increasingly modern concept of people
 with disabilities as a minority whose civil rights must be protected. The Govern-
 ment attempts to ensure that all government-funded projects take account of the
 needs of disabled citizens. However, in practice, government and private sector dis-
 crimination in employment of the disabled still exists. According to the Affirmative
 Action Monitor, fewer than two-thirds of companies target the disabled as part of
 their affirmative action programs. The law mandates access to buildings for people
 
 
 with disabilities, but such regulations have rarely been enforced and until recently,
 public awareness of them was virtually nonexistent. The National Environmental
 Accessibility program, an NGO comprising disabled consumers as well as service
 providers, has established a presence in all nine provinces in order to lobby for com-
 pliance with the regulations and to sue offending property owners when necessary.
 Indigenous People.-The Constitution provides for the recognition of "the institu-
 tion, status, and role of traditional leadership," and requires the courts to "apply
 customary law when that is applicable, subject to the Constitution and any legisla-
 tion that specifically deals with customary law."
 The Constitution further permits legislation for the establishment of provincial
 Houses of Traditional Leaders and a National Council of Traditional Leaders, to
 deal with matters relating to traditional leadership, the role of traditional leaders,
 indigenous and customary law, and the customs of communities observing a system
 of customary law. By midyear, six provinces had established Houses of Traditional
 Leaders. Under the terms of the Constitution and new implementing legislation, the
 National Council of Traditional Leaders was inaugurated on April 18. The Council
 is to advise the Government on matters related to traditional authorities and cus-
 tomary law.
 Nationall/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Constitution and Bill of Rights prohibit
 discrimination on the basis of race, ethnic or social origin, and culture. The Govern-
 ment has begun reorganizing and redesigning the educational, housing, and health
 care systems to benefit all racial and ethnic groups in society more equally. The
 public and private sectors continue to pursue affirmative action programs, which are
 permitted under the terms of the Constitution. The Government has instituted an
 effective affirmative action program, and has strongly encouraged private firms to
 do so. According to a 1998 Department of Labor survey, 82 percent of private sector
 firms have instituted affirmative action programs.
 According to Affirmative Action Monitor, affirmative action policies have had little
 impact on the top echelons in business. Based on the consultants' survey in 1996,
 one-third of the organizations with no programs did not intend to implement one.
 Twelve percent of the companies surveyed said that they had experienced a drop
 in standards or deterioration in quality of work due to affirmative action. However,
 the country's black majority increasingly is making inroads into the previously all-
 white entrepreneurial sector through pooled investments and acquisitions.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for freedom of association
 and the right to strike and these rights are given statutory effect-in the Labor Rela-
 tions Act (LRA) which went into effect in November 1996. All workers in the private
 sector are entitled to jon a union. Most workers in the public sector, with the excep-
 tion of members of t e South African National Defense Force, the National Intel-
 ligence Agency, and the South African Secret Service, are also entitled to join a
 union. No employee can be fired or discriminated against because of membership
 in or advocacy of a trade union. Union membership has continued to decline steadily
 in the last few years as a result of job layoffs and a fairly stagnant job creation-rate.
 According to official estimates, there are 248 registered trade unions and between
 30 and 40 unregistered trade unions, with a total approximate membership of 2.9
 million persons, about 30 percent of the formally employed, economically active pop-
 ulation. The unemployment rate by comparison is estimated at between 30 and 35
 percent.
 The largest trade union federation, the Congress of South African Trade Unions
 (COSATU), is formally aligned with the African National Congress (ANC) and the
 South African Communist party (SACP). Over 60 former COSATU members serve
 in national and provincial legislatures and administrations, and scores more entered
 local government. Its closest rival, the Federation of Unions of South Africa
 (FEDUSA), is an apolitical, multiracial federation that was formed in 1997 by merg-
 ing several smaller worker organizations. A relatively minor labor federation, the
 National Council of Trade Unions (NACTU), while officially independent of any po-
 litical grouping, has close ties to the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) and the
 Azanian Peoples Organization (AZAPO).
 The LRA seeks to create an industrial relations regime that is stable and recog-
 nizes that basic worker rights need to be protected. The act protects workers against
 unfair dismissal, recognizes their right to form trade unions, enshrines the right to
 strike, and establishes a simple set of procedures that protect striking workers from
 the threat of dismissal. Essentially, for a strike to proceed, all that is required is
 that a dispute be referred for conciliation. If conciliation fails to resolve the dispute,
 then a trade union is entitled to advise an employer of an intent to strike. Such
 a strike is not liable to criminal or civil action. Organized labor also has the right
 
 
 326
 to engage in "socioeconomic protest," whereby workers can demonstrate, without
 fear of losing their jobs, in furtherance of broader social issues. The LRA also allows
 employers to hire replacement labor for striking employees, but only after giving 7
 days' notice to the striking trade union. Employers have the right to lock out work-
 ers if certain conditions are met.
 The LRA applies to public sector as well as private sector workers. Public sector
 employees, with the exception of essential services and the three components of the
 security services, are also provided with the right to strike. While this right was
 first asserted in the Public Sector Labor Relations Act of 1993, the LRA simplifies
 and rationalizes collective bargaining in the public sector and the resort to indus-
 trial action.
 The Government does not restrict union affiliation with regional or international
 labor organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law defines and protects
 the rights to organize and bargain collectively. The Government does not interfere
 with union organizing and generally has not interfered in the collective bargaining
 process. The RA statutorily entrenches "organizational rights," such as trade union
 access to worksites, deductions for trade union subscriptions, and leave for trade
 union officials, which strengthen the ability of trade unions to organize workers.
 Union participation as an equal partner with business and government in the Na-
 tional Economic Development and Labor Council (NEDIAC), a tripartite negotiating
 forum, ensures a direct voice for labor in the formulation of economic, social, and
 labor policy.
 The LRA allows for the establishment of workplace forums that are intended to
 promote broad-based consultation between management and labor over issues such
 as work organization, corporate downsizing, and changes in production processes.
 The forums, in order to receive statutory protection, can be established by trade
 unions in businesses with more than 100 employees only. While to date, trade
 unions in less than a handful of factories have established workplace forums, the
 intent of the law is to build wide support within the trade union movement and
 business for such cooperative workplace relationships.
 To further reduce the adversarial nature of labor relations, the LRA also created
 a Commission for Conciliation, Mediation, and Arbitration (CCMA). Since its incep-
 tion in November 1996, the CCMA has successfully resolved many disputes referred
 to it and remains critical to the emergence of a less confrontational business cli-
 mate. The CCMA is also gradually be ginning to play an interventionist role by get-
 ting involved in disputes before they deteriorate into a full-fledged strike or lockout.
 A Labor Court and a Labor Appeals Court are other important creations of the LRA.
 The labor court has jurisdiction to resolve disputes that the CCMA is unable to me-
 diate to the satisfaction of both parties. Notwithstanding the existence of the CCMA
 and specialist courts for labor disputes, the thrust of industrial relations is to mini-
 mize the need for judicial intervention in labor relations leaving it to the contending
 parties themselves to resolve disputes whenever possible.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor of either adults or
 children is illegal under the Constitution and is not practiced.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employmen.-Employ-
 meat of minors under the age of 15 is prohibited by law. However, the law gives
 discretionary powers to the Minister of Welfare to exempt certain types of work to
 allow individual employers or groups of employers to hire children under certain
 conditions (for example, on weekends and holidays when they are not in school).'
 This is common practice in the agricultural and informal sector. Child labor also is
 used in the informal economy.
 The fact that children between 15 and 18 years of age are not protected by child
 labor laws has caused some debate within the Government. Labor Director General
 Sipho Pityana stated that there were about 200,000 children working in South Afri-
 ca in 1997, some as youngdas 5 years old. This figure did not include unpaid domes-
 tic work or children working in the informal sector. Child labor figures for the infor-
 mal sector are nearly impossible to quantify, since the Government has yet to iden-
 tify the size of the informal sector's contribution to employment and the economy
 in general. The Government states a continuing commitment to abolishing child
 labor through new legislation and improving the enforcement of current child labor
 laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legally mandated national mini-
 mum wage. Instead, unionized workers in the formal sector of the economy set wage
 rates on n industry-by-industry basis via annual negotiations with employer orga-
 nizations. In those sectors where workers are not sufficiently organizet engae
 in the collective bargaining process, the Wage Act gives the Minister of Labor the
 
 
 327
 authority to set wages. The Wage Act, however, does not apply to farm laborers or
 domestic workers.
 Occupational health and safety issues are a top priority of trade unions, especially
 in the mining and heavy manufacturing industries. Although attention to these is-
 sues has increased dramatically, including passage in 1993 of the Occupational
 Health and Safety Act, the country's industrial an[ mining processes are dangerous
 and sometimes deadly. Government attempts to reduce mining fatalities culminated
 in the 1996 Mine Health and Safety Act, which went into effect in January. The
 new act provides for the right of an employee to remove himself from work deemed,
 dangerous to health and/or safety. Moreover, it establishes a tripartite Mine Health
 and Safety Council and an Inspectorate of Mine Health and Safety tasked with en-
 forcing the act and monitoring compliance with its provisions. The act specifically
 makes it an offense for a company to discriminate against an employee who asserts
 a right granted by the act (for example, to leave a hazardous work site) and requires
 mine owners to file annual reprts that provide statistics on health and safety inci-
 dents for each mine being worked.
 The Parliament passed the basic conditions of employment bill in November. This
 bill standardizes time and one-half pay for overtime, establishes a shorter 45 hour
 workweek, and longer maternity leave for women (4 months instead of 3). There
 was substantial debate over this bill, until labor and business interests agreed on
 a compromise bill that should go into effect in 1998 after ratification by the provin-
 cial governments.
