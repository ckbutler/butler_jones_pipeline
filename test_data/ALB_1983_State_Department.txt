 Albania is a small, mountainous Balkan nation of about 2.8
 million people with a history of isolation from its neighbors
 and the rest of the world. Since the end of World War I, it
 has been ruled over by a particularly harsh, pervasive Communist
 dictatorship, which, although cloaked with the forms and style
 of a "people's democratic government," is in reality ruled
 personally by the leader of the Albanian Workers' Party, Enver
 Hoxha.
 Hoxha exercises his rule through the ruling party, which
 professes a Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist ideology, and the
 Albanian Government. Together these two institutions control
 all aspects of Albanian life, severely restricting political and
 civil rights. The Hoxha regime has made xenophobia a national
 policy; most Albanians have little contact with foreigners or
 the outside world. There are persistent reports of serious
 human rights violations in Albania, but Albania's regime does
 not cooperate with any of the humanitarian agencies concerned
 with such reports. Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment for
 political deviation seem commonplace, and there are reports of
 torture. In fact, it is widely believed that political
 conflicts within the elite have led to the extrajudicial
 execution of the vanquished leader. Albania has been proclaimed
 by its leadership to be an atheist state, and the exercise or
 advocacy of religion is severely punished. It has not signed
 the 1975 Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation
 in Europe.
 Since Albania's break with the People's Republic of China in
 1978, it has pursued a "go-it-alone" course, the result of which
 has been to continue its isolation from the outside world, to
 the detriment of the country's education, medicine, industry,
 and arts, as well as civil and political rights.
 While direct information is sketchy, there have been no
 observable improvements in Albania's human rights record or
 practices in the past year.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There is insufficient information on the possible use of killing
 by the Hoxha regime for political purposes. Execution has been
 used in the past to eliminate real or potential rivals to
 Hoxha's supremacy. Most recently, Prime Minister Mehmet Shehu
 was reported by the Albanian Government to have committed
 suicide, but almost certainly he was executed without trial
 * The United States has not had diplomatic relations with or
 official representation in Albania since World War I. It is
 difficult therefore to comment authoritatively on conditions in
 that country.
 
 (915)
 
 
 916
 because of differences with Hoxha. In September, three other
 former ministers, all associates of Shehu, were executed,
 according to reliable reports.
 The present penal code lists 34 crimes, 23 of them political or
 military crimes, for which Albanian courts may impose the death
 penalty, including agitation and propaganda against the state,
 incitement of hatred between nationalities and races, creation
 of or participation in a counterrevolutionary organization,
 activity against the revolutionary movement of the working
 class, and refusal to carry out a duty or coercing others to
 refuse.
 b. Disappearance
 Information on disappearances is sketchy, but Albanians who have
 managed to escape from the country say that disappearances do
 occur.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There are unconfirmed reports of police brutality, particularly
 against persons accused of antistate or religious activity. It
 is impossible to say whether such practices are isolated and
 result from abuse of local officials' authority or are of a
 widespread, systematic nature.
 Private international humanitarian organizations have reported
 that Albanians sentenced to prison endure extremely harsh
 conditions of confinement. One prison camp was described where
 "prisoners mined copper in eight-hour shifts, six days a week,
 with little protective clothing," were forced to meet excessive
 work quotas, and when they failed to do so, faced extra work
 hours or solitary confinement. There were similar reports in
 the past of prisoners being held in solitary confinement for up
 to six months. One report mentions special isolation cells,
 one meter square by two meters high, where prisoners are kept in
 solitary confinement. Called "cloaks," these cells are too
 small for prisoners to lie down in. Other reports tell of
 prisoners being fed only 600 grams of cornbread a day while
 being forced to work 16 hours.
 At one prison, Burelli, conditions are said to be unusually
 harsh. The facility lacks even the basic necessities for human
 habitation: there is no heating or running water, and the
 prisoners have to sleep on concrete floors.
 Eyewitnesses have reported the use of public humiliation at some
 prisons, including the exhibition of the bodies of dead
 prisoners, as a means of intimidating the populace. Although it
 is impossible to say how widespread such practices may be, there
 is no reason to believe that conditions have improved
 significantly in the last year.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There are numerous reports that the families of those who escape
 from Albania are sent to prison as a deterrent to other would-be
 illegal emigrants. Former Prime Minister Mehmet Shehu's widow
 
 
 917
 was sentenced in September to 25 years in prison, allegedly
 because she collaborated in her husband's plot to oust Hoxha.
 There are also reports that up to 300 elderly prisoners,
 remnants of the pre-World War I elite and the last survivors of
 pre-Communist Albania, continue to be held in the Spach
 concentration camp. Otherwise, there is insufficient
 information to make meaningful comment on arbitrariness of
 arrest and imprisonment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judicial system in Albania includes a supreme court and
 regional and district courts. While the Hoxha regime clearly
 controls the administration of justice and has the power to
 administer it to suit its own ends, there is virtually no
 reliable information on judicial practices in Albania. More
 than 4,300 prisoners are reported to be interned at six heavy
 security prisons throughout Albania. Most of those 4,300 were
 imprisoned for expressing dissatisfaction with political or
 economic conditions in Albania, or for attempting to leave the
 country without authorization. Amnesty International has
 reported allegations of the use of psychological and sometimes
 physical pressure to obtain statements from defendants and
 witnesses. Amnesty has further reported that when defendants
 were permitted to have defense counsel, they seemed to be
 state-appointed and to provide only nominal services. Some
 defendants reportedly did not see their defense counsel before
 trial, and trials were frequently held behind closed doors.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Generally acknowledged as one of the most totalitarian regimes
 in the world, the Albanian Government appears to be able to
 violate the privacy of the home and family whenever it wishes
 and to the extent it deems necessary to achieve its ends. There
 is no apparent recourse or protection against such intrusion.
 Inviolability of the home is constitutionally guaranteed, but
 according to numerous reports is seldom respected. The
 Government has a pervasive internal security police force to
 monitor the activities of its citizens, using, among other
 measures, an extensive informer network to report on their
 private lives. Children are encouraged in school to report on
 their parents' activities: e.g., whether they practice religious
 beliefs in the privacy of their home. There is little contact
 with the outside world by either mail or telephone, and what
 contact exists is almost certainly carefully controlled.
 Several escapees report that the Greek minority in Albania has
 difficulty in receiving mail or telephone calls from their
 relatives in Greece. Packages of food, medicine, and clothing
 sent to Albanians of Greek ethnic origin are returned to
 Greece.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Albanian Constitution states that citizens enjoy freedoms of
 speech and press. It also provides, however, that "the rights
 of citizens are indivisible from the fulfillment of their duties
 and cannot be exercised in opposition to the socialist order."
 From available reports, it seems that the regime shows little
 respect for these rights.    The press is owned and tightly
 
 
 918
 censored by the regime. The flow of news into and out of
 Albania is rigidly controlled, as is its internal
 dissemination. The press does not criticize the Government's
 policies or leaders. On the contrary, it appears that one of
 the prime functions of the press is to bolster the cult of
 personality of Enver Hoxha in grandiloquent terms. Persons
 found listening to foreign radio broadcasts or exhibiting "alien
 manifestations" are reportedly subject to punishment. Albanian
 citizens receive mail from other countries on an extremely
 limited basis, and are similarly restricted in sending mail
 abroad. As in other totalitarian states, the arts and
 literature are deemed weapons of revolutionary change and as
 such are subject to strict state control.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Albanian Constitution calls for freedom of "organization,
 association, assembly, and public manifestation," with the
 caveat that such rights cannot be exercised in opposition to the
 "socialist order."  In practice, those who deviate from
 established norms of behavior meet with swift and severe
 reprisals. The highly developed security police network has the
 authority and the power to prevent any manifestations of
 opposition to the regime.
 The United Trade Unions of Albania, an arm of the Albanian
 Workers' Party, has as its major function the education and
 political indoctrination of workers with the goal of raising
 productivity and work standards through increased worker
 discipline. Albanian unions have no significant voice in the
 field of labor relations, although they do play a key role in
 organizing elements of the labor force for the periods of
 so-called "voluntary" manual labor in which virtually all
 Albanians are required to participate.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Religious activity is expressly prohibited by the Albanian
 Constitution and by government policy. In 1967, the Government
 abrogated all laws dealing with church-state relations and began
 a harsh campaign to eliminate all vestiges of religion, which
 were primarily Muslim, Orthodox, and Roman Catholic. More than
 2,000 mosques, churches, monasteries, and other religious
 institutions were closed. All religious literature was banned,
 and a number of church leaders were imprisoned or executed.
 Over 200 priests and mullahs were reportedly jailed or sent to
 labor camps as a result of the antireligion program. The regime
 continues to suppress religious activity by imposing harsh
 penalties on persons who engage in religious practices:
 possession of a Bible or listening to Radio Vatican can result
 in a five-year sentence. The state also conducts an educational
 campaign against religion and obliges citizens to expose
 believers. Children are questioned in school about their
 parents' beliefs. In spite of these pressures, some Albanians
 reportedly continue at great risk to practice their faith
 secretly in the privacy of their homes.
 d.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement within the country and travel abroad are rigidly
 controlled. Violators may be punished severely, as may their
 families in the case of illegal emigrants. Albanians are
 reportedly allowed to travel abroad only on official business
 
 
 919
 or, very rarely, for family reasons. When permission is
 granted, it is under strict control and based on demonstrated
 obedience to the Hoxha regime. Under the penal code, "flight
 from the state and refusal to return to the fatherland on the
 part of a person sent on service or allowed to leave the state
 is punishable by imprisonment for not less than 10 years or by
 death." Under such conditions, very few persons manage to leave
 Albania.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Albania has been under the autocratic rule of Enver Hoxha for
 four decades. No parties or political viewpoints other than
 Hoxha's, as expressed through the Albanian Workers' Party, are
 permitted. Disputes between factions under Hoxha appear to be
 resolved by the dismissal of the losing faction. Many followers
 of the late Prime Minister Mehmet Shehu were dismissed,
 imprisoned, or executed.
 The Constitution provides for the exercise of state power and
 the direction and control of all other state organs by the
 People's Assembly and by people's councils. The members of
 these bodies are selected by the party and then "elected" by
 universal suffrage. As evidence of the absence of political
 choices for the population, Albania routinely reports voter
 participation at or near 100 percent, with approximately 100
 percent of the ballots cast for the officially nominated
 candidates. Women also may participate in "elections," but
 there are only a few women in positions of leadership in party
 or state organizations.
 Among the ethnic minority groups in Albania, the largest is
 Greek (estimates vary from less than 100,000 to over 400,000).
 The Constitution grants national minorities "guaranteed
 protection and development of their culture and popular
 traditions, the use of their mother tongue, and its teaching in
 the schools, and equal development in all fields of social
 life." While there are differences of opinion about the extent
 to which minorities in Albania can exercise these cultural,
 educational, and linguistic rights, they are clearly
 restricted. Several reports indicate that there are
 persecution, harassment, and discrimination against minorities
 solely because of their ethnic status. There are even reports
 of mass removals of segments of the Greek population out of the
 traditionally Greek areas. Furthermore, insofar as the ban on
 religious practice has removed the Greek Orthodox Church from
 the Greek communities, an important part of the community and a
 cultural link between the Greeks in Albania and their homeland
 has been broken. The leadership of the Albanian Workers' Party
 and the Albanian Government is overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian of
 Muslim background.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Albanian Government has flatly refused to cooperate in any
 investigation of alleged human rights violations.
 The Amnesty International 1983 report decried the imprisonment
 of political dissenters, the lack of safeguards for political
 prisoners and detainees, ill treatment of detainees, and harsh
 prison conditions in Albania. Freedom House rates Albania "not
 free."

 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Albania is a poor country with limited natural resources and the
 smallest amount of arable land per capita in Europe. Its annual
 average population growth rate (1970-81) was around 2.5 percent,
 which is the highest among the Eastern European countries, which
 average 0.8 percent. Its infant mortality rate is 47.5 per
 1,000 births. Average life expectancy at birth is about 70
 years. Given the poverty of the country and its self-imposed
 isolation, the regime has apparently achieved a significant
 degree of economic development. Per capita gross national
 product is estimated to be about $840, but current accurate
 economic data are not available. Albania provides more than the
 minimum required daily per capita calorie supply for its
 population, and there are no reports of chronic food shortages
 or rationing. However, its calorie supply (110 percent of daily
 needs) is one of the lowest in Europe. Rents on housing are
 said to be low, but there are reportedly shortages, especially
 for newly married couples.
 Albania has taken steps toward industrial development, but its
 economy is grounded in agriculture and the production of raw
 materials, especially minerals. All land belongs to the state,
 and individual citizens are permitted to own only limited
 amounts of personal property.
 Albania is a party to the International Convention on the
 Political Rights of Women and to the Convention on the
 Nationality of Married Women. The Albanian Constitution asserts
 that women enjoy equal rights with men in work, pay, recreation,
 social security, sociopolitical activity, education, and in the
 family. Information on the extent to which these rights are
 protected in everyday life is generally not available, but there
 appear to have been advances in the rights and status of women.
 In 1975, reportedly 35 percent of all students were female.
 Reportedly, women participate equally in the obligatory labor
 and military service programs, but few women appear in positions
 of leadership.
