 COLOMBIA
 Colombia is a constitutional, multiparty democracy in which the Liberal and Con-
 servative parties have long dominated the political scene. M-19, the former guerrilla
 movement that signed a peace accord with the Government and became a legal po-
 litical party in 1990, has gained some support as an alternative to the traditional
 parties. Peace negotiations between the Government and the Simon Bolivar Na-
 tional Guerrilla Coordinating Board broke off in early May. Despite government at-
 tempts to restart the peace talks, they remained suspended at year's end. President
 Cesar Gaviria assumed emergency powers under a state of emergency declared on
 November 8, following escalating narcotics trafficker and guerrilla violence.
 According to the US3. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, total military ex-
 penditures for 1989 were $758 million. There are no plans to reduce these expendi-
 tures in the near future. Internal security is the primary responsibility of the Min-
 istry of Defense, which includes the national police. The Department of Administra-
 tive Security (DAS), which is responsible for national security intelligence, reports
 directly to the President. Security forces are known to be responsible for human
 rights abuses.
 Colombia has a mixed economy, with private enterprise having a dominant role.
 While coffee production continues to be a major component of the Colombian econ-
 omy, its overall importance has declined as the country has diversified its export
 base and expanded private investment. State enterprises have joint ventures with
 private foreign investors in the oil and coal industries and play an important role
 in the electncal and telecommunication utilities. Privatization of certain public in-
 dustries is continuing. Narcotraffickers control extensive illicit enterprises.
 Colombia's long democratic tradition has withstood extraordinary levels of vio-
 lence for over 40 years. The main perpetrators of human rights violations are
 narcotraffickers, leftist guerrilla groups, and rightw"g paramilitary groups, the last
 of which at times operate with the support or acquiescence of the local or regional
 armed forces and police. The police and the armed forces are also responsible for
 significant numbers of abuses, particularly in     areas with   high  levels of
 narcotrafficking and political violence. Violations attributed to members of the police
 and military are usually in the context of efforts to quell guerrilla or narcotics-relat-
 ed violence.
 Narcotraffickers were responsible for widespread human rights abuses and contin-
 ued to use terror in attempts to intimidate the Government and judiciary. They con-
 tinued to disseminate false information about official human rights abuses to under-
 mine domestic and international support for the Government. It is standard operat-
 ing procedure for guerrilla or bandit groups to murder or kidnap local government
 officials and civilians as part of their continuing effort to destabilize the Govern-
 ment and finance the insurgency. In some areas, the guerrillas cooperated with
 narcotraffickers. Although there was violent conflict between narcotraffickers and
 guerrillas in a few areas in the past there was no evidence of such conflict in 1992.
 Individual members and units of the army and the police were responsible for
 many human rights violations. In urban areas, the national police committed
 human rights violations including disappearances, arbitrary detentions arbitrary
 killings, and threats of violence. They also participated in extrajudicial "cleanup"
 killings (see Section L.a.). Particularly in areas of high guerrilla activity and little
 government presence, such as the Magdalena Medio, members of the armed forces
 were responsible for violations including murders, disappearances, and torture. Tar-
 gets of abuse by the security forces include leftist politicians, labor organizers,
 human rights workers, and peasants. Both officers and enlisted men and, in some
 cases, entire units have participated in rightwing paramilitary activity, which tar-
 gets guerrillas and others commonly sought by the military. Military links to these
 groups declined recently, in part because of President Gaviria's commitment to end
 support by officials for such groups. Some paramilitary groups have been linked to
 narcotraffickers.
 Several institutional reforms were implemented in an effort to improve respect for
 human rights, including judicial reforms aimed at ending the historical ineffective-
 ness of the judiciary. In its ir'st 6 months of operation, the new system investigated
 and tried cases involving narcotrafficker and guerrilla violence more efficiently.
 Some of the judicial reforms, however raised questions about whether defendants'
 rights were adequately protected (see ection i.e.). The Office of the Defender of the
 
 
 360
 People, a national level ombudsman, became fully operational. The Procuraduria, an
 independent government administrative watchdog agency, conducted investigations
 and imposed sanctions on police and military personnel implicated in human rights
 abuses.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Colombia is historically one of the
 most violent societies in the world, with perhaps the world's highest per capita mur-
 der rate. Due to insufficient police and judicial resources and expertise to inves-
 tigate and prosecute most killings, it is difficult to separate political from nonpoliti-
 cal murders. Opinions differ regarding the 1992 levels of politically motivated assas-
 sinations. While the homicide rate itself increased in 1992, there were conflicting
 opinions from respected sources on whether political murders increased. The Center
 for Investigations and Popular Education (CINEP), Bogota's Jesuit-affiliated human
 rights and social research institute, reported 873 politically motivated murders and
 855 presumably politically motivated murders for the period January through Sep-
 tember 1992. F or 1991, CINEP reported 500 and 1,269, respectively. Information
 from the Office of the Presidential Counselor for Human Rights indicates a de-
 crease, with 124 homicides reported through September 1992.
 The armed forces were responsible for extrajudicial killings particularly during
 counterinsurgency operations, but unlike previous years, there were no reports of
 military involvement in massacres. Police abuses, which occured mainly in the
 urban areas, included extrjudicial killings, arbitrary detention, and torture. Na-
 tionwide, plicemen continue to be murdered by narcotrrorists, guerrillas, and com-
 mon criminals at the alarming rate of more than 1.6 per day. Aing to official
 statistics, 620 police were killed in the line of duty in 1992.
 The recent phenomenon of killing of persons deemed to be social undesirables,
 such as street children indigents, prostitutes, and homosexuals, appeared to be
 more widespread. CINEP cited 420 such killings through September 1992 compared
 to a total of 389 in all of 1991. The killings were most common in Medllin, Barran-
 quis, Cali, Bogota, Cucuta, Pereira, and Manizales. Members of the police, appar-
 ently hired by local merchants, were often implicated in such killings. In other in-
 stances they were performed by urban vigilante groups, known as popular militias,
 and by criminal eements. In response to identified plice involvement in Bogota,
 _the Prosecutor General's office, in conjunction with the Prcuraduria, established in
 late September a special team of investigators and prosecutors to prosecute "social
 ceanup" cases.
 In 1992 the Government in several instances took action against police and mili-
 tary personnel involved in human rights violations. In April a police court-martial
 sentenced two policemen to the maximum penalty allowble under Colombian law,
 30 years in prison, for the January murder and robbery of a Japanese business exec-
 utive. In June a military court sentenced a captain and two sergeants to 16-year
 prison terms for torturing and killing six campesino laborers in Antioquia in 1988.
 Because official involvement was prove  the  vernment was ordered to pay 5,000
 grams of gold to the victims' families. Two further examples include the April dis-
 missal of 33 police-of whom 28 were low level agents-for inappropriate conduct,
 cluding abuse of authority, and suspension of 13police officials suspected of in-
 volvement in murders of persons whose bodies were found in eight mass graves near
 Cucuta. The trial and conviction of polie and military personnel responsible for
 killings and other abuses improved but remains infrequent.
 Narcterrrism, while declining through the first half of 1992, increased sharply
 in June and continued at high levels through the end of the year. A kidnaping and
 murder spree instited by Me dellin narcotlcs kingpin Pablo Escobar from19is pris-
 on cell precipitated the Government's thwarted attempt to transfer him, resulting
 in his escape on July 22. Since then more than 70 poie and DAS officials have
 lost their lives at the hands of narcoterrorists in Medin alone. In September 1992,
 Judge Myriam Rocio Velez was gunned down along with her three DAS bodyguards
 in a brutal attack as she left her Medellin home. Rocio Velez was the fist of the
 so-called faceless judges and prosecutors to be assassinated since the inception of
 the special prisdiction in January 1991 (see Section i.e.). The late 1991 massacre
 of 20 Paez Indians in an opium-ong area of Vaile de Cauca Department was
 dtermined to be a result of a drug-related land dispute. The alleged paramilitary
 operational leader of the massacre, who had links to narcotraffickers, has been ar-
 rested and remains in custody.
 Despite current governmental policy and legislation outlawing their existence,
 rightwing paramilitary groups, sometimes with the cooperation or acquiescence of
 
 
 corrupt local military and police officers, continued to operate in rural areas. The
 Government's continuing pressure on the trafficking operations that finance some
 paramilitary groups, and continued efforts to sever the connections between these
 groups and individual military units and officers, had--at least in early 1992-a
 suppressing effect on paramilitary activity. However, since March CINEP statistics
 indicated a resumption of such activity.
 Only one of the 140 identified paramilitary groups, the Madalena Medio Peasant
 Self-Defense Movement, took advantage of the Government s surrender decrees in
 late 1991. In January unknown persons brutally murdered the leader of that group,
 Ariel Otero, in Puerto Boyaca. Found on his body was a note saying "Ariel Otero:
 for being a traitor, thief, and murderer." In April two military officers, a lieutenant
 colonel and a major, were dismissed from military service pending an investigation
 into army involvement in illega paramilitary organizations. Reprtedly the two offi-
 cers were negligent in the performance of their duties against paramilitary groups
 in the Magdaena Medio region.
 A further blow to paramilitary activity was the death of aspiring paramilitary
 leader Jaime Rueda Rocha during a police raid. Rueda, a known Medellin cartel-
 hired assassin, was responsible for a long list of criminal acts. His most notorious
 alleged crime was the 1989 assassination of Liberal Party presidential candidate
 Luis Carlos Galan.
 The nongovernmental Permanent Committee for the Defense of Human Rights is-
 sued a report on the incidence of massacres in Colombia from January through Au-
 gust. Colombia's official sources define a massacre as the murder of five or more
 persons in the same incident with a requirement of some measure of subjective in-
 tent. The Permanent Committee defines massacre as two or more deaths in the
 same incident. The report details a total of 118 massacres for the first 8 months
 of 1992. The perpetrators of the majority of these cases remain unknown. However,
 in cases where some information on the perpetrators was available, most were at-
 tributed to illegal paramilitary groups or popular militias.
 Leftist guerrillas were responsible for numerous extrajudicial killings. Their vic-
 tims included those who refused to submit to extortion, those believed to have
 helped the Government, and those (including some former guerrillas) who were de-
 dared guilty of "crimes against the people." In September eight peasants were mur-
 dered on their farm near Chalan, Sucre department. According to reports, Revolu-
 tionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrillas were responsible for the mas-
 sacre. The apparent motive was retaliation against the family for refusal to pay pro-
 tection money to the FARC.
 b. Disappearance.-CINEP statistics for 1992 reflect a decrease in both disappear-
 ances and kidnapings. For the period January-November 1992, 94 disappearances
 and 104 kidnapings were recorded by CINEP, as compared to 180 and 375 respec-
 tively, in all of 1991. Preliminary statistics from the Procuraduria further corrobo-
 rate this trend. Despite this decrease, disappearances continue, and      the
 Procuraduria noted in its last report that disappearances caused by the security
 forces are a disturbing and chronic problem in Colombia. In early May, four
 campesinos disappeared over several days in La Uribe, Meta Department. CINEP
 alleged that two mobile army units were responsible. La Uribe is the site of the ma-
 jority of cases of political violence recorded by CINEP in the extremely violent Meta
 region of Colombia. Although guerrillas and paramilitary groups are known to be
 active in the area, the police and military are presumed responsible in one-half of
 the cases reported.
 CINEP reprts that guerrillas are responsible for 90 percent of reported
 kidnapings. Kidnaping the wealthy for ransom is an important source of revenue
 for the guerrillas. They also kidnap for political reasons, sometimes executing vic-
 tims after mock trials. In December Congress passed legislation prepared by a non-
 governmental social action group, Pais Libre, designed to stiffen penalties against
 kidnars and prevent families of victims from paying ransom demands. This un-
 precedented citizens' initiative, made possible under the 1991 Constitution, reflects
 the profound extent to which the general population has been affected by
 kidnapings. At year's end, three kidnaped US. citizens remained in the hands of
 guerrillas.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although torture is prohibited by law, the police and security forces reportedly beat
 and torture detainees, especially in the period immediately following detention.
 However the number of reprted ases is down this year. The 31 cases reported by
 CINEP through November contrasted with 158 cases from 1991. The Procuraduria
 had a total of 302 cases on file (91 new cases were filed between May 1991 and
 April 1992) involving allegations of torture by members of the security forces; the
 national police were implicated in 55 cases. The victims were typically peasants,
 
 
 workers and prisoners. During this period, administrative sanctions were levied
 against 12 policemen, 3 military personnel, and 4 prison employees.
 Illegal rightwing paramilitary groups operating in the countryside frequently tor-
 tured victims beore killing them. Torture is also a ommon guerrilla and
 n~rc    -rist practice. The bodies of Puerto Boyaca Mayor Gustavo Londono and
 an associate were found showing signs of extreme torture and mutilation. A known
 paramilitary member himself, the mayor was most likely killed by a rival para-
 military p-oup.
 According to the Procuraduria, physical assault continues to be the most common
 human rights violation committed by the security forces; of the 1,071 cases under
 investigation, 596 were filed between May 1991 and April 1992; after preliminary
 investigation 166 national police personnel were implicated in physical assault vio-
 lations. Victims primarily included workers, students, peasants, and the unem-
 ployed. The Procuraduria levied administrative sanctions against 150 of the per-
 petrators during the above period.
 An agreement reached in 1991 between the police and the armed forces with the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) granting access to all persons de-
 tained on security charges continued in force. The military is centralizing informa-
 tion on those detained and notifying the ICRC upon detention in an attempt to fa-
 cilitate visits by ICRC representatives.
 The Procuraduria has stated that some abuse of prisoners in long-term detention
 facilities does occur. Prison conditions are poor, due to lack of adequate resources
 and overcrowding. Colombian prison officials are both unwilling and lack resources
 to treat prisoners infected with the human immnodeficiency virus humanely.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest Detention, or Exile.-The 1991 Constitution includes several
 mechanisms designed to prevent illegal detentions. A detainee must be brought be-
 fore a judge within 36 hours and has the right to seek, before any judge, a petition
 of habeas corpus which must be acted upon within 36 hours. These rights were often
 ignored in practice, however, and numerous instances of arbitrary arrest or deten-
 tion continued in 1992. The Prcuraduria investigated 836 fdles invlving 1,039 al-
 leged victims of arbitrary arrest and detention; thetionional police were implicated
 in 74 percent of these cases. The Procuraduria levied administrative sanctions
 against 106 members of the security forces between May 1991 and April 1992.
 Persons are not subject to exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The right to due process is specifically provided
 for in the Constitution. The accused have the right to representation by counsel, but
 in practice representation for indigents is gross~y inadequate. An overburdened judi-
 ciary and a traditional reluctance to grant bail means that many detainees never
 come to trial; they simply serve the minimum sentence applicable to the crimes
 which they are alleged to have committed. According to one study, a majority of the
 prisoners in Colombia have never been convicted of a crime and may not have been
 formally indiced.
 The judiciary is independent of the executive and legislative branches in theory
 and largely in practice, although Some politically sensitive cases are usurped by ex-
 ecutive decree. In addition, the judiciary has long been subject to intimidation when
 dealing with serious narcotrafficking or paramilitary group cases. Many mag-
 istrates, judges, and attorneys have been suborned, threatened with death, killed,
 or had family members killed because they were investigating or trying such cases.
 In January 1991, the Government took some steps to try to alleviate these problems
 by establishing a special jurisdiction for serious narcotics, terrorism, and public cor-
 ruption cases. These special courts (now referred to as "regional jurisdiction) were
 designed to improve security for judges (and prosecutors since July 1) working on
 narcotics and terrorism cases, to speed processing of such cases, and to improve the
 conviction rate, which has risen dramatically. The protection afforded the judges
 stems primarily from their anonmity. Trials in these courts are closed to the pub-
 lic, although representatives of the Procu raduria must be present during most pro-
 ceedings.
 The powers of the law enforcement agencies to conduct investigations under the
 direction of the new public prosecutors were also reformed and strengthened. De-
 fendants before the regional jurisdiction enjoy many of the procedural rights guar-
 anteed by the Constitution. However, several due process issues are raised by the
 structure of "faceless" judges and prosecutors and anonymous witnesses of the re-
 gional jurisdiction. A defense attorney may not impeach an anonymous witness; nor
 may a defendant make copies of documents to be used as evidence against him; nor
 can a defense attorney bring charges of malfeasance or incompetence against the
 eudge. Some human rights organizations have alleged that the regional jurisdiction
 is being misused to target disproportionately low-level coca producers, student
 protestors, and peasant leaders. The regional jurisdiction system was endorsed by
 
 
 363
 a special congressional session in late 1991 after full and open debate on the issues
 surrounding its existence.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-A judi-
 cial order is generally required for authorities to enter a private home, except in
 cases of hot pursuit. There are widespread violations of legal norms regarding
 searches in remote regions, but in urban areas the sanctity of the home is generally
 respected. Peasants frequently are forced to leave their farms due to military
 counterinsurgency operations, guerrilla conscription and confiscations, and illegal
 right-wing paramilitary groups. The Procuranduria studied 355 cases of illegl
 searches, and 26 agents of the State were administratively sanctioned between May
 1991 and April 1992. The study implicated 31 national police in the reported cases;
 victims are usually peasants and workers.
 Telephone taps and the interception of mail must be authorized by a judge.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violation of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con.
 flict.-Unlike previous years, there were no reports in 1992 that military aircraft
 or helicopter gunships had bombed and strafed villages. Some local human rights
 groups however, continued to charge that civilians were deliberately targeted dur-
 ing military operations. The military continued to respond that noncombatant civil-
 ians are not deliberately fired on and that any resulting injuries or damage are inci-
 dental to combating guerrillas and narcotraflickers. Few casualties were reported,
 although clashes between the guerrillas and military have produced significant
 numbers of temporarily displaced persons fleeing the conflict zones and seeking ref-
 uge in urban centers.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-These constitutionally protected rights are re-
 spected. The press often and vigorously criticizes the Government and its leaders,
 and the privately owned Frint media publish a wide spectrum of political views. Tel-
 evision frequencies and acilities are owned by the State, which leases air time to
 private production companies. The Government imposes some restrictions on the
 coverage of terrorism, and during a crisis it reserves the right to prohibit broadcast
 media .from covering certain news events.
 During 1992 violence directed against journalists declined slightly. According to
 CINEP statistics through September, 14 journalists were victims of human rights
 violations from all sources, 1 of which was an assassination for political reasons.
 This contrasts with 23 violations in 1991.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom of peaceful assembly
 and association is respected. Public meetings and demonstrations are normally held
 without interference. Permission is required for demonstrations and is usually
 granted except when the Government concludes that there is imminent danger to
 public order. Any organization is free to associate with international bodies in its
 field.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for religious freedom, and
 there is little religious discrimination in practice. The overwhelming majority of Co-
 lombians are Roman Catholic, and the predominant position of the Catholic Church
 is established by a 1973 treaty with the Vatican which was renegotiated in 1992.
 The Government permits proselytizing among Indians, so long as the Indians wel-
 come it and are not induced to adopt changes that endanger their survival on tradi-
 tional lands.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens are constitutionally guaranteed the right to travel domestically
 and abroad. In areas where military operations against guerrillas are under way,
 civilians may be required to obtain safe-conduct passes from the military guerrillas
 reportedly use similar means to limit travel in areas under their control. Emigration
 is unrestricted and expatriates may, by law, repatriate. The Government uses ac-
 cepted United Nations standards to determine the status of refugees and asylum
 seekers.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Since independence in 1824, citizens have exercised this right, except for short
 lapses, in elections that have generally been conducted fairly and openly. Presi-
 dential elections are held every 4 years. The Liberal and Conservative parties are
 the most competitive, with one or the other usually gaining the presidency. Persons
 are enfranchised at age 18. Public employees are forbidden to participate in political
 campaigns, but, except for military personnel, may vote. All parties operate freely
 without government interference. There are no restrictions on the participation of
 
 
 364
 women or minorities in politics. Women hold many mid-level and some high-level
 positions in government, including the two top slots at the Foreign Ministry.
 There are about 80 distinct ethnic groups among the approximately 500,000 indig-
 enous inhabitants of Colombia. The 1991 Constitution gives special recognition to
 the fundamental rights of indigenous people. Rights regarding territory, govern-
 ment, education, and preservation of cultural integrity are specifically outlined. The
 Government is sponsoring programs to facilitate the exercise of indigenous rights;
 these programs are coordinated by the Presidential Counselor for Human Rights.
 Although somewhat limited in scope due to lack of resources, the programs empha-
 size civic education while maintaining and preserving cultural integrity. There is
 growing political activism among the indigenous people of Colombia.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Procuraduria is charged with protecting citizens from abuses of human rights
 from all sources. The Government cooperates with investigations by local and inter-
 national human rights groups. CINEP is one of the most respected domestic human
 rights organizations, and information compiled by it has been used by international
 human rights organizations. Local human rights groups, universities, and the Gov-
 ernment itself regularly sponsor conferences to analyze violence and human rights
 violations. One function of the presidential human rights advisor and of the newly
 created Defender of the People is to assist human rights groups. It is the constitu-
 tional duty of the Defender of the People to ensure the promotion and exercise of
 human rights and to educate the population concerning such rights. These and other
 government officials maintain close contact with prominent local human rights
 groups.
 Members of these groups are sometimes the target of violence by illegal rightwing
 paramilitary gups or members of the police or military forces. The Regional Com-
 mittee for the Defense     of Human    Rights (CREDHOS), headquartered       in
 Barrancabermeja, was particularly hard hit with the assassination of two
 CREDHOS employees and an attack against its president, Jorge Gomez Lizarazo.
 In January CREDHOS secretary Blanca Valera de Duran was gunned down in
 broad daylight by unknown assailants as she left the CREDHOS office. Julio Cesar
 Berrio, a security guard employed by CREDHOS, was killed during a Sunday after-
 noon visit to an ice cream parlor. Criminal investigations are still under way in
 these cases. Although the Goverment promised to undertake a meaningful investiga-
 tion, no results were reported as of year's end.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion. Language, or Social Status
 Article 43 of the new Constitution declares that "men and women have equal
 rights and opportunities. Women may not be subjected to any form of discrimina-
 tion." Article 40 specifically requires the authorities to 'guarantee adequate and ef-
 fective participation by women at the decision making levels of public administra-
 tion." Long be ore implementation of the new Constitution, however, Colombian leg-
 islation had guaranteed women extensive rights.
 Despite these constitutional guarantees, discrimination against women still exists.
 Women are entitled to remuneration equal to that of men, but this law is more re-
 speted by the Government than the private sector. Reliable statistics indicate that
 women in metropolitan areas earn approximately 66 percent of what men with com-
 parable educational backgrounds earn. Estimates indicate that while women com-
 prise about 41 percent of the country's economically active population, men still
 dominate top positions in government and industry. Nevertheless, approximately 40
 percent of the university population is female, and over the past several years
 women have increased their participation in a variety of professions. There are ac-
 tive private associations working to advance women s rights in the workplace and
 in public life.
 Violence directed against �women appears to be common, but a lack of reliable sta-
 tistics makes it difficult to gauge its full extent. A social welfare organization in Bo-
 gota estimates that only 20 percent of sexual assaults are reported by women to au-
 thorities. According to Pro Mujer, an organization that assists female victims, at
 least five rapes a day are reported in Colombia. Victims of domestic violence are
 usually reluctant to file reports or press charges. The Government, through the Co-
 lombian Institute of Famiy Welfare, provides education in domestic relations and
 personal behavior, primary to lower income families. Domestic violence has not
 histrically been treated as a serious crime in Colombia.
 However, with recent governmental and social attention directed at domestic vio-
 lence, there is a growing trend toward recognizing the seriousness of the crime. This
 
 
 365
 has yet to result however, in significantly increased numbers of convictions or stiff-
 er penalties for those convicted of such abuse.
 Colombia's constitutional and legislative commitment to the protection of the fun-
 damental Tights of children is significant. A Children's Code was enacted in 1989
 to specify the fundamental rights of children, define the principles for the protection
 of minors, determine the sources of problems and the methods to be adopted to over-
 come the problems, and to establish and restructure the services responsible for the
 protection of minors. The fundamental rights of children are constitutionally guar-
 anteed in Article 44. The Constitution also provides that the family society, and the
 State are obligated to assist and protect children, to foster their development, and
 to assure the full exercise of their rights.
 Several 'million blacks form a racial minority in Colombia. They enjoy all the legal
 rights of other citizens but they suffer some discrimination. Although constituting
 4 percent of the population, there were no black representatives in Congress in
 1992. Indians legally enjoy all the rights and privileges of full citizenship but alo
 experience  discrimination.  Both   blacks  and   Indians   are   significantly
 underrepresented among government and business leaders. Indians form 1 percent
 of Colombia's population. The new Constitution mandates 2 seats for Indians in the
 102-seat Congress and, in fact, a third Indian was elected to an at-large seat in the
 Congress.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The right of workers to organize unions and strike
 is recognized by law. The Labor Code provides for automatic legal recognition of
 unions which have obtained 25 signatures from a workplace, and strengthens the
 penalties for interfering with workers' freedom of association. The Labor Code also
 assures the independence of labor oroanizations in determining internal rules, elect-
 ing officials, and administering activities, and forbids the dissoution of trade unions
 by administrative fiat. Colombian workers are organized into 2,265 unions, 101 fed-
 erations, and 3 confederations, and are free to establish international affiliations
 without government restrictions.
 The Constitution extends the right to strike to nonessential public employees and
 authorizes the Congress to enact implementing legislation.  ore carrying out a
 legal strike, unions must negotiat directly with management and engage in concil-
 iation procedures if no agreement results. By law, pubnc employees must go to bind-
 ing ar itration if conciliation talks fail; in practice, public service unions decide by
 membership vote whether or not to seek arbitration.
 In early 1992, there were strikes and protests against government austerity meas-
 ures andplans to privatize key public enterprises. Ten thousand trade unionists
 demonstrated in February in a national day of protest in support of striking utility
 bank, telephone, and dock workers. A 1-week telecommunications strike in Apri
 failed in its intent to force the Government to withdraw its telecommunications pri-
 vatization bill from Congress. Port workers also went on strike against a govern-
 ment decree modifying their collective bargaining agreement.
 Organized labor suffers from a disproportionately high rate of violence from a va-
 riety of sources including guerrillas illegal paramilitary groups, and common crimi-
 nals, and also as a result of internal union struggles. Members of organized peasant
 groups are frequently caught in the middle of struggles between insurgents and
 paramilitary forces, particularly in areas of high guerrilla activity. The Inter-
 national Labor Organization's (ILO) Committee of Experts (COE), referring to re-
 ports that governmental investigations into the murder and disappearance of trade
 unionists rarely lead to convictions, observed that the climate ofviolence and inse-
 curity has an extremely damaging effect on the exercise of trade union rights.
 In its 1992 report, the COE pointed to the need to amend the Labor Code to en-
 sure that all agricultural workers benefit from compensation for industrial acci-
 dents. The Committee praised the repeal of legal provisions restricting trade union
 rights, but stated that various provisions of the Labor Code still conflict with the
 ILO Convention. In addition, the COE suggested that the prohibition of strikes of
 public workers engaged in essential services be more clearly defined, and reiterated
 its previous requests that the Government amend the Labor Code to conform with
 the Convention on the issue of weekly rest.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right of workers to orga-
 nize and engage in collective bargaining enjoys constitutional protection. Unions
 have been successful in organizing larger firms and public services, which include
 less than 8 percent of Colombia's economically active population. High unemploy-
 ment and weak union organization have limited workers bargaining power in the
 private sector. Antiunion discrimination or the obstruction of union association is il-
 legal; this prohibition is enforced by administrative labor inspections. The new
 
 
 366
 Labor Code increased the fines for restricting freedom of association. The use of
 strikebreakers is prohibited by law.
 The revised Labor Code eliminates mandatory mediation in private labor-manage-
 ment disputes, and extends the grace period before the Government can intervene
 in an efort to resolve conflicts. Confederations and federations are empowered to
 assist their affiliates in collective bargaining.  .
 Colombian labor law is applied in the country's seven free trade zones (FTZ).
 There is no restriction against union organization in the FTZ's. Several public em-
 ployee unions have collective bargaining agreements in the FTZ's of Barranquilla,
 Bsuenaventura, Cartagena, and Santa Marta. Some FTZ unions incorporate both
 government and contract workers.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is le-
 gallyprohibited, and this prohibition is respected in practice. The Constitution spe-
 cificaly forbids slavery or any treatment of human beings resembling servitude.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Constitution prohibits the em-
 ployment of children in most jobs before the age of 14, and the Labor Code prohibits
 youths under the age of 18 from requesting emplogment permits. This provision is
 respected in larger enterprises and major cities. iowever, the extensive informal
 economy is effectively outside government control. A recent Ministry of Labor study
 reveals that about 800,000 children between ages 12 and 17 are working. There are
 also many younger children who work in the informal sector as street vendors, as
 well as children who work in subhuman conditions in some small coal mines.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government annually sets a national min-
 imum wage which serves as an important benchmark for wage bargaining. The cur-
 rent level, set by the Government after the National Labor Council, a tripartite ad-
 visory board, failed to reach an agreement between administration, labor, and pri-
 vate sector representatives in December 1992, is consistent with the Government's
 anti-inflation policies but falls short of providing an adequate standard of living for
 a worker and family. Over one-qarter of the population earns less than the mini-
 mum wage. Lax enforcement of labor laws is partly due to the small number of
 Labor Ministry inspectors and to fear on the part of unorganized workers of losing
 their jobs. The law provides for a standard workday of 8 hours and a 48-hour work-
 week. These laws are supposed to be enforced by Ministry of Labor inspectors and
 judicial labor courts.
 Workers' occupational safety and health are extensively regulated, but many such
 regulations are difficult to enforce for workers in the informal sector who are not
 covered by social insurance systems. Employees have the right to ask for Ministry
 of Labor inspections in cases of suspected occupational hazards. However, Colom-
 bian workers suffered many industrial accidents during the year, many of them in-
 capacitating, owing to a combination of low levels of public safety awareness, scant
 involvement by organized labor, and lax enforcement by the Labor Ministry.
