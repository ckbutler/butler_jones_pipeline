 SWITZERLAND
 Switzerland is a constitutional democracy with a federal
 structure. Federal legislative power is vested in a bicameral
 legislature elected by universal suffrage every 4 years. The
 Constitution guarantees all basic freedoms. Initiative and
 referendum procedures provide avenues for significant changes
 in policy through direct action. Despite linguistic and
 religious diversity, Switzerland has developed a political
 system based on national consensus.
 Individual cantons have considerable autonomy. They are
 directly involved in many human rights matters, subject to
 limitations established by Federal legislative and
 constitutional guarantees. Persons contending that their
 rights have been violated at cantonal level can seek redress
 in Federal courts.
 Switzerland traditionally serves as host for many
 international organizations and conferences concerned with
 humanitarian law and human rights, including the International
 Labor Organization and the International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC).
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 No such occurrences took place in Switzerland in 1986.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of abduction, secret arrests, or
 clandestine detention.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution provides freedom from all of the above, and
 there were no allegations of any violations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest, detention,, or exile is
 guaranteed by law. A detained person may not be held longer
 than 24 hours without a warrant of arrest issued by the judge
 conducting the preliminary investigation. A suspect must
 immediately be shown the warrant and has the right to contact
 legal counsel as soon as a warrant is issued. A suspect may
 be detained with a warrant until the investigation is
 completed, but the length of investigative detention is always
 reviewed by higher judicial authority, and investigations are
 typically completed quickly. Bail, or release on personal
 recognizance, is granted unless the examining magistrate
 believes the individual is a danger to society or will not
 appear for trial.
 There is no forced or compulsory labor in Switzerland.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution guarantees public trials. Minor cases are
 tried by a single judge, difficult cases by a panel of judges,
 
 
 1035
 SWITZERLAND
 and murder or other serious crimes by a public jury. Even the
 most serious cases are usually brought to trial within several
 weeks or, at the most, a few months.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There were no allegations of violations of this nature by
 Swiss authorities.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There are no restrictions on freedom of speech and press
 except in cases involving groups or associations considered a
 potential threat to the State. No groups or associations are
 so designated at the present time.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The only restriction on peaceful assembly and association is a
 requirement to obtain permits from police authorities before
 holding public meetings. These are rarely refused unless
 authorities have reason to believe the meeting will lead to
 violence. Public opinion and the media reacted strongly
 against occasional past complaints of police overreaction when
 demonstrations, generally involving youth, became violent.
 Such incidents diminished in number and intensity during
 1986.
 Labor unions enjoy full freedom to organize, strike, and
 influence political decisions. Swiss labor relations have
 been characterized by industrial peace, and strikes and
 similar labor unrest are practically unknown.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Switzerland enjoys religious freedom. The legal requirement
 for universal male military service provides no exemption for
 conscientious objectors, who are nearly always convicted for
 refusal to serve. Efforts to modify the Constitution to move
 toward effective decriminalization of conscientious objectors
 and to provide alternative service for those claiming exemption
 for reasons of conscience have been unsuccessful to date,
 although such efforts continue.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Swiss citizens have freedom to travel in or outside the
 country and can emigrate without difficulty. Switzerland was
 traditionally a haven for refugees, but concern over demands
 upon public services by growing numbers of asylum-seekers has
 tempered public support for continued liberal policies in this
 regard. Situations involving economic migrants, e.g. Tamils
 from Sri Lanka, led to reiteration of the policy that
 applicants failing to meet criteria for political asylum are
 required to depart Switzerland. In one case in 1986, a
 Turkish national intercepted crossing the border illegally was
 returned to Italy. The Swiss people remain generally willing
 to assist political refugees, but Federal and cantonal actions
 reflect the growing popular view that Switzerland should
 
 
 1036
 SWITZERLAND
 adhere to a narrow definition of those entitled to such
 assistance.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Switzerland is a highly developed constitutional democracy.
 There is now universal adult suffrage in Federal elections.
 Initiative and referendum procedures provide unusually intense
 popular oversight of, and involvement in, the legislative
 process through direct participation in government decisions
 at Federal, cantonal, and local levels.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There were no requests during 1986 for outside investigations
 of the human rights situation. Switzerland cooperates with
 international and nongovernmental groups in all areas of human
 rights. The ICRC is made up of Swiss nationals, and they play
 prominent roles in other humanitarian nongovernmental
 organizations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The traditionally limited involvement of women in the
 political and business worlds continues to expand slowly.
 Twenty-five women (10 percent of the total membership) were
 elected to the Federal Parliament in 1983; since 1984 a woman
 has served on the 7-member Federal Council, the nation's
 executive body.
 One of the 26 cantons still excludes female suffrage at the
 cantonal and local levels. Women are still subject to some
 legal disabilities, are still typically paid less than men for
 equal work, and remain underrepresented in senior positions in
 industry, banking, and government.
 Italian and Romansch linguistic minorities (respectively about
 10 percent and 1 percent of the population) express concern
 that the limited resources made available to them by the
 Federal Government endanger the continued intellectual
 vitality of these languages. Some argue that this amounts to
 deprivation of freedom of speech. Recurrent complaints at
 lack of an Italian-language university were answered by the
 announcement in 1985 of plans for a university-level technical
 institute in Lugano which, however, would not grant degrees.
 The Federal Government seeks through careful apportionment of
 funds to ensure that all linguistic groups have commensurate
 facilities and means to carry out cultural activities in their
 own languages.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 There is no national minimum wage. Industrial wages are
 negotiated during collective bargaining between employer
 associations and labor unions. The Labor Act sets maximum
 hours of work at 45 hours for blue- and white-collar workers
 in industry, offices, and retail trades, and 50 hours for all
 other workers. Currently, the work week for blue-collar
 workers in most industries is 43 hours, and for white-collar
 
 
 1037
 SWITZERLAND
 workers between 40 and 43 hours. Overtime is restricted by
 law to 220 hours annually.
 The Labor Act and the Federal Code of Obligations contain
 extensive regulations to protect the health and safety of
 workers. Special provisions exist for female workers, who may
 not be employed for dangerous work or, in most cases, at night.
 About 15 percent of the Swiss population of 6.5 million is
 made up of longtime foreign residents, that is, foreign
 workers and families. Prompted by popular concerns that
 attribute unemployment to foreign labor, the Government has
 sought to limit the numbers of foreign workers entering
 Switzerland or obtaining residence permits. Federal and
 cantonal authorities have made efforts to integrate foreign
 workers and their families into social services programs,
 although there has also been some popular resentment at
 additional facilities provided to such foreign workers.
 The minimum age for the employment of children is 15 years.
 Children over age 13 may be employed for light duties (e.g.
 helping in retail stores), for not more than 9 hours per week
 during the school year and 15 hours otherwise. Strict
 regulations govern employment of young people between the ages
 of 15 and 20; for example, they may not work at night or on
 Sundays, or under hazardous or dangerous conditions.
