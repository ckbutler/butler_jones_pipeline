 PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
 
 In traditional China, the law and legal institutions
 served as instruments for enhancing the power of the state
 and for disciplining the people to carry out its policies.
 With government acquiescence, the leaders of clans, villages
 and guilds dispensed a wide range of sanctions that included
 public censure, fines, ostracism, and corporal punishment.
 The formal machinery of the law confirmed and supplemented
 these unofficial processes administered by local leaders.
 The Chinese idea of "fazhi" often translated into English as
 the "rule of law" is more accurately rendered as "rule by
 law."   The object was the management by the state of order-
 ly, efficient and highly repressive procedures to ensure
 prompt, harsh and highly visible punishment of those whose
 offenses could not be managed by unofficial mechanisms.
 The notion that individuals might have rights against their
 social group, society or the state was an utterly alien
 concept.
 The century preceding 1949 was marked by inept and corrupt
 government, foreign invasion and occupation, rebellion,
 civil war, warlordism, banditry, and revolution. The
 restoration of public order and development of China's
 capacity to meet the basic economic needs of its vast
 population were widely welcomed by the Chinese as the
 primary tasks of the government. After 1949, the newly
 established People's Republic of China (PRC) attempted to
 pursue these goals through development of a socialist
 society in which collective state aims took precedence over
 individual rights. These factors, combined with periodic
 political instability at top levels in the PRC government
 have all contributed to a poor record on individual human
 rights in China over most of the past thirty years.
 In 1954, China's leadership adopted the first PRC constitu-
 tion and for several years began to develop a legal system
 and encourage freer expression of opinion.  The outspoken
 criticism of the political system by intellectuals in 1956,
 however, brought about a period of repression. This lifted
 briefly in the early 1960's when once again the leadership
 began drafting legal codes and allowing greater freedom in a
 number of fields. For nearly a decade to follow, however,
 severe ideological restrictions were placed on all fields of
 work and arbitrary rule prevailed. For several years from
 1968, in fact, China was governed in a repressive manner.
 There has been movement in the direction of greater
 freedoms in the past three years since the death of Mao
 Zedong and the purge of the so-called "Gang of Four" and
 their followers. The Chinese government appears to
 be making a serious effort to improve the rights of
 citizens by instituting a working legal system, expanding
 access to information, allowing some political dissent,
 adopting a more tolerant approach to national minorities
 and religious groups, liberalizing emigration policies
 and involving a larger number of citizens in local elections.
 Thousands of scholars, officials, and religious figures
 
 (437)
 
 
 purged during the numerous political campaigns of the
 past two decades have been rehabilitated. Many have been
 restored to positions of authority. China is a less oppres-
 sive place in which to live than it was three years ago.
 The press is a livelier forum for political debate, differ-
 ences of opinion are publicly aired, contacts and friend-
 ships with foreigners are possible (but still limited), and
 thousands of Chinese students are going overseas.
 The reforms have not yet broken entrenched patterns of
 harassment, arbitrary arrests and harsh punishment without
 free trial for political dissent. The Chinese government
 still maintains, particularly in remote areas of China,
 a large prison system and numerous labor camps. An extensive
 police system continues to monitor the political activities
 of China's citizens.
 In China, a developing country of one billion people,
 scarce resources have created significant frustrations that
 have boiled to the surface as visible discontent. In the
 past year, with the general loosening of political controls,
 thousands of poor peasants, frustrated youth, unemployed
 workers and soldiers have demonstrated in China's cities and
 petitioned the government and party authorities for redress
 of grievances. Others have registered more general com-
 plaints against the political system and advocated more
 fundamental political and legal reforms. Chinese officials
 have frequently treated protest as a problem in itself, but
 on occasion sought to make use of it, and most recently
 China's leaders have begun to deal with the individual
 problems which the petitioners have raised.
 Despite signs of improvement, the Chinese media and officials
 still condemn "human rights" as a "bourgeois slogan" without
 any relevance for China today. Ren Wanding, Chairman of the
 China Human Rights Alliance, was arrested April 4, 1979
 while attempting to put up a wall poster criticizing PRC
 leaders' disregard for human rights guarantees. Putting up
 wall posters is a right guaranteed by the Chinese Constitu-
 tion of 1978, but in February and March 1979 a proclamation
 was issued forbidding posters critical of "socialism" and
 restricting posters to less central, often inconvenient,
 areas of the cities.
 In early December, Beijing's "Democracy Wall" was relocated
 away from a busy street to a small, more remote location;
 persons wishing to put up wall posters are now required to
 register their names and addresses so they can be held
 responsible for the "political and legal implications" of
 their posters.
 In winter 1978-79, hundreds of youths in China's major
 cities spoke out against inequities in the political
 system. Some openly published unofficial journals, others
 spoke at rallies. Scores of them were arrested last spring
 and some in November; they are still being held in prison
 without trial. Many of these cases have have been widely
 discussed among informed Chinese.
 
 
 In October, 1979, two prominent dissidents, Wei Jingsheng
 and Fu Yuehua, were brought to trial separately on a variety
 of charges. Wei was found guilty of providing state secrets
 to a foreign journalist and was sentenced to 15 years in
 prison. He appealed the verdict, but it was upheld. Fu's
 trial, still open to appeal as of early January, resulted in
 a two year sentence for organizing a protest march and
 disrupting traffic. Both trials were "open," but admission
 was selective; no foreigners, including the press, were
 allowed.
 The trials have been the subject of continued and spirited
 discussion among the Beijing populace, including thinly
 veiled debate in the public media. The basic issues are the
 extent to which open questioning of the prevailing system
 will be tolerated and uniform standards of law will be
 applied. The fact that this debate is taking place at all
 suggests that China has been moving toward a freer society
 with some increased respect for individual rights, albeit
 within a political system that emphasizes conformity and
 unity. Sustained respect for law and human rights will not
 come easily, however. Periodic waves of repression within
 the parameters allowed by the Constitution and new legal
 system are quite possible.
 China's leaders seem determined to develop a legal system
 that would prevent the unchecked exercise of official
 authority. China has not had even a rudimentary working
 legal system for more than ten years, during which time the
 average citizen had no real recourse or protection from
 arbitrary arrest due to an off-hand comment, class back-
 ground, or having sided with the wrong faction in the work
 unit. Amnesty International has documented some cases
 reflecting these factors in its 1978 report on China.
 China's Constitution was most recently revised in February
 1978. It includes articles guaranteeing citizens' rights
 pertaining to work and leisure; voting and standing for
 election; belief and non-belief in religion and propagating
 atheism; old age, illness, and disability care; education;
 participation in scientific and cultural activities; equality
 of women; lodging grievances with the government; freedom of
 person and home from unlawful arrest or search as well as
 speech, correspondence, press, assembly, association, proces-
 sion, demonstration, labor strikes, and writing big-character
 posters. However, these rights are circumscribed by constitu-
 tional duties of citizens to uphold the leadership of the
 Communist Party and the socialist system, to promote national
 unity, to observe labor discipline and public order, to
 protect public property, and to repsect social ethics and
 safeguard state secrets.
 In June, 1979, China's National People's Congress  (Fifth
 Congress, Second Plenum) adopted the "Law of Criminal
 Procedure," "Criminal Law," "Organic Law of the People's
 Courts," "Organic Law of the People's Procuratorates,"
 "Organic Law for Local People's Congresses and Local
 People's Governments," and "Electoral Law for the National
 People's Congress and Local People's Congresses at all
 Levels." These became effective on January 1, 1980.

 The media have conducted an extensive education campaign
 on the new procedures and have admitted that there has been
 resistance to the new laws in some areas, particulary from
 the public security organizations. In December 1979, the
 standing committee of the National People's Congress voted
 to retain older legal regulations of the past thirty years
 where they do not contradict the new laws. This decision is
 likely to result in much confusion since many old regula-
 tions were not well publicized and were contradictory as
 well. Only the old labor reform law has been officialy
 revised to remove some of its more repressive elements.
 In the international arena, China has shown a new willingness
 to discuss human rights. Chinese U.N. Third Committee
 representatives have called for greater attention to flagrant
 violations of human rights, while aligning China with Third
 World views which stress social, economic and cultural over
 political rights. They have at the same time asserted,
 however, that each country's own legal provisions affecting
 the rights of citizens are bound to differ and are internal
 matters and that, moreover, individual freedom must not be
 detrimental to the national public interest.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture: The Department of State has no accurate
 information to indicate whether or not PRC authorities are
 still using torture. Torture is illegal under the new
 criminal law which went into effect January 1, 1980.
 Considerable psychological coercion, such as sustained group
 interrogation, is still used, however, toward dissidents and
 non-conformists.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment:
 Cases of cruel punishment continue to be documented. Wall
 posters, court notices and refugee interviews indicate that
 lengthy or open-ended prison sentences for political and
 economic crimes often involve years of solitary confinement
 with little or no communication with family allowed. Execu-
 tions for serious political crimes appear to have ended*
 The media have condemned the execution of a youth who spoke
 out against Mao and the "Gang of Four" in the early 1970's
 as an example of the transgression of political authority.
 Although summary executions have taken place, particulary
 during the Cultural Revolution, there have been no reports
 of them in the past two years. Recent media reports of
 capital punishment for serious crimes on the order of
 intermediate level courts have not clarified whether the
 Supreme People's Court gave approval or whether the defen-
 dants were allowed to appeal to a higher court--both of
 which are required by law.
 c. Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment: Article 47 of
 the state Constitution states that no person can be arrested
 except by a decison of people's procuratorate. On February
 23, 1979, the Standing Committee of the National People's
 Congress adopted a 15-point regulation which detailed the
 proper procedures for arrests and detention of citizens,
 including provision for arrest warrants, notification of
 charges and time limits for filing formal charges.
 
 
 441
 A form of habeas corpus was written into the 15-point
 arrest detention 'reguation, but it is too early to tell
 how successful this will be in changing past practice of
 detaining citizens for months and years without trial
 or even formal charge.
 There are political prisoners in the People's Republic of
 China, but an accurate estimate of the total number is
 impossible. Thousands of intellectuals, officials, and
 religious figures imprisoned on political grounds in
 the past thirty years have been released and often publicly
 exonerated, even posthumously, in recent years. Yet the
 practice of political imprisonment continues. Refugee
 interviews and dissident sources also report that thousands
 of citizens have been arrested in the past few years for
 expressing errant political views. The "Gang of Four" and
 many of its alleged followers have been detained for three
 years without trial.
 The government acknowledges holding political prisoners,
 describing these individuals as "counterrevoluntionaries,
 ruffians, scum and lawbreakers." Prisons are generally
 not open for inspection by foreigners and the International
 Committee of the Red Cross does not have access to
 detainees.
 d.  Denial of Fair Public Trial:  Under the new
 Criminal Code, public trial will be guaranteed, except
 for cases involving "State secrets," "personal secrets"
 and juveniles. The fact that even the "public" trials
 recently instituted by the authorities remain closed to
 foreign observers makes it difficult to evaluate the
 extent to which sentences are supported by evidence.
 Generally, criminal trials have not been public in China
 but several have been shown on nation-wide television as
 part of the campaign to educate the nation on the new
 laws. Based on the few trials shown on television,
 what the Chinese define as a "trial" is the equivalent of a
 sentencing hearing in the U.S.
 Defendants are entitled to counsel according to both
 the Constitution and the newly enacted laws. However,
 no specific provision grants the right to counsel in the
 crucial pre-trial investigation process where the decision
 of guilt or innocence is usually made. Chinese officials
 have, however, indicated that defendents can confer in
 private with counsel. In the few cases shown on television,
 the counsels acted as advocates for mercy and did not
 contest the guilt of the accused. China has virtually no
 trained lawyers, a deficiency that the government has begun
 to remedy through the reopening of law schools and the
 examination of Western systems. There have been reports of
 special courts and hearings for political offenses, partic-
 ularly if the person charged is a Party member. Last spring,
 several Chinese officials admitted to Western journalists
 that the new criminal code does not affect "party discipline,
 "under which party members can be subjected to observation,
 detention and reform through labor. Civilians are apparently
 not tried by military courts.
 
 
 442
 e.  Invasion of the Home: Article 47 of the state
 Constitution states that "the citizens' freedom of person
 and their homes are inviolable." In practice, however,
 this -provision has seemed to offer little or no protection.
 Last spring during the roundup of dissidents, Chinese
 Public Security officials searched the homes of youths
 without notice or warrant and confiscated incriminating
 evidence.
 2.   Government Policy Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food Shelter, Health Care, and
 Education:
 The PRC has the largest population of any country in
 the world and faces massive problems in feeding, clothing
 and employing its population. Its success in meeting
 minimal requirements in these areas has been impressive
 considering the limited resources available. While there
 is a disparity between urban and rural living standards,
 the government is making efforts to reduce the inequality,
 if possible. There is almost no evidence of starvation
 or malnutrition though there are occasional reports of
 severe food shortages in rural areas. Living quarters
 are often cramped and inadequate--a problem that the
 government is attempting to solve. Health care is available
 to all, either-gratis or for very little,   and the educa-
 tional system provides for a universal six to nine year
 curriculum. Education in remote areas, and at higher levels,
 however, is still a problem.
 Article 7 of the Constitution gives commune members the
 right to farm small private plots, engage in limited
 sideline production, and keep a limited number of live-
 stock for personal need, as long as the "absolute pre-
 dominance of the collective economy of the people's commune
 is ensured..." Article 9 protects the rights of citizens to
 own lawfully earned income, savings, and other means of
 livelihood. Chinese are entitled to own their own houses
 and other personal property and have the right of inheritance.
 There are significant differences in income and access to
 material goods. A government official, a senior university
 professor, or a skilled engineer might earn ten times the
 monthly salary of a young factory worker. But wealth is
 distributed fairly evenly. Top government and party officials
 enjoy a relatively high standard of living, but the lifestyle
 of the privileged few would look quite threadbare in most
 countries. Government officials now acknowledge a significant
 unemployment and underemployment problem involving perhaps
 up to 20 percent of the population and particulary serious
 among urban youth.
 Increasingly strict population control measures involve
 government-sponsored peer pressure and economic disincentives
 such as cuts in wages or rations for more than two children.
 There have also been reports of forced sterilizations and
 forced abortions even in the later months of pregnancy,
 although it is not clear whether these are sanctioned by the
 government.
 
 
 443
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, including:
 a. Freedom of speech, press religion and assembly:
 These are guaranteed under the state Constitution but
 generally have not been respected in practice. Political
 debate normally has been rigidly controlled but with
 periodic loosening. In late 1978, wall poster writers
 and youths in many of China's cities openly debated sensitive
 political questions such as China's human rights record,
 the nature of the Chinese political system, and the proper
 historical role of the late Chairman Mao Zedong. Many of
 these youths formed quasi-political dissident groups such as
 the "China Human Rights Alliance," the "April Fifth Society,"
 the "Exploration Group," and the "Enlightenment Society."
 Chinese authorities tolerated this for several months but
 reacted strongly in March 1979, arresting dissident leaders
 and stopping publication of all but the most innocuous
 journals. In August and September, however, the pendulum
 again seemed to shift in the direction of less control until
 December when new regulations restricted the airing of
 grievances in wall posters.
 The Constitution (Article 46) reflects an opposition
 to religious proselytizing. It says, "citizens enjoy
 freedom to believe in religion and freedom not to believe
 in religions and to propagate atheism." Chinese Communist
 ideology treats religion as a corrupting influence and in
 general the authorities have made the practice of religion
 very difficult. Nevertheless China is now turning to a
 more tolerant religious policy. The Chinese have resur-
 rected the officially sanctioned religious organizations,
 including Buddhist, Islamic, Protestant, and the "Chinese
 Patriotic Catholic Church" (independent of the Vatican).
 Chinese branches of the YMCA and the YWCA have also been
 reestablished. The Chinese have recently published a new
 Protestant hymnal and stated that new translations of the
 Bible and the Koran will be published in 1980.
 Minority peoples, primarily Muslim or Tibetan Buddhists,
 have enjoyed greater religious freedom than Chinese in the
 past but religious services are still carefully controlled
 and monitored in minorities areas. Christianity is still
 suspect for its association in China's historical experience
 with Western imperialism and true religious freedom is still
 far from reality.
 In past periods of liberalization and again recently, China
 has responded to the special interests of the national
 minority peoples in such border areas as Xinjiang, Yunnan
 and Xizang (Tibet) by allowing some degree of local autonomy,
 official recognition of their languages and rapid promotion
 of their cadres (government and party workers). "People's
 governments" in these areas have a sizeable representation
 of minority peoples. At the same time, the central Chinese
 government maintains rigid military control and fosters
 significant migration by Han (Chinese) to these areas.
 Western journalists have observed and documented the
 domination of Tibetan culture and society by the Han.
 
 
 444
 Foreign publications are now widely available for sale only
 to foreigners and for foreign currency. They are stocked in
 Chinese libraries, but access is restricted.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration: Chinese citizens need permission to
 travel any distance within the country or to change residence.
 They must obtain "letters of introduction" from their unit
 of employment to purchase tickets and secure accommodations.
 They also need ration coupons for staple foods (distributed
 on a municipal or county of residence basis). There are
 numerous examples of families being split by job assignments.
 The government now appears to be ameliorating some hardship
 cases. Nevertheless, large numbers of Chinese do manage to
 travel or move without these documents.
 A program to send large numbers of middle school graduates
 to rural communes or state farms has been in force since the
 early 1960's. An estimated 18 million youths have left
 cities for permanent life in the countryside, most of them
 involuntarily. Many of them have returned to the cities
 illegally, especially during the past two years when the
 government has been more lenient. Young graduates are still
 being sent out but in smaller numbers for shorter terms and
 with some element of choice involved. Meanwhile, the cities
 are making great efforts to organize service and commercial
 enterprises to employ both returnees and new graduates, and
 to provide educational opportunities for graduates.
 Emigration controls have greatly loosened during the
 past two years. This is evident in the growing numbers of
 persons who have legally entered Hong Kong from the PRC:
 26,000 in 1977; 67,500 in 1978; and 61,000 during the
 first ten months of 1979. Permission to leave China is
 now being given to students (whether government or privately
 sponsored), persons wishing to visit or permanently join
 relatives living abroad, persons who need to go abroad to
 settle estates or work in family businesses, overseas
 Chinese (ethnic Chinese who are nationals of other countries),
 and officials. There are some indications that PRC students
 cannot be accompanied overseas by family members to ensure
 that they will return to China.
 Prior to 1978, processing of exit permit and passport
 applications routinely took four to six years. Since
 early 1978, processing time has been substantially reduced,
 but still varies from place to place.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process:
 The PRC formally has a multi-party system. In reality,
 however, the Chinese Communist Party controls all facets of
 political, economic and social life. There is no freedom to
 participate in the choice of senior leaders or policies
 through democratic processes, and local elections have not
 been contested. New laws adopted by the National People's
 Congress call for free elections of local governmental
 leaders and Chinese official statements maintain that these
 
 
 elections will be held by secret ballots with a choice of
 multiple candidates. There have not been enough elections
 to determine the degree of involvement by average citizens,
 especially in choosing candidates. Thus far, the few elec-
 tions held have had multiple candidates, and a few non-Party
 contestants have won seats. The Chinese elite--the more
 than 38 million Chinese Communist Party members--participate
 in the selection of representatives to higher party organs.
 There is no direct election of senior party officials.
 Under the Constitution, women participate equally in the
 political process and an increasing number of women are
 playing important roles in the party and the government.
 Nevertheless, China has traditionally been a male-dominated
 society and the political process, especially at higher
 levels, is still largely a male preserve. In economic life,
 equal wages for urban jobs have reduced economic discrimina-
 tion against women, and women in post-'49 China have played
 a much greater economic role.
 The trade union structure is controlled by the Chinese
 Communist Party and is used primarily as a means of chan-
 nelling Party policy downward. The All-China Federation of
 Labor was reestablished in late 1978. The Federation has
 announced that workers will have a greater say in manage-
 ment, participate in the selection of factory leaders and
 will be allowed to elect shift leaders. Even though the
 right to strike is guaranteed under the 1975 Constitution,
 the few strikes of which we are aware were quickly suppres-
 sed. The major role of labor unions is to improve produc-
 tivity and welfare, not to act as bargaining agents. Wages
 are set by the state.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of-Human Rights:
 There is no dialogue between the PRC and official and
 non-official international human rights organizations.
 Chinese government leaders and -officials have refused
 to respond to repeated requests by Amnesty International
 for meetings and explanations regarding alleged human
 rights violations. Chinese officials regard such requests
 as interference in the internal affairs of China.
