 ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
 Antigua and Barbuda, a small two-island state, is a parliamentary democracy and
 a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. A Prime Minister a Cabinet, and a bi-
 cameral Legislative Assembly comprise the Government. A dovernor General, ap-
 rointed by le British monarch, is the titular Head of State with largely ceremonial
 duties. Power passed peacefully from Prime Minister V.C. bird, Sr. to his son, Les-
 ter B. Bird, in general elections held in March. The Antigua Labour Party retained
 'ower by capturing 10 of 17 parliamentary seats, down from the 15 it held under
 V.C. Bird's administration. The Governor General appoints the 15 Senators, 11 with
 the advice of the Prime Minister and 4 with the advice of the opposition leader.
 Security forces consist of a police force and the small Antigua and Barbuda
 Defence Fore. The police are organized, trained, and supervised according to Brit-
 ish law enforcement practices, and have a reputation for respecting individual rights
 in the performance of their duties.
 Antigua and Barbuda has a mixed economy with a strong private sector. Tourism,
 the most important source of foreign exchange earnings, improved during the year,
 due mainly to improved economic conditions in the United States and Europe. The
 country is burdened by a large and growing external debt which remains a serious
 economic problem. The Government announced a series of severe tax and other aus-
 terity measures for 1995 aimed at addressing the debt, prompting mounting but
 peaceful social protest.
 Although the Government generally respects the constitutional provisions forpo-
 litical and civil rights, it restricts freedom of speech and the press in practice. The
 Government placed some restrictions on the opposition's freedom of assembly and
 access to government-controlled broadcast media in the 1994 election campaign, dur-
 ing which there were scattered acts of violence. Societal discrimination and violence
 against women continued to be problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Rilling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other cruel or inhuman treatment of pris-
 oners or detainees, and the authorities generally respected these prohibitions in
 practice. A 1990 law allows flogging as a penalty for rape. The courts may also im-
 pose flogging on convicted child molesters, although there were no such instances
 in 1994.
 Conditions at the lone 18th-century-vintage prison are primitive, and a 1930 law
 still governs treatment of prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention, and the Government respects these provisions in practice. Crimi-
 nal defendants have the right of judicial determination of the legality of their deten-
 tion. The police must bring detainees before a court within 48 hours of arrest or
 detention. Opposition leaders claim the Government has developed a pattern of ar-
 resting suspects on Fridays and holding them until Tuesdays. Most of these cases
 involve youths suspected of narcotics violations.
 There were no reports of involuntary exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judicial system is part of the Eastern Carib-
 bean legal system and reflects historical ties to the United Kingdom. The Queen's
 Privy Council is the final court of appeal, which is invariably employed in the case
 of death sentences. There are no military or political courts. The Constitution pro-
 (307)
 
 
 308
 vides that criminal defendants receive a fair, open, and public trial. In capital cases
 only, the Government provides legal assistance at public expense to persons without
 the means to retain a p rivate attorney.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for these rights, and there were no reports of arbitrary inter-
 ference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence. The police must obtain a
 warrant from an officer of the court before searching private premises.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech,
 the press, and other forms of communications. The authorities generally respect
 these provisions in practice. However, the Government dominates the electronic
 media-the only daily source of news--and effectively denies equal access to opposi-
 tion parties. The Government owns one of the two radio stations and the single tele-
 vision station. One of the Prime Minister's brothers owns the second radio station,
 and another brother is the principal owner of the sole cable television company. The
 government-controlled media reported regularly on the Government's and the ruling
 party's activities during the election campaign, but granted only very limited access
 to the opposition parties.
 Political opposition parties and private sector organizations such as the Chamber
 of Commerce publish several weekly newspapers which offer e variety of opinions
 without government interference.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly. The police normally issued the required permits for
 public meetings. However, during the 1994 political campaign, opposition leaders
 claimed pie routinely denied permits for rallies on plitical grounds. The police
 contend that delays and refusals in issuing permits were intended to avert violent
 confrontations. While the authorities placed some restrictions on demonstrations,
 the opposition was able to stage numerous public meetings, rallies, and other events
 with little interference.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and all
 groups are free to maintain links with coreligionists in other countries.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Countr, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Neither law nor practice restricts the right of citizens to move about
 within the country, to travel abroad, or to emigrate.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Antigua and Barbuda has a multiparty political system accommodating a wide
 spectrum of political viewoints. All citizens 18 years of age and older may register
 and vote by secret ballot. The Constitution requires general elections at least every
 5 years. The law obligates the Government to hold voter registration during a fixed
 period each year, and parties conduct their own registration drives free of govern-
 ment interference. The Antigua Labour Party (ALP) won the March 8 election for
 the fourth consecutive time, although party leadershi passed from outgoing Prime
 Minister V.C. Bird to his son, Lester B. Bird. The ALI won 10 of 17 seats, less than
 itsprevious 15 to 2 majority.
 Except for a period of opposition from 1971 to 1976, the ALP has held power con-
 tinuously from 1951. The opposition has charged that the ALP's longstanding mo-
 nopoly on patronage and its influence over access to economic opportunities make
 it extremely difficult for opposition parties to attract membership and financial sup-
 prt. In 1992 public concern over corruption in government spawned the merger of
 three opposition political parties into the United Progressive Party (UPP). The UPP
 succeeded in increasing its representation to seven seats from five during the elec-
 tion.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While there are no governmental restrictions, no local human rights groups have
 formed to date. There were no requests for human rights investigations or inquiries
 during the year.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, creed, language, or social sta-
 tus, and the Government generally observed its provisions.
 Women.-While the role of women in society is not legally restricted, tradition
 tends to limit women to home and family, particularly in rural areas, and to restrict
 
 
 309
 their career options. To change these traditional roles, the Government began pro-
 grams to provide enhanced educational opportunities for both sexes, as well as fam-
 ily plarning services. The Directorate of Women's Affairs (previously the Women's
 Desk) worked energetically, with some success, to help women advance in govern-
 ment and the professions, but progress was slower in the private sector.
 Violence against women is a recognized social problem. It is treated as a matter
 of public conscience, and there are nongovernmental social welfare groups focused
 on the problem. Knowledgeable sources believe that over 2,000 incidents of physical
 and mental violence occurred. Women in many cases are reluctant to testify against
 their abusers. Police generally refrain from intervening in cases of domestic vio-
 lence, and some women have credibly charged that the courts are lenient in such
 cases.
 Children.--Child abuse remains a hidden problem. While the Government repeat-
 edly expressed its commitment to children's rights, no significant efforts were made
 toprotect those rights in practice, and abuse tends to go unpunished.
 People With Disabilities.-There are no specific laws mandating accessibility for
 the disabled, but there are constitutional provisions that prohibit discrimination
 against the physically disabled in employment and education. There is no evidence
 of widespread discrimination against physically disabled individuals, although the
 Government does not visibly enforce the constitutional antidiscrimination provi-
 sions.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-.Workers have the right to associate freely and to
 form labor unions, and the authorities generally respect these rights in practice. Al-
 though fewer than 50 percent of workers belong to unions, the important hotel in-
 dustry is heavily unionized. Antigua and Barbuda has two major trade unions: the
 Antigua Trades and Labour Union (ATLU) and the Antigua Workers' Union (AWl).
 The ATLU is associated with the ruling ALP, while the larger and more active AWU
 is rather loosely allied with the opposition.
 The Labor Code recognizes the right to strike, but the Court of Industrial Rela-
 tions may limit this right in a given dispute. Once either party to a dispute requests
 the court to mediate, there can be no strike. Because of the delays associated with
 this process, unions often resolve labor disputes before a strike is called. There was
 a 7-hour strike by the association of gasoline retailers, which ended when the Gov-
 ernment agreed to rescind a proposed 15-percent excise tax increase on gasoline.
 Unions are free to affiliate with international labor organizations and do so in
 practice.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Labor organizations are free
 to organize and bargain collectively. The law prohibits antiunion discrimination, and
 there were no reports that it occurred. Employers found guilty of antiunion discrimi-
 nation are not required to rehire employees fired for union activities, but must pay
 full severance pay and full wages lost by the employee from the time of firing until
 the determination of employer fault. There are no areas of the country where union
 organization or collective bargaining is discouraged or impeded.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution forbids slavery
 and forced labor, and they do not exist in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law stipulates a minimum
 working age of 13, which is respected in practice. The Ministry of Labour, which
 is required by law to conduct periodic inspections of workplaces, has responsibility
 for enforcement. There have been no reports of minimum age employment viola-
 tions. The political strength of the two major unions and the powerful influence of
 the Government on the private sector combine to make the Ministry of Labour very
 effective in enforcement in this area.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law established minimum wages for var-
 ious work categories in 1981. The lowest minimum wage, for domestic workers, is
 $0.46 (EC$1.25) per hour, the highest minimum wage, for skilled labor, is $1.30
 (EC$3.50) per hour. Most minimum wages would not provide a decent standard of
 living for workers and their families, but in practice the great majority of workers
 earn substantially more than the minimum wage.
 The law permits a maximum 48-hour 6-day workweek, but in practice the stand-
 ard workweek is 40 hours in 5 days. The law provides workers a minimum of 3
 weeks of annual leave and up to 13 weeks of maternity leave.
 There are no occupational health and safety laws or regulations; thus there is no
 provision for a worker to leave a dangerous workplace situation without jeopardy
 to continued employment.
