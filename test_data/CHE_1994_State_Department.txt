 SWITZERLAND
 Switzerland is a constitutional democracy with a federal structure. The bicameral
 Parliament elects (from among its members or other persons) the seven members
 of the Federal Council, the highest executive body, whose presidency rotates annu-
 ally. Because of the nation's linguistic and religious diversity, the Swiss political
 system emphasizes local and national political consensus, and grants considerable
 autonomy to the cantons.
 The Swiss armed forces are a militia based on universal military service for able-
 bodied males. There is virtually no standing army apart from training cadres and
 a few essential headquarters staff functions. Police duties are primarily a respon-
 sibility of the individual cantons, which have their own distinct police forces. The
 National Police Authority has a coordination role and relies on the cantons for ac-
 tual law enforcement.
 Switzerland has a free enterprise industrial and service economy that is highly
 dependent on international trade. The standard of living is very high.
 The Government fully respects human rights. The electorate approved a new
 antiracism law in September which criminalizes racist or anti-Semitic actions and
 public speech, and ratifies the 1960 U.N. Convention Against Racism. However,
 there continued to be instances of violence against foreigners, and the Federal Gov-
 ernment is investigating allegations of cantonal police mistreatment of detainees
 during previous years.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Ridling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution proscribes such practices, and there were no reports of violations.
 Amnesty International (Al) alleged in April that during 1992-93 there were 13
 cases of minor violence against persons in cantonal police custody. Cantonal police
 forces publicly rejected all the allegations. The Government promptly launched an
 investigation, and in November published a detailed report that also rejected all the
 allegations.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law provides for freedom from arbi-
 trary arrest, detention, or exile. A suspect may not be held longer than 24 hours
 without a warrant issued by the investigative magistrate. A suspect has the right
 to choose and contact an attorney as soon as the warrant is issued; the State pro-
 vides free counsel for indigents. Investigations are generally prompt. Release on per-
 sonal recognizance or bail is granted unless the magistrate believes the person is
 dangerous or will not appear for trial. Any lengthy detention is subject to review
 by higher judicial authorities. Some foreigners were held in lengthy detention while
 awaiting trial.
 There is no summary exile, nor is exile used as a mean of political control. Non-
 Swiss convicted of crimes may receive sentences which include denial of reentry for
 a specified period following completion of a prison sentence.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is independent of the other branches
 of government, and is free of interference from them at both the federal and the
 cantonal levels.
 The Constitution provides for public trials in which the defendant's rights are
 fully respected, including the right to challenge and to present witnesses or evi-
 dence. All courts of first instance are local or cantonal courts. Minor cases are tried
 by a single judge, difficult cases by a panel of judges, and serious crimes (such as
 murder) by a public jury. Trials are usually held expeditiously. Citizens have the
 right to appeal to the federal court.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Can-
 tonal laws regulate police entry into private premises. These laws differ widely from
 canton to canton, but all prohibit arbitrary intrusion. There were no reports of viola-
 tions of these rights.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and press; an effective judiciary and democratic political system, along with an inde-
 pendent press, combine to ensure this is fully implemented. The authorities may le-
 gally restrict these freedoms for groups deemed to be a threat to the State, but no
 groups were restricted during the year. The new antiracism law criminalizes racist
 or anti-Semitic expression whether in public speech or in printed material.
 Most broadcast media are government-funded (the exceptions are small-scale ex-
 perimental programs), but enjoy editorial autonomy. Foreign broadcasts are freely
 accessible. Private press and publishing operate without government hindrance.
 The Government fully respects academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The only restriction on peace-
 ful assembly and association is a requirement to obtain a permit from police before
 holding any public meeting. The authorities routinely grant permits unless they
 have reason to believe a meeting would lead to violence.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for complete freedom of reli-
 gion, and the authorities do not hamper the teaching or practice of any faith. There
 is no single state church, but most cantons support one or another church out of
 public funds. A taxpayer may opt out of contributing to church funding in any can-
 ton.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Under the Constitution and the law, citizens are free to travel in or
 outside the country, to emigrate, and to repatriate.
 Switzerland has traditionally been a haven for refugees, but public concern over
 the high number of asylum seekers induced the Government to legislate emergency
 measures for swifter processing and, for rejected applicants, swifter expulsion; the
 Government promptly began implementing these measures, and in December it ex-
 tended them through 1996. Still, the Government continues to give asylum seekers
 orderly consideration. It cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
 and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees.
 Refugees whose applications are rejected are alowed to stay temporarily if their
 home country is torn by war or insurrection. Through August (latest data), 1,165
 rejected asylum seekers were deported to their country of origin.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Suffrage is universal for citizens over age 17, and balloting is secret. Local, can-
 tonal, and federal elections are free and are contested actively by a variety of par-
 ties. Frequent use of initiative and referendum procedures provide additional means
 for popular involvement in the legislative process.

 Women were disfranchised until 1971, but since then their participation in politics
 has unabatedly expanded. Women occupy 41 of the 246 seats in the Parliament, 1
 of the 7 in the Federal Council, and a record 9 in cantonal government executive
 bodies.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernment In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local human rights advocacy groups concern themselves almost exclusively with
 lobbying the Swiss and other governments about the human rights situation in
 other countries. All maor international human rights groups are active in Switzer-
 land.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Although the Constitution prohibits discrimination against women in
 the workplace, this problem persists, and the Government has only recently started
 to take effective action against it. While in recent years significant numbers of
 women have entered traditionally male-dominated professions (such as medicine,
 law, and engineering), women generally do not receive equal pay for equal work;
 studies indicate women's earnings average 15 percent less than those of men.
 Various laws continue to discriminate against women; however, in 1994 Par-
 liament passed legislation improving the treatment of women regarding health in-
 surance and government pensions. In addition, it began work on amending the
 Labor Law so as to abolish provisions that ban women (except in a few fields, such
 as nursing) from working at night or on Sundays.
 In recent years policymakers have become more concerned about violence against
 women. While there are no reliable data on this topic, indications are that a prob-
 lem exists and that many cases go unreported. The Federation of Women's Organi-
 zations and other groups have heightened public awareness of this issue. Eve% city
 maintains a telephone hot-line, through which female victims of violence can obtain
 help and counseling, and shelters for battered wives. Specialists, working with po-
 lice, regularly interview women who report attacks. The law prohibits wife beating
 and similar offenses, and a change in the Penal Code in 1992 explicitly made spous-
 al rape a crime. The authorities effectively enforce these laws. The Penal Code also
 criminalizes sexual exploitation and trafficking in women.
 Children.-The Federal and cantonal governments, as well as organizations de-
 fending children's rights, in recent years have devoted considerable attention to pos-
 sible abuses against children, sexual abuses in particular. For convicted perpetra-
 tors of the latter, the law mandates imprisonment for up to 15 years. In June the
 Government approved the 1988 U.N. Convention on the Rights of a Child, and
 transmitted the draft bill to Parliament for ratification, albeit with some formal res-
 ervations regarding the Convention's provisions for the rights of children to natu-
 ralization and the rights of seasonal workers to be accompanied by their families.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Italian and Romansch languages may
 not long thrive in Switzerland, according to members of those communities, if the
 Federal Government does not increase its limited funding for education and media
 in them. The Federal Government regards preservation of languages as a respon-
 sibility of the cantons.
 In a referendum in September, voters approved inclusion of an antiracism article
 in both the Penal and the Military Code. This article is the nation's first law that
 seeks to prevent racial, ethnic, or religious discrimination before it occurs. The law
 also ratifies the 1960 U.N. Convention against Racial Discrimination.
 Reported attacks against foreigners were less frequent than in the 3 previous
 years-during the first 7 months of 1994 (latest data), 5 attacks were registered,
 a drop from 9 during the same period of 1993. Officials effectively investigate racist
 attacks, and in most cases these lead to arrest and trial of the perpetrators. Convic-
 tions carry a sentence of at least 1 year in prison.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government has not mandated that buildings, gov-
 ernment services, or transportation facilities be made accessible to people with dis-
 abilities. An umbrella organization actively lobbies on behalf of most associations
 defending the rights of the disabled; in 1994 it persuaded the Government to cease
 requiring disabled men to pay the tax imposed on men who have not accomplished
 their military duty.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers, including foreigners, are free to associ-
 ate, to join unions of their choice, and to select their own representatives. The Gov-
 ernment does not hamper the exercise of these rights.
 Unions are independent of the Government and political parties.
 
 
 982
 The right to strike is legally recognized and freely exercised. Strikes are infre-
 quent, however, in 1994 there was only one. The law prohibits retribution against
 strikers or their leaders.
 Unions can and do freely affiliate with international organizations.
 b. The Right to Organze and Bargain Collectiely.-By law   workers have the
 right to organize and bargain cllectively, and the law protects tAem from antiunion
 discrimination. The Government fully respects these provisions. Periodic negotia-
 tions between employer and worker organizations determine wa   and other labor
 matters at the national and local levels. Nonunion firms generally adopt the terms
 and conditions fixed in the unions' collective bargaining agreements.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Although there is no specific con-
 stitutional or statutory ban on forced or compulsory labor, it does not occur.
 d. Minimum Wage for Emplment of Children.-The minimum age for employ-
 ment of children is 15 years. hdren of age 13 or 14 may be employed in 1ight
 duties for not more than 9 hours a week dur-ng the school year, and or 15 hours
 otherwise. Employment of youths between ages 15 and 20 is strictly regulated; they
 cannot work at night, on Sundays, or under hazardous conditions. The Federal Of-
 fice for Industry, Trade, and Labor effectively enforces the law on working condi-
 tions.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage. The low-
 est wages fixed in collective bargaining agreements are generally adequate to pro-
 vide a decent standard of living or wor era and their families.
 The Labor Act sets a maximum 45-hour workweek for both blue- and white-collar
 workers in industry, services, and retail trades, and a 50-hour workweek for all
 other workers. The law requires a rest period during the workweek, and limits over-
 time to 120 hours annually.
 The Labor Act and the Federal Code of Obligations extensively provide for protec-
 tion of worker health and safety. The Federal Office of Industry, Trades, and Labor
 rigorously enforces these provisions. The Government is currently overhauling the
 1948 Labor Law, in part to strengthen provisions for workers' health and safety. A
 worker may opt out of a dangerous assignment, without penalty.
