 VIETNAM
 Following the unification of North and South Vietnam under a
 Hanoi-based communist government in 1975, policies entailing
 extensive human rights violations have been common in the
 Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV). AS the newly-established
 regime imposed policies to restructure Vietnamese society in
 a typical Marxist-Leninist mold, whole classes of people
 have been politically persecuted and disadvantaged, and
 state control of these societies has been extended to an
 unprecedented extent, with a consequent severe constriction
 of individual freedom of activity. Additionally, in its
 efforts to consolidate power, the SRV meted out harsh
 sentences in prison-like conditions in "reeducation camps"
 to thousands of persons whose affiliation with the fallen
 regime of South Vietnam or whose views or background made
 them suspect in the eyes of the new regime. By 1981, many
 lower-ranking officials and a number of higher ranking
 officers of the former regime had been released, but suffer
 from restrictions on their employment and movement. Vietnam-
 ese government sources have estimated that about 60 percent
 of those released had been rearrested. While it is impossible
 to be precise about the numbers in a fluctuating prison
 population, estimates of those still in reeducation camps
 vary from 25,400 (the SRV government) to 126,000 (informed
 observers).
 Between 1977 and mid-1979, the SRV government encouraged and
 at times coerced the departure of nearly one million Vietnam-
 ese, about half of whom were ethnic Chinese. At the time of
 the Geneva conference on refugees in July 1979, Hanoi
 undertook to halt this flow of refugees and to cooperate
 with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to
 organize a program for orderly legal departure. Progress
 has been slow in setting up the orderly departure program
 for the United States and other Western countries. At the
 same time, an average of 7,000 Vietnamese per month left
 clandestinely from January through September 1981. The
 number has decreased in recent months, at least in part
 because of harsher Vietnamese efforts to stop the flow.
 Refugees have cited repressive government controls, discrim-
 ination against minorities and persons associated with the
 South Vietnam regime and their families, stepped up military
 conscription and deteriorating economic conditions as
 reasons for leaving.
 The increased conscription and the worsening social and
 economic conditions are in part the consequence of Vietnam's
 diversion of manpower and resources to its invasion and
 occupation of Kampuchea, an operation which has debilitated
 the already limited industrial and agricultural capability
 of the SRV, which had decreased in part because of col-
 lectivization. Corruption also had an increasing impact
 upon life in Vietnam during the past year and affected the
 distribution of government services, ethnic discrimination,
 internal freedom of movement and emigration. Refugee
 accounts of government practices, although at times in-
 consistent, provide a reasonable pool of information about
 human rights trends in Vietnam, and are broadly consistent
 with reports from other sources.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is specifically prohibited in the constitution
 promulgated in December 1980. There are reports that some
 (702)
 
 
 703
 reeducation prisoners have been beaten. Provision of below
 subsistence levels of food rations, denial of medical care
 and assignment of hard labor to political prisoners are
 regular practices, resulting in acute suffering, permanent
 physical impairment and death.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Although the SRV admits that a few "war criminals" have been
 executed, execution apparently is not a widespread occurrence
 in the reeducation camps, although some executions, particu-
 larly for escape attempts, have been reported. On occasion,
 the government has announced the execution of persons
 allegedly involved in resistance or espionage activities and
 in organizing the clandestine departure of refugees. Infor-
 mation on the exact conditions in the reeducation camps is
 limited largely to the testimony of releasees or escapees.
 Camps visited by observer teams appear to be in good condi-
 tion, but both Amnesty International and the distinguished
 jurist Dermot Kinlen (who visited the same four centers and
 prisons) expressed concern in their reports at the conditions
 of detention and lack of proper medical care for detainees.
 Refugee reports suggest that elaborate preparations are
 taken to present the best possible picture to visitors of
 those few locations they have been permitted to visit.
 Sanitation and diet are said to be chronic problems in the
 camps, with outbreaks of malaria, dysentery, and beriberi
 common. Dangerous and hard labor is said to be the norm for
 those undergoing reeducation, as well as for ordinary
 prisoners.
 c. Disappearances
 Refugees report that the authorities occasionally wait for
 months before notifying relatives that a person has been
 detained. In 1981, there were no reports of persons dis-
 appearing without any eventual word of their locations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Since 1975, arbitrary arrest has continued, with victims
 subjected to imprisonment without trial under the rubric of
 reeducation. Vietnamese regulations provide for reeducation
 of "obstinate counter-revolutionary elements who have com-
 mitted acts detrimental to public security" and "professional
 scoundrels." The first category appears to apply to military
 officers and high officials of the former southern regime.
 The second may have been used for persons whose views or
 backgrounds are suspect in the eyes of the regime, despite
 their lack of association with (and in some instances
 previous incarceration by) the previous regime.
 Estimates of those still in reeducation camps range from
 25,400 (an SRV figure) to 126,000 (informed observers). The
 reeducation camps are designed to remove potentially dis-
 sident elements from the society, and to produce conformity
 through confinement, indoctrination and hard labor. Some
 prisoners, including officers of up to colonel rank, have
 been released, but many are still imprisoned. Vietnamese
 government-sources estimated in April 1980, that about 60
 percent of those released had been rearrested.
 The regime has spoken publicly of plans to relocate millions
 of persons to unproductive rural areas. Hundreds of thousands
 have already been resettled, frequently through application
 of coercion or force. In principle, the purpose is to
 expand the amount of land in agricultural production, but
 
 
 704
 those southern Vietnamese in particular who are targeted for
 resettlement are persons whose views and backgrounds make
 them suspect in the regime's view. Conditions at these "New
 Economic Zones" are widely reported to range from poor to
 life-threatening, with inadequate provision of basic services.
 Further, the settlement often displaces pre-existing tribal
 minorities, threatening their heritage.
 a. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In general, both political prisoners and those accused of
 ordinary offenses are denied public trial and access to
 counsel. People regularly are arrested and imprisoned with-
 out any form of legal proceedings (habeas corpus, counsel or
 public trial), because of real or suspected association with
 either the former government or resistance groups, or be-
 cause of dissident views, or attempted clandestine escapes.
 Leadership elements of minority groups also suffer prolonged
 detention. In its reply in September 1980 to Amnesty
 International's report, the SRV described "reeducation
 without judiciary condemnation" as "an extremely humanitarian
 system" because the person so detained was spared a "tarnished
 judiciary record." Amnesty's response in December 1980
 notes that detention for indefinite periods without formal
 accusation or opportunity to defend oneself is contrary to
 the widely accepted principle of presumptive innocence.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The North Vietnamese system of population surveillance by
 block wardens now extends to Ho Chi Minh City and other
 southern towns, although the system works imperfectly in the
 south, partly because of a shortage of trusted party workers.
 There are reports of officials planting incriminating evidence
 during searches of residences. Although the 1980 constitution
 provides for inviolability of places of residence, senior
 Vietnamese officials have acknowledged that abuses of search
 and seizure occur.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Vietnamese authorities have attempted to divide and control
 the Catholic church, the Buddhist Sangha, the Muslim
 community and other religious sects; however, people are per-
 mitted to attend religious services. Catholic priests are
 subject to police surveillance, and most priests and nuns are
 required by the government to work full time in state-run
 occupations, thus limiting their participation in religious
 activities. The church's teaching role has been restricted
 severely, and many churches and all but one Catholic seminary
 in the south have been closed. Sermons require government
 approval, and uncooperative priests are subject to prison
 sentences or "reeducation." Catholics are closely watched
 by the security forces, are required to attend political
 lessons, and are discriminated against in employment. In
 central Vietnam, 'thousands of Catholics have been forcibly
 relocated and required to work on government construction
 projects. The government has sharply limited the number of
 new Christian clergy ordained and has restricted communica-
 tions between rural parishes and their bishops.
 Nearly all of the 30,000 Vietnamese Muslims are members of
 the Cham minority, which the regime distrusts. The govern-
 ment has disbanded the organized Muslim association and
 broken links with overseas Muslim organizations. The regime
 
 
 forbids the traditional pilgrimage to Mecca and has not given
 permission for the Muslim community to participate in the
 Koran reading contest held in Malaysia. Many Muslim schools
 have been closed, but most mosques are still open. Most
 Muslim community leadership has either been placed in re-
 education or proscribed from any secular role.
 Buddhists have resisted efforts to control them. The poli-
 tically active An Quang unified Buddhist church reacted
 sharply when the government packed its leadership council with
 pro-party monks. In Ho Chi Minh City, demonstrating Buddhists
 were arrested in April 1977, and pagodas closed. Two An Quang
 leaders remain under arrest. Monks at the formerly political-
 ly active An Quang, Xa Loi and Vinh Nghien pagodas reportedly
 rarely receive visitors and are under close government
 surveillance. Pagoda schools are closed and while ceremonies
 may continue, monks may not preach sermons. Nationwide, monks
 need permission to travel and to stay overnight away from
 their home pagodas. Some reports from rural areas claim that
 local authorities seek to control the Sangha by forbidding
 the donation of food. Few young men have been allowed to
 join the Sangha.
 Other religious groups (notably the Hoa Hao, a reformed
 Buddhist sect), also have resisted government control. The
 Hoa Hao leadership is now reportedly imprisoned. Leadership
 of the Theravada Buddhist sect similarly has either been
 impressed or banished from any official role and replaced by
 pro-regime, occasionally communist, "clergy" to represent
 them abroad.
 The ministry of culture and information maintains tight con-
 trol over all newspapers, other publications, and cultural
 exhibitions, censoring all sources of information and promot-
 ing "revolutionary culture." Many prominent artists and
 writers have been arrested. The single semi-independent
 newspaper, "Tin Sang," published and previously available only
 in the south, was closed by the regime in June 1981.
 There are reliable reports that the Ministry of Interior
 inspects and censors international mail and on occasion
 takes actions against persons whose letters are critical of
 the SRV government.
 There is no freedom of assembly in Vietnam. Even assembly
 by religious communities for other than strictly spiritual
 purposes is banned.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Government approval is required for most internal and all
 external travel. No one is allowed to change his residence
 or work location without permission from the authorities.
 Only government officials or approved spokesmen for quasi-
 governmental organizations generally receive permission to
 travel abroad.
 A number of factors, including ethnic persecution, discrimi-
 nation with regard to economic and educational opportunities,
 fear of reprisals or of exile to remote areas and, recently,
 fear of conscription to fight in Kampuchea, have stimulated
 a mass exodus from Vietnam since 1975. The "facilitated"
 departures of ethnic Chinese and others as refugees has
 largely ceased since the UN conference on Vietnamese refugees
 held in Geneva in 1979. Information from refugees who have
 
 
 706
 left Vietnam since then indicates that SRV authorities are
 no longer systematically assisting departures and are punish-
 ing people caught trying to depart clandestinely.
 In May 1979, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) reached agreement with the SRV on the orderly departure
 of persons who wish to leave Vietnam for countries of new
 residence. Subsequently, UNHCR, on behalf of the United
 States Government, negotiated an agreement to cover persons
 wishing to leave for the United States. As of October 1980,
 about 2,000 people had left legally in an ad hoc fashion for
 the United States, and in December 1980, a systematic program
 of orderly departure for the United States was inaugurated
 with an initial flight of 250 persons. The SRV suspended
 this program for review in January 1981, but in September
 resumed issuing exit permits. SRV representatives met with
 resettlement countries in Geneva in October, and the generally
 positive tone of that meeting suggests that the prospects
 for the continued operation of the program are good. By the
 end of 1981, approximately 3,870 departees had left Vietnam
 for the United States.
 During 1981, the great majority of refugees from Vietnam
 left clandestinely, but there were some cases in which
 bribes were paid to low-level security officials to facilitate
 escape. Hanoi and province-level radio stations broadcast
 news of executions of boat leaders involved in abortive
 escapes as well as word of punishments dealt to others
 implicated. These broadcasts, confirmed by numerous refugee
 reports, indicate that current sentences for escape partici-
 pants range from three to 15 years of imprisonment at hard
 labor. Female escapees, especially those with children, may
 receive terms as short as one to three months.  (The three
 to 15 year range conforms to the provisions of a 1967 law on
 fleeing to join the enemy or counter-revolutionary forces.)
 Property, often including the means to make a living, is
 confiscated from those trying to depart illegally, as well
 as from those who have departed. For persons who leave
 under the orderly departure program, the major hurdle is to
 receive an exit permit from the SRV, a time-consuming process
 which many departees report can be speeded up by paying
 bribes to responsible officials. Refugees from the Mekong
 Delta have reported that people have paid SRV officials from
 eight to ten taels ($4800-$6000) of gold per person just to
 be considered on a tentative orderly departure list, with no
 guarantee as to when or if they would be able to leave.
 Furthermore, some persons on the "orderly departure list"
 reportedly are subject to recurring security checks and
 harassment.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Authority is concentrated in the Communist Party, which
 controls the political process. The politburo of the central
 committee of the Vietnam Communist Party (VCP) makes the de-
 cisions and within the politburo power is concentrated in
 the hands of five men. The national assembly endorses the
 politburo's decisions. The new constitution contains no
 changes affecting participation in the political process.
 National elections are held in Vietnam every five years, and
 local elections are held more often. Voting is compulsory
 but pro forma, and does not represent real participation in
 political decision-making. Elections held in May 1981 for a
 new national assembly, produced no change in the Communist
 Party's full domination of the political process in Vietnam.
 The voters were allowed few choices from a previously approved
 list of candidates.
 
 
 707
 Although southerners have been appointed to some ministerial
 and national assembly positions, distrust of southerners is
 a significant factor in the delegation of political responsi-
 bilities. Gradual assimilation and co-option appears to be
 the long run strategy with regard to ethnic minorities in
 Vietnam. The SRV has created special schools in the Hanoi
 area to train minority cadres who can be the "eyes and ears"
 of the party among their own people, targeting particularly
 children of Muslim and other religious minority communities.
 Recent party recruitment has focused on the military and
 members of the youth league, with a resulting decline in the
 membership percentage of manual workers, women and ethnic
 minorities. The average age of party members is high--
 currently approximately forty--but new recruitment should
 lower it.
 The Vietnam Federation of Trade Unions, like other "popular"
 institutions in Vietnam, is under the direct and total control
 of the Communist Party. By itself, it has no power to
 establish trade union policies in the SRV. Its primary
 function is to provide a mechanism to disseminate and enforce
 party policies.
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been two brief visits to Vietnam by groups concerned
 about the human rights situation there. An Amnesty Interna-
 tional Delegation visited Vietnam for ten days in December 1979,
 and a small group led by the distinguished jurist Dermot Kinlen
 spent nine days in Vietnam in April 1980, at the invitation of
 Prime Minister Pham Van Dong. Vietnamese government officials
 met with both delegations, and arranged for them to visit
 three reeducation centers and one prison. Both groups visited
 the same facilities, which are also those seen by some journal-
 ists and other visitors. Their reports were published in
 June 1981. Mr. Kinlen concluded "that there is a wholesale
 and widespread violation of human rights in Vietnam." The
 Amnesty International report includes the original report
 submitted to the SRV government in May 1980, which noted
 Amnesty's concern about the continued detention of thousands
 of persons without trial and the absence of adequate legal
 safeguards concerning arrest and detention. The published
 report also includes the Vietnamese government response of
 September 1980, which calls on "different conceptions of
 humanitarianism and human rights" to justify reeducation with-
 out legal process as "an extremely humanitarian system"
 because the detained person is spared "a tarnished judiciary
 record." Amnesty replied in December 1980, that detention
 without trial is contrary to the widely accepted principle of
 presumptive innocence. In its final comment in March 1981,
 the SRV invoked the precedent of the Nuremberg international
 tribunal to justify as "legitimate and legal" the retroactive
 application of Hanoi's laws against high-ranking members of
 the former Saigon administration .and army, whom it described
 as having "collaborated with the enemy with a view to con-
 sciously betraying their homeland."
 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 Economic development continues to be thwarted by the impact of
 sporadic attempts to socialize southern agricultural produc-
 tion, by output loss from the flight and expulsion of skilled
 and entrepreneurial workers, by the cost of maintaining
 defenses against China, as well as by the conflict in
 
 
 708
 Kampuchea, which requires the regime to divert resources and
 personnel to the war effort. To try to meet its trade
 deficit, the regime has exported some scarce domestically
 produced agricultural and other consumer goods. There have
 been some recent press and other reports that the SRV will
 try to offset its trade deficit with the Soviet Union and
 some Eastern European countries through arrangements to
 deduct part of the salaries of Vietnamese workers sent to
 these countries, ostensibly for training.
 In 1981, government efforts to encourage agricultural produc-
 tion have had some results, primarily due to better weather,
 but also aided by such policies as production incentives,
 including permission to sell privately produce in excess of
 assigned production quotas. The continuing threat of
 collectivization and the lack of food and other consumer
 goods on which to spend any earnings has limited the effective-
 ness of these incentives, however. Agricultural output has
 been reduced further by continuing natural calamities,
 particularly a series of devastating typhoons late in 1980.
 This accumulation of man-made and natural disasters will
 require Hanoi to import some three to four million tons of
 foodstuffs in 1981. The heavy burden of inflation on city
 dwellers, especially government cadre and proletariat, is
 reflected in increased corruption, moonlighting and crime.
 The corruption in turn increases the burden on the average
 citizen, who frequently must bribe officials to obtain
 public services and official documents. Hanoi's determina-
 tion to integrate the south into a united, collectivized
 Vietnam has brought hardship there. Sporadic attempts to
 collectivize agriculture in the south and efforts to control*
 the marketing of food products have contributed to the food
 shortage by reducing the incentives for production and
 disestablishing traditional distribution mechanisms. Hanoi
 now has announced a new collectivization push for the rice-
 rich Mekong Delta. Collectivization of the fishing industry
 and nationalization of most seagoing boats has lowered
 fishermens' income severely; according to some reports,
 70 percent of the catch is taken in taxes. The fishing in-
 dustry has been further curtailed by severe government
 limits on the amount of fuel and water taken on fishing
 trips, measures taken to prevent refugee escapes, and by
 depletion of the fishing fleet through loss of boats to
 refugee flight.
 Because of the food shortages brought on by economic
 policies, diversion of resources to Hanoi's Kampuchean
 adventure and natural disasters, rice and meat rations have
 been reduced drastically. The families of draft dodgers
 and deserters from the armed forces as well as most family
 members of boat escapees and those people returning with-
 out permission from forced resettlement in NEZ's have been
 removed from food distribution lists. Sales of government
 food continue to be restricted to cadres and certain govern-
 ment employees and their families, whose income levels remain
 static. Most people, therefore, are required to buy food on
 the free market, where prices are accelerating rapidly.
 The ethnic Chinese, who account for about half the total
 number of refugees, are discriminated against severely
 through denial of employment and educational opportunities.
 Former ARVN officers systematically are denied employment
 and the children of former GVN officials (beth military and
 civilian) are blocked from university education by a review
 of family background which weeds out all "unreliable ele-
 ments." Persons released from reeducation centers are
 subject to severe restrictions on employment and travel.
 
 
 709
 The level of health care has declined steadily since 1975.
 The severe shortage of medical facilities and medicines has
 been aggravated by the need to divert material and person-
 nel for the care of soldiers wounded in Kampuchea. There
 are distinct levels of treatment for different levels of
 cadres, and only the most minimal facilities are available
 for the average worker. Ordinary peasants and workers must
 purchase medical prescriptions on the open market, unlike
 cadre who have access to free or government subsidized
 prescriptions. The resulting underdosing of serious com-
 municable diseases such as tuberculosis has raised the
 prospect of development of drug resistant disease strains.
 Basic economic and social figures for Vietnam include: a
 population growth rate of 2.9 percent for the 70's, down
 from 3.1 percent for the previous decade; life expectancy at
 birth of 63 years (1979); and an infant mortality rate of 62
 per 1,000 in the first year. In 1976 adult literacy was
 estimated at 87 percent, and virtually all children of
 primary school age of both sexes were in school. Chronic
 food shortages and maldistribution limited daily per capita
 calorie intake to 83 percent of requirements in the 1976-
 1979 period, and may now be even further below minimum
 standards.
