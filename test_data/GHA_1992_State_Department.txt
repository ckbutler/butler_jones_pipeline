 GHANA
 Ghana was governed throughout 1992 by the Provisional National Defense Coun-
 cil (PNDC) under the chairmanship of Flight Lieutenant (Retired) Jerry John
 Rawlings, who seized power from an elected government on December 31, 1981, and
 suspended the Constitution. Under the Establishment Proclamation of January 11,
 1982, the PNDC exercised "all powers of government.* In addition to Chairman
 Rawlings, the PNDC consisted of 7 members, of whom 1 was a serving military offi-
 cer and 6 were civilians. The executive branch consisted of ministries headed by sec-
 retaries, who together constituted a committee of secretaries, chaired by a PNDC
 member, that drafted laws for referral to the PNDC for final consideration and ap-
 proval. All senior national, regional, and district officials were appointed by the
 PNDC.
 During 1992, the pace of a democratization process announced in 1991 accelerated
 noticeably, culminating in a presidential election on November 3 and a parliamen-
 tary election on December 29. International observers were present for the presi-
 dential elections. The new Government was inaugurated on January 7, 1993. De-
 spite serious irregularities, most international observers accepted the validity of the
 results of the presidential election, although the opposition political parties did not.
 The opposition parties boycotted the parliamentary elections in pretest over what
 they claimed was massive fraud in the presidential election and because they said
 the parliamentary elections would not be free and fair.
 Ghana's military forces number about 8,000 to 10,000. The several security orga-
 nizations report to various departments of Government, but all come under the con-
 trol of the PNDC. Most security cases of a political nature are handled by the Bu-
 reau of National Investigation (BNI). All security agencies report to the PNDC
 Member for Foreign Affairs and National Security. Total military expenditures for
 1989, the last year for which the US. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency con-
 ducted a detailed analysis, were $30 million. There is no indication that efforts will
 be made in the near future to reduce these expenditures, which include the costs
 of Ghana's participation in the regional peacekeeping force in Liberia and in the
 United Nations' peacekeeping forces in Lebanon and Cambodia. There were occa-
 sional credible reports of police brutality and mistreatment of prisoners.
 Although Ghana is attempting to rebuild its industrial base after years of eco-
 nomic mismanagement, more than 60 percent of the population still draws its liveli-
 hood from agriculture. Gold, cocoa (and cocoa products), timber, and diamonds are
 major sources of export revenues. Annual economic growth has averaged 5 percent
 since the inception of an economic recovery program in 1983.
 Although there clearly were still problems, such as the Government's replacement
 of two repressive laws with one which allowed preventive detention, the human
 rights situation in Ghana improved during 1992. The Newspaper Licensing Law was
 repealed, and independent newspapers flourished, most of them outspokenly critical
 of the PNDC. However, one newspaper editor was found guilty and sentenced to 18
 months in prison under the Criminal Libel Law. The state-owned media began to
 give objective coverage to opposition groups and to publish occasional editorials criti-
 cizing the Government. Government opponents voiced their opinions in seminars,
 press conferences, speeches, and political rallies. Despite these improvements, the
 maintenance of a preventive detention law, the continued holding of political detain-
 ees and prisoners, the past human rights record of the PNDC Government, and the
 Government's refusal to consult with political parties until after they had protested
 the results of the presidential election contributed to opposition distrust of the Gov-
 ernment and cast a shadow over the democratization process.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated or other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-No politically motivated disappearances were reported.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were occasional credible reports of mistreatment of prisoners, including soli-
 tary confinement for long periods and the incarceration of prisoners without clothes
 in dark, small cells without proper beds. Prisons in Ghana are antiquated and seri-
 ously overcrowded, and conditions are harsh. From time to time, the PNDC com-
 muted the sentences of ill or aged prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Criminal Code provides minimal
 legal protection against arbitrary arrest and detention. Although accused persons
 have the right to be charged formally within 48 hours of detention, the court has
 unlimited discretion regarding the setting of bail. It may refuse to release prisoners
 on bail and instead remand them without charge for an indefinite period, subject
 to weekly review by judicial authorities. The only crimes for which, by statute there
 is no bail are mu;er and subversion. PNDC Law 4 (Preventive Custody Law of
 1982), which provided for indefinite detention without trial if the PNDC determined
 it in the interest of national security, was repealed in October. Also repealed was
 an amendment to 1984 PNDC Law 91 (the Habeas Corpus Act) which prevented
 any judicial inquiry into the grounds for detention under PNDC Law 4.
 These two laws were replaced by Public Order Law No 2 which allows the Sec-
 retary of Interior to order any person detained for up to 14 days in order to prevent
 armed robbery, ethnic conflict, or disruption of public order. he detention may be
 renewed up to a total of 28 days unless a special review court of three superior court
 iustices appointed by the Chief Justice orders a longer detention. There is no other
 judicial review of cases under this law. Persons held under prvisions of Public
 Order Law No. 2 must be informed of the grounds on which they are being held,
 next of kin must be notified, and access to the detainees must be granted within
 48 hours of the detention.
 Ghanaian security forces occasionally take persons into custody without warrants
 and hold them incommunicado for extended periods of time, with no legal recourse
 available to the detainee. The threat of such treatment is a deterrent to political
 or other opposition activities. After a series of bombings in Accra, several people
 were detained, not because they were suspected of direct involvement, but because
 they had contact with the accused author of the bombings. Those detained included
 two of the acused's wives, as well as opposition figures Johnny Hansen and Kwesi
 Pratt, and defeated presidential candidate Albert Adu Boahen. While most were re-
 leased within hours, Hansen was held without charge a number of days in excess
 of the time permitted by Public Order Law No. 2
 Following the disputed presidential election, opposition figures claimed that party
 supporters were aitraiy arrsted, primarily in the Kumasi area. A government-
 owned newspaper reported that 50 people were arrested by security agents in the
 Kumasi area.
 The exact number of long-term political prisoners and detainees at the end of
 1992 was unknown; the best estimates indicate 50 to 70. It is difficult to determine
 how many of the 50 to 70 long-term detainees are political detainees. The Govern-
 ment claims that 26 are held on criminal charges and 16 in connection with coup
 attempts. The Movement for Freedom and Justice (MFJ) and several international
 human rights groups published lists of detainees during 1991. In March 1992 the
 PNDC released 17 political detainees and prisoners. However, other individuals
 were often detained for a few days to a few weeks for a variety of reasons and then
 released. The PNDC announced that all persons currently being held in prison had
 either been convicted or were awaiting trial on criminal or national security
 charges. Thus, many are still being denied a speedy, fair, and public trial.
 The Government does not'practice forced exile. In recent years the PNDC has
 quietly encouraged Ghanaians, including dissidents with valuable skills who are liv-
 in   r oa to return; in some cases the Government has offered amnesty. Some
 fomrgovernment and PNDC officials have returned and resumed careers outside
 politics, apparently without difficulties.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria.-Three court systems exist in Ghana. In the
 "prerevolutionary" court system, traditional legal safeguards are based on British
 legal procedures. Trials are public, and defendants have a right to
 be represented by an attorney, to present evidence, and to cross-examine witnesses.
 This system includes high courts, appeals courts, and the Supreme Court headed
 by a Chief Justice. There are limitations, however, in the independence of these
 
 
 courts. In the past the PNDC summarily dismissed judges, thereby reminding them
 that they served at the PNDC's sufferance. In 1989 the Government reconstituted
 the Judicial Council but confined it to an advisory role for judicial appointments and
 disciplinary matters. The judiciary is still not independent.
 A separate public tribunal system at the national and regional levels was set up
 by the _PNDC in 1982 to bypass the regular court system and speed up the judicial
 process by restricting the procedural rights of defendants. The public tribunals de-
 pend largely on *udges with little or no legal experience, and they shortcut legal
 safeguards and de process to provide "rough and ready" decisions, particularly in
 criminal cases. This system includes the O ice of Revenue Commissioners, the Na-
 tional Investigations Committee (established by PNDC Law 2 with the power to in-
 vestigate virtually any allegation referred to it by the PNDC), the Special Military
 Tribunal, and the Public Tribunals Board. Kwesi Pratt and Albert Adu Boahen were
 charged with obstruction of justice for refusing to testify before a public tribunal in
 the trial of those charged with planting four bombs in Accra (see Section 1.d.). They
 contended that public tribunals do not provide adequate safeguards for human
 rights.
 ithe past, the PNDC normally avoided bringing political and security cases to
 trial, preferring to keep suspected opponents in indefinite detention. Under the
 terms of the Habeas Corpus Act (PNDC Law 91), repealed in October, the PNDC
 maintained and exercised the right to detain indefinitely any citizen without divulg-
 ing the grounds for the detention or initiating criminal proceedings. PNDC Law 24
 empowers public tribunals to impose the death penalty for any crime specified a
 capital offense by the PNDC or if the tribunal determines that it is merited by a
 particular case, even if the crime is not punishable by the death penalty under regu-
 ar statutes. There are no known instances of this law being used. No appeals were
 permitted until 1985, when the National Appeals Tribunal was created. The Ghana
 Bar Association has elected not to practice before the public tribunals.
 The Chieftaincy Act of 1971 gives village and other traditional chiefs powers in
 local matters, including authority to enforce customary tribal laws dealing with such
 subjects as divorce, child-custody, and property disputes.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Citizens
 engaged in activity deemed objectionable by the Government are subject to surveil-
 lance, including monitoring of telephones and mail. There is no recourse if a govern-
 ment agency wiretaps or interferes with private correspondence. In past years,
 forced entry into homes has been reported in connection with security investiga-
 tions.
 Despite efforts to redefine the role of the local Committees for the Defense of the
 Revolution (CDR's), which previously functioned as neighborhood watch committees
 reporting political activity to the Government, there continue to be credible reports
 of CDR interference in private and tribal matters. There also are credible reports
 of CDR interference in the free and fair conduct of the November presidential elec-
 tion.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Newspaper Licensing Law, which pro-
 scribed criminal or so-called intentional libel and placed a limit on freedom of
 speech and the press, was repealed in 1992. Scores of independent newspapers ap-
 peared, and these, plus some established independent papers, have been outspoken
 in their criticism of the PNDC. Also, the opposition parties and organizations such
 as the Ghana Bar Association, the Movement for Freedom and Justice, the Trades
 Union Congress (TUC), the National Union of Ghanaian Students (NUGS), and oth-
 ers have been outspoken in their criticism of the Government.
 The Government owns the radio and television stations and the two principal
 daily newspapers. Reporting in the official media accentuates the positive aspects
 of government policies but also covers selected instances of corruption and mis-
 management in government ministries and state-owned enterprises. In general, the
 government-owned media did not carry criticism of government policies or of Chair-
 man Rawlings and PNDC members. In 1992 the state-owned media began more ob-
 jective efforts at coverage of opposition activities. However, journalists are occasion-
 ally subject to discipline or dismissal by the Government for publishing articles
 deemed unacceptable. As a result, self-censorship is a pattern in the official media,
 and writers, editors, and commentators rarely cross the boundary of acceptable re-
 porting and commentary.
 Foreign periodicals are sold in Accra and other major cities. Issues containing ar-
 ticles critical of the Government circulate freely. Western journalists can more rou-
 tinely secure visas and press credentials than was the case a few years ago.
 
 
 In general, the PNDC has not suppressed freedom of speech, press, or academic
 freedom on university campuses. The NUGS, one of the more vocal critics of the
 PNDC, is tolerated and allowed to organize and hold meetings. There have been sev-
 eral student demonstrations critical of the PNDC, but the Government has not
 taken any action against the student groups.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom of assembly and asso-
 ciation is restricted. People generally are free to organize indoor gatherings, wheth-
 er formal or informal, but permits are required for public meetings or demonstra-
 tions held outdoors. Since the ban on political parties was lifted on May 18, the op-
 position parties have had little difficulty gettin permits. They must, however, no-
 tify the police 48 hours in advance of a rally. Bfore the ban was lifted, a permit
 for an anti-PNDC rally was denied, and a massive police presence prevented the il-
 legal march. There was no violence. Other rallies were allowed.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is no state-favored religion. Ghanaians are pre-
 dominantly Christian, and Christians of all sects as well as Muslims are well rep-
 resented at all levels of Government. There are no apparent advantages or dis-
 advantages attached to membership in any particular sect or religion.
 Foreign missionary groups have generally operated throughout the country with
 a minimum of formal restrictions, although some churches have had difficulty ob-
 taining visas and residence permits for some of their expatriate missionaries.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Ghanaians and foreigners are free to move throughout the country
 without s'cial   rmission. Police checkpoints exist countrywide for the prevention
 of smugg       owever, in 1992 the PNDC ordered most checkpoints to be left un-
 manned during daylight hours. Roadblocks and car searches are a normal part of
 nighttime travel in Acra.
 Aks members of the Economic Community of West African States, Ghanaians may
 travel without visas for up to 90 days in member states. Ghanaians are generally
 free to exerc    iss right, and nationals of other member states are free to travel
 to Ghana. Ghanaians are also free to emigrate or to be repatriated from other coun-
 tries.
 Since the last half of 1990, Ghana has had a growing refugee population. Libe-
 rias fleeing civil war began to arrive in Auguat 1990. By November 1990, Ghana
 was host to some 8,000 Liberian refugees. Most of the new refugees, as well as
 many transiting third-country nationas also fleeing Liberia, were housed by the
 Government with assistance from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refu-
 gees (UNHCR) in a camp 20 kilometers from Accra. An undetermined number of
 refugees have voluntarily returned to Liberia. The estimated camp population is
 currently 6000 to 7,000 inhabitants. In addition, over 15,000 Ghanaans who re-
 sided in Liberia returned to their home villages in Ghana, often imposing great
 strain on government social services.
 During times of inreased tensio i n  dTogo, as many as several thousand Togoles
 flee their own country to seek refuge in Ghana. They generally are received by rel-
 atives and return to their country voluntarily when the tension eases.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Chairman Rawlings and the PNDC exercised total executive, legislative, and ad-
 ministrative authority. However, the p rocess of transition to constitutional rule
 which was begun in January 1991 accelerated in 1992; Rawlings was elected Presi-
 dent on November 3; and parliamentary elections were held on December 29. The
 new Government was inaugurated on January 7, 1993. The Commonwealth Sec-
 retariat, the Carter Center, the Organization of African Unity, Canada, and mem-
 bers of the European Community sent observers to the presidential elections. Ob-
 servers noted significant problems with the electoral process (involving especially
 the voter registration list) but felt that the irregularities did not change the outeome
 of the election. Claiming that the presidential elections had been unfair and that
 any election conducted under the same conditions would be unfair, the opposition
 parties boycotted the parliament  elections.
 Many of the constitutional and legal means to enable Ghanaians to change their
 government through democratic means were in place in 1992. Nonetheless, given
 the falure of the Govement and the opposition parties to reach agreement on the
 implementation of electoral procedures, the election irreglarities, and the opposi-
 tion boycott of the parliamentary elections, it remained to be demonstrated conclu-
 sively that Ghanaans would have the ability to exercise this right.
 The elections were supervised by an nterim  National Electoral Commission
 (INEC) of three full-time and six part-time Commissioners which the PNDC ap-
 pointed in February to supervise the constitutional referendum, the registration of
 
 
 107
 parties, and the elections. The Consultative Assembly finished drafting the Con-
 stitution in March. It was overwhelmingly approved by a referendum in April, de-
 spite widespread criticism of the transition provisions; these provisions provide
 sweeping indemnity for the PNDC and its appointees. In May the PNDC published
 the Political Parties Law and lifted the ban on politics. Although the law was based
 largely on the new Constitution (in effect as of January 7, 1993) and on previous
 election laws, the opposition parties sought an injunction to keep the INEC from op-
 erating under this law. They particularly objected to the specific limit on individual
 campaign contributions, to the prohibition against companies' contributing to cam-
 paignsand to the prohibition against adoptig party names used in previous elec-
 tions. he court ruled against the oppositionparties. However, the PNDC then said
 that the INEC could raise the limit on idividual contributions if it so desired. After
 meetings with the opposition parties the INEC raised the limit significantly.
 The time schedule and many of the laws governin* election procedures were es-
 tablished before the INEC Commissioners were appointed. The IEC believed that
 it could not change these procedures, although it was willing to suggest change to
 the PNDC. For instance, when it became clear that there were serious problems
 with the voters' register, the INEC suggested a reregistration, an option rejected by
 the PNDC. Instead, the INEC launched a cleanup of the register, despite which an
 excess of 1 million names may remain, stemmin from the duplication of some
 names and the inclusion of some persons recently deceased. In the wake of their
 loss in the presidential elections, the opposition parties contended that the excess
 names provided ample opportunity for manipulation of election results.
 The opposition had few specific criticisms of the INEC members. However, be-
 cause the members were appointed without consultation with the opposition and be-
 cause of mutual suspicion and animosity prevalent in the preelectoral period, the
 independence and neutrality of the INEC remains a question mark in the minds of
 many.
 During 1992 the opposition, the TUC, the bar association, the students' union,
 and the major religious groups were highly critical of the PNDC's refusal to consult
 with the opposition. The PNDC's efforts to urge the major religious communities to
 support its economic and social policies have created tensions. Chairman Rawlings
 publicly criticized the Roman Catholic Church for prohibiting its priests from par-
 ticipating in the district assemblies.
 The PNDC's unwillingness to consult prior to maki   decisions regarding the
 transition lessened the credibility of the process, even'itthe decisions themselves
 might have been reasonable. For example, there was considerable criticism of the
 PNDC's method of selecting members for the Consultative Assembly. However, the
 Assembly operated as an independent body, and the PNDC made little effort to in-
 fluence its deliberations except over the indemnity provisions. Indeed, except for the
 indemnity provisions, ihe Consultative Assembly seemed to oppose the PNDC on
 most issues.
 here are no de facto obstacles to women participating in Government. There was
 one woman on the PNDC and several women deputy secretaries.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 At least four human rights organizations were established in Ghana in the past
 18 months, including the Committee on Human and People's Rights and the Bar
 Association Human Rights Committee. The Government has not reacted to this de-
 velopment. The PNDC frequently has shown annoyance at criticism of its human
 rights record from Ghanaian religious organizations and international human rights
 advocates. In 1991 the PNDC invited Amnesty International (Al) to visit Ghana to
 discuss alleged inaccuracies in an Al report. The Government permits prison visits
 by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Although ethnic differences are intentionally played down by the Government, op-
 pnents of the PNDC occasionally complain that the PNDC and the political leader-
 ship are dominated by the Ewe ethnic group from eastern Ghana. Chairman
 Rawlings and a number of his close advisors are Ewe, but many PNDC members
 and secretaries have other ethnic origins. Land disputes led to some ethnic violence.
 The Government has made concerted efforts to improve the status of women, but
 Ghanaian women remain subject to some forms of societal discrimination. In 1985
 the PNDC promulgated four laws that overturned many of the customary, tradi-
 tional, or colonial laws that discriminated against women. These concerned family
 accountability, intestate succession, customary divorce registration, and the admin-
 istration of estates. Women in urban centers and those with skills and training en-
 
 
 108
 counter little overt bias, but resistance to women in nontraditional roles persists.
 Women in the rural agricultural sector remain subject to traditional male domi-
 nance and difficult labor conditions. Statistics show an equal male/female ratio in
 school enrollments in grade 1, dropping to 2 to 1 by grade 6, 4 to 1 at the secondary
 level, and 9 to 1 at umversity level.
 Violence against women (including wife beating) occurs, but since there are no
 statistics or studies available, the extent of the problem is uncertain. Police do not
 normally intervene in domestic disputes, and such cases seldom come before the
 courts. The Government has not addressed the issue of violence against women. The
 practice of female genital mutilation (circumcision) is discouraged but not outlawed.
 ccording to an independent expert in the field, the percentage of Ghanaian women
 who have undergone this procedure may be as high as 30 percent. Such mutilation
 is practiced only in the far northeastern and northwestern parts of the country.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-This right is restricted, as the Trades Union Ordi-
 nance confers broad powers on the Government to refuse to register a trade union.
 However, the PNDC has not interfered with the right of workers to associate in
 trade unions. Civil servants are prohibited by law from joining or organizing a trade
 union. .
 Trade unions-in Ghana and their activities are still governed by the Industrial
 Relations Act (IRA) of 1965. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) has in recent years
 been led by experienced union leaders who, aided by a revised union constitution
 and bylaws, continued to define an autonomous role for the TUC within the PNDC
 regime.
 The right to strike is recognized in law. Under the IRA, the Government estab-
 lished a system of settling disputes, first through conciliation, then arbitration. The
 Government must ap prove any strike but does so rarely, and only in cases where
 conciliation and arbitration fail to produce an agreement. There has been no
 progress in implementing the Government's declared intention to replace this sys-
 tem with labor tribunals to arbitrate industrial disputes certified as deadlocked.
 The TUC is affiliated with the Organization of African Trade Union Unity
 (OATUU), headquartered in Accra. In December 1992, the TUC broke with OATUU
 policy barring affiliations outside the African continent and was accepted as a mem-
 ber of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The IRA provides a frame-
 work for collective bargaining and some protection against antiunion discrimination
 as well. Ghana's trade unions engage in collective bargaining for wages and benefits
 with both private and state-owned enterprises, though in the latter category the
 threat of detention (a common practice in the early 1980's) hangs over union leaders
 to force agreement on issues. No union leaders were detained in recent years for
 union or other activities.
 There are no functioning export processing zones in Ghana.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Ghanaian law prohibits forced
 labor, and it is not known to be practiced. The International Labor Organization
 (ILO) continues to urge the Government to revise various legal provisions that per-
 mit imprisonment with an obligation to perform labor for offenses that are not coun-
 tenanced under ILO Convention 105, ratified by Ghana in 1958.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Labor legislation in Ghana sets
 a minimum employment age of 15 and prohibits night work and certain types of
 hazardous labor for those under 18. In practice, child labor is prevalent, and young
 children of school age can often be found during the day performing menial tasks
 in the market or colecting fares on local buses. Observance of minimum age laws
 is eroded by local custom and economic circumstances that encourage children to
 work to help their families. Violators of regulations prohibiting heavy labor and
 night work or children are occasionally punished. Inspectors from the Ministry of
 Mobilization and Social Welfare arere        or  forcemet
 lations.                         reponsb    fe   o         of cl     la
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-in 1991 minimum standards for wages and
 working conditions were established through a tripartite commission composed of
 representatives of government, labor, and employers. The minimum wage rate com-
 bines wages with customar benefits such as transportation allowances, and other
 salaries are adjusted accordingly, but the existing minimum wage is insufficient for
 a single wage earner to support a family. In most cases households are supported
 by multiple wage earners, some family farming, and other family based commercial
 activities.
 The basic workweek in Ghana is 40 hours. Occupational safety and health regula-
 tions are in effect, and sanctions are occasionally applied through the Labor Depart-
 
 
 ment of the Ministry of Social Welfare. However, safety inspectors are few in num-
 ber and poorly trained. They will take action if matters are called to their attention,
 but lack the resources to seek out violations.
