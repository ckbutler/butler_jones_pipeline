 NIGER
 Niger is governed by an authoritarian military regime with
 power concentrated in the hands of its President, General
 Seyni Kountche. He took power in a military coup in 1974,
 toppling a civilian government which had lost popular support
 because of corruption and inefficiency. Kountche rules by decree,
 and the freedoms of assembly, expression, and political activity
 are restricted. Otherwise, the people are free to pursue their
 private interests including owning property and travelling within
 the country and abroad. Government administration, including the
 legal system, is considered generally fair and moderately effi-
 cient. Violations of the integrity of the individual occur but
 are not widespread. However, in 1983 a student and a labor
 leader died while in detention.
 Landlocked Niger occupies a large area in the arid Sahel region
 of West Africa. The economy is based primarily on subsistence
 farming, livestock, and a few cash crops. In addition, there is
 a mining sector dominated by uranium, of which Niger is one of
 the world's major producers. Poor worldwide prices and demand
 for uranium in recent years have had a serious negative effect
 on the Nigerien economy.
 Pour major ethnic groups, each with its own language, make up the
 bulk of the population. There is little discrimination among the
 ethnic groups, but women generally do not possess full social and
 legal equality with men. Traditional forms of culture are very
 strong. Only a small minority of the entire population benefits
 from a modern education beyond the elementary level, and the
 nation's literacy rate is very low. Islam is by far the dominant
 religion.
 The state of human rights in Niger changed very little in 1983.
 The only significant development was the formation of a National
 Development Council, whose 150 members are either appointed or
 elected indirectly. The creation of this institution is part of
 a phased process which began in 1979 to return the nation to
 civilian, constitutional rule. The Council stands at the apex of
 a structure called the Development Society, which includes
 previously-formed councils at the village, area, and regional
 levels. These councils are designed to elicit grass roots partic-
 ipation in economic and social development decision-making, but
 their role is exclusively advisory. The National Council has the
 additional task of drafting a national charter which will pave the
 way for the writing of a Constitution. The pace of political
 reform in Niger is slow and designed to ensure the creation of a
 constitutional form of Government which has strong popular support
 and can be sustained. The Government wishes to avoid the
 instability and chaos which previously afflicted Niger.
 The future of human rights in Niger will hinge to a great extent
 on how the Kountche government deals with the internal and exter-
 nal threats it perceives. A university student strike in April
 ended in violence and the death of one student. In October, the
 Government was rocked by an attempted coup mounted by individuals
 who appeared to have no particular ideological or foreign policy
 differences with the Kountche government. No harsh repression
 followed either event, but the Government is clearly wary of the
 potential for unrest generated by poor economic conditions,
 Kountche's strict rule, or foreign intervention.

 The threat of Libyan intervention is strong. Colonel Qadhafi,
 the Libyan leader, has stated that Niger will be his next target
 after Chad. He is believed to be behind an assassination attempt
 against Rountche in 1981, and a failed attack on Niger's uranium
 mines in 1982, as well as other anti-Kountche activities. Rela-
 tions between the two countries are understandably poor and are
 not expected to improve. Despite the difficult econonic condi-
 tions, and the intense security preoccupation provoked by the
 Libyan menace, the Kountche government has indicated that plans
 for political reform must proceed.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There were no reports in 1983 of political killings by either the
 Government or terrorist groups. Military and security forces are
 disciplined.
 b. Disappearance
 No disappearances were reported in Niger during 1983.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment is not believed
 to be a major human rights problem, but one student arrested
 during the strike in April died in detention shortly after his
 arrest. A labor official who was arrested following a dispute
 with the head of the security services also died while in deten-
 tion. This individual was known to have been in poor health
 before his arrest and the exact causes of his death are not known.
 It is not known whether the Nigerien government investigated this
 case.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention or Exile
 There were no reports of any private Nigerien citizen being
 detained, punished, or tried for the expression of views critical
 of or different from the Government in 1983. A senior military
 officer who reportedly criticized the Government was arrested
 early in 1983 and remains in detention. It is not known whether
 any formal accusation or trial has taken place. With the Consti-
 tution suspended, there are no specific statutory protections
 against arbitrary arrests or imprisonment, nor does habeas corpus
 exist. Warrants for arrest are not required. The law provides
 for a suspect to be charged within 48 hours, but delays, sometimes
 lasting months, occur as the result of a lack of trained, effi-
 cient legal officials. Over 30 people have been arrested in
 connection with the attempted coup in October, but as of this
 writing, there is no clear indication that they have been
 formally charged, or that they have access to lawyers. The
 Government does not exile dissidents, but some dissidents have
 fled the country for fear of imprisonment.
 
 
 262
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There are public trials for civil and criminal cases not
 involving political acts. Legal counsel is provided for
 indigent defendants accused of felonies or other major offenses
 if they are under 18 years of age, handicapped, or faced with
 the possibility of a sentence of more than 10 years. There is
 sone evidence that courts are subject to political influence, or
 pressure in ordinary civil, or criminal cases. Defendants may
 appeal verdicts first to an appellate court and, if desired,
 to the nation's highest tribunal, the State Court. The State
 Court, however, decides only on the legality of lower court
 decisions, not the decisions themselves. The President has
 the right of pardon in penal cases. Islamic justice is often
 used on a local basis throughout the country for petty crimes.
 The Supreme Court was suspended at the time of the Diori regime
 (1960-1974), and replaced by a State Court, composed of civilian
 magistrates, which serves in the capacity of a Supreme Court
 as a final Court of Appeals. There is also a State Security
 Court which operates outside the legal framework and tries
 political cases. The exact composition of this Court is not
 known, but it is assumed that at least some of its members
 are military. On paper, defendants brought before the State
 Security Court are entitled to counsel. In practice, however,
 a lawyer has never been allowed to represent a client before
 the State Security Court and its proceedings are conducted in
 secrecy. As of this writing, it is expected that such a court
 will try the 30 individuals allegedly involved in the attempted
 coup of October, but there is no confirmation. In any event, such
 trials are held in secret and little is known about their proceed-
 ings.  It is assumed that the Security Court can review sentences
 of a person already in detention but information is not available-
 about rules, or procedures, or if defendents are entitled to
 counsel.
 There are believed to be about 20 political prisoners in Niger.
 Former President Manani Diori remains under house arrest in
 Niamey. Other political prisoners include associates of Diori
 as well as former opposition leader Djibo Bakary. Other members
 of the outlawed Sawaba Party are detained at prisons in Agadez
 and Tillaberi.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The police have the right to enter homes between 5:00 a.m. and
 9:00 p.m. but will enter at other times if they believe they have
 sufficient cause. A court warrant is not required. There have
 been no reports of forced entry or other violations of privacy
 such as monitoring correspondence or the operation of informer
 systems.
 Section 2  Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a.  Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are suppressed. Institutions which might voice
 dissent such as an independent press or a freely elected legisla-
 ture do not exist. The government controlled media allows only
 occasional minor or veiled criticism of government policies or
 
 
 263
 operations. The primary function of the media is to disseminate
 government policies and viewpoints and to engender popular support
 for them as well as for leading government figures such as the
 President and Prime Minister. Nigerien journalists are aware of
 their status as government employees and of the guidelines within
 which they are expected and required to operate. There have been
 no reports of censored, or banned magazines, or other publica-
 tions, but the Government is under no constraints 'should it
 discover material that it deems offensive. Foreign films are
 subject to censorship on the grounds of public morality and
 political content.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Some forms of voluntary association (not political parties) such
 as trade unions, churches, and other religious groups function
 with the understanding they operate consistent with government
 policy. The trade union movement is organized in a confederation
 of 23 unions representing about 30 percent of the salaried workers
 in Niger. Although weak, poorly financed, and subject to
 government influence, the trade union movement is considered
 fairly democratic. Meetings are frequent, and the unions have the
 right to organize, negotiate, and strike even though strikes are
 rare. The Confederation maintains relations with recognized
 international bodies and sends representatives to international
 meetings.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Niger is overwhelmingly Muslim, but Christian churches have
 access to government controlled radio to broadcast their
 services. Several Christians hold high government office.
 Conversion from one religion to another is permitted but
 occurs rarely. There have been no reports of religious discri-
 mination but adherence to Islam, the religion of most of the
 population, tends to give one a slight advantage in all sectors
 of life.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel within Niger is closely monitored, although no special
 travel documents are necessary for internal travel. Police checks
 on the outskirts of all cities and towns have been in place since
 the 1974 coup that brought the current Government into power.
 Nigeriens wishing to travel abroad or emigrate must apply for exit
 visas which are usually granted routinely. The repatriation of
 Nigerien nationals is unrestricted. In early 1983, the Government
 willingly and efficiently repatriated approximately 55,000
 Nigeriens who had been expelled from Nigeria. A small number of
 refugees from other countries have been accepted.
 Section 3  Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Niger i's a military dictatorship with virtually all power con-
 centrated in the hands of the nation's President, General Seyni
 Kountche. He rules in the name of the Supreme Military Council,
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 18
 
 
 264
 a small group of military officers most of whom participated in
 the 1974 coup which brought Kountche to power. Kountche rules
 by decree, makes all government appointments, and decides the
 pace of all political change. While the military remains the
 source of Kountche's power, the number of military officers in
 high positions has declined substantially in recent years. All
 of Niger's seven departments have military governors, but there
 are no military officers in Kountche's cabinet. Government
 operations are conducted largely by civilian technocrats.
 The capacity of the people to influence the Government is
 improving but is still very limited. There are no political
 parties. As an alternative to a party based democracy, the
 Government began in 1979 to create a structure it calls the
 Development Society, a hierarchical network of councils at the
 village, subregional, regional, and national levels. The
 councils at each level contain a mixture of elected and appointed
 members, but only at the village level are the members elected
 directly by the people. At the higher levels, members are elected
 by the members at the next lower level. The precise role of the
 Development Society Councils has yet to be defined in practice.
 Theoretically, their role is to involve the people in econcmic
 development activities. But even then their role is strictly
 advisory, and the Councils have no financial support from the
 central Government. The National Council has the additional
 task of writing a national charter which will pave the way for
 the writing of a Constitution. The Charter, and eventually the
 Constitution, are expected to address the subject of the future
 role of the military and find a formula for more popular
 participation in government.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Niger is not an active participant in regionai and international
 human rights organizations. The Government of Niger has not been
 the subject of resolutions, investigations, or other actions by
 human rights organizations. Amnesty International reported in
 1982 that the Government of Niger still had not responded to a
 1981 request that all political prisoners either be brought to
 trial or released, and in 1983 Amnesty International expressed
 concern about the long-term detentions without trials, ill treat-
 ment of prisoners, and prison conditions. There were no reports
 of visits by international human rights organizations. Within
 Niger there are no government or private organizations which
 monitor human rights or attempts to protect individual liberties.
 Freedom House rated Niger "not free" in 1983.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Niger is one of the world's poorest countries. Most of the
 population of 6,083,000 (1983 est.) live at a subsistence level.
 Gross national product per capita was $345 for 1981. Other social
 indicators are also low. The adult literacy rate is 8 percent.
 Infant mortality is 139 deaths for 1,000 live births. Life
 expectancy is 43 years. On the average, Nigeriens receive 91
 percent of daily nutritional requirements. Given these conditions,
 
 
 265
 the Government has made economic development its top priority.
 The bulk of funds derived from the uranium boom of the late 1970's
 was channeled into projects in health, agriculture, and rural de-
 velopment. Foreign assistance has largely gone to these sectors.
 Substantial progress resulted from these efforts. Economic growth
 rates in the late 1970's kept well ahead of the population growth
 rate of 2.9 percent. However, the current and future economic
 prospects for Niger are decidedly clouded as uranium revenues
 have declined substantially due to a slump in demand and lower
 prices. No improvement in uranium prices is expected, and Niger
 has no other easily exploitable, known mineral resource.   In
 consequence, the Government has cut back economic development
 programs to a fraction of their former size. The one bright spot
 is that continuing improvements in the agricultural sector make it
 possible for Niger to attain food self-sufficiency when rainfall
 is good.
 Less than 30 percent of Niger's 5.8 million people have access to
 any form of modern medical care. Lack of health care combined
 with malnutrition and prevalent diseases like malaria, meningitis,
 diarrhea, and measles lead to high morbidity and mortality rates.
 The'Government has indicated that it is determined to weather the
 difficulties ahead through a program of austerity, more efficient
 management, effective use of foreign assistance, and increased
 efforts to exploit Niger's mineral reserves.
 Niger's social and cultural situation has mixed effects on human
 rights. The bulk of the population lives much as it has for
 centuries. The low literacy and educational levels have made it
 difficult for modern forms of political thought and organization
 to take root. The essentially traditional nature of society
 helps insure that family and ethnic group ties remain strong and
 supportive but traditional attitudes limit movement toward modern-
 ization of the country. The Tuareg group (approximately 12
 percent of the population) remains unconvinced of the value of
 formal education, particularly for females. Women throughout the
 population traditionally have not enjoyed equal rights or
 opportunities. Male children still have a far better chance of
 being educated, and they possess substantially greater property
 rights. In case of divorce, custody of all children under eight
 years of age is given to the husband. Nonetheless, improvements
 in the status of women are being attempted. Some women have been
 promoted to management positions within the administration and
 the Government sponsors and supports the Nigerien Women's
 Association. An Office of Women's Affairs exists in the ministry*
 of Youth, Sports, and Culture. In addition, significant media
 attention is given to successful women in non-traditional
 careers.
 The Government has made a considerable effort to ensure that
 benefits of economic development are fairly distributed through-
 out the population. The largest ethnic group, the Hausa,
 dominates commerce while the second largest group, the Djerma,
 dominates the Government. The nomadic Tuaregs have traditionally
 lived apart from central government authority, but this is
 gradually changing as the Tuaregs begin to see benefits from
 government programs. The Government of Niger is very conscious
 of the need to preserve ethnic harmony, minimize the effects of
 ethnic differences, and work for the equal application of
 justice. As a result of this policy, ethnic tensions are
 currently low.
