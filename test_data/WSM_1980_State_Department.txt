 WESTERN SAMOA
 Western Samoa lies in the Pacific Ocean approximately 5000
 miles southwest of the continental United States and consists
 of two main islands with a population of 152,000. Western
 Samoa became independent on January 1, 1962, ending more than
 40 years of United Nations Trusteeship and league mandate
 rule by New Zealand. Western Samoa's constitution is based
 on the British pattern of parliamentary democracy, modified
 to take into account Samoan customs. Apia, the capital and
 commercial center, is the only major city in the country.
 Samoans have tended to retain their traditional ways despite
 exposure to European influence for more than 150 years.
 Most Samoans live within the traditional social system based
 on the "Aiga," or extended family group, headed by a "Matai,"
 or Chief. The Legislative Assembly ("Fono") has 47 members,
 45 of which are elected by Matai suffrage on a territorial
 basis. There are some 10-12,000 Matais who are eligible to
 vote for members of the Fono. The present head of state
 holds his position for life; future heads of state will be
 elected by the Legislative Assembly for five-year terms.
 The constitution establishing the system was overwhelmingly
 adopted by a universal suffrage plebiscite conducted under
 United Nations supervision in 1961.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by law in Western Samoa. Article 7
 of the constitution of Western Samoa ensures that "no person
 shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading
 treatment or punishment." This is observed in practice by
 reason of law and custom.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 All are illegal and not practiced or condoned. Treatment
 of prisoners is fair and humane.
 c. Disappearances
 There are no secret arrests or detentions in Western Samoa.
 d. Arbitrary Arrrest and Imprisonment
 There are no political prisoners in Wester Samoa. Habeas
 corpus exists and is honored in practice. Preventive
 detention does not exist. Suspects must be charged within
 twenty-four hours following an arrest. Prison conditions
 do not appear to be harsh. Persons awaiting sentence-are
 housed in the same detention facilities with those already
 convicted and serving time. Most Samoans who are jailed
 have been convicted of relatively minor crimes such as petty
 theft, and their terms of sentence are short. There are,
 however, at least three cases of individuals who have been
 sentenced to death and who are awaiting word on whether their
 sentences will be commuted. In at least one case, the
 individual has been waiting for this decision since 1978.
 With this exception, there are no lengthy delays between
 arrest, arraignment, and trial. Local custom (Ifoga) is
 taken into account in sentencing.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to fair public trial is guaranteed by law and is
 honored in practice. Defendants may be represented by
 counsel and assessors are provided to assist in cases
 involving traditional matters. Charges are filed within
 twenty-four hours following arrests and are formally and
 clearly stated. The Judiciary is independent of the
 Executive. There are no political, security, or military
 courts.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 There is respect for the sanctity of the home and search
 warrants are required as a matter of law. The Samoan
 constitution does not specifically refer to illegal entry,
 but Article 14 provides for the protection from invasion
 or seizure of property without due process of law. Local
 custom dictates that this law be respected.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter,'Health Care
 and Education
 Samoans have the right to own property and are offered
 protection of law by Article 14 as noted above. Most land
 ownership is held communally by the extended family group
 (Aiga) on which Samoan society is based. With some cash
 cropping, Western Samoa is able to provide adequate food
 and shelter and a reasonable standard of health care for
 its people. Education is free (compulsory from ages 7-15)
 and local schools are supplemented by mission schools. Some
 Western Samoans travel abroad for secondary schooling,
 technical studies, and university education. As of 1978,
 the gross national product of Western Samoa was $70 million,
 with a per capita income of $450. Industrial development
 since independence has been modest. Tourism renders
 considerable support to the economy and continues to grow
 in volume.
 Current statistical data on vital needs mentioned above are
 not available. As Samoan society centers around the extended
 family and communal village life, woman normally work within
 the home. However, women do frequently serve as "Matai," or
 head of an extended family grouping, on an equal basis with
 men. The Samoan parliament whose members represent various
 districts, is elected by the Matais.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Article 13 of the Samoan constitution guarantees freedom of
 speech, assembly, association, movement and residence.
 Article 11 guarantees freedom of thought, conscience, and
 religion. These rights are respected in practice.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Western Samoans are free to travel within the country and
 abroad. Rights of emigration and repatriation are respected.
 There are no refugees in Western Samoa.

 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The primary basis for suffrage is the Matai system. The
 title of Matai is conferred upon any eligible member of an
 extended family group. Two members of the parliament are
 elected by universal adult suffrage by people lacking family
 group ties. New Matai titles are constantly being created,
 the number having more than doubled since independence.
 Matais traditionally consult with their "Aiga" before making
 decisions for the groups. Most Samoans actively support
 the Matai system. Members of parliament serve for three
 years. Women have equal standing in the political process
 and are particularly active in community affairs. There is
 presently one female member of parliament. Females also
 serve in many other public offices.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No requests for investigations have been made to the
 Western Samoan government. Western Samoa has not acceded
 to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
