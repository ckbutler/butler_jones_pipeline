 SAINT LUCIA
 St. Lucia is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy and a member of the Com-
 monwealth of Nations. The Government comprises a prime minister, a cabinet, and
 a bicameral legislative assembly. A Governor General, appointed by the British
 monarch, is the titular head of state, with largely ceremonial powers. In general
 elections in May, the St. Lucia Labour Party (SLP) defeated the incumbent United
 Workers Party (UWP), gaining 16 of 17 seats in the House of Assembly. Dr. Kenny
 Anthony of the SLP assumed the p rime ministership from the UW s Dr. Vaughan
 Lewis, who had taken over from lon-serving UWP Prime Minister John Compton
 in March 1996. The judiciary is independent.
 The Royal Saint Lucia Police is the only security force and includes a small unit
 called the Special Services Unit (which has some paramilitary training) and a coast
 guard unit. Although the police have traditionally demonstrated a high degree of re-
 spect for human rights, there were allegations of abuse by police and prison officials.
 The economy is based on tourism and on the export of bananas, which represent
 the principal sources of foreign exchange earnings. Saint Lucia is diversifying its
 economy into other types of agriculture, light manufacturing, and construction. Un-
 employment, estimated at 20 percent, remains a source of potential instability.
 The authorities generally respected human rights. Government criticism of the
 media and pressure on antigovernment radio stations under the UWP, occasional
 credible allegations of physical abuse of suspects or prisoners, very poor prison con-
 ditions, domestic violence against women, and child abuse represented the major
 problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution specifically prohibits torture, and there were no reports of such
 abuse. However, many criminal convictions
 in recent years have been based on confessions, which may reflect an effort by
 police to force confessions rather than rely on criminal cases, which could be subject
 to long judicial delays and procedural obstacles. The Crusader newspaper reported
 one such incident in February, in which the police severely beat a suspect while
 questioning him regarding a passenger van's stolen windscreen. The article included
 the medical examiner's report, which revealed multiple marks of violence.
 The island's only prison, built in the 1800's to house a maximum of 101 prisoners,
 was subject to severe overcrowding with over 400 inmates. Very poor prison condi-
 tions led to a prison riot in June; prisoners set fires that destroyed over half the
 antiquated prison. The inmates asserted that the fires were part of a protest for im-
 provements in conditions at the prison. Following the fire, about 250 inmates were
 transferred to a factory shell outside the capital pending repairs to the existing pris-
 on. The Government appointed a new board whose function is to hear prisoners'
 complaints of abuse. The Government also is considering construction of a new facil-
 ity. Prison guards are generally well-trained.
 The Government permits prison visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Government adheres to the constitu-
 tional provisions prohibiting arbitrary arrest or imprisonment and requiring a court
 hearing within 72 hours after detention. However, the authorities have frequently
 held prisoners for years "on remand" after charging them (there is no constitutional
 requirement for a speedy trial).
 
 
 There were no reports of forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and it is independent in practice.
 There are two levels of courts: Courts of summary jurisdiction (magistraes
 courts) and the High Court. Both levels have civil and criminal authority. The lower
 courts accept civil claims up to about $1,900 (EC$5,000) in value, and criminal cases
 generally classified as "petty." The upper court has unlimited authority in both civil
 and criminal cases. All cases can be appealed to the Eastern Caribbean Court of Ap-
 peal. Cases may be appealed to the Privy Council in London as the final court of
 appeal.
 The Constitution requires public trials before an independent and impartial court
 and, in cases involving capital punishment, provision of legal counsel for those who
 cannot afford a defense attorney. In criminal cases not involving capital punish-
 ment, defendants must obtain their own legal counsel. Defendants are entitled to
 select their own legal counsel, are presumed innocent until proven guilty in court,
 and have the right of appeal. The authorities observe both constitutional and statu-
 tory requirements for fair public trials.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices. Government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanctions.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-St. Lucian governments have generally re-
 spected constitutional provisions for free speech and press. However, the UWP Gov-
 ernment occasionally demonstrated hostility to elements of the print and electronic
 media, resulting in the closure of Radio St. Lucia and Radyo Koulibwi in 1996. Ac-
 cording to the Observer newspaper, Radyo Koulibwi was seen as facilitating
 antigovernment sentiments through its talk-show format. This government action
 did not appear to affect the overall degree of press freedom.
 Five privately owned newspapers, two privately owned radio stations, and one
 partially government-funded' radio station operate in St. Lucia. They carry a wide
 spectrum of political opinion and are often critical of the Government. The radio sta-
 tions have discussion and call-in programs that allow people to express their views.
 The two local television stations are also privately owned and cover a wide range
 of views. In addition, people can subscribe to cable television service, which provides
 programming from a variety of sources.
 The Government does not restrict academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of association and assembly, andthe Government generally respects these
 rights in practice. The law requires permits for public meetings and demonstrations
 if they are to be held in public places, such as on streets or sidewalks or in parks.
 The police routinely grant such permits; the rare refusal generally stems from the
 failure of organizers to request the permit in a timely manner, normally 48 hours
 before the event.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this rioght in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 Sicts them in practice.
 No formal government policy toward refugee or asylum requests exists. The issue
 of the prvision of first asylum did not arise. There were no reports of forced expul-
 sion of anyone having a valid claim to refugee status; however, government practice
 remains undefined.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to che an           a   nd exercised that right vigor-
 ously in May when the SLP defeated the UWP, which had governed with only one
 interruption since 1964. The SLP won 16 of 17 seats, campaigning on a platform
 of job creation and economic diversification and appealing explicitly to women and
 younger voters. In response to concerns about the size of the SLP's parliamentary
 majority, Prime Minister Anthony publicly emphasized that the Government will
 make efforts to reach out to the opposition to ensure that the country's democratic
 traditions are not undermined by the small size of the parliamentary opposition.
 The 1996 merger of smaller parties--the Concerned Citizens' Movement, the St.
 Lucia Freedom Party, and the Citizens' Democratic Party-into the SLP left the
 country with only two major political parties.

 Under the Constitution, general elections must be held at least every 5 years by
 secret ballot, but may be held earlier at the discretion of the government in power.
 Two members of the Senate are independent, appointed by the Governor General.
 The Governor General, George Mallet, who had been affiliated with the UWP,
 stepped down following the elections, and the Prime Minister has indicated his suc-
 cessor should be nonpolitical.
 There are no impediments to participation by women and minorities in govern-
 ment. Two of the 13 members of the new Cabinet are women. However, women and
 minorities are not represented in numbers proportional to their share of the popu-
 lation.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While there are no local human rights groups, there are no governmental restric-
 tions that would prevent their formation.
 Following the prison riot in June (see Section 1.c.), the Government invited Carib-
 bean human rights monitors, including Penal Reform International, to investigate
 prison conditions. A report on the results of that investigation is expected in early
 1998.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status                         T
 Government policy is nondiscriminatory in the areas of housing, jobs, education,
 and opportunity for advancement. There are no legal restrictions on the role of
 women or minorities.
 Women.-There is increased awareness of the seriousness of violence against
 women. The Government does not prosecute crimes of violence against women un-
 less the victim herself presses charges. If the victim chooses for any reason not to
 press charges, the Government cannot bring a case. Charges must be brought under
 the ordinary Civil Code. The police force conducts some training for police officers
 responsible for investigating rape and other crimes against women. Police and
 courts enforce laws to protect women against abuse, although police are hesitant to
 intervene in domestic disputes, and many victims are reluctant to report cases of
 domestic violence and rape or to press charges.
 The 1994 Domestic Violence Act allows a judge to issue a protection order prohib-
 iting an abuser from entering or remaining in the place where the victim is. It also
 allows the judge to order that an abuser's name be removed from housing leases
 or rental agreements, with the effect that the abuser would no longer have the right
 to live in the same residence as the victim.
 The Saint Lucia Crisis Center monitors cases of abuse (physical and emotional)
 and helps its clients deal with such problems as incest, nonpayment of child sup-
 port, alcohol and drug abuse, homelessness, custody, and visitation rights. The
 group has publicized the plight of battered women and has protested the rare
 deaths of women who were victims of domestic violence. The Crisis Center is also
 working to establish a shelter for battered women and homeless girls. Some second-
 ary schools address the problem of sexual harassment and battering in their cur-
 riculum topics.
 The Minister for Women's Affairs is responsible for protecting women's rights in
 domestic violence cases and preventing discrimination against women, including
 equal treatment in employment.
 Children.-Since independence, successive governments have given high priority
 to improving educational opportunities and health care for the nation's children.
 Education is free and compulsory from age 5 through 15. Government clinics pro-
 vide prenatal care, immunization, child health care, and health education services
 throughout the island.
 A broad legal framework exists for the protection of children through the Criminal
 Code, the Children and Young Persons Act, the Family Court Act, the Domestic Vio-
 lence Act, and the Attachment of Earnings Act. Although the Government adopted
 a national plan of action in November 1991 for the survival, protection, and develop-
 ment of children, the Government has not fulfilled this program by implementing
 effective programs. The St. Lucia Crisis Center reports that the incidence of child
 abuse remains high.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no specific legislation protecting the rights of
 the disabled, nor mandating provision of access to buildings or government services
 for them. There is no rehabilitation facility for the physically disabled, although the
 Health Ministry operates a community-based rehabilitation program in residents'
 homes. There are schools for the deaf and for the blind up to the secondary level.
 
 
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution specifies the right of workers to
 form or belong to trade unions under the broader rubric of the right of association.
 Most public sector employees are unionized; about 20 percent of the total work force
 is unionized. Unions are independent of government, and are free to choose their
 own representatives in often vigorously contested elections. There are no restrictions
 on the formation of national labor federations. In 1994 several of the major unions
 formed an umbrella grouping called the Industrial Solidarity Pact. Unions are free
 to affiliate with internationalorganizations, and some have done so.
 Strikes in both the public and private sectors are legal, but there are many ave-
 nues through collective bargaining agreements and government procedures which
 may preclude a strike. The law prohibits members of the police and fire depart-
 ments from striking. Other "essential services" workers-water and sewer authority
 workers electric utility workers, nurses, and doctors-must give 30 days' notice be-
 fore strikig.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have the legal right
 to engage in collective bargaining, and they fully exercise this right. Union rep-
 resentatives have reported attempts by government and other employers to under-
 mine this process.
 The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers, and there are effective
 mechanisms for resolving complaints. It also requires that employers reinstate
 workers fired for union activities.
 Labor law is applicable in the export processing zones (EPZ's), and there are no
 administrative or legal impediments to union organizing or collective bargaining in
 those zones. In practice, however, many firms resist union efforts to organize in the
 EPZ's, even to the point of closing operations.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Government prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and it is not known to occur. While there is no specific prohibi-
 tion of forced or bonded labor by children, there were no reports of such practices.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Gov-
 ernment does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded labor by children, but such
 practices are not known to occur (see Section 6.c.). The Children and Young Persons
 Act stipulates a minimum legal working age of 14 years. Ministry of Labor officials
 are responsible for enforcing the law. There were no reports of violations of child
 labor laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Wages Regulations (Clerks) Orders, in ef-
 fect since 1985, set out minimum wage rates only for clerks. These office workers
 receive a legislated minimum wage of about $300 (EC$800) per month. The mini-
 mum wage is not sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker sup-
 porting a four-person family, but some categories of workers receive more than the
 legal minimum for clerks, which is used only as a guide for setting pay for other
 professions.
 There is no legislated workweek, although the common practice is to work 40
 hours in 5 days. Special legislation covers hours which shop assistants, agricultural
 workers, domestics, and young people in industrial establishments may work.
 Occupational health and safety regulations are relatively well developed. The
 Labor Ministry periodically inspects health and safety conditions at places of em-
 ployment under the Employees Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1985. The
 Ministry enforces the act through threat of closure of the business if it discovers vio-
 lations and the violator does not correct them. Workers are free to leave a dan-
 gerous workplace situation without jeopardy to continued employment.
