 ALBANIA*
 Albania is a small, isolated, Balkan nation of about 2.8
 million people. Since the close of World War II, it has
 been ruled by a dictatorship professing a Marxist-
 Leninist ideology. Over much of this period, Albania has,
 in effect, been under the autocratic personal rule of Enver
 Hoxha. Albanian Prime Minister Mehmet Shehu was reported
 dead in December 1981. Rumors that he either was
 assassinated or committed suicide still persist. Shehu's
 passing fueled speculation that Albania might be entering a
 period of political change. Despite his advancing age,
 however, Hoxha appeared in firm control of the country at
 year's end.
 The ruling Albanian Workers' Party and the Government
 maintain rigid, pervasive control over nearly all aspects
 of life in Albania, severely restricting the exercise of
 political and civil rights. For most Albanians, contact
 with foreigners, or with the outside world in general, is
 extremely limited. There continue to be reports of serious
 human rights violations in Albania. Arbitrary arrest and
 imprisonment for political deviation seems commonplace, and
 there are unconfirmed reports of the use of torture.
 Albania is a self-proclaimed atheist state, and the
 exercise or advocacy of religion is punished severely. It
 has not signed the Final Act of the Conference on Security
 and Cooperation in Europe done at Helsinki in 1975. There
 were few observable changes in Albania's human rights
 record or practices in 1982.
 Hoxha's tight internal rule is reflected in Albania's
 foreign policy, which steers a highly autarchic course.
 Albania has shunned involvement with the United States and
 with the Soviet Union. Since its break with China in 1978,
 Albania has followed an essentially 'go-it-alone" course,
 the net effect of which has been to continue to isolate it
 from contact with the outside world -- to the detriment of
 education, medicine, industry, and the arts, as well as
 civil and political rights.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 Reliable information on the possible use of killing by the
 Government for political motives is not available. In the
 past, however,, there have been reports -- largely
 unconfirmed -- of summary.executions. Under the present
 * The United.State does not have diplomatic relations with
 Albania,:nor has it had official representatives in that
 country since 1946. This fact makes it difficult for the
 US Government to comment authoritatively on conditions in
 Albania.

 penal code, Albanian courts may impose the death penalty
 for a number of political offenses, including agitation
 and propaganda against the state, incitement of hatred or
 quarrels between nationalities and races, creation of a
 counter-revolutionary organization or participation
 therein, activity against the revolutionary movement of
 the working class, and refusal to carry out a duty or
 coercing others to refuse.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no reliable information available concerning
 disappearances, but Albanians who have escaped from the
 country recently report that disappearances do occur.
 c. Torture
 There are unconfirmed reports of police brutality,
 particularly against persons accused of anti-state or
 religious activity. It is not possible to tell from
 available information whether such pract4ces are isolated
 and result from abuse of local authorities' discretion or,
 rather, are of more widespread and systematic use.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Private international organizations reported in the past
 that Albanians sentenced to prison endure extremely harsh
 conditions of confinement. One prison camp was described
 where 'prisoners mined copper in eight-hour shifts, six
 days a week, with little protective clothing', were forced
 to meet excessive work quotas, and, when they failed to do
 so, faced extra work hours or solitary confinement. There
 were similar past reports of prisoners being held in
 solitary confinement for up to six months. There are
 other reports that prisoners are sometimes fed only 600
 grams of cornbread per day while being forced to work 16
 hours per day. Eyewitnesses have reported the use of
 public humiliation of prisoners, including public
 exhibition of the bodies of dead prisoners, as a means of
 intimidating the populace. Although it is impossible to
 ascertain how widespread such practices may be, there is
 no reason to believe that these conditions during 1982
 changed significantly.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Beyond noting that families of persons who escape Albania
 are reportedly sent to prison as examples to other
 would-be illegal emigrants, there is insufficient
 information on arbitrary arrest and imprisonment in
 Albania for further meaningful comment.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary in Albania includes a supreme court and
 regional and district courts. While the ruling party
 clearly controls the administration of justice, there is
 virtually no further hard information on judicial
 practices in Albania. Amnesty International, however,
 
 
 839
 reported in past years receiving allegations of the use of
 psychological and sometimes physical pressure during
 investigations to obtain statements from the accused and
 witnesses. Amnesty International further reported that
 where defendants were permitted defense counsel, these
 appeared to have been state-appointed and to have provided
 only nominal services. Some defendants reportedly did not
 see their defense counsel before their trials, which
 frequently were held behind closed doors.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Inviolability of the home is constitutionally-guaranteed
 but, according to numerous reports, seldom respected.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Albanian Constitution states that citizens enjoy
 freedom of speech and press. It also provides, however,
 that "the rights of citizens are indivisible from the
 fulfillment of their duties and cannot be exercised in
 opposition to the socialist order." From available
 reports, it appears that the Government shows little if
 any respect for these rights.
 The press is owned and tightly censored by the state. The
 flow of news both into and out of Albania is rigidly
 controlled, as is its internal dissemination. Criticism by
 the press or broadcast media of Government policies or of
 the top leadership is not countenanced. Persons found
 listening to foreign radio broadcasts or exhibiting "alien
 manifestations" are reportedly reprimanded and punished.
 Albanian citizens receive mail from other countries on an
 extremely limited basis, and are similarly restricted in
 sending mail abroad.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Albanian Constitution provides for freedom of
 "organization, association, assembly, and public
 manifestation," with the caveat, however, that 'the rights
 of citizens are indivisible from the fulfillment of their
 duties and cannot be exercised in opposition to the
 socialist order."  It appears that in practice those who
 deviate from Party or Government-established norms of
 behavior meet with swift and severe reprisals.
 The United Trade Unions of Albania are established as an
 arm of the Albanian Workers Party. Their major function
 is the education and political indoctrination of workers,
 with the goal of raising productivity and work standards
 through increased worker discipline. Albanian unions have
 no significant responsibilities in the field of labor
 relations, although they do play a key role in organizing
 elements of the labor force for the periods of so-called
 "voluntary" manual labor in which virtually all Albanians
 are required to participate.

 c. Freedom of Religion
 Religious activity is expressly prohibited by the Albanian
 Constitution and by Government policy. In 1967, the
 Government abrogated all laws dealing with church-state
 relations and began a campaign to eliminate all vestiges
 of religion, which at that time were primarily Muslim,
 Orthodox, and Roman Catholic. More than 2,000 mosques,
 churches, monasteries, and other religious institutions
 were closed; all religious literature was banned; and a
 number of church leaders were imprisoned or executed.
 Freedom House reported in 1981 allegations that over 20
 Roman Catholic priests were serving prison sentences. The
 regime continues to suppress religious activity by
 imposing harsh penalties on persons who engage in
 religious practices, by conducting an educational campaign
 against religion, and by obliging citizens to expose
 believers. In spite of these pressures, some Albanians
 reportedly continue to practice religion secretly in the
 privacy of their homes.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement within the country and travel abroad is rigidly
 controlled. Transgressors may be punished severely, as
 may their families in the case of illegal emigrants (see
 section l.e. above). Albanians reportedly are permitted
 to travel abroad only on official business or, very
 rarely, for family reasons under strict controls and based
 on demonstrated obedience to the regime. Under the penal
 code, "flight from the state and refusal to return to the
 fatherland on the part of a person sent on service or
 allowed to leave the state is punishable by imprisonment
 for not less than 10 years or by death.' Under current
 conditions, very few persons manage to leave Albania.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Albania has been under the autocratic rule of Enver Hoxha
 for several decades. No other parties or political
 viewpoints except those of the Albanian Workers Party are
 permitted to exist. In 1982, many high-ranking officials,
 including followers of the late Prime Minister, Mehmet
 Shehu, were purged from the Party and State apparatus.
 The Constitution provides for the exercise of state power
 and the direction and control of all other state organs by
 the people's assembly and by people's councils. The
 members of these bodies are selected by the party and then
 *electedl by universal suffrage. As evidence of the
 absence of political choices for the populace, Albania
 routinely reports voter participation at or near 100
 percent, with approximately 100 percent of the ballots
 cast for the officially-approved candidates. Women also
 may 'participatel in *elections', but there are few women
 in positions of leadership in party or state organizations.
 Among the ethnic minority groups in Albania, the largest
 is Greek. The Constitution states that national
 
 
 841
 minorities are "guaranteed protection and development of
 their culture and popular traditions, the use of their
 mother tongue and its teaching in the schools, and equal
 development in all fields of social life." While there
 are substantial differences of opinion in the West on the
 extent to which cultural, educational, linguistic, and
 other rights of minorities in Albania may be exercised,
 these rights clearly are restricted. Similarly, there
 appear to be fundamental differences of opinion on the
 extent to which minority group members, solely because of
 that status, may suffer greater persecution than other
 Albanians.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights.
 The Albanian Government has refused to cooperate in any
 investigation of alleged human rights violations.
 In November 1982, 13 members of the European Parliament
 introduced a resolution petitioning Albanian authorities
 for better treatment of the Greek minority. The
 Parliament's Political Committee is expected during 1983
 to consider this matter further.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Albania is a poor country with limited natural resources
 and the smallest amount of arable land per capita in
 Europe. It has a comparatively high population growth
 rate, estimated at 2.2 percent (1980), and an infant
 mortality ratio of 47.5 per 1000. Average life expectancy
 at birth is 70.1 years. Per capita GNP is estimated to be
 about $840, but accurate current economic data are not
 available. No evidence has been received of chronic food
 shortages or rationing. Rents on residential housing
 appear to be low, but there reportedly are housing
 shortages, especially for newly-married couples.
 Albania has taken steps toward industrial development, but
 its economy is grounded in agriculture and the production
 of raw materials. All land belongs to the state, and
 individual citizens are permitted to own only limited
 amounts of personal property.
 Albania is a party to the International Convention on the
 Political Rights of Women and to the Convention on the
 Nationality of Married Women. The Albanian Constitution
 asserts that women enjoy equal rights with men in work,
 pay, recreation, social security, education,
 socio-political activity, and in the family. Information
 on the extent to which these asserted rights are protected
 in day-to-day life is generally not available. However,
 there do appear to .have been advances in the rights and
 status of women; in 1975, reportedly 35 percent of all
 students were women. Women reportedly participate equally
 in the obligatory labor and military service programs, but
 few women appear in positions of leadership.
