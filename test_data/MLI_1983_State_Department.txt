 MALI
 Mall is ruled by the country's only political party, the
 Democratic Union of the Malian People. The military continues
 to play a major role in the party.
 Mali became independent from France in 1960, with a government
 strongly influenced by Marxism-Leninism and inclined toward
 dictatorial rule. In 1968, a small group of military officers
 overthrew this regime and replaced it with a military committee.
 This committee, after several years in power, announced a plan
 for a return to civilian rule, a new constitution, and the
 creation of a single political party.   In 1979, General Moussa
 Traore, one of the leaders of the 1968 coup, was elected
 President under the new system for a six-year term. Mali's
 political leaders have focused the political process over the
 past five years on reducing the role of the military in the
 Government, building up support for the sole political party,
 and generating popular support for economic reforms. Military
 officers currently hold about one-fourth of the senior posi-
 tions in the Cabinet and the party, most of the governorships,
 and a fraction of the lower level administrative posts, mostly
 in border areas. Most of the senior Central Government
 officials are technocrats or regional political leaders.
 Party membership seems to be increasing. During the 1981 elec-
 tions to local and national party positions, there was some
 freedom of choice among candidates. The party leaders have
 increasingly emphasized a more open exchange of views and have
 looked upon local party officials as counterbalances to
 appointed local officials. The party is ruled by a Central
 Executive Bureau, all of whose members hold an elected local
 party position. Although the Government also includes an
 elected National Assembly, the President in consultation with
 his Cabinet and the party's Central Committee makes all of
 Mali's important decisions.
 According to the 1983 World Bank report, Mali is among the
 poorest countries in the world. Landlocked and lacking easily
 exploitable mineral resources, Mali's economy has been based on
 farming and animal husbandry, both of which have been afflicted
 regularly by poor rainfall. The legacy of Mali's socialist past
 has been a bloated public sector and inefficient state enter-
 prises, which the present Government has attempted to overcome
 through a program with the International Monetary Fund. The
 Fund pronounced the first standby program a success in 1983
 and began negotiations for a second one in the following months.
 Mali has a tradition of free enterprise which the Government is
 now encouraging. Burdensome regulations, numerous taxes and
 duties, scarce credit, and a very small market still hamper
 commercial operations.
 In addition to the military, security organizations include the
 Gendarmes, the Presidential Guard, and police who exert a con-
 siderable, but generally low-key, influence. However, avenues
 of recourse tend to be more effective through personal rather
 than official channels. There are no organized opposition
 groups within Mali, whether based on region, ethnic group, labor
 affiliation, or political orientation. Likewise there are no
 organized external threats either from neighbors or terrorist
 groups.

 Mali was characterized during 1983 by civil calm, despite such
 potentially sensitive government actions as a wage freeze and
 increases in consumer grain prices. The political and human
 rights situation did not change significantly over the previous
 year. The Government permitted limited criticism of its economic
 reform policies, though always in the context of official party
 meetings. The few labor strikes during the year, all unrelated to
 reform measures, were settled peacefully and without the use of
 government force. There were no known new political arrests.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 There were no reported incidents of politically motivated killings
 during 1983.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported incidents of disappearance, abductions, or
 hostage-taking during 1983.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Physical abuse of suspects is occasionally a method of police
 interrogation, but torture is not a form of punishment nor is it
 a common practice. Public beatings by the citizenry perpetrated
 on persons identified as thieves are known to occur but are not
 common. When present, police will take such persons into custody
 rather than leave them to "public justice.' Prisons in Mali are
 not cruel and inhuman by design, but the lack of resources does
 create poor physical and health conditions.   while prisons are
 scattered around the country, maximum security prisons are iso-
 lated in the harsh northern desert for security reasons. The
 deaths in 1983 of two prisoners in one of these facilities were
 attributed to poor health. Some prisoners are put on work crews
 and subjected to long hours of hard manual labor in the heat of
 the day. Malian authorities prefer to release most non-African
 prisoners to the appropriate embassy's supervision and escort from
 the country.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There were no reports of arbitrary arrest during 1983 in Mali.
 The Malian judicial system is based on the French system and the
 principle of habeas corpus, or its equivalent, does not exist.
 Prisoners are usually allowed access to a lawyer of their
 choosing. Bail is not available, but prisoners are sometimes
 released on their own recognizance. Administrative backlogs often
 cause delays in bringing people to trial quickly, but the
 Government has sought more speedy processing. Former government
 officials have on occasion been held without trial until they have
 repaid embezzled funds. Amnesty International has cited several
 cases of arrest of teachers and students during the 1979-80
 protests and the short-term detention of three students arrested
 in November 1982. Teachers arrested during the 1979-80 protests
 were banished after their release from prison to remote teaching
 posts.
 
 
 229
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 During the course of a trial, usually very short in duration,
 charges are clearly stated. The defense lawyer tends to argue
 mitigating circumstances as the prisoner has usually admitted
 his guilt. Guilt is determined and sentencing performed by a
 panel of three judges. The appeals process is limited to
 Presidential pardon or call for a new trial. The judiciary is
 part of the executive branch and therefore potentially subject
 to interference, though there are no known reports of such.
 The court process is more likely to be subverted by private
 means than by government interference. In addition to the
 criminal court system, a special Court of State Security hears
 cases on diversion or embezzlement of government funds and
 operates as the criminal courts do. Finally, the National
 Assembly can convene the High Court of Justice to hear cases
 against the State committed by the President or the ministers.
 Neither court has met during 1983.
 Although predominantly a Muslim country, Islamic law is not
 common in Mali. Through a gift of the Government of Saudi
 Arabia, a first Islamic courthouse is currently under con-
 struction to serve the region of Kayes. It has not been made
 clear how this court will function in relation to other courts
 or whether Islamic courts will be extended to other parts of
 the country.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Mali's Constitution guarantees the inviolability of the home.
 Searches are infrequent, and search warrants are issued and
 recorded, albeit sometimes after the fact. Shortly after
 Ramadan began in June last year, the Government revived a custom
 of the previous government by ordering all nightclubs, bars, and
 private parties closed for the remainder of Ramadan. The clos-
 ings were intended to help the "weak* adhere to the strict
 Islamic rules of fasting, according to the Government. Muslims
 and non-Muslims were therefore restricted from engaging in these
 activities. Almost all clubs had reopened within a month after
 Ramadan.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution does not specifically guarantee the freedoms
 of speech or press, and they exist in practice only to a
 limited degree. Criticism, within the confines of party
 organs or other officially government-sanctioned forums is
 allowed. While policies, programs, and even some individuals
 are acceptable subjects for criticism, authority of the party
 and government is not.
 The local media consist of one newspaper, one radio station, and
 a newly opened television station. All are state owned and
 operated. In addition, the women's, youth, and labor sections
 of Mali's single party have their own official publications.
 One private news magazine which published its first issue over a
 year ago never appeared again, reportedly because of a lack of
 financial support. Journalists who have strayed into sensitive
 areas have in the past sometimes lost their jobs. For the most
 
 
 230
 part, private publication of unauthorized information or opin-
 ions is still not tolerated or attempted, but international
 publications, even those critical of Mali or its Government,
 are readily available and circulate freely.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution guarantees the liberty of citizens to form
 organizations to protect their 'professional interestsw but in
 reality only selected organizations qualify for this freedom.
 Other than urban professional associations, the only groups which
 assemble freely are the women's, youth, and labor associations of
 the single political party. Government refusal to authorize
 an independent student union led, in part, to the student protest
 of 1981. The sole national labor union, the National Union of
 workers, despite its party affiliation, maintains some degree of
 autonomy from the Government. The Union and its 12 affiliates
 represent almost all salaried employees in Mali. Union leaders
 have spoken out against some government economic policies
 (specifically opposing any policy that would lay off large
 numbers of workers) and government officials seek their
 opinions on labor issues. Strikes are permitted and several
 called during 1983 were quickly resolved. The union has rela-
 tions with a number of its counterparts in other countries and
 is affiliated with the Organization of African Trade Union Unity
 and other international groups. Social and religious gatherings
 of large groups require permits which are usually granted,
 sometimes on an annual basis.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Mali is according to its Constitution a secular state.  With the
 exception of the closing of nightclubs and restricting general
 merrymaking during Ramadan this year, religion has not directly
 influenced government policy. Almost all Malians are Muslim,
 but other religions and animism are practiced freely and per-
 mitted to establish houses of worship and schools. Christian
 missionaries of various faiths enjoy government cooperation and
 are free to proselytize. Religious conversion is permitted.
 The Catholic Bishop is permitted to make a New Year's address to
 the nation each year. Only the Bahai are forbidden to proselyt-
 ize or establish houses of worship, although they are free to
 practice their faith. Various religious orders maintain
 bookstores and some distribute religious literature freely.
 Being Muslim does not confer any particular advantages in
 secular endeavors or career, but there do exist a number of
 informal groups of influence within the Muslim community to
 which those of other religions would not be privy.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Aside from police and customs checks along Mali's roads, internal
 freedom of movement is basically unrestricted. Some police at
 checkpoints are known to supplement their usually delayed
 salaries by assessing fines or confiscating goods. Malians are
 free to change residence or workplace, which has led to con-
 tinuing urban migration. Foreign travel requires an exit visa.
 There have been cases in which students are denied these visas
 during the course of the schoolyear. Emigration, viewed as a
 relief for poor economic conditions, and repatriation are not
 restricted. Malians, especially traders, have a long tradition
 
 
 231
 of travel throughout Africa and beyond. Malians expelled from
 Nigeria last February had no trouble reentering the country.
 Although there are a number of other Africans transiting Mali in
 search of work, there are no refugees. Africans from neighboring
 countries are generally allowed to reside in Mali and to seek
 employment. There are no known cases in which citizenship was
 revoked for political reasons.
 Section 3  Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 The Democratic Union of the Malian People is the supreme
 political entity in Mali and the only party permitted. In
 practice' there is no way for citizens to change their govern-
 ment or even directly to affect its decisions. In the highly
 centralized system of government, important policies and
 decisions are made among a small group:  the President, the 19-
 member Central Executive Bureau, and the Cabinet or Council of 17
 Ministers, including two *super' ministers who are also members
 of the Central Executive Bureau. Issues raised in the Council
 of Ministers and the Bureau are studied and voted on by the
 latter. These decrees, passed by simple majority, become the
 'laws' by which government decisions are enacted. The party and
 the Government both have representative bodies composed of
 delegates elected countrywide (the last elections were held in
 1981-82), but these groups meet only twice a year in regular
 session. The National Assembly debates proposed legislation
 (after review by the Supreme Court) which can be modified and
 theoretically rejected, though this rarely, if ever, occurs.
 The National Assembly can vote on legislation only after it has
 been accepted by the Council of Ministers. The party's Council
 reviews party policy but in effect does not manage daily party
 functions. Elections are held every three years; the 1982
 elections were the first under the current Constitution and
 party charter. Party elections, conducted at every level, were
 generally contested with multiple candidates, open to all party
 members and received wider voter turnout than those held in 1979.
 Party activities are enjoying increased participation. National
 Assembly elections, on the other hand, were controlled by the
 party's Central Executive Bureau, which chose the final single
 candidate for each position. With developing party structures
 and single-party supremacy, the role of the military has
 decreased significantly. Only three of the original 14 officers
 who led the 1968 coup still occupy leading positions. Five of
 the 19 Bureau members, five of 17 Cabinet ministries, five of
 the seven regional governorships, and numerous lower level
 positions are currently held by military officers.
 Women remain underrepresented in Mali's political and economic
 processes at all levels of government. The economic liberties
 and responsibilities many assume at the local level, particu-
 larly in agricultural and craft cooperative ventures are not
 reflected at the national level. A limited number of women
 occupy positions of responsibility in most ministries. The
 Minister of Information is the only female Cabinet member.
 There is one female member of the Central Executive Bureau and
 two representatives in the 137-member National Assembly. The
 National Union of Malian Women is an active political organiza-
 tion under the auspices of the party and a channel through which
 women can voice their concerns. Social, religious, and economic
 conditions, however, continue to confine most women to family
 duties.

 232
 Ethnic politics are not a divisive influence in Mali, as the di-
 vergent groups are bound by more commonalities than differences.
 Although the Bambara represent the majority ethnic group in Mali,
 minority groups are conscientiously represented at the national
 level of the Government and party. In local government, it is
 the Central Government's practice to assign officials to serve
 outside their native regions. Although some nomadic minorities
 prefer to remain on the fringe of Mali's economic and political
 mainstream, the country remains free of ethnic tension.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government of Mali, and President Traore personally, were
 responsive to Amnesty International's call for the release of
 several teachers imprisoned for their alleged involvement in
 .autonomous trade union activities." According to the 1982
 Amnesty report, the teachers were released following the 1981
 Paris meeting between Traore and Amnesty representatives. The
 Government has not responded to demands made in 1981 by Amnesty
 to release all prisoners of conscience, end torture, and improve
 prison conditions, nor has it responded to Amnesty's request for
 information on detention of three students in December 1982.
 Foreign Minister Blondin Beye did, however, discuss human rights
 issues with Amnesty representatives in March 1981. In its 1983
 report, Amnesty International was concerned about the imprison-
 ment of two prisoners of conscience and the harsh conditions at
 Taoudonet and other remote Saharan prisons. Mali has no known
 local human rights organizations. Mali has played no major role
 in international forums vis-a-vis human rights; nor has it been
 the focus of scrutiny in these forums. Mali is a party to the
 International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights. Mali is
 also a signer of the Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights
 Covenants, and has ratified the African Charter on Human
 and People's Rights. Freedom House rates Mali "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Mali was ranked among the poorest countries in the 1983 World
 Bank annual report. Economic development is the primary goal
 of the Government, but Mali's resources do not adequately
 address the needs of its population.    Malians living close to
 or in urban centers or who work for the Government have greater
 access to government services and resources. This is especially
 true of education. Although there is a system of health centers
 in villages throughout the country, the facilities for effective
 health care are poor even in Mali's capital.
 The rights of women in Mali are in general negatively affected
 by social, cultural, and general poverty factors. Women
 sometimes enjoy relative economic autonomy in areas in which
 their individual economic rights do not clash with local custom.
 However, this custom usually restricts women to family responsi-
 bilities, or "women's issues" when they do participate in
 politics. The Women's Union promotes health and education
 issues and has disseminated information on the disadvantages of
 female circumcision, but the practice is still widely followed,
 without government sanction, throughout Mali.
 Mali's population is currently 7,393,000 people, growing at the
 rate of 2.3 percent a year. Malians born in 1980 can expect to
 
 
 23
 live an average of 43.19 years. While life expectancy has
 increased over the years, so has the infant mortality rate--
 168.40 per 1,000 live births in 1983, up from 154.4 in 1980. As
 a result of severe drought conditions in the mid-1970's, the
 daily caloric intake was 83.75 percent of the total required in
 1977 as opposed to 94 percent in 1970. Only nine percent of the
 population has access to safe water although urban dwellers are
 more likely to have access (42 percent) than their rural
 counterparts, only three percent of whom enjoy such access.
 All Malians are guaranteed an opportunity for a free and compet-
 itive education according to the Constitution, but only 28
 percent of those eligible are enrolled in primary school. Only
 nine percent of the population is literate. Twenty percent of
 all eligible females and 36 percent of all eligible males attend
 primary school.
 Mali's real per capita gross national product continued its
 downward drift in 1981 to $185. Government official and
 military officer salaries are modest. The Government's main
 priorities at present are long-term economic development of
 the rural agricultural sectors and short-term relief food aid
 for drought victims. The drought has severely hampered Mali's
 development process and makes the atmosphere for economic reform
 difficult.
