 LAOS
 The Lao People's Democratic Republic is ruled by a Communist
 government established in December 1975 after a 20-year
 insurgency supported by North Vietnam. It takes its political
 ideology from Marx, Lenin, and Ho Chi Minh. It is dependent
 on Vietnamese and Soviet military and economic support to
 retain power. There are about 50,000 Vietnamese troops in
 Laos. The country is ruled by a single political party, the
 Lao People's Revolutionary Party. The Government's insecurity
 and efforts to establish a Communist political and economic
 structure based on the Soviet and Vietnamese models have
 resulted in numerous human rights violations. Laos' estimated
 3.7 million ethnically diverse people, scattered over more
 than 91,000 square miles of rugged terrain, have no common
 national history and share few common values. National
 institutions remain weak. There is no constitution or
 codified body of law. No national elections have been held
 since the establishment of the regime.
 Laos is an extremely poor and underdeveloped country which
 gained independence from France in 1954. It found itself on
 the frontier between the Communist and non-Communist elements
 in southeast Asia, and between major regional rivals, Thailand
 and Vietnam. Factional fighting among the Communist Pathet
 Lao, Neutralists, and Royalists lasted until the Communist
 victory in 1975. Regional and domestic political tension,
 scattered anti-government resistance activity, and poor
 economic conditions continue, contributing to a siege
 mentality on the part of the narrowly-based Lao leadership.
 The state security apparatus, which reinforces central control
 through threats, fear, intimidation, and imprisonment, is a
 primary source of human rights abuses.
 There is evidence, which the United Nations has investigated,
 that since the Communist takeover in 1975 toxin/chemical
 weapons have been used in contravention of international law
 against Hmong and other tribespeople in Laos by the Government
 and/or Vietnamese. forces. Since 1983, however, there has been
 a decrease in toxic agent attack reports. The Government has
 denied these reports and has refused to permit U.N.
 investigators on its territory.
 After taking over in 1975, the new regime arrested many
 officials of the former Government and sent them to remote
 prisons it referred to as "re-education camps.' A number of
 prisoners died in these camps, some were subsequently
 released, and a relatively small number are still held under
 guard in harsh conditions. Most, however, have been released
 to a kind of internal exile with restrictions only on travel.
 Although many officials of the previous Government remained at
 their posts after 1975, the original arrests frightened a
 large percentage of the small middle class, including Chinese
 and Vietnamese urban traders and artisans, who fled the
 country. Since 1975, more than 300,000 persons, about 8
 percent of the population, have fled Laos. After dropping for
 several years, the rate of departures rose dramatically in
 1984, primarily in response to perceived renewed resettlement
 opportunities in third countries and as a reflection of
 greater frustration with continuing economic hardship and lack
 of opportunity to improve one's lot in Laos. The departure of
 a significant portion of the skilled middle class has held
 back economic progress, as have the Government's preoccupation
 with political and military security and its mistrust of the
 few well-educated persons who have remained. The nation's
 
 
 813
 LAOS
 mountainous geography, pronounced ethnic cleavages, and lack
 of support for the Government among the populace also make
 progress difficult. The Government's stated policy is
 eventually to eliminate private ownership of business. It
 openly admits that it is presently unable to run the economy
 without the assistance of private businesses and so tolerates
 their continued existence.
 Human rights violations, such as arbitrary arrests and
 detention without trial, continued in 1984, and the individual
 remains subject to the arbitrary control of the state and the
 Communist Party. Compared with the period just after the
 Communist take-over, in 1983 and 1984 there have been a few
 limited improvements in some human rights in Laos, although
 very serious abuses persist. In 1984, apparently only a few
 people were sent to *re-education camps," many were released,
 and the conditions of some who remain under detention
 reportedly improved. Lao culture, however, emphasizes humane
 values which tend to mitigate somewhat the totalitarian nature
 of the regime.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing.
 Reports continued in 1984 of villagers, particularly Hmong
 tribespeople, being killed by Government and/or Vietnamese
 forces using toxic weapons, although such reports were fewer
 than in 1982 or 1983. These reports, unlike those made in
 previous years, have not been verified independently. There
 are reports that Lao Government and Vietnamese patrols have
 fatally shot persons fleeing from Laos and those entering the
 country illegally--usually smugglers or suspected members of
 the anti-government resistance.
 An unknown number of people are killed annually in combined
 Lao/Vietnamese military operations against resistance forces.
 Many of the insurgents appear to be former Royal Lao Army
 troops. Both sides are reported to use brutal tactics, with
 the anti-government forces attempting assassination and ambush
 of Lao, Vietnamese, and other Communist military and civilian
 personnel. There are recurrent reports of lethal attacks in
 isolated areas on vehicles bearing government officials and on
 buses. These are attributed to resistance elements but have
 also involved ordinary robbery. Resistance groups have also
 reportedly killed a few aid experts from other Communist and
 non-Communist countries. Official policy calls for the
 execution of resistance leaders, but no such executions were
 reported in 1984.
 b. Disappearance
 Although there were numerous cases of secret arrest and
 removal of persons to Ire-education' camps in the first years
 of the present regime, disappearance has been reported only
 rarely in the last several years and not at all in 1984.
 
 
 814
 LAOS
 c. Torture, Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been no reports of torture for the past five
 years. A relatively small number of 're-education' prisoners
 continues to be held in harsh conditions. Former prisoners
 have reported that punishment for misbehavior could include
 brutal public beatings, shackling, deprivation of food, and
 sometimes, for those who tried to escape, execution. Some
 inmates died from malnutrition. Lao Government officials have
 publicly denied reports of mistreatment of persons in the
 Ire-education camps.'
 Laos also has ordinary prisons and prison work camps where
 those awaiting trial or convicted of crimes are held with
 persons accused of undefined political offenses. Conditions
 are said to be spartan.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Lao Government continues to maintain a number of
 're-education camps' in which persons associated with the
 previous Government are imprisoned. Figures on those
 incarcerated are unavailable. In 1975 and 1976 thousands of
 Lao citizens (as well as a few foreign residents) were
 arrested and sent, without public hearing or trial, to remote
 camps for *re-education.'
 According to information obtained from refugees, in 1980 there
 were at least 20 're-education camps,* with a total population
 of more than 15,000 inmates (including family members). The
 camps are concentrated in the Viengsai area and Houa Phan
 Province near the Vietnamese border, in the Plain of Jars,
 near Ban Ban in Xieng Khouang Province, and in Saravane and
 Attopeu Provinces in south Laos. Information collected on
 4,182 inmates indicated that 3,134 were former soldiers (of
 whom 982 held the rank of major and above), 564 were former
 policemen, and 350 were former government officials.
 Since 1979, conditions in most of the 're-education camps'
 have improved, and a number of camps have been closed. Most
 detainees are now living in a kind of internal exile under
 conditions that--except for the severe restriction on their
 freedom of movement--generally are no worse than those of poor
 Lao living in the countryside. Some are on probation or
 cannot arrange necessary travel documents. Others who have
 lost property and families are reported to have chosen to
 remain in areas near the camps to begin new lives. A
 relatively small number of Ire-education' prisoners arrested
 in 1975-76 continues to suffer harsh conditions in closely
 guarded camps. These include those who continue to defy the
 Lao Government and its policies, as well as a few of the
 leading anti-Communist leaders of the pre-Communist
 governments. In 1984 the Government permitted at least 60
 "re-education camp" prisoners to return to Vientiane in
 releases concentrated in the first few months of the year.
 In 1984, government officials claimed, as they had in 1983,
 that nearly all soldiers and officials sent to 're-education
 camps' in 1975-76 had been 'released" and that "only a few"
 people remained under detention. Some government officials
 contend that all "re-education camps' have been closed. It
 has not been possible to verify the accuracy of such
 statements, but it is believed that 1,000 to 3,000 detainees
 
 
 815
 LAOS
 remain in 're-education' camps. Those accused of hostility to
 the regime or of what the Government calls 'socially
 undesirable habits," such as prostitution, drug abuse,
 idleness, and 'wrong thought" are sent to 'rehabilitation'
 centers, usually without trial. Most of these persons have
 been allowed to return to their homes after periods ranging
 from a few months to several years of hard labor, political
 indoctrination, and admission of guilt. In 1984, there were
 reports that some unemployed and idle youths in Vientiane and
 other urban areas were rounded up and sent against their will
 to the countryside to work on public works projects, in some
 cases to join "patriotic youth" groups also working on such
 projects.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 No code of law exists in Laos and there is no guaranteed due
 process. The Government is still revising the pre-1975 law
 code and rehabilitating the court system. It is expected to
 publish a constitution by the end of 1985. In the meantime,
 it has promulgated interim rules and regulations for the
 arrest and trial of those accused of specific crimes,
 including armed resistance to the Government. These
 regulations were disseminated to local authorities in October
 1978, primarily to correct the haphazard way in which they
 were carrying out their duties. Although the regulations
 allow the accused to make a statement presenting his side of
 the case, they provide no real opportunity for the accused to
 defend himself and do not permit bail or use of an attorney.
 Rather, the Government has issued instructions on how to
 investigate, prosecute, and punish wrongdoers. These
 instructions are applied capriciously and inconsistently.
 People can be arrested on the accusation of others and
 detained while the accusations are investigated. Those
 arrested are not always informed of the charges against them,
 and investigations often take a long time unless family
 members and friends take a strong interest in the cases.
 Influential government officials and their families can easily
 influence the judgments reached. There is some provision for
 appeal, except that important political cases tried by
 .people's courts' are without appeal. Death sentences must be
 approved by the Council of Ministers. Lao regulations call
 for judgment to be given in public. This is, in effect, a
 public announcement of the sentence not a public trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Search and seizure are authorized by the security bureaus
 themselves rather than by an impartial judicial authority, and
 government regulations, which are not always followed, provide
 little protection for the individuals affected. International
 and domestic mail is selectively opened on a routine basis.
 Mail from China and the non-Communist countries is
 particularly suspect. Telephone calls are frequently
 monitored. Privately owned land may not be sold but can be
 inherited. Houses, appliances, and other private property can
 be sold only with difficulty in most cases, since the
 possession of large amounts of cash in this poor country draws
 immediate government suspicion. Inheritances cannot be passed
 on to relatives who have left the country as refugees and
 acquired another nationality. Only government officials and
 others who the Government determines have a professional need
 are allowed to possess non-Communist foreign newpapers,
 
 
 816
 LAOS
 magazines, and other publications. The Government, however,
 makes no attempt to stop Lao from watching Thai television or
 listening to foreign radio stations like the Voice of
 America. The state security apparatus monitors family life
 extensively through a system of neighborhood wardens and
 informers.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Lao press is owned by the Government and Party and used to
 disseminate official positions. Written or spoken opposition
 to the Government is not permitted. Persons who have engaged
 in such activity have been jailed. Most Lao are intimidated
 into avoiding discussion or association with foreigners.
 Academic freedom does not exist.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government controls all meetings and, except for religious
 and athletic events, organizes them. Individuals do not have
 the right to join together to promote causes not sponsored by
 the regime or to protest government policies. All
 associations--such as those for youth, women, workers, and a
 "peace organization'--are government-controlled and authorized
 'mass organizations.' These are organized to exercise
 government control and disseminate government policy. All
 professional groups are organized by the Party, and their
 leadership is ordinarily drawn from party ranks. Trade unions
 are organized as "mass organizations' of the Party without the
 right to engage in collective bargaining. They have no real
 influence in determining working conditions. Lao associations
 are permitted to maintain relations with like-minded
 organizations in other countries, particularly those in
 Communist countries. Ordinarily Lao citizens are permitted
 association or contact with foreigners only in rare and
 unusual circumstances, usually involving their work.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Nearly all Lao are Buddhists or, in the case of some hill
 tribes, animist. After 1975, the Government took over some
 Buddhist and Christian places of worship for use as political
 indoctrination centers or warehouses. This practice appears
 to have ceased, however, and construction of Buddhist temples
 can be observed. In general, Buddhist temples have become
 more active in the past few years, and the number of monks has
 increased. In official statements, the Government has
 recognized the right of the people to religious belief as well
 as the contributions religion can make to the development of
 the country. Many Lao, however, believe that the Government
 has begun a long-term effort to subvert the role of
 religion--in part because it considers the maintenance of
 temples and the activities of monks non-productive. This
 effort includes carefully controlling the education of young
 monks and compelling the Buddhist clergy to propagate some
 elements of Marxist-Leninist doctrine. Monks, however, are
 the only remaining social group still entitled to special
 honorific terms of address, and even high party and government
 officials continue to use them. Religious festivals are
 permitted to take place without hindrance. Young people
 regularly enter into religious orders for short periods.
 Links may be maintained with coreligionists and religious
 
 
 817
 LAOS
 associations only in countries approved by the Government,
 usually other Communist countries. Traditional links to Thai
 Buddhists are no longer permitted. In theory, missionaries
 are not banned from entering Laos to proselytize, but in most
 cases they have been denied permission. Many top party
 officials still participate in religious ceremonies, but the
 military are forbidden even to have Buddhist funerals.
 Roman Catholics and Protestants are permitted to worship
 without harassment, but the activities of their churches are
 closely observed. Since 1975, they have not been permitted to
 operate schools, seminaries, or associations. Last year, a
 new Roman Catholic bishop coadjutor of Vientiane was
 consecrated and several Protestants were released from
 .re-education," but in 1984 a few church leaders remained
 under detention, allegedly for anti-government activity.
 Catholic church officials visited Laos to meet with local
 Catholic church leaders in 1984. The Bishops of Laos,
 however, did not go to nearby Bangkok to meet the Pope during
 the latter's visit there in May. The Government tries to
 persuade hill tribe minority groups to abandon their
 'old-fashioned' animist beliefs.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Lao citizens must obtain permission from the authorities for
 all internal travel of any distance and in all cases when
 crossing-provincial boundaries. A curfew exists in the
 capital and other major cities. Its rules change from time to
 time, as does its enforcement. Government officials have
 cited threats of 'disorders' created by 'reactionary" elements
 as the reason for the restrictions.
 Foreign travel is permitted for officials, students in
 government-approved programs, and some others who have access
 to foreign exchange. Lao are rarely permitted to study or
 train in non-Communist countries even at their own expense.
 Exit visas are required and are difficult to obtain, but in
 1983 and 1984 there were noticeable increases in the number of
 Lao permitted to travel abroad. Border crossing permits are
 available for those with business in Thailand. Although the
 Lao Government has said that those wishing to emigrate will be
 allowed to so do, as a practical matter legal emigration is
 rarely authorized for ethnic Lao and, when it is, reportedly
 requires substantial bribes. Since 1975, about 293,700 of the
 Lao who have fled Laos have registered as refugees in
 Thailand. An unknown number of other Lao who have fled Laos
 have simply settled in with kindred ethnic groups.
 Some of those fleeing are fired upon and killed by Lao,
 Vietnamese, or Thai border patrols as they attempt to cross
 the Mekong River. Many Lao caught seeking to leave illegally
 have been imprisoned, although in some cases they have only
 been sent to short indoctrination seminars and then released.
 The Lao and Thai Governments have agreed to take back, on a
 case-by-case basis, those of their respective citizens who
 have illegally crossed into the other country and wish to
 return home. From May 1980, when agreement was reached with
 Thailand and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) on a voluntary repatriation program, to May 1984,
 2,544 Lao refugees voluntarily returned to Laos under the
 auspices of the UNHCR. The Lao Government suspended the
 
 
 818
 LAOS
 program from June until December following the onset of a
 border dispute between Laos and Thailand. Those accepted for
 return receive several days of political indoctrination and
 are then released to return to their homes, where they are
 placed under the control of village authorities. The UNHCR
 provides basic necessities and monitors treatment and living
 conditions thereafter. Perhaps as many as 5,000 to 10,000
 refugees have repatriated themselves without official
 involvement. There appears to be no pattern of official
 harassment or maltreatment of these voluntary returnees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Laos is ruled by a small elite of the Lao People's
 Revolutionary Party, the sole party. There is neither freedom
 to participate in politics outside the Party nor popular
 choice of policies or officials. After the Communists seized
 power in May in 1975 but before the establishment of the
 present regime in December of that year, local elections were
 held in which voters chose from a list of candidates selected
 by the party. Representatives to the Lao People's Supreme
 Council were subsequently reported to have been chosen by
 those local officials, although this process was not made
 public. There have been no national elections. A few
 'by-elections' have been organized to replace representatives
 who have died or been transferred.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 Laos has refused to cooperate with the U.N. Secretary
 General's investigation of the use of chemical/toxin weapons
 in Laos. Hmong and other refugees continue to report attacks
 against them with toxic agents, by Lao and/or Vietnamese
 military forces with Soviet assistance. The Lao Government
 has denied the use of such weapons. International efforts to
 gather information, to express concern over these reports, and
 to seek an impartial international investigation continue. A
 team of United Nations investigators stated in December 1982
 that 'it could not disregard the circumstantial evidence
 suggestive of the possible use of some sort of toxic chemical
 substance in some instances.'
 Laos does not cooperate with private international
 organizations interested in human rights. Laos occasionally
 permits visit by officials of international human rights
 organizations if the purpose of the visit is not specifically
 related to allegations of human rights violations. In the
 past, the Lao Government has permitted UNHCR to investigate to
 a limited degree the status of Lao refugees voluntarily
 repatriated from Thailand. A senior UNHCR official made a
 brief visit to Vientiane in 1984. Amnesty International in
 its 1984 Report stated that its main concerns remain the
 continued detention in Ire-education camps' of large numbers
 of people detained without trial since 1975 for their
 political activities or positions under the former government,
 and the lack of legal safeguards for people detained on
 political grounds. The Freedom House 1983-84 report lists
 Laos as "not free.-
 
 
 819
 LAOS
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 In 1984 the economic and social situation showed few signs of
 significant improvement. Government pressure to 'socialize'
 the economy along Marxist-Leninist lines was strong.
 Increased pressure was placed on farmers to join cooperatives,
 and the Government intensified its efforts to reduce and
 control the small private sector. The economy was tied more
 closely to that of Vietnam by, inter alia, decreasing foreign
 trade links through Thailand and upgrading such links through
 Vietnam. The value of the kip dropped about 60 percent
 between January and October. Unfavorable weather conditions
 damaged the 1983-84 rice crops, which were insufficient to
 meet domestic consumption, and Laos received emergency food
 donations from several non-Communist countries, including the
 United States.
 Approximately half of the population in Laos is ethnic Lao,
 also called *lowland Lao"; 20 percent are tribal Thai; 15
 percent are Phoutheung (or Kha); and other mountain tribes
 constitute another 15 percent (Hmong, Yao and others). The
 Lao Government is attempting to integrate these groups and
 overcome traditional antagonisms between lowland Lao and
 minority groups.
 The Hmong are split along clan lines. Many were strongly
 anti-Communist, but others sided with the Communist Pathet Lao
 and the Vietnamese. The Government is repressive toward all
 groups that fought against it, especially those who continue
 to resist its authority by force. The Hmong have a strong
 military tradition and have attempted to defend some of their
 tribal areas. Vietnamese and Lao armed forces have conducted
 military operations to dislodge them from their strongholds.
 There has also been a Government campaign to suppress
 resistance from lowland Lao groups, mainly in southern Laos,
 around Vientiane, and in northwest Laos.
 The Government wants to resettle some ethnic minorities who
 now inhabit mountainous areas in the lowlands, where they
 would be under government control and engage in settled
 agricultural production. The Government has reportedly
 abandoned the use of force in favor of a voluntary program
 based on material inducements.
 Deterioriation in Sino-Lao relations since 1979 has resulted
 in continuing increased Lao Government suspicion and
 surveillance of local Chinese. The Government so far has not
 persecuted or expelled Chinese although it allows them to
 emigrate rather freely; in fact, the majority of Chinese in
 Laos in 1975 have since left on their own, largely for
 economic reasons. Those who remain have maintained the
 Chinese schools in Vientiane and Savannkhet and Chinese
 associations in several provincial capitals.
 About 85 percent of the population of Laos is engaged in
 agriculture. Per capita gross national product (GNP) is
 variously estimated at from about $100 to $220. The country's
 economic problems are complicated by inadequate internal
 transport and isolation from the sea. The avowed aim of the
 Government is economic self-sufficiency and improved
 conditions for the people through a socialist transformation
 of the economy, including collectivization of agriculture.
 Earlier coercion of farmers to join agricultural cooperatives
 caused some lowland farmers to leave the country, and the
 
 
 820
 LAOS
 formation of new cooperatives has since been slowed. The
 Government has declared that farmers will not be forced to
 join collectives but continues to apply strong pressure on
 them to join, and economic incentives are given to those who
 do so. The Government has nationalized most industries and
 has at times tried to impose strict controls on private
 enterprise. Limited private trade continues, however, because
 it still constitutes the principal and most efficient way to
 distribute goods. In 1984 there were renewed efforts to
 restrict such trade by the imposition of increased taxes on
 private businesses, customs duties on importers, and attempts
 to reduce smuggling of consumer goods from Thailand. Laos
 continues to experience serious foreign exchange problems and
 has difficulty in paying its import bills for many
 necessities, including fuel. Natural and man-made problems
 continue to hold timber and coffee exports far below their
 potential. In addition, the Government has used these
 commodities and minerals to pay for aid from Soviet bloc
 countries, rather than selling them for hard currency.
 Partial restrictions on trade through Thailand may have played
 a role in these developments.
 Health conditions are poor but improved marginally in 1984.
 In 1984, the World Bank estimated infant mortality at 118.8
 per 1,000 live births, which represents a significant
 reduction from 1976 when the government figures placed the
 rate at 204 per 1,000 live births. Life expectancy at birth
 was approximately 45.25 years in 1984. The estimated overall
 population growth rate is 2.2 percent. According to
 government statistics, in 1982 there were only 226 physicians
 and 1,184 other medical personnel in the country. Major
 causes of death in Laos are gastrointestinal diseases from
 unsafe drinking water, malaria, respiratory infections, and
 malnutrition. The Government is attempting to improve public
 health by training more personnel in basic health care,
 improving water supplies, modernizing 13 provincial hospitals,
 constructing clinics in all districts, inoculating against
 cholera and other diseases, and promoting adult education on
 preventive hygiene.
 Lao authorities are also continuing a campaign to reduce
 illiteracy. The Government has claimed that illiteracy has
 been eliminated in some provinces. The official claim of 60
 percent adult literacy (98.75 percent between ages 15 and 45)
 seems exaggerated. The World Bank estimated the literacy rate
 at only 43 percent in 1980. The Government carries out an
 intensive program of adult education aimed at indoctrinating
 adults along "socialist lines.* Approximately 93 percent of
 children aged 5-14 are said to attend school regularly.
 However, teacher training has usually been rudimentary.
 According to some accounts, in provincial and urban areas the
 time teachers must devote to supplementing their meager
 salaries causes them to reduce classroom hours substantially.
 Emphasis in higher education is placed on training technicians
 and engineers to work on development projects. Thousands of
 Lao students have been sent abroad for training in the
 U.S.S.R., Vietnam, and Eastern Europe. The pool of trained
 manpower in Laos is gradually increasing as students begin to
 return from abroad, but some do not find jobs in their areas
 of training.
 The role of women in Lao society has traditionally been
 subservient to that of men, but discrimination is not highly
 pronounced. The Government-controlled Lao Women's Federation
 has as one of its stated goals achievement of rights for woman
 "equal* to those of men. Lao women are currently being
 encouraged to take an increasing part in economic and
 state-controlled political activity.
