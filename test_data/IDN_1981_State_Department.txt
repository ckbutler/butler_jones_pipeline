 INDONESIA
 Indonesia, the world's fifth most populous nation, contains
 a wide diversity of ethnic, social, linguistic, religious
 and geographic groups. The government stresses national
 unity through a secular political philosophy. The themes
 of public policy emphasize independence, economic develop-
 ment, public order and nationalism.
 Indonesia became an independent constitutional democracy
 in 1945. In 1965, an unsuccessful attempt by the Indonesian
 Communist Party to seize power resulted in significant
 social disruption and violence. Memories of the events
 of that time significantly color Indonesian attitudes
 toward acceptable limits of political dissent. Indonesia
 currently has a limited representative government dominated
 by the military. Two of the three national elections since
 independence have been held by the current government.
 The next national parliamentary elections are scheduled for
 May 1982, and presidential elections for 1983.
 During 1981, there were positive human rights developments
 in a number of areas. The proliferation of groups concerned
 with focusing more public attention throughout Indonesia
 ,on the preservation and improvement of civil and human
 rights, first noted in 1980, continued. Contributing to
 this process, a revised criminal procedures code which
 replaces a 134 year old Dutch colonial code was promulgated
 December 31, 1981. The government permitted the International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to visit prisoners tried
 and sentenced for involvement in the abortive communist coup
 d'etat of 1965. Based on presidential decrees, the process
 of according citizenship papers or naturalization to pre-
 viously stateless members of the Chinese minority continued.
 With the end of the emergency situation in East Timor,
 relief operations by international voluntary agencies were
 phased out and the emphasis switched to economic development
 and tracing of missing persons. The government continued its
 development program in this historically under-developed
 area. The Indonesian government continues to provide one of
 the region's two processing centers for Indochinese refugees,
 and to date has accepted over 66,000 for first asylum,
 pending their resettlement in third countries. The economic
 growth rate for Indonesia in 1981 was estimated at an
 impressive 8 percent, although Indonesia remains a poor
 country with significant income distribution and unemploy-
 ment problems.
 Restrictions on political expression, however, remain
 and there is concern among human rights groups over govern-
 ment powers of detention without trial. Much of the current
 international interest in human rights in Indonesia is
 focused on allegations of abuses in East Timor.
 These include allegations of disappearances, killings, and
 large scale detentions. The Indonesian government denies
 that abuses have occurred, and it is difficult to indepen-
 dently confirm or deny those allegations.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Indonesia's legal codes make no specific reference to torture
 or cruel punishment. According to human rights lawyers, the
 legal restriction against it is derived through legal inter-
 
 (592)
 
 
 pretation of the "presumption of innocence" clause in
 chapter 1 or paragraph 8, law 14 of 1970. Some former
 detainees and their lawyers have over the years alleged
 beatings and other abuse of accused criminals and of some
 political dissidents, particularly alleged PKI (Indonesian
 Communist Party) members and extremist Muslims.
 Over the past year, the press aired charges of torture of
 accused persons, primarily by the police, in criminal cases,
 resulting in death in at least two instances. As these
 cases were reported, they attracted community and high-level
 official attention, and the commander of the national police,
 a four-star police general, publicly voiced concern and
 ordered investigations. Widespread publicity given to the
 charges and admonitions and disciplinary warnings by the
 police commander are thought to have had a salutary effect
 in inhibiting potential police abuses. A "Year of Develop-
 ment" for the national police was decreed in 1981, and
 significant portions of a greatly increased police budget
 were devoted to enhancing police awareness of citizens'
 rights in connection with the promulgation of the revised
 criminal procedures code.
 Since 1978, Minister of Defense Jusuf has taken a strong
 position against abuses of prisoners and has suggested
 reform measures aimed at protecting the rights of detainees.
 There has been greater public attention to allegations of
 wrongdoing, and International Red Cross inspections of
 prisons have continued. Some of the old detention centers
 in Jakarta have been closed.
 In 1981, Jakarta saw the voluntary formation of the first
 private prisoners' aid societies, and increased interest in
 the welfare of prisoners was expressed by the national
 legislature.
 Indonesian human rightsgroups believe the trend toward
 better treatment of prisoners continues. They credit the
 public statements of General Jusuf and other key officials
 with sensitizing lower ranking officials in this regard.
 Lapses in treatment of prisoners do occur, however, and
 there are variations in attitudes by locality, particularly
 in the more remote provinces. There have been occasional
 allegations of torture of persons imprisoned in East Timor,
 but no documented cases.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Overcrowded conditions, minimal food, inadequate prison
 budgets and occasional mixing of political detainees with
 ordinary criminals have given rise to charges of abuse.
 Student detainees generally enjoy special facilities, as
 do certain other classes of political prisoners.
 Separate detention facilities are maintained for women.
 There have also been allegations of inhumane treatment of
 prisoners in detention camps in East Timor. The Indonesian
 government does not yet permit Red Cross inspection of
 detainee centers in East Timor.
 There have been no reported incidents of summary execution
 over the past year. Capital punishment is implemented
 sparingly. In December 1981, President Suharto commuted
 to life imprisonment (with the possibility of parole) the
 death sentences of the two most prominent individuals
 convicted of involvement in the abortive communist coup
 attempt of 1965, former foreign minister Subandrio and
 
 
 594
 ex-Air Force chief of staff Omar Dhani. At least 20
 persons, sentenced to death for their involvement in the
 coup attempt, remain in prison with their sentences held
 in abeyance. Traditional Islamic corporal punishments are
 not permitted under Indonesian law.
 c. Disappearances
 Continuing concern has been expressed about reported dis-
 appearances of persons in East Timor. Amnesty International
 has focused its attentions on several specific cases,
 alleging that some of those reported as missing were
 subsequently killed by Indonesian forces. Some of the
 persons alleged to have disappeared by Amnesty International
 and others have been located in other parts of East Timor,
 but many cases remain unresolved. There have also been
 unsubstantiated allegations of killings of innocent persons
 in connection with Indonesian anti-guerilla operations in
 the province in mid-1981. In June 1981, the ICRC was
 permitted to establish an operation in East Timor, in
 conjunction with the Indonesian Red Cross, aimed at tracing
 missing persons based on inquiries by relatives.
 Elsewhere, as a result of charges brought by Indonesian
 human rights groups, there have been substantial disclosures
 of the names of prisoners who are alleged members of
 extremist Muslim groups classified by the government as
 subversive. Trials of these persons continued, and others
 were released for lack of evidence. During the year the
 national police commander several times publicized his
 instructions to police that all arrests should be reported
 as soon as practicable to relatives of the accused.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The rights of habeas corpus, bail bonding and legal counsel,
 are included in the new criminal procedures code promulgated
 in December 1981, but they do not apply in cases involving
 alleged subversion or corruption. Political detentions of
 indefinite duration reportedly continue, but details on
 current cases are lacking.
 Under criminal law procedures in use prior to the promul-
 gation of the new code, police could detain and investigate
 suspects for 20 days, prosecutors could detain suspects
 for 30 days, and the court could authorize extension of
 this period every 30 days for a period of up to one year.
 This does not apply to security and subversion cases, for
 which the period of detention has no legal limit.
 The Indonesian government has detained opposition students
 and their advisors, other political activists, and persons
 accused of corruption. A few have been brought to trial
 under existing legal codes, most have been released after
 questioning, and others have been detained for periods of
 up to fifteen years without charges. During the past few
 years, detentions fell into two groups: students and
 opposition leaders arrested during the protests surrounding
 the electoral process in 1977/78, and suspected Muslim
 extremists believed to have instigated or participated in
 illegal anti-government activities or ensuing acts of
 violence or criminal acts such as robbery and murder.
 Thirty-five students were tried and sentenced for their
 role in the 1977/78 protests. Only a few received sentences
 greater than five years, and most have already been released.
 Muslim extremists are frequently detained in remote provinces
 and there are no good estimates of the total number of such
 detainees.
 
 
 595
 All political prisoners detained in connection with the
 failed 1965 coup d'etat, with the exception of several
 hundred persons tried and convicted of specific criminal
 offenses, were released by December 1979. While questions
 concerning conditions of the released political prisoners
 are not a public issue in Indonesia, consideration of their
 status and efforts to reintegrate them into society are of
 concern to some foreign and domestic humanitarian organi-
 zations. Objection has been raised to the fact that the
 identification cards of ex-prisoners, while similar to
 those required of all Indonesians, carry special identifiable
 markings and that, reportedly, in some parts of the country
 former prisoners are periodically required to report to
 government authorities and to report their movements.
 Of more concern are limitations on employment opportunities
 for former prisoners. By government edict they may not
 join the civil service, the armed forces, or be employed by
 "essential industries." There is still no central authority
 concerned with collecting information on the welfare of
 ex-prisoners. Reports on them are, therefore, impressionistic,
 based on limited or skewed samples, but it is thought that
 the percentage of former prisoners who are unemployed is
 higher than for the bulk of the population, and that other
 social opportunities open to them remain more limited.
 There are unconfirmed reports that discrimination has
 extended to their families, who have also been denied
 educational and employment opportunities.
 Allegations of arbitrary arrest in East Timor fall into
 two categories: persons arrested and detained in prisons
 on the island of Timor and persons allegedly detained on
 the island of Atauro, located just off the north coast of
 Timor. According to best estimates, 300-400 are currently
 imprisoned on Timor. This includes both criminals and
 persons accused of association with the Fretilin movement.
 Many of the latter have been transferred to Atauro over
 the past year.
 In addition to this group, a number of persons suspected
 by the Indonesian government of being Fretilin members or
 sympathizers have allegedly been detained and sent to
 Atauro as a result of Indonesian anti-guerilla operations
 in the province in the summer of 1981. There have been no
 visits by international agency personnel to Atauro so
 assessments of either the numbers of individuals detained
 there or the conditions of their detentions are difficult
 to make. Estimates of the total number of detainees on
 Atauro, which come mostly from critics of the Indonesian
 government, have varied widely, up to a figure of 10,000.
 At least two Timorese assemblymen, who wrote a letter to
 President Suharto in June 1981 accusing the military of
 human rights abuses in East Timor, were reportedly detained
 by the Indonesian government in mid-November. The best
 available evidence indicates all were released by the end
 of December 1981.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Paragraph 17 of chapter 11, law 14 of 1970 states: "Court
 investigation sessions are open to the public unless regu-
 lated separately by the law." This applies only to courts
 of first instance, not to appeals courts, where hearings are
 conducted primarily on the basis of legal briefs, with no
 personal appearances. The regulations implementing the law
 cited above have never been issued.. It, therefore, has
 been left to the discretion of judges to decide when court
 sessions should be closed in the reported interest of
 national security, public order or propriety. 'In practice,
 
 
 596
 most trials are open. There have been occasional complaints,
 however, that in the past, particularly in some security
 and political cases, public attendance was discouraged by
 the requirement that those wishing to attend register and
 sign their names.
 In recent years, it has become common practice for suspects
 and detainees to be provided in most cases with legal
 counsel, although there is no obligatory right to counsel
 under current law except in instances of capital offenses.
 The Indonesian Bar Association advocates enhancement of
 civil and humanitarian rights and has facilitated the
 establishment of legal aid societies in most major cities.
 These societies are permitted to advertise publicly.
 Farmers increasingly have sought legal aid in land disputes
 involving government and local land owners. There are only
 500 attorneys registered with the bar (in a population of
 140 million). Anyone with a college degree, however, can
 serve as a defense attorney.
 Citizens and civil rights organizations have charged in
 the past that fair trials have been denied because of
 corruption within the ranks of the judiciary. In February
 there were changes in the leadership of the administration
 of the judicial system, with the former Minister of Justice
 being appointed Chief Justice, the former Attorney General
 taking the Justice Ministry and a former Cabinet Secretary
 assuming the position of Attorney General. The three
 officials at the outset declared their joint intention to
 reform the judiciary, and since they have taken office
 over 20 judges, at various judiciary levels, have either
 been suspended, tried, or sentenced. This process continues
 and has generally gained the respect and approbation of the
 legal community.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Judicial warrants for searches of private property are
 required except in cases of action by security agents or
 in cases of economic crime and corruption, but it is
 difficult to ascertain the degree to which this requirement
 is respected.
 Forced entry by security authorities has been alleged in
 the past, but no cases have come to light this year.
 There have been no known cases of "bugging," demolition
 or sealing of doors and windows. One human rights organi-
 zation, however, contends that cases of "bugging" are quite
 common, but they lack evidence to substantiate such claims.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Article 28 of Indonesia's 1945 constitution states that
 freedom of association and assembly, of expressing thoughts
 orally and in writing, shall be prescribed by statute.
 Religious freedom is more specifically guaranteed in
 article 29, paragraph 2, of the constitution, which says
 that the state shall guarantee freedom to every resident
 to adhere to his religion.
 The press is carefully controlled in Indonesia, and an
 implicit system of "self censorship," with journalists and
 publishers recognizing the limits of permissibility,
 generally prevails. Journalists complain, however, that
 in some instances they are instructed by government officials
 by telephone concerning newsworthy developments which are
 
 
 597
 embargoed. During 1981, articles pertaining to some acti-
 vities of political oppositionists were discouraged.
 The government also initially banned press coverage of
 the hijacking of an Indonesian airliner from Sumatra to
 Thailand and of violent social disorders in East Java --
 resulting in the blacking out of two full pages of one of
 the leading domestic news magazines, for the first time
 in that journal's history. The government is, furthermore,
 sensitive to foreign press coverage of Indonesian develop-
 ments, and this has led to its refusal to extend residence
 permits for foreign journalists in some instances.
 The government exercises censorship prerogatives over
 foreign films and publications. Readers thus occasionally
 find portions inked out of magazines and newspapers from
 abroad. Communist writings are prohibited, as are lurid
 magazines or pictures. While the government has permitted
 former political prisoners to publish articles in leading
 magazines and newspapers, in May 1981, it banned and con-
 fiscated two recently published books written by novelist
 Pramoedya Ananta Toer, because of putative Marxist content.
 A political prisoner from 1966-79 and a 10-year inmate of
 Buru Island, Toer is considered by some to be Indonesia's
 leading novelist.
 Generally there is little government interference with
 academic inquiry, although increasing controls are exerted
 during periods of political sensitivity, such as the
 forthcoming general elections. In September, six well-
 known academics and intellectual figures were disinvited
 from participation in a conference of the.National
 Academy of Sciences. Some academics involved with political
 oppositionist activities also claim they have been harassed
 in the pursuit of their professions.
 Limits on freedom of assembly are imposed by government
 policy. Nevertheless, some opposition can be expressed.
 Opposition elements continued to use parliamentary legal
 procedures and publications to register protests about
 policies and leaders, and labor and farm representatives
 petitioned to the parliament concerning alleged government
 abuses on various levels.
 Indonesia is a secular state, and its constitution provides
 for religious tolerance. Although the Indonesian population
 is overwhelmingly Islamic, no particular discrimination is
 directed against those of other faiths, and a number of
 members of the minority religions rank high in government
 councils. Despite government policies designed to promote
 religious tolerance, traditional tensions between the Muslim
 community and other religious sects occasionally resurface.
 There is a considerable body of Indonesian law designed to
 protect the rights of the individual worker, and certain
 types of trade union activity are permitted. By law, any
 employer with '25 or more employees must recognize and nego-
 tiate with them as a trade union upon worker demand.
 The results of these negotiations are the collective labor
 agreements, the number of which has grown enormously: in
 mid-1981, there were 1,380 registered with the government
 while in 1975, there were .30. Even where there is no union,
 companies are required, after consultation with the employees,
 to post written regulations covering labor matters.
 The partial right to strike (and to lock-out) exists in the
 private sectors, except in those industries which the govern-
 ment considers "vital." It is government policy to intervene
 in labor disputes before they reach a strike/lock-out
 confrontation. When serious labor unrest/disagreement
 
 
 598
 occurs, the government may mediate directly or the matter
 can be referred to a special series of labor courts.
 Only when all remedies have failed may a strike be declared
 legal. Illegal or non-legal strikes do occur, usually over
 wages but sometimes over working conditions. According to a
 senior trade unionist, no striker or strike leader has been
 jailed for involvement in an illegal strike. Low level
 police harassment does occur.
 Employees of the government and government-owned industries
 are not permitted to unionize but can affiliate with a
 government employees association which has branches in
 most government offices. Government employees cannot
 strike or engage in collective bargaining.
 In 1978, the government inaugurated a mandatory social
 insurance program providing for workers' accident and
 life insurance and for a savings scheme, a "provident
 fund." By mid-1980, over 1 million employees were covered.
 Individual workers' rights against arbitrary dismissal are
 established by Indonesian labor laws. There is strong'
 enforcement of legislation in the job security area.
 Organized in 1973 with the encouragement of the government,
 the National Trade Union Federation is one of the few
 broad-based mass organizations in Indonesia and it is
 composed of 21 industrial unions in the private sector.
 -Government figures estimate trade union membership at
 2.7 million in mid-1981. A 1977 government decree
 authorized check-off, but the system is not widespread
 and is not a significant source of union funding.
 While many senior trade unionists are active politically
 in-their personal capacities, the trade union movement
 itself is not officially aligned with any political party
 or grouping.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Exit permits are required of persons leaving the country,
 but-they are usually obtainable without difficulty upon
 presentation of identification papers and fee payment.
 There has been some criticism of alleged government denial
 of exit permits to leading members of opposition groups.
 At mid-year, there was a flurry of charges concerning an
 existing and extensive "black list" of persons prohibited
 from traveling abroad. The immigration director general
 promised to review the matter, which, according to the
 press, he said had been instituted under the "old order"
 government of the late President Sukarno. Results of the
 review, however, have not been disclosed. East Timorese
 seeking to leave Indonesia frequently encounter difficulties
 in obtaining exit permits.
 The government requires a permit to change residence,
 primarily to control the further movement of population
 from the-rural areas into the already overcrowded cities.
 Permits reportedly are not difficult to obtain for persons
 able to prove that they have employment in the city.
 Former detainees are free to travel domestically, but are
 required to notify authorities of travel outside their home
 areas. There have been charges from abroad that former
 political detainees associated with the 1965 coup attempt
 have been forced to participate in government transmigration
 programs to outer islands. However, there are no proven
 cases and there is some indication that government policy
 is to discourage congregations of ex-political prisoners
 in transmigration centers.
 
 
 599
 Travel between East Timor and other parts of Indonesia is
 restricted and a government permit is required to leave
 East Timor. There are also some restrictions on movement
 within Timor. There is, however, evidence of increased
 freedom of movement in the fact that people in certain
 settlements have been given official permission to travel,
 on a regular basis, to other locations in order to receive
 medical treatment or to obtain food. Also, people in the
 overcrowded Uatolari area have begun moving back into the
 nearby mountain area where their agricultural land is located.
 In general, freedom of movement has been greater in the more
 secure western districts of the province, but developments in
 Uatolari indicate that the situation is easing in the
 eastern part of the island as well.
 One thousand five hundred and sixty-five Portuguese citizens
 were repatriated from East Timor in 1976 following the inte-
 gration of the province into Indonesia. Indonesia has
 stated its willingness to allow 3,200 additional Portuguese
 citizens to be repatriated if Portugal agrees, but efforts
 to deal with this problem through diplomatic intermediaries
 (Indonesia and Portugal have no relations) have thus far not
 been successful. The International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC) has obtained approval for the repatriation to
 Portugal of 72 persons (32 separate cases) to be reunited
 with first degree relatives (husbands and wives or parents
 and children)., Thirteen of the 32 cases have been repatriated
 and two others have changed their minds about leaving East
 Timor. An additional case was resolved when the two persons
 involved departed on their own outside ICRC auspices.
 The remaining cases are still awaiting repatriation. In the
 interim, four new cases were submitted to the Indonesian
 authorities for approval in June 1981. A separate repa-
 triation effort by the ICRC involving 12 families of Cape
 Verdian origin has been approved by the Indonesian government.
 Their departure is now dependent on acceptance by the
 government of Cape Verde. There is also an agreement
 between Indonesia and Australia for the repatriation of
 Timorese with relatives in Australia. Six hundred and
 thirteen persons have been identified for this program and
 352 have left Indonesia as of November 25, 1981. Over 600
 additional persons originating from East Timor have emigrated
 to Australia on an individual basis since July 1980.
 In general, however, movement on the repatriation front has
 been slow over the past year. Six of the families in the
 ICRC program and 47 persons in the Australian program have
 left Indonesia  since October 15, 1980, when data was
 collected for last year's human rights report.
 A few Indonesians remain in communist countries where they
 chose to reside after the 1965 upheaval. Permission from
 the government must be obtained through Indonesian embassies
 abroad for them to return home. Such permission is being
 determined on a case-by-case basis.
 Women generally are treated the same as men in matters of
 internal or foreign travel, emigration or repatriation.
 The Indochinese refugee camp on Indonesia's Galang Island
 has been developed by the government and United Nations
 High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) into an excellent
 refugee facility. In addition to accepting over 60,000
 first asylum Indochinese refugees since 1975 pending their
 resettlement in third countries, the Indonesian government
 has provided one of the region's two processing centers to
 hold refugees transferred from camps in other Association
 of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, to date
 principally Thailand, where pressure has been heaviest.
 The transfer of refugees from Thailand to Galang began
 
 89-510 0 - 82 - 39
 
 
 600
 in July 1980, and is continuing consistent with available
 space. No Vietnamese refugees are known to have been pushed
 off Indonesian shores. Indonesia has not accepted any
 Vietnamese for permanent settlement.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Indonesia has a limited representative government dominated
 by the military. All adult citizens except prisoners and
 members of the armed forces are enfranchised, and a specific
 number of seats in parliament are reserved for appointed
 members of the armed forces. Elections for parliament (DPR)
 are held every five years, with the next election scheduled
 for May 1982. The president is elected by an assembly (MPR),
 consisting'of the parliament plus an equal number of
 appointed members in a special sitting every five years.
 The next is set for 1983. The 1975 law on political
 parties limits the number to three: a Muslim party, an
 association of former nationalist and Christian parties,
 and the government-sponsored party or "functional group"
 (GOLKAR). Because of its government affiliation, the
 latter has certain advantages in presenting its policies
 and views. It won the 1971 election with 62.8 percent of
 the vote and the 1977 election with 62.1 percent.
 Political activity by the parties in the period between
 elections is centered largely on the national and regional
 legislative bodies because of a prohibition on operations
 at the village level. This restriction is lifted during
 the election campaign. Government regulations during the
 1977 election limited the freedom of all three political
 groups to criticize each other and government policy.
 The communist party and a Muslim party involved in separatist
 revolts during the 1950's have been banned. Members of the
 former and some leaders of the latter are not allowed to
 run for office.
 An informal 50-man opposition group consisting of retired
 military officers, some elements of the Muslim community
 and former student leaders, formed in early 1980, continues
 its activities and efforts to influence the parliament by
 submitting petitions critical of government leadership.
 Although Indonesian women traditionally are important income
 earners for their families and modern legislation guarantees
 them equal treatment, they are still not fully represented in
 the decision-making structure or the modernization process.
 There has been *proved participation of women's groups in
 development-related projects involving nutrition, family
 planning, And home economics. However, no woman has held a
 full cabinet portfolio since 1966. Although well represented
 in the professions (academic, judicial and medical), they
 hold only one ambassadorship, and no governorships or top
 offices in the national and local assemblies or national and
 provincial government.
 At the rural level women are losing traditional economic
 pursuits, but are not being included in adoption of
 modern techniques. While Indonesia has comprehensive labor
 legislation to protect female wage earners, women do not
 receive equal pay for equal work, partly because there is
 no minimum wage law, and also because women are restricted
 from holding certain jobs in industry.
 The Javanese, who comprise about forty-five percent of the
 total population, have a preeminent role in the country's
 political leadership as a result of historical and cultural
 factors. Other ethnic groups are represented at the highest
 levels of government, but the majority of non-Javanese
 
 
 601
 ethnic groups are somewhat under-represented in the mid
 and lower levels of the military and bureaucracy. There is
 deep resentment of the Chinese minority which plays a
 disproportionately large role in the nation's economy.
 This racial tension periodically is translated into anti-
 Chinese violence such as occurred in central Java in
 November 1980.
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The government accepts a program of visitations by the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to prisons
 and detention centers, and during 1981 permitted visits
 to the estimated 300 individuals sentenced for complicity
 in the abortive communist coup d'etat of 1965.
 Discussions for a survey of human rights conditions by
 the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), initiated
 in 1980, however, made no apparent progress. In recent
 years, Amnesty International representatives have been
 refused access to Indonesia because of the government's
 disagreement with findings of Amnesty International's
 reports.
 Large scale relief efforts in East Timor by the ICRC and
 Catholic Relief Services (CRS) have been phased out as a
 result of improved economic conditions on the island.
 ICRC continues to operate programs in East Timor with the
 Indonesian Red Cross and the ICRC Jakarta representative
 has unrestricted access to the province to oversee these
 activities. CRS has received approval to begin an agri-
 cultural development project in East Timor, with unrestricted
 access to the area for the project manager. It was reported
 in December 1981 that the United Nations International
 Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) will be permitted to
 operate a program in East Timor beginning in early 1982.
 Overall, however, the government has been more restrictive
 in granting access to East Timor by outside observers during
 the past year than in 1980.
 For the past 10 years, a private Jakarta-based legal aid
 institute (LBH) has contested human rights violations by
 defending or representing aggrieved parties in open court
 and through stimulating press attention and discussion.
 In 1981, the LBH issued the second in what is now considered
 an annual series of reports, concerning human rights in
 Indonesia during 1980, to the acclaim of wide elements of
 the press, the parliament, and society in general.
 Indonesia is not party to any of the United Nations human
 rights treaties except for the U.N. Convention on the
 Political Rights of Women, which it ratified in 1958.
 Although it is not party to the U.N. protocol relating to
 the status of refugees, it nonetheless has been generous
 in providing first asylum to Indochinese refugees. At its
 1981 session, the U.N. Commission on Human Rights decided
 to discontinue its examination of the human rights situation
 in Indonesia under the Commission's confidential 1503
 procedures.
 United Nations resolutions have been adopted in recent
 years, contrary to Indonesian efforts, expressing deep
 concern over the situation in East Timor and reaffirming

 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 Inflation, at a crippling 640 percent in 1966, has averaged
 in the 10-15 percent range for the past five years; President
 Suharto noted during his independence day address that the
 inflation rate for the first seven months of 1981 was only
 5.4 percent. Since 1974, real economic growth has averaged
 about 7.6 percent annually.
 The infant mortality rate has improved from 159 per 1000
 in 1960 to 126 in 1970 and 120 in 1979. Life expectancy
 at birth, 39 years in 1960 and 46.7 in 1970, was 53 years
 in 1979. Current per capita income has been raised to an
 estimated $431, from $80 in 1960.
 Population pressure, insufficient'food production, inadequate
 employment opportunities and landlessness are probably the
 greatest constraints on the ability of the economy to
 satisfy basic needs and improve income distribution.
 In 1970, 28 percent of the urban population and 51 percent
 of the rural lived below the absolute poverty level.
 The island of Java has approximately 80 million people and
 one of the highest population density rates in the world;
 53 percent of rural families on Java are landless.
 Indonesia's family planning program has lowered birth
 rates and reduced population grow4th to less than two
 percent. It is also seeking to reduce Java's population
 pressures and to increase agricultural production through
 an accelerated transmigration program to the outer islands;
 4.9 percent of the budget is devoted to manpower and
 transmigration.
 Agricultural output has increased by about 3.8 percent
 annually during the past decade, one of the best agri-
 cultural performances of any major developing country.
 The percentage of calorid supply available for consumption
 relative to nutritional requirements has risen from 89 in
 1960 to 92 in 1970 to 105 in 1979. As a result of rising
 consumption, however, Indonesia-remains a large grain
 importer, especially of rice, despite increased agricultural
 production. During the past few years, the government
 increasingly has stressed non-rice production, particularly
 in areas not suited to rice cultivation. In the current
 budget, 14.7 percent is devoted to agriculture and irri-
 gation, an increase of 2.7 percent from the previous year.
 The percentage of the population with'access to safe water
 has risen from 3 to 12 from 1970 to 1979. In the fiscal
 1981 budget, 2.8 percent was devoted to low-cost housing.
 Wide income disparities remain, however, and studies by
 both government and private experts point to the need to
 increase the income of the rural and urban poor.
 The adult literacy rate is 65 percent, increased from 39
 in 1960, 56.6 in 1970 and 62 percent in 1979. Primary
 school enrollment has increased from 71 percent in 1960
 to 78 percent in 1970 to 94 percent in 1979, and consider-
 ation is being given to making primary education compulsory.
 In higher education, the trend is to increase agricultural
 and rural atudies and, especially, to train mid-level
 technicians. In the current budget, 11.4 percent is
 devoted to education and culture.
 Development has been hindered by limited availability of
 qualified medical personnel and health facilities.
 The ratio of physicians per capita has, however, increased
 from 1:41,000 in 1960 to 1:12,000 today, with over 1,000
 doctors being graduated each year. The number of regional
 nealtn centers, maternal child health centers and polyclinics
 has been increasing, and there are now over 4,300 public
 health centers throughout the country, with at least one
 in every sub-district, about 50 percent of which are
 staffed with at least one physician.
