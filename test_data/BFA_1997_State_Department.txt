 BURKINA FASO
 President Blaise Compaore continued to dominate the Government of the Fourth
 Republic, assisted by members of his party, the Congress for Democracy and
 Progress (CDP). In spite of the existence of dozens of political parties, there is little
 viable opposition to the President and his Government. In legislative elections in
 May, 44 percent of eligible citizens voted and gave the CDP control of 101 of 111
 seats in Parliament. A delegation from the International Assembly of Francophone
 Parliamentarians considered the election to be substantially free and fair, however,
 
 
 a collective of 14 local nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) gave a more mixed
 review, describing the elections as aceful and orderly, but also marked by general-
 ized and systematic corruption andaredby voter list irregularities. In December
 1995, the constitutionally mandated (though purely consultative) second chamber of
 Parliament was installed, completing the government structure envisaged in the
 1991 Constitution. The Constitution provides for an independent judiciary; however,
 it is subject to executive influence.
 The security apparatus consists of the armed forces, the paramilitary gendar-
 merie, controlled 1y the Ministry of Defense, and the police, controlled by the Min-
 istry of Territorial Administration. Some members of the security forces committed
 human rights abuses.
 Over 80 percent of the population of 10 million engages in subsistence agriculture.
 Frequent drought, and limited communication and transportation infrastructures, in
 addition to a 77 percent illiteracy rate, are longstanding problems. The 50 percent
 devaluation of the cfa franc in 1994 made imports more expensive for salaried work-
 ers and civil servants, but improved the competitiveness of livestock and cotton ex-
 ports. Since 1991 the Government has adopted a series of structural adjustment pro-
 grams that are designed to open the economy to market forces and to reduce govern-
 ment deficits, while shifting resources to the education and health sectors. In recent
 years, the country has registered strong gains in life expectancy, literacy, and school
 attendance rates, although it remains a very poor country with annual per capita
 income about $220.
 The Government's human rights record improved somewhat, but serious problems
 remain in several areas. Despite the May elections, President Campaore's continued
 dominance limited citizens' right to change their government. The security forces
 continued to mistreat detainees, and prison conditions remained harsh. Arbitrary
 detention was a problem, and authorities did not ensure detainees due process. A
 general climate of impunity for members of the security forces, along with the lack
 of progress in identifying or punishing those responsible for serious abuses commit-
 tedin previous years, continued to tarnish the Government's record. Courts are sub-
 ject to executive influence, and authorities do not ensure fair trials. The media prac-
 tices self-censorship. In. March the Council on Information ordered the director of
 a popular radio call-in show, whose participants were often critical of government
 officials, to suspend the show until additional regulations to the 1995 code governing
 radio broadcasting were released. In October the Government tightened regulations
 governing public demonstrations and increased penalties for violations. Societal dis-
 crimination against women persists. Violence against women and children, particu-
 larly female genital mutilation (FGM), remained a problem, although the Govern-
 ment passed legislation making FGM a crime. The Government has taken steps to
 educate citizens about the dangers of this practice. Killings of criminal suspects by
 vigilante mobs remained a problem, but apparently decreased.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 There was no progress made in punishing those responsible for abuses committed
 in past years. The major problem with law enforcement remains a general climate
 of impunity for human rights abusers fostered by the habitual failure of the Govern-
 ment's investigations to result in guilty findings and appropriate sanctions. Inquir-
 ies tend to drag on until they are overshadowed by subsequent incidents or quietly
 shelved. Appeals by human rights organizations generally go unanswered. This fail-
 ure to prosecute previous abuses remains a major hindrance to further human
 rights progress.
 The May 1996 incident in which members of the police in the town of Reo shot
 and killed an unarmed villager during an operation to fine owners of unregistered
 vehicles remained unresolved. An official investigation into the 1995 shooting to
 death of two unarmed high school demonstrators in Garango has yielded no results.
 Investigation of the 1994 savage beating of two prisoners, who later died at the
 Mac prison in Ouagadougou, ended without calling for the punishment of those re-
 sponsible. There were no further developments regarding the 1994 corruption scan-
 dal that led to the death in custody of two suspects under suspicious circumstances.
 To date the authorities have provided no explanation of the death of Doin Redan,
 who was found dead in 1994 a day after being detained by police. The Government
 continued to make no real effort to investigate the fate of a Ghanaian detainee re-
 portediy killed in 1993 while in police custody. International and local human rights
 groups pressured the official commission investigating the 1991 assassination of
 
 
 23
 Clement Ouedraogo, a prominent opposition leader, to submit a report of prelimi-
 nary findings to the Prime Minister. The report has not been made public and the
 case remains open, as do the cases of the 1989 "disappearance of professor
 Guillaume Sessouma, detained for allegedly participating in a coup plot, and of med-
 ical student Dabo Boukary in 1990, detained following student demonstrations.
 Credible reports indicated that security forces tortured and killed both men. The
 Government failed to respond to students' calls for information on Boukary's death,
 which was included in a list of demands issued during the university strikes that
 begn in February.
 There were some killings of criminal suspects by vigilante mobs, but apparently
 fewer than in recent years. A major independent daily reported on only one such
 kiln  this year, which occurred in Ouagadougou.disappearances.
 b. iwere no reports of ptcall
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degradi  Treatment or Purnshment.-
 While legally prohibited, mistreatment of detainees, ften to extract confessions, has
 been documented for a number of years. There are credible reports that officials at
 Macl prison continue to employ derading treatment. The Government is not known
 to have taken any disciplinary action against those responsible, and the climate of
 impunity created by the Government's failure to prosecute abusers remains the larg-
 est obstacle to ending abuses.
 Prison conditions are harsh, overcrowded, and can be life threatening. The federal
 prisonn Bobo-Dioulasso, buit in 1947, houses about 1,000 prisoners, although de-
 signed to hold less than half that number. There are separate facilities for men,
 women, and children. The prison diet is poor, and inmates must often rely on sup-
 plemental food from relatives.
 According to human rights monitors, prison visits are granted at the discretion
 of prison authorities. Permission is routinely granted, and advance permission is not
 d. Arbjtry Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides for the right
 to expeditious arraignment  access to legal counsel, and the law limits detention
 for investigative purposes without charge to a maximum of 72 hours, renewable for
 a single 48-hour period. In practice, however, police rarely observe these provisions.
 The average time of detention without charge is1 week._
 On January 31, poice dispersed a student march in the capital that was protest-
 ing the condition of dormitories, classrooms, and the levels of scholarships. Police
 used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters, arrested approximately 30
 students, anedetan them until Februay4 (see Section 2.b.).
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary; however, in practice it is subject to executive influence. The President has ex-
 tensive appointment and other judicial powers. The Constitution stipulates that the
 Head of State is also the President of the Superior Council of the Magistrature,
 which nominates and removes some high-ranked magistrates and can examine the
 performance of individual magistrates.
 The Constitution provides that the Supreme Court is the highest court in the
 country. Beneath it are 2 courts of appeal and 10 provincial courts ("de grande in-
 stance "). There is also a High Court of Justice, with jurisdiction to try the President
 and senior government officials for treason and other serious crimes. In 1995 the
 National Assembly passed legislation reforming the military court system, making
 military courts less susceptible in principle to executive manipulation, however,
 their independence has not yet been demonstrated.
 In 1994 the Government announced the creation of the Office of Ombudsman,
 called "MVediateur du Faso." Retired general Mar Garango was appointed to the po-
 sition, which is responsible for mediating disputes between theState and its citi-
 zens. In March the mediator negotiated an agreement to end a student strike after
 the Prime Minister's efforts to broker an accord between the students and authori-
 ties failed. In addition to the formal judiciary, customary or traditional courts, pre-
 sided over by village chiefs, handle many neighborhood- and village-level problems,
 such as divorce and ieritance disputes. These decisions are generally respected by
 the population, but citizens may also take a case to a formal court.
 The Constitution provides for the right to public trial, access to counsel, and has
 provisions for bail and appeal. While these rights are generally respected, the ability
 of citizens to obtain a fair trial remains circumscribed by ignorance of the law (77
 percent of the population is illiterate) and by a continuing shortage of magistrates.
 Amendments to the Penal Code to make to relevant to modern requirements,
 such as the revision making FGM a crime, were adopted by Parliament during its
 last session in 1996 and entered into effect early in the year.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 
 
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for these rights, and, in practice, the authorities generally do
 -not interfere in the daily lives of ordinary citizens. In national security cases, how-
 ever, a special law permits surveillance, searches, and monitoring of telephones and
 private correspondence without a warrant. By law and under normal circumstances,
 homes may be searched only with the authority of a warrant issued by the Minister
 of Justice. Except in certain cases, such as houses of prostitution and gambling
 dens, such warrants must be executed during "legal hours," defined as between 6
 a.m. and 9 p.m.
 Section 2. Respectfor Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom orSpeech and Press.-The 1991 Constitution provides for freedom of
 speech and of the press. In practice, however, these freedoms still remain cir-
 cumscribed by a certain degree of self-censorship. The President and his Govern-
 ment remain sensitive to criticism. Provisions in the Code granting the Government
 strong legal powers to intimidate the press -through a broad interpretation of defa-
 mation were removed in December 1993. As a result, journalists charged with libel
 now may defend themselves in court-by presenting evidence in support of their alle-
 gations. Perhaps as a consequence, the independent press continued to exercise
 greater freedom of expression.
 In February the director of a popular independent radio station received verbal
 instructions from government officials who demanded that a popular call-in show
 whose listeners often voiced opinions critical of the Government be taken off the air.
 He was also attacked by two armed thugs who identified themselves as ruling party
 members. In March the Government sent written orders to suspend the program
 until additional-regulations to the existing 1995 code governing radio broadcasting
 were written and-enacted. The director complied, and the program was taken off the
 air. The Government has yet to publish the new regulations, and the program re-
 mains off the air.
 In July the Government divided a $170,000 grant among 20 independent radio
 stations and publications, including some critical of the Government, after they had
 been invited to send a list of needs to a 10-member selection committee chaired by
 the President of the Association of Independent Broadcasters.
 The independent press includes six dailies, a dozen weekly newspapers, and a
 monthly news magazine. Although the official media, including the daily newspaper
 Sidwaya, the national radio, and the national television, display progovernment em-
 phasis, the presence of independent competition led government media to give more
 coverage to the political opposition during the May parliamentary campaign. There
 are a dozen thriving independent radio stations, one with eight branches, and one
 private television station.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly, and the Government generally respected this right in practice.
 Political parties and labor unions have usually been allowed to holdmeetings and
 rallies without requesting government permission since early 1990. In October the
 National Assembly passed a law to replace an existing 1992 regulating public dem-
 onstrations. The new law requires that authorities be notified in advance of planned
 demonstrations and gives the executive the right to use reasons of public order to
 forbid demonstrations. In addition penalties for violations are increased from 6
 months to 5 years to 2 to 5 years. Permits, however, must be obtained from munici-
 pal authorities for political marches. Applicants must indicate date, time, duration,
 and itinerary of the march or rally, andauthorities may alter or deny requests on
 grounds of public safety. Denials or modifications may be appealed before the courts.
 On January 31, police dispersed students protesting in the capital, using tear gas
 and rubber bullets. Police arrested approximately 30 students and detained them
 until February 4.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association, and the Government gen-
 erally respects this right in practice. Since early 1990, political parties and labor
 unions have usually been permitted to organize and hold meetings and rallies with-
 out seeking government permission.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. Burkina Faso is a secular state. Islam,
 Christianity, and traditional religions operate freely without government inter-
 ference. Neither social mobility nor access to modern sector jobs are linked to, or
 restricted by, religious affiliation. -
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement, and authorities re-
 spect this right in practice. Gendarmes routinely stop travelers within the country
 
 
 25
 for identity and customs checks and the levying of road taxes at police and military
 checkpoints. There is no restriction on foreign travel for business or tourism.
 Refugees are accepted freely. The Government provides first asylum and contin-
 ued to provide it to refugees from neighborin countries, primarily from Mall and
 Niger. The Government cooperates with the ofce of the United Nations High Com-
 missioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting
 refugees. In February the Government and UNHCR officials reached an accord on
 the repatriation and resettlement of the 25,000 Tuareg refugees and on the UNHCR
 timetable for terminating all food distribution to Tuaregs living in the northernmost
 camps by December 31. Following the final convoy in August of some 400 repatriat-
 ing Nigerien Tuaregs, the UNHCR concluded its assistance program for Nigerien
 Tuaregs. Over 170,000 Malian refugees have repatriated. The last group of Tuareg
 refugees living in the country was returned to Mali on December 8 under the aus-
 pices of the UNHCR. On December 15, the Government officially closed all refugee
 camps. At year's end, those refugees who opted to remain in the country were being
 registered by local authorities and were to be treated according to regulations of the
 Economic Community of West African States. There were no reports of forced return
 of persons to a country where they feared persecution. There were no reports of
 forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the constitutional right to change their government through
 multiparty elections. However, in practice, they are unable to exercise this right
 fully due to the continued dominance of the President and his rulingparty. In May
 44 percent of eligible voters went to the polls and gave the ruling CDP 101 out of
 111 parliamentary seats in an election that international observers described as
 substantially free and fair; however, a collective of 14 local NGO's described the
 elections as peaceful and orderly, but marked by generalized and systematic corrup-
 tion and marred by voter list irregularities. The Supreme Court annulled the results
 in four constituencies because of these irregularities. (The ruling party won all four
 seats in the subsequent elections. The 14 N GO collective cited similar voting irreg-
 ularities in these subsequent elections as well). The victory reflected both general
 support for policies of the governing party and a lack of viable opposition alter-
 natives. Presidential elections are scheduled to be held in 1998.
 The Compaore Government includes a strong presidency, a prime minister, a
 council of ministers presided over by the President, a two-chamber National Assem-
 bly, and the judiciary. The legislature is independent, but it remains susceptible -to
 external influence from the executive branch.
 In January during its first session, the CDP-dominated National Assembly
 amended the Constitution to allow a president to run for an unlimited number of
 terms. Previously, the Constitution had restricted the mandate to two 7-year terms.
 There are no restrictions in law or practice on the participation of women or mi-
 nority rup members in politics. However, women are underrepresented in posi-
 tions of responsibility; 4 of the 29 ministers and 10 of the 111 National Assembly
 deputies are women. The President of the Social and Economic Council is a woman.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government's attitude toward local human rights organizations has been
 mixed. According to activists, the Government did not interfere with the activities
 of an such group this year, including the Burkinabe Movement for Human Rights
 (MBL)HP), an independent group with representation in all 45 provinces. The Gov-
 ernment helped the human rights organization Gerddes sponsor a seminar in July
 on building democracy within the military. However, the Government has failed to
 answer inquiries from international human rights organizations concerning past
 abuses. Amnesty International is still awaiting the results of the government in-
 quiry into the 1995 killings in Garango, but the Government has not responded to
 Ars request for information.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, religion, or ethnic
 origin. Minority ethnic groups are, like the majority Mossi, represented in the inner
 circles of the Government, and government decisions do not favor one group over
 another.
 Women.-Violence against women, especially wife beating, occurs occasionally.
 Cases of wife beating are usually handled through customary law and practice.
 There are no statistics on rape, although it is recognized as a crime. Spousal rape
 
 
 is not discussed. There are organizations-that counsel rape victims, including Catho-
 lic and Protestant missions, the Association of Women. Jurists in Burkina, the
 Burkinabe Movement -for Human- Rights (MBDHP), Association of Women, and
 Promofemmes, a regional network that works to combat violence against women.
 The Government -is attempting to change attitudes toward women, using education
 through the media. The Penal Code explicitly prohibits sexual harassment, but has
 no special laws protecting women against violence other than general laws dealing
 with violence.
 The Constitution provides for respect of human rights including those of women,
 but there is no specific constitutional protection for women, who face extensive dis-
 crimination.In general women continue to. occupy a subordinate position and experi-
 ence discrimination in such areas as education, jobs, property, and family rights.
 Overall, women represent 45 percent of the work force. In the-modern sector, how-
 ever, women make up one-fourth of the government work force, although usually in
 lower paying positions. Women still do much of the subsistence farming work. After
 Wthe May parliamentary elections,' the Government created a Ministry of Women's
 Affairs and appointed a woman as minister.
 Children.-The Constitution nominally protects children's rights. The Government
 has demonstrated its commitment to improving the condition of children by adopt-
 ing a national policy to revitalize primary health care through the-privatization of
 hospitals, which provided greaterautonomy in hospital management. The Govern-
 ment has stated its commitment to improve access to primary education and as of
 1996 had raised the-iteracy rate to 23 percent.
 Females constitute approximately one-third of the total student population in the
 primary school system and are represented in the secondary and higher educational
 systems although the percentage decreases dramatically beyond the primary level.
 Schools in rur  areas have disproportionately fewer female students than schools
 in urban areas. The Government has set up a scholarship program for female sec-
 ondary students to encourage them to stay in school.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is still widely
 prcticed, especially in many rural areas, and is usually performed at an early age.
 Theperenageoffemales who have undergone this procedure may be as high as
 70 percent. Fhe Government has made a strong commitment to eradicate FGM
 through educational efforts, and a national committee campaigns against the prac-
 tice. The Penal Code was revised in the last session of Parliament in 1996 to make
 FGM a crime, with stricter punishment for those involved in its practice. Perpetra-
 tors are subject to 6 months to 3 years' imprisonment and a significant fine. The
 Government has launched a sensitization campaign regarding the deleterious effects
 of this practice. Another form of mutilation, scarification of the faces of bth boys
 and girls of certain ethnic groups, is gradually disappearing.
 People With Disabilities.-While there are modest government subsidies for work-
 shops for the disabled, there is no government mandate or legislation concerning ac-
 cessibility for the disabled. There is no legislation to protect people with disabilities
 from discrimination. Programs to aid the disabled are limited, but human rights
 groups are not aware of any discrimination against the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1962 Labor Code has been amended several
 times during the past decade, most recently in 1996. Under this legislation, workers,
 including civil servants, traditionally have enjoyed a legal right of association, which
 is recognized under the Constitution. There are 4 major labor confederations and
 12 autonomous trade unions linked together by a National Confederal Committee.
 They rpresent a wide ideological spectrum; the largest and most vocal member es-
 pouses Socialist doctrine. Essential workers, such as police, may not join unions.
 The Constitution provides for the right to strike, and workers use strike actions
 to achieve labor goals. In June the most prominent health services union called a
 partial strike of emergency staff workers. After the Government questioned this ac-
 tion, the Supreme Court ruled that the strike by emergency staff violated a law pro-
 tecting public safety, but it did not find illegal the union's right to call a general
 strike in support of the emergency workers 3 weeks later. The strike ended after
 a monthwhen the Government and union signed an agreement.
 Labor unions may affiliate freely with international trade unions. The National
 Confederation ef Burkinabe Workers (CNTB) is affiliated with the Brussels-based
 World Confederation of Labor (WCL).
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargai Collectively.-Unions have the right to bar-
 gain for wages and other benefits, both directly with employers and with industry
 associations. These negotiations are governed by minimums on wages and other
 
 
 benefits contained in the Interprofessional Collective Convention and the Commer-
 cial Sector Collective Convention, which are established with government participa-
 tion. If no agreement is reached, employees may exercise their right to strike. Either
 labor or management also may refer an impasse in negotiations to labor tribunals.
 Appeals may be pursued through the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court, whose
 decision is binding on both parties. Collective bargaining is extensive in the modern
 wage sector but encompasses only a small percentage of workers. .
 The Labor Code prohibits antiunion discrimination. The Labor Ministry handles
 complaints about such discrimination, which the plaintiff may appeal to a Labor Tri-
 bunal. If the Tribunal sustains the appeal, the employer must reinstate the worker.
 Union officials believe that this system functions adequately.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced labor,
 and it is not practiced.
 The Government prohibits forced and bonded child labor but does not enforce this
 prohibition effectively. Children commonly work with their parents in rural areas
 or in family-owned small businesses in villages and cities.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Gov-
 ernment prohibits forced and bonded child labor but does not enforce this prohibi-
 tion effectively (see Section 6.c.). The Labor Code sets the minimum age for employ-
 ment at 14, the average age for completion of basic primary school. However, the
 Ministry of Employment, Labor, and Social Security, which oversees labor stand-
 ards, lacks the means to enforce this provision adequately, even in the small wage
 sector. Most children actually begin -work at an earlier age on small, family subsist-
 ence farms, in the traditional apprenticeship system, and in the informal sector.
 There are no reports of children under the age of 14 employed in either state or
 large private companies.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code mandates a minimum monthly
 wage, a standard workweek of 40 hours with at least one 24-hour rest period for
 nondomestic workers and a 60 hour workweek for household workers, and estab-
 lishes safety and health provisions. The minimum monthly wage in the formal sec-
 tor, about $45 (cfa 27,089), does not a pply to subsistence agriculture, which employs
 about 85 percent of the population. The Government last set the minimum wage in
 1996. It is not adequate for an urban worker to support a family. Wage earners usu-
 ally supplement their income through reliance on the extended family, subsistence
 agriculture, or trading in the informal sector.
 A system of government inspections under the Ministry of Labor and the Labor
 Tribunals is responsible for overseeing health and safety standards in the small in-
 dustrial and commercial sectors, but these standards do not apply in the subsistence
 agricultural sector. However, the Government's Labor Inspector Corps does not have
 sufficient resources to fulfill its duties adequately. Every company is required to
 have a work safety committee. If a workplace has been declared unsafe by the gov-
 ernment Labor Inspection Office for any reason, workers have the right to remove
 themselves from dangerous work without jeopardy to continued employment. In
 practice there are indications that this right is respected, but such declarations are
 relatively rare.
