 ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
 A member of the British Commonwealth, Antigua and Barbuda
 celebrated its fifth anniversary of independence from Great
 Britain on November 1, 1986. Respect for human rights in
 Antigua and Barbuda is grounded in its domestic laws and
 reinforced by the democratic political values and traditions
 that evolved before independence and continue to develop. Its
 population supports these values and expresses dissent openly,
 aided by a free press. The Constitution provides for a
 parliamentary system of government based on majority rule, and
 requires general elections at least every 5 years.
 Security forces consist of a police force and the Antigua and
 Barbuda Defence Force, an 80-man infantry unit. The police
 are organized, trained, and supervised according to British
 law enforcement doctrine. The security forces have a good
 reputation for respecting individual rights in the performance
 of their duties.
 Antigua and Barbuda's human rights record continued to be good
 in 1986.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 No instances of political killing were reported.
 b. Disappearance
 No disappearances, extralegal detentions, or politically
 motivated abductions were reported.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture and cruel or inhuman
 treatment of prisoners or detainees. These prohibitions are
 respected in practice. Prison conditions are adequate, and
 the authorities permit regular visits by a prisoner's family
 and attorney, as well as by members of the clergy.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arbitrary arrest and detention are prohibited by the
 Constitution and do not occur in practice. Criminal
 defendants are guaranteed the right of judicial determination
 of the legality of detention, and detainees must be brought
 before a court within 48 hours of arrest or detention.
 No cases of involuntary exile have been reported.
 The Constitution prohibits forced or compulsory labor, and
 such practices are not known to take place in Antigua and
 Barbuda.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Criminal defendants are guaranteed a fair, open, and public
 trial. The independent judiciary is widely respected for its
 fairness and professionalism. The Eastern Caribbean Supreme

 ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
 Court serves Antigua and Barbuda. The Government guarantees
 legal assistance at its expense to persons without means to
 retain a private attorney. There are no political prisoners
 in Antigua and Barbuda.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home or
 Correspondence
 Arbitrary police or government actions against a person's
 home, family, or privacy have not been reported. The police
 must obtain a warrant before searching private premises.
 Leftist political groups have charged that the Government
 tampers with their mail, but these allegations have neither
 been supported with evidence nor brought to court.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and the Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, the press, and
 other forms of communication. The electronic media--the only
 source of daily local news--are dominated by the Government.
 Antigua Broadcast System Radio and ABS-TV are state owned, and
 the only privately owned radio station is controlled by the
 Prime Minister's family. Opposition politicians assert that
 they have almost no access to air time to present their
 positions. ABS Radio and TV report regularly on the
 activities of the ruling party, but rarely report on the
 opposition. A different situation exists in the nation's
 print media. Weekly newspapers representing the opposition
 publish a variety of opinions and are free to criticize the
 Government. Religious organizations also publish their own
 newspapers.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution assures the right of peaceful assembly.
 Public meetings and organized demonstrations are held without
 interference. The local police, however, monitor the travel
 and activities of the Antigua Caribbean Liberation Movement
 (ACLM), a leftist political party. In one incident, a
 Canadian diplomat was detained briefly at the airport and
 questioned by the police about his visit to ACLM
 headquarters. An official protest was registered and an
 official apology issued by the Government of Antigua and
 Barbuda.
 Less than a majority of Antigua and Barbuda's workers belong
 to labor unions, but labor organizations are free to organize
 and bargain collectively. The right to strike can be limited
 if the Court of Industrial Relations is involved in a given
 dispute. Unions are free to affiliate with international
 labor organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is free exercise of religious beliefs. The population
 is overwhelmingly Protestant, but adherents of other religious
 denominations proselytize openly without government
 interference.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The movement of citizens within the country is not restricted

 by law or practice.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: the Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Antigua and Barbuda has a multiparty political system which
 accomodates widely divergent views. All citizens 18 years of
 age and older may register and vote. Individual parties
 conduct voter registration drives free from government
 interference. The Government is obligated by law to hold
 voter registration during a fixed period each year.
 Prime Minister V.C. Bird's Antigua Labour Party (ALP) won an
 overwhelming victory in the 1984 elections, taking every
 constituency in Antigua. In Barbuda, an independent won the
 sole seat and became the Government's only parliamentary
 opposition. Despite the lopsided ALP victory, the elections
 were considered to be fair and open.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Internationally recognized human rights organizations have not
 expressed concern about Antigua and Barbuda. There were no
 requests for investigations or inquiries into alleged
 violations in 1986. The Government is sensitive to human
 rights issues and has condemned abuses elsewhere.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language or Social Status
 Antiguan and Barbudan law and practice prohibit discrimination
 based on race, sex, creed, language, or social status. The
 role of women in society is not restricted by law, but
 tradition limits women to home and family, particularly in
 rural areas. As elsewhere in the region, these traditional
 roles are changing. The Government has begun programs to
 provide enhanced educational opportunities for both sexes, as
 well as family planning services, which many expect to lead to
 greater participation by women in Antigua and Barbuda's
 economic, social, and political life.
 Two women senators sit in Parliament, and are the highest
 ranking female political figures in the country. The
 Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Health and the Chief
 Establishment Officer are both women. A woman also heads the
 Department of Tourism. There is a "Womens Desk" in the
 Government to monitor compliance with laws and statutes
 regarding women and to safeguard their legal rights. Ninety
 percent of the assistant permanent secretaries in the
 Government are women, as are 6 out of 10 personnel in the
 civil service. The law entitles women to equal pay for equal
 work.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The legal minimum working age is 13, and the minimum age law
 is respected. The workweek is 40 hours in 5 days, and workers
 are guaranteed a minimum of 3 weeks annual leave. There are
 no occupational health and safety laws or regulations. A
 minimum wage is established by law.
