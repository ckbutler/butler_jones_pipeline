 LiYHUANIA
 Lithuania is a parliamentary democracy, having regained its independence in
 1990 after more than 50 years of forced annexation by the Soviet Union. The Con-
 stitution, adopted by referendum in 1992, established a 141-member unicameral leg-
 islature, the Seimas; a directly elected president, who functions as Head of State;
 and a government formed by a prime minister and other ministers, appointed by
 the President and a pproved by the Seimas. The Government exercises authority
 with the approval ofthe Seimas and the President. In fair elections in 1992 the
 Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party (LDDP)-the successor to the Communist Party
 of Lithuania, which in 1989 broke away from the Soviet Communist Party-won a
 majority of parliamentary seats and formed the Government. In 1993 voters elected
 AlgidasBrazauskas, then Chairman of the LDDP, as President. The Conservatives
 prevailed in the October and November parliamentary elections, followed by the
 Christian Democrats. The two parties formed a coalition government (the first in
 Lithuania's history) in December.
 A unified national police force under the jurisdiction of the Interior Ministry is
 responsible for law enforcement. The State Security Department is responsible for
 internal security and reports to Parliament and the President. The police committed
 a number of human rights abuses.
 Since independence lithuania has made steady progress in developing a market
 economy. Over 40 percent of state property, including most housing and small busi-
 nesses, has been privatized. Trade is diversifying, with a gradual shift to Western
 markets. The largest number of residents are employed  agriculture (24.8 percent),
 followed by industrial enterprises (19.8 percent, including electricity, gas, and water
 supply), followed by wholesale and retail trade (12.3 percent). About 35 percent of
 those employed work for state enterprises, while 65 percent are employed n private
 companies. The agricultural sector's high proportion of the work force reflects a lack
 of efficient consolidation of small private farms and represents a vocal protectionist
 current in economic policy debates. The banking system remains weak. The inflation
 rate for the first half of 1996 was 10.2 percent, compared with 16.7 percent for the
 same time period in 1995. Per capita gross domestic product in 1996 was estimated
 at $2,000 (8,000 litas) and unemployment in October was 6.4 percent. The balance
 of trade remains negative due to imports of gas and other energy products from
 Russia. Major exports include textile and knitwear products, timber and furniture,
 electronic     food, and chemical and petroleum products.
 The Government generally respects the human rights of its citizens, but problems
 remain in some areas. Police on occasion beat detainees and abuse detention laws.
 Police corruption is on the rise, and prison conditions remain poor.
 Some journalists allege that government officials apply pressure on them not to
 criticize governmental policies or acts. Jewish cemeteries are sporadically subjected
 to some vandalism and pilferage. Violence and discrimination against women and
 child abuse are serious problems. The Government took steps to assist people with
 disabilities.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disa.ppearances.
 There is a problem, however, of women who have been forced-or willfngly sold-
 into prostitution by mafia gangs (see Section 5). Their families, unaware of the situ-
 ation claim that they have disappeared or have been kidnaped.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution specifically forbids torture, and there were no reports of its use.
 However, police sometimes beat or otherwise physically mistreated detainees. The
 local press reported that incidents of police brutality are becoming more common.
 In many instances, the victims reportedly are reluctant to bring charges against po-
 lice officers for fear of reprisals. In past years the Ministry of the Interior has been
 unwilling to publicize statistics on reported cases of police brutality. However, this
 year the Ministry has compiled a detailed list of abuses: 371 officers were recalled
 
 
 1019
 
 from duty for negative activities in the first 9 months of 1996-231 for disciplinary
 Sroblems, 72 for various traffic violations, 9 for abusing their occupational privi-
 eges, and 10 for brutality. The Interior Ministry states that district police inspec-
 tors are the most negligent in the force. The Minister requested the establishment
 of an internal affairs group that would be responsible for monitoring police abuses.
 However, the group has yet to be formed. The Commissar General states that dur-
 ing the year 337 officers were dismissed for wrongdoing, and 38 officers for criminal
 activity with the highest number of abuses occurring in the border police depart-
 ment. President Brazauskas has initiated an amendment to the Police Force Law,
 whereby the President would have the power to dismiss the Commissar General,
 and the police force would be separate from the Ministry of the Interior.
 Human rights violations continue in the military despite renewed efforts by mili-
 tary to quash criminal bullying-a practice inherited from the former Soviet armed
 forces. Rolandas Slkinas, a 21-year-old married conscript deserted after 1 month
 in the army because of constant taunting and beatings. Moreover, the chief resident
 of one of the major hospitals in Vilnis stated that soldiers in the army are con-
 stantly being treated for ipjuries resulting from abuse. In the first 6 months of the
 year, that same hospital alone treated four soldiers for broken jawbones. The Lith-
 uanian Human Rights Protection Association recommended that the Parliament
 take action on the problem and require the Ministry of Defense to prevent violations
 of human rights in the armed forces.
 Prison conditions are poor. Due to limited resources, most are overcrowded and
 poorly maintained. Prisoners on death row or serving life sentences are required to
 wear special striped uniforms. Human rights monitors are permitted to visit pris-
 ons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exil_- Except in cases that come under provi-
 sions of the Preventive Detention Law (described below), police may detain a person
 for up to 72 hours based upon reliable evidence of criminal activity. Under a law
 passed in June, a judge must also approve the detention. At the end of that period,
 police must decide whether or not to make a formal arrest, and a magistrate must
 approve an arrest warrant. The authorities have a total of 10 days to present sup-
 porting evidence. Once a suspect is formally charged, prosecutors may keep the sus-
 pect under investigative arrest for up to 2 months before taking the suspect to court.
 In exceptional cases, investigative arrest may be extended by a frther 6 to 9
 months with the written approval of the Prosecutor General. The Constitution pro-
 vides for the right to an attorney from the moment of detention.
 In an effort to cope with the rise in violent organized crime, in 1993 Parliament
 passed the Preventive Detention Law pertaining to persons suspected of being vio-
 lent criminals. The law, which was passed as a temporary measure, allowed police,
 but not the internal security and armed forces, to detain suspected violent criminals
 for up to 2 months rather than only for the standard 72-hour period. The effect of
 the law is to give prosecutors and investigators additional time to conduct an inves-
 tigation and file formal criminal charges against the detainee. Those apprehended
 must be released after 2 months if an investigation does not lead to formal charges.
 Local police commissioners must obtain the Prosecutor General's approval of each
 arrest carried out under the provisions of this law. In the first 9 months of the year,
 230 people were detained pursuant to this law compared with over 500 for all of
 1995. Of these 230 detainees, only 66 were released after the specified 2 month time
 period.
 The Parliament voted in December 1995 to extend this law for an additional year,
 maintaining provisions carried over from 1995 modifications, including checks on
 prosecutorial abuse. The law requires that a detainee: (1) must be informed within
 3 hours following arrest about the length of the preventive detention being consid-
 ered (not to exceed 2 months); and (2) must be brought before a court within 48
 hours of arrest for a ruling on the legality of the detention. Furthermore, a detainee
 has the legal right to consult with an attorney during the period of detention. The
 law gives law enforcement officials wide latitude in making arrest decisions and
 may be open to abuse. Parliamentarians who voted against the extension stated
 that preventive detention was not in keeping with the Constitution and the Euro-
 pean Convention on Basic Human Rights and Freedoms. The Prosecutor General,
 however, reported that although a drastic measure, it is effective. In several well-
 publicized cases, the law helped to convict and sentence dangerous criminals to
 Iengthy prison terms. In many other instances, however, the suspects were freed
 without charge after expiration of the maximum detention period, leading some ob-
 servers to believe that the police are abusing the length of the detention period pro-
 vided by this law.
 There is no provision for exile, nor is it practiced.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ia, and the judiciary is independent in practice.
 Eforts continued in 1996 to reform legal codes imposed during the Soviet era.
 Parliament passed new civil and criminal procedure codes as well as a Court Reform
 Law in 1996. The judicial system presently consists of a two-tier structure of district
 courts and a Supreme Court, which is an appellate court. There is also a Constitu-
 tional Court. Court decisions are arrived at independently. The Prosecutor General
 exercises an oversight responsibility through a network of district prosecutors who
 work with police investigators-empoyed by the Ministry of the Interior-in prepar-
 ing the prosecution's evidence for the courts. The institution of lay assessors was
 abolished at the end of 1994.
 Under the provisions of the Court Reform Law, two new kinds of courts are being
 created. Local district courts are being set up below the present district courts to
 handle cases at the municipal level, while a new appellate ourt level is hearing ap-
 peals arising from district court decisions, thereby reducing the case load of the
 overburdened Supreme Court. Moreover, a commercial court is in operation through
 the district courts.
 An arbitration system is pending. In addition, as a result of accession to the
 Council of Europe, the Ministry of Justice has begun a thorough review of Lithua-
 nia's laws with a view towards brign * them into accord with the provisions of the
 European Convention on Human Rights.
 The Constitution provides defendants with the right to counsel. In practice the
 right to legal counsel is abridged by the shortage of trained advocates who find it
 difficult to cope with the burgeoning numbers of criminal cases brought before the
 courts. Outside observers have recommended the establishment of a public defender
 em to regularize procedures for provision of legal assistance to indigent persons
 ed in c           l cases. B  law defense advocates have access to government evi-
 dence and may present evidence and witnesses. The courts and law enforcement
 agencies generally honor routine, written requests for evidence.
 Government rehabilitation of over 50,000 persons charged with anti-Soviet crimes
 during the Stalin era led to reports in 1991 that some people alleged to have been
 involved in crimes against humanity during the Nazi occupation had benefited from
 this rehabilitation. A special judicial procedure was established to examine each
 case in which an individual or organization raised an objection that a rehabilitated
 person may have committed a crime against humanity. In 1994 the Supreme Court
 overturned the rehabilitation of three persons whose cases were pending from 1993;
 there have been no such rulings by the Supreme Court since. Presently there is no
 legal procedure in Lithuania regulating the annulment of rehabilitation.
 Formal charges have not been brought against Lithuanian-American Aleksandras
 Lileikis, an alleged war crime suspect. After being stripped of his US. citizenship
 in May for concealing his World War II activities, which allegedly included persecut-
 ing Jews when he headed the security police of the Vilnius district under Nazi con-
 trol, the 89-year-old Lileikis returned to Vilnius. The Prosecutor General's office is
 passively investigating the case of Lilelkis' activities in Nazi-occupied Lithuania but
 has not pressed charges against him. The have yet to complete their interrogation
 of Lileikis, ostensibly due to his poor he   Lileikis denies the charges.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Famil, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the right to privacy. The authorities do not engage in in-
 discriminate or widespread monitoring of the correspondence or communications of
 citizens. With the written authorization of a prosecutor or judge, however, police
 and the security service may engage in surveillance and monitoring activities on
 grounds of national security. Except in cases of hot pursuit or the danger of dis-
 appearance of evidence, police must obtain a search warrant signed by a prosecutor
 beorey     may enter private premises.
 It is widely assumed, however, that law enforcement agencies have increased the
 use of a range of surveillance methods to cope with the expansion of organized
 crime. There is some question as to the legal basis of this police surveillance, but
 there are no known legal challenges to such surveillance.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press. The Government generally respects these rights in practice.
 Prior restraint over either print or broadcast media and restrictions on disclosure
 are prohibited, unless the Government determines that national security is involved.
 Nevertheless, journalists working for the state-owned electronic media complained
 about pressure by superiors to avoid criticism of government policies in their tele-
 vision and radio reporting. The Parliament adopted its long-awaited media law in
 
 
 1021
 July, after a draft public information law failed to pass in November 1995 because
 most independent news publications and many prominent journalists protested that
 it was too restrictive. The new media law introduced an element of self-regulation
 but postponed a difficult decision on television advertising. Under the new law, the
 media are to create a   a1 ethics commission and ombudsman to check l    cases
 and other complaints. The final version of the law allows reporting on the private
 lives of officials as long as the information affects the welfare of the people.
 The independent print media baa flourished since independence includng a wide
 range of economic newspapers and specialty magazines. Officially there are over
 2,00 newspapers and magazines registered, but only a fraction are still published.
 Many investigative jouralists covering organized crime were harassed by and re-
 ceived death threats from organized 'crime families."
 Five private radio stations, including one broadcasting in Polish, are on the air.
 Two private television stations also broadcast regular programing to wide audi-
 ences. Representatives of the private electronic media have complained for some
 time about unfair broadcastin- rates that the Government sets, which allegedly
 favor the state radio and television stations.
 There are no restrictions on academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-There are no laws that pro-
 hibit public gatherings. Citizens must inform local government authorities of
 planned demonstrations. During the first 6 months of 1996, pensioners protested 12
 times, demanding higher pensions and better health care.
 The Constitution provides for, and the authorities respect, the right of citizens to
 associate freely. The Communist Party of Lithuania and other organizations associ-
 ated with the Soviet regime continue to be banned. There are no special require-
 ments to form an association or political party.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for religious freedom, and the
 Government usually respects this provision in practice. The Law on Religious Com-
 munities and Associations was passed in October 1995. It grants religious commu-
 nities, associations, and centers property rights to prayer houses, homes, and other
 buildings and permits construction necessary for their activities. Article 5 of this
 law mentions nine religious communities that have been declared "traditional" by
 the law and therefore are eligible for governmental assistance: Latin Rite Catholics
 Greek Rite Catholics, Evangelical Lutherans, Evangelical Reformers, Orthodox, Old
 Believers Jews, Sunni Muslims, and Karaites. There are no restrictions on the ac-
 tivities of other religious communities.
 Relations between the Government and the officially registered Jewish community
 are good. Hiowever, the Hasidc Chabad Lubavich ommunity is having difficulties
 registering as a traditional Jewish religion. The Ministry of Justice argues that the
 Chabad Luhavich is not a part of Lthuania's historical, spiritual, or social heritage
 and therefore cannot be registered as traditional (Article 5 of the Law on Religious
 Communities and Associations). The Ministry states that the Chabad Lubavich does
 not have a continuity of traditions and is a separate branch of Judaism than that
 followed by the traditional Lithuanian Jewish religious community. Furthermore,
 they state that the Hasidic movement only began in ithuania in the 18th century
 and has been suspended twice. The Chabad Lubavich counter that the suspension
 of their activity during the war years and after was imposed by Nazi and Soviet
 occupiers. They also have protested the disassociation of the Hasidic movement from
 Judaism. The Chabad Lubavich continue to press for recognition as a traditional re-
 ligion. They have been allowed to operate a kindergarten.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Under the law, citizens and permanent residents are permitted free
 movement within the country and the right to return to the country. There are no
 restrictions on foreign traveL A growing number of refugees prompted the Govern-
 ment to begin plans for building a refugee detention center and other refugee facili-
 ties. Scandinavian countries are willing to assist this endeavor financially. The vast
 majority of refugees are fleeing economic, rather than political, conditions in their
 countries. However in April a group of 40 Asian refugees briefly threatened to
 starve themselves it they were not granted political asylum. Officials placated them,
 ending the hunger strike, but stated that the refugees' request cannot be granted.
 There were about 500 refugees waiting to be deported at year's end. Lithuania is
 prepared to begin readmission agreement discussions with Russia and has con-
 cluded an agreement with Ukraine.
 The refugee issue in Lithuania is closely linked to developments in Russia and
 other neighboring countries of the former Soviet Union, as it is mainly a transit
 country. Although a delimitation agreement has been signed between Lithuania and
 Belarus, the border has not yet been formally demarcate& Moreover, Lithuania has
 not signed readmission agreements with Belarus and Russia. During the year the
 
 
 1022
 Government established a refugee registration center in the town of Pabrade. The
 reception center includes status determination procedures for those officially seeking
 ayl,. There are approximately 400 economic refugees at the center.
 Lithuania has not signed the 1951 Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees
 or its 1967 Protocol. However, the Government adopted the Law on Refugee Status
 on July 4, which is expected to be ratified in 1997. It describes a refugee as for-
 eigner who has reasonacble grounds to fear persecution in his own country because
 of-race, religion, national origin, social status, or political beliefs, cannot be effi-
 ciently defended in his own country, or has good reason to be afraid to request such
 defense. Moreover, Lithuania observes the principle that no person may be returned
 to a territory where he may be exposed to persecution. The Government cooperates
 with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other
 humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. There were no reports of forced
 expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status.
 The issue of first asylum did not arise in 1996.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights:- The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Lithuania is a parliamentary democracy. The election law provides for a secret
 ballot in parliamentary elections. Of 141 parliamentary seats, 71 are elected directly
 and 70 through proportional representation. According to a new election law adopt-
 ed by the Seimas in June, only those parties that receive more than 5 percent of
 the total ballots (or 7 percent for coalitions) are allowed representation in the Par-
 Hiament. National minority slates have been exempt from this rule in the past, but
 despite the new guidelines ethnic Lithuanians, Pales, Russians, and Jews were all
 elected to the new Parliament in the fall elections.
 The Citizenship Law, adopted in 1991 and amended in October 1995, is inclusive
 with regard to the country's ethnic minorities. The law provides citizenship to per-
 sons who were born within the borders of the Republic; who were citizens of Lithua-
 nia pric- to 1940 and their descendants; or who became citizens under previous
 legal= authority. More than 90 percent of Lithuania's ethnic Russian, Polish,
 Belarusian, and Ukrainian inhabitants received citizenshi.
 Qualification for naturalization of persons not covered by the above-mentioned
 categories requires a 10-year residency, a permanent job or source of income, knowl-
 ede of the Constitution, renunciation of any other citizenship, and proficiency in
 Lithuanian.
 While there are no legal restrictions on women's participation in politics or gv-
 ernment thy are underrepresented in political leadership positions. There are now
 24 femafe deputies in the 141-member Seimas up from 9 before the fall elections,
 and 2 female ministers (up from 1) will serve in the new Cabinet.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Vwilatlons of Human Rights
 Most government authorities cooperate with local nongovernmental organizations
 and actively encourage visits by international and nongovernmental human rights
 gru. A    e exception is the Ministry of Interior, which has continually refused
 to release informatio n on poie bru tality and statistics on orruption-related inci-
 dents. The Asociation for the Defense ofH n Rights in Lithuania is an umbrella
 organization for several small human rights groups, all of which operate without
 government restriction. In 1994 the Government estabished the Department of
 International and Human Rights within the Ministry of Justice, which monitors law
 and legal practice to determine whether these are in accord with Lithuania's inter-
 national obligations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prhibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion, disability,
 or ethnic background. However, discrimination ainst women persists.
 Women-Abse of women at home is reportedly common, especially in connection
 with alcohol abuse by husbands, but institutional mechanisms for coping with this
 problem are only now being formed. The Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
 the women's organization Fokus have allotted 280,000 Norwegian krona ($111,947)
 for the establishment of a women's crisis center in Vilnius. At the shelter women
 will be able to receive professional counseling and support as well as medical aid.
 The religious organization Caritas opened a six-room shelter in Vilnius in Septem-
 ber as well. According to one sociological survey, 20 percent of women reported expe-
 riencing an attempted rape, while another 33 percent reported having been beaten
 at least once in their lives. There was a 10 percent drop in rape occurrences in the
 first half of 1996. Official statistics on the incidence of abuse of women in the home
 
 
 1023
 
 are not filed separately from other categories of assault. The Ministry of Interior
 stated that 30 women were killed in the fir t half of 1996 due to arguments result-
 ing from jealousy or domestic problems. This represents 34.5 percent of all murders
 during that time period. In addition, 43 women reportedly were severely beaten dur-
 ing the first half of 1996. Women's groups report some resistance among law en-
 forcement officials to collecting and releasing such statistics. Persons convicted of
 rape generally receive sentences of from 3 to 5 years in prison.
 There have been some women, mostly underage, who have been forced-or will-
 ingy sold-into prostitution by mafia gangs. Some agree to go out of naivete, others
 consciously, intending to become rich. Although some women go to the West of their
 own free will, many others are lured by deception: e.g., by advertisements in news-
 papers where seemingly inncent job are offered-work as "au pairs", bar dancers,
 or waitresses. Women are also tricked into prostitution through false marriage ad-
 vertisements. According to 1995 statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, 80 Lith-
 uanian women engaged in prostitution were deported from Israel (the number for
 1996 was 30), 9 from Germany, 5 from the Netherlands, and 4 from Poland. Their
 families are often unaware of the situation and believe that they have disappeared
 or been kidnaped. An official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that about
 *99 percent of women who have been reported missing are actually willingly working
 as prostitutes in the West.
 The Constitution provides for equal rights for men and women, and official policy
 specifies equal pay for equal work. Generally, men and women receive the same pay
 for comparable work, but women are significantly underrepresented in some profes-
 sions and in the managerial sector as a whole. Significant inequalities in society
 based on gender continue, and there are still very conservative views about the role
 of women. The fact that women's enrollment now exceeds that of men in some uni-
 versity departments has prompted university administrators to introduce pref-
 erential entrance criteria f6r men to redress what is perceived as an abnormal state
 of affairs. Parliamentary deputies speaking about female deputies in public some-
 times make unflattering comments based on gender stereotypes without eliciting
 any public reaction.
 C&re.-The Ministries of Social Protection and of the Interior share official re-
 nslbility for the protection of children's rights and welfare. Starting in 1994, the
 MSocial Protection took on many of the
 functions formerly handled by the Interior Ministry and its subordinate police offi-
 cers throughout the country, thereby focusing more attention on the social welfare
 needs of children- There are 56 br es of the Children's Right Protection Council
 oghout Lithuania. This Council registers and cares for children in dysfunctional
 and abusive families, registering some 26,000 this year. Furthermore, a "village" for
 orphaned children has been built near Jilnius by the German organization SOS
 Kinderdrf for $10 million.
 Child abuse is a problem. The press has been thorough in reporting increases in
 cruelty to children, including sexual abuse, intentional starvation, beatings, and
 murder. Authorities reported that seven children were killed as a result of severe
 beatings by parents in the first half of 1996. No department or organization collects
 information on child abuse, however. Moreover, there are no specific criminal codes
 for child pornography, sexual abuse, or sex tourism. There is only one rehabilitation
 center for children who have been sexually abused in the country.
 Social welfare workers believe that child abuse in connection with alcohol abuse
 by parents is a serious problem. Moreover, the prevalence of authoritarian values
 in family upbringing has discouraged more active measures against child abuse.
 People With Disailities.-The Government designated 1996 the Year for Disabled
 Persons. More than 350,000 people with disabilities live in Lithuania-10,000 of
 them children. The Law on Integrating Disabled People, passed in 1991, provides
 for a broad category of rigts and government benefits to which disabled people are
 legally entitled.ne Pariament allotted $7.5 million (31 million litas--more than
 double the $3.25 million disbursed in 1994) for the betterment of facilities for the
 disabled, prosthetics, specially equipped vans, and other technology. An apartment
 building specially designed for people with various disabilities being built in Lithua-
 nia's second-largest city, Kaunas, should be completed in 1997. A center for deaf
 children is being created, as is a program for children with special orthopedic prob-
 lems.
 Religious Minorities.-A small Jewish community exists, largely in main cities.
 Jewish leaders called on officials to provide better police protection for Jewish ceme-
 teries in Kaunas, Vilnius, and Klaipeda, which have been subject to some sporadic
 vandalism and pilferage.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Minority ethnic groups-including Russians,
 Poles, Belarusians, and Ukrainians-comprise roughly 20 percent of the population.
 
 
 1024
 
 A few hundred representatives of the Polish minority protested in June against a
 law depriving ethnic minorities of preference in elections (see Section 3). Poles also
 protested the redrawig of the boundaries of Vilnius to include a region heavily pop-
 ulated with ethnic Poles. They are angered by the rise in taxes tat accompanies
 inclusion in the city of Vilnius.
 Lithuania amended article 47 of its Constitution to allow foreigners to purchase
 land. The new law, which allows only citizens from European Union and NATO na-
 tions to own land, discriminates against citizens of other nations, notably those from
 the former Soviet Union.
 Many public sector employees were required to attain a functional knowledge of
 Lithuanian within several years, although the authorities have been granting liberal
 extensions of the date by which this is to be achieved. During the first 8 months
 of 1996, language testing committees tested 4,025 people for whom Lithuanian is
 not a native Ianguage. Of those examined, 3,349 were certified as language quali-
 fied. To gain citizenship, 120 people were tested, 97 of whom passed. There is no
 documented evidence of~b dismissals based on the language raw. The authorities
 have indicated that the intent of the law is to apply moral incentives to learn Lith-
 uanian as the official language of the State; they have asserted that no one would
 be dismissed solely because of an inability to meet the language requirement.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association The Constitution and the 1991 Law on Trade Unions
 recognize the right of workers and employees to form and join trade unions. The
 Law on Trade Unions formally extends this right to employees of the police and the
 armed forces, although the Collective Agreements Law of 1991 does not allow collec-
 tive bargaining by government employees involved in law enforcement and security
 related work. In 1990 the Lithuanian branch of the Soviet Union's All-Union
 Central Council of Trade Unions, including 23 of 25 trade unions, renamed itself
 the Confederation of Free Trade Unions (CFIU) and began asserting increased inde-
 pendence from its Soviet parent. In 1993 the CFTU joined eight other unions that
 also had been part of the All-Union Central Council to form the Lithuanian Trade
 Union Center (LTUC).
 The Lithuanian Workers' Union (LWU) was formed in 1990 as an alternative to
 the CFTU. Unlike the CFTU/LTUC, the LWU was an early supporter of Lithuanian
 independence from the Soviet Union and actively sought Western free trade union
 contacts. The LWU claims a dues-paying membership of 50,000 workers organized
 in 35 regional groupings.
 The Law on Trade Unions and the Constitution provide for the right to strike,
 although public officials prvidig essential services may not do so. Many workers
 threatened to strike because of low wage, but there were no major strikes in 1996.
 There are no restrictions on unions affiliating with international trade unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and .Bargain Co/ectvy. -The Collective Agreements
 Law provides for ollective bargaining and the right of unions to organize employ-
 ees, thou    several provisions reportedly hinder the establishment of new union
 organizations. According to the law, unions, in order to be registered, must have at
 least 30 founding me'rs in large enterrises or have a membership of one-fifth
 of all employees in small enterprises. Difficulties commonly arise in state enter-
 prises in which employees are represented by mre than one union. LWU officials
 charge that managers in some state enterprises discriminate ag t LWU organiz-
 ers and have on occasion dismissed employees in retribution or their trade union
 activities. The LWU also charges that the udicial system is slow to respond to LWU
 grievances regarding dismissals from work. LWU representatives clain that state
 managers sometimes prefer the CFTU/LTUC over LW/U unions as collective bar-
 gaining partners.
 In general trade union spokesmen say that managers often deterine wages with-
 out regard to trade union wishes, except in larger factories with well-organied
 trade unions. The Government issues periodic decrees that serve as gudelines for
 state enterprise management in setting wage scales. The LWU and the LTUC en-
 gage in direct collective bargaining over wages at the workplace level. Wage deci-
 sions are increasingly being made at the enterrise level, although government min-
 istries still retain some control over this sphere in state-owned enterprises. The
 LWU reports that it supplements its bargaining efforts with active lobbying in gov-
 ernment ministries that own enterprises. During the first 6 months of 1996 prices
 increased faster than the growth of wage increases, thereby reversing a process of
 real wage growth that hadbegun in 1993.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor, and this prohibition is observed in practice.

 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Chi-dren-The legal minimum age for em-
 plotyment of children without parental consent is 16 years. The legal minimum age
 wih    e written consent of parents is 14 years. Free trade union representatives
 assert that the mechanisms for monitor*    minimum   age legislation are rdi-
 eentary. Complaints about infringement of child labor regulations generally are re-
 ferred to local prosecutors who investigate the charges and take legal action to stop
 violations. Available evidence suggests that child labor is rare.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Wor.-The legal minimum wage was raised on Sep-
 tember 1 from $30 (120 litas) to $75 (300 litas) per month. The minimum wage does
 not prvide a decent standard of living for a worker and family. The average wae
 in the public sector is $166 (663 litas)-per month. The Council of Ministers and te
 Ministry of Social Pr   on periodically set the minimum  wage. Every 3 months
 these government bodies must submit their minimum wage proposals to the Par-
 iament, which, has the right to approve or revise the minimum wage level. Enforce-
 ment ofthe minimm wage is a     st nonexistent, in part because the Government
 does not_ want to exacerbate the unemployment problem  (The unemployment rate
 durig the second quarter of 1996 was 14.2 percent.) The 40-hour workweek is
 standad, with a prvision for at least one 24-hour rest period. For a majority of
 the population, living standards remain low. The poorest households spend 68 per-
 cent of their income on food, compared to 45 percent in wealthier households.
 The Consitution provides that workers have the right to safe and healthy work-
 ing conditions. In 1993 a Labor Safety Law went into effect, setting the rihts of
 workers confronted with hazardous conditions and providing legal protection for
 workers who file complaints about such conditions. The State LaLor Inspection Serv-
 ice, which the law estabished, is charged with implementing the Labor Safety Law.
 Regional labor inspetion offices, each of which employs onl-y two or three officials,
 are severely understaffed. They closed 77 enterprises or departments of enterprises
 found to be in violation of safety regulations during the first 6 months of 1996. Un-
 safe conditions caused by worn, outdated industrial technologies are reportedly
 wiespread, and 36 work-related deaths were recorded in the fir-st 6 months of 1996.
