 CENTRAL AFRICAN EMPIRE
 Constitutional rule returned to the Central African
 Empire (CAE) after an eleven-year hiatus in December
 1976 with the proclamation of the Empire. Despite
 authoritarian rule, the Central African record during
 the past decade on some aspects of human rights, e.g.,
 freedom of religion and the involvement of women, is
 fairly good. The new constitution contains a specific
 bill of rights which guarantees basic civil and religious
 liberties and some political rights. National and party
 elections should take place before the end of the year.
 The nation's human rights image has suffered recently
 from isolated individual cases which have received wide-
 spread media attention -- such as the detention of two
 western journalists in July 1977, earlier (1972) ear
 cutting and public beating incidents, and the incongruity
 some journalists saw in the nature of the coronation
 ceremony in a poor country.
 During the past four months the government of the CAB has
 actively sought to improve its human rights record. It
 has entered into a government-to-government human rights
 dialogue with the United States; made decisions and
 adopted policies designed to ameliorate the situation;
 and strongly reiterated its intention to continue the
 current trend.
 1.   Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The extent to which torture is utilized, if at all, is
 unknown.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Prison conditions are inadequate by international stan-
 dards. Detainees are mistreated and beatings are a conmmon
 form of discipline.
 The last incident of public mutilation took place in 1972
 when the right ears of several convicted thieves were
 removed. This incident received a considerable amount
 of unfavorable external publicity. Partially as a
 
 
 result of the extremely negative foreign reaction, the
 government decided to stop the practice. The dis-
 memberment statutes have been repealed and no further
 incidents have been reported.
 In July 1977 two western journalists were arrested for
 violation of CAE immigration and censorship laws. The
 American was summarily expelled, but the Briton was
 beaten and incarcerated for a month. He was later ex-
 pelled when the government decided not to press charges.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 According to local law, detention without charges is
 limited to three days, but can be prolonged to six days.
 At that point, a detainee must either be formally
 charged or permitted to go free. In practice, however,
 the preventive detention of many persons is prolonged
 without judicial recourse.
 Several of the seven political prisoners reported by
 Amnesty International in February 1977 were released in
 December 1977.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The legal system of the CAE is patterned on the French
 judicial system. A number of conscientious jurists
 attempt to see that laws are justly executed and that
 correct legal procedures are applied in a fair and
 public manner.
 A potential challenge to the authority of the traditional
 civil court structure is the Permanent Military Tribunal.
 The jurisdiction of the tribunal now extends to all
 political crimes and all cases of embezzlement or mis-
 appropriation of state funds or property. The notable
 human rights aspects of the Tribunal include: 1) no
 right to counsel, 2) no right of appeal, and 3) re-
 striction to the Emperor of the decision to prosecute
 before the Permanent Military Tribunal.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Inviolability of the home is guaranteed in the new
 imperial constitution. In practice it is not respected
 in politically-related cases.

 2.   Recent Trends in Governmental Policies Relating
 to the Fulfillment of Such Vital Needs as Food,
 Shelter, Health Care and Education
 The development strategy of the government of the
 Central African Empire is summed up in the national
 slogan, "to clothe, to house, to feed, to care for, and
 to educate."
 Within the limited resources available to it, and with
 the assistance of foreign donors, the nation has had
 some success in implementing this mandate. Expansion
 of health, education, and agricultural services has high
 priority as does the creation of a rural development
 corps.
 Corruption exists, but it is difficult to establish the
 extent to which corruption hinders the achievement of
 national economic goals. When caught, offending
 officials are imprisoned.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Thought, Speech, Religion, Press
 and Assembly
 The CAE continues to enjoy a good record concerning the
 freedom of religion. Religious organizations are an
 integral part of life in the CAE and are protected by
 the new constitution. The right of access to knowledge,
 right of association and rights of privacy are also
 guaranteed, except when deemed interference with the
 security of the state. International mail is regularly
 censored.
 The press is government-controlled and assembly for
 political purposes is subject to government authorization.
 There is in practice flexibility within the system and
 some limited freedom of expression. For example, the
 American Ambassador was recently asked to debate U.S.
 human rights policies on national televisibn. The
 government does not seek to impose ideological con-
 formity or restrict intellectual enquiry.
 The national trade union is a government sponsored in-
 stitution. Nonetheless, it has in the past had latitude
 for independent action on bread-and-butter issues and
 negotiation with expatriate employers.
 b.   Freedom of Movement within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 
 
 Although there are security checks for travelers, there
 are few limitations on movement within the country. There
 are few restrictions on foreign travel or emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The December 1976 change in the form of government from
 republic to monarchy marked the government's announced
 intent to restore democratic institutions. The consti-
 tution calls for creation ofa national assembly which
 will join the executive branch as one of the two main
 elements of the government, under the overall supervision
 of the Emperor. All deputies will be required to be
 members of the sole political party and will enjoy limited
 parliamentary immunity. Party and national elections
 should take place in 1978. All adults will be eligible to
 vote.
 4.    Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 No outside independent organizations, to the best of our
 knowledge, have requested permission to investigate
 human rights violations in the Central African Empire,
 despite the recent detentions of two western journalists.
 The Central African Empire invited Amnesty International
 to visit the CAE and to attend the coronation ceremonies.
