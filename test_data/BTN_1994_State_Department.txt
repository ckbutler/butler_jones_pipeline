 BHUTAN*
 The Wangchuck dynasty of hereditary monarchs has ruled Bhutan since 1907. Lo-
 cated in the Himalayas between India and Tibet, the small Kingdom has been able
 to escape domination by any external power since the 10th century. There is no
 written constitution or bill of rights. King Jigme Sinhye Wangchuck, on the throne
 since 1972, has continued some efforts toward social and political modernization
 begun by his father. However, in the past half-decad government efforts to repress
 ethnic Nepalese has sidetracked further progress. Budhst citizens fear for the sur-
 vival of their culture and identity because of the rapid growth of the Nepalese seg-
 ment of the population. Buddhists constitute one-half to two-thirdsof the population
 and generally inhabit the northern areas of the Kingdom. About one-third of the
 population, living mostly in the southern districts, is I~rmdu of Nepalese origin.
 The Royal Bhutan Police, a force of about 5,000, assisted by the Royal Bhutan
 Army, with approximately 7,000 lightly armed men, and a militia of about 10,000,
 maintains internal security. These forces have committed gross human rights
 abuses against ethnic Nepalese in the past, and the Government has failed to pros-
 ecute those responsible.
 An estimated 90 percent of Bhutan's 600,000 population live in rural areas on
 subsistence agriculture in a mainly barter economy and are largely illiterate. India
 is Bhutan's main trading partner and principal source of foreign exchange.
 The human rights situation improved slightly, but many basic rights remain re-
 stricted. There was insufficient information to determine if the Government contin-
 ued to sanction the expulsion of ethnic Nepalese. These people continued to arrive
 in refugee camps in eastern Nepal, although in much lower numbers than in the
 past few years. Some refugees claim that they were evicted by security fores. From
 1989 to 1992, Bhutanese authorities forcibly expelled tens of thousands of people do-
 clared to be illegal immigrants under the 1985 Citizenship Act. Other rights are also
 restricted. The citizens do not have the right to change their government, and there
 are significant limitations on the right to a fair trial, peaceful association and as-
 sembly, and on worker rights. Traditional cultural practices discriminate against
 women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no independent con-
 firmations of political or extrajudicial killings. However, the government-controlled
 weekly news paper continued to describe dozens of incidents in which unidentified
 men staged hit-and-run attacks on civilians living in the south, resulting in some
 deaths. Many attacks, described by the Government as political terrorism, appear
 to have been the work of criminal gangs taking advantage of unsettled conditions
 on the border with India.
 b. Disappearance.-From 1989-92, police and army forces arrested thousands of
 ethnic Nepalese suspected of supporting the dissident movement. Some have been
 held in incommunicado detention; others have disappeared. The Government has de-
 nied responsibility for any disappearances. In the past few years, the Government
 released from detention at least 1,666 ethnic Nepalese under official amnesties, in-
 cluding 23 on February 22. Among those amnestied in February was Deo Dutta
 Sharma, a student leader who says he was abducted by the Royal Bhutan Police
 from the Indian state of West Bengal in December 1989. After his release Sharma
 claimed he was held in solitary confinement for the first 3 years of his detention.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 According to local human rights groups allegations of torture and rape in southern
 Bhutan decreased at the end of 1993. Rowever, there was little evidence of that the
 Government investigated or punished security force officials implicated in the wide-
 spread abuses reported during 1989-1992. Government forces committed these
 abuses in southern Bhutan as part of an effort to reduce the presence of ethnic Nep-
 alese (see Section 5). This policy created a climate of impunity in which the Govern-
 ment tacitly condoned the physical abuse of ethnic Nepalese.
 The Human Rights Organization of Bhutan (HUROB), the People's Forum for
 Human Rights Bhutan (PFHRB), and the South AsiaHuman Rights Documentation
 Center (SAHRbC) published dozens of affidavits from victims of rape and torture
 who fled to refugee camps in Nepal. Several nongovernmental organizations (NGO's)
 *The United States does not have an embassy in Bhutan. Information on the human rights
 situation is therefore limited.

 in Nepal are providing rehabilitation services to victims of torture among those refu-
 gees.
 Following the 1990 disturbances and mass arrests, prison conditions had been
 poor, with inadequate sanitation, unhealthy food, and endemic overcrowding which
 reportedly resulted in the deaths of detainees. Respon  to urging from Amnesty
 International (Al), the Government ended the use of shackles in 1992. Representa-
 tives from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRO) began visiting pris-
 ons in 1993. The opening of a new prison camp in Chemgang and the release of
 more than 1,600 detainees contributed to some improvement in conditions of deten-
 tion.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arbitrary arrest and detention remain a
 problem but are not routinely used as a form of harassment. The law does not pro-
 vide for protection against arbitrary arrest. There are few established procedures for
 processing detainees. These shortcomings in the criminal justice system leave the
 authorities ample room for abuse. The authorities may arrest persons without war-
 rants and detain them for weeks before they are brought before a judcia officer.
 Delay in informing family members of an arrest is commonplace. Incommunicado
 detention was a serious problem in 1991 and 1992, but the initiation of ICRC prison
 visits and establishment of an ICRC mail service between detainees and family
 members has helped to allay this problem.
 'Terrorists" caught by vlage volunteers are generally held in detention camps in
 southern Bhutan before they are transferred to prison facilities near the capital. In
 many cases, the detention of accused "antinationals," a term the Government uses
 to describe some ethnic Nepalese dissidents, is arbitrarily pro longed. At mid-year,
 the authorities d      etaine  o   tainees on charges reated to political umst
 in southern Bhutan. Many have been awaiting trial for nearly 4 years.
 Although the Government does not formally; use exile a form of punishment, many
 of the accused "antinationals" freed under government amnesties say they were re-
 leased on the condition that they depart the country. Several of them subsequently
 registered at camps in Nepal funded by the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Triai.-The judicial system consists of district courts and
 a High Court in Thimpu with judges appointed by the Royal Civil Service Commis-
 sion. Minor offenses and administrative matters are adjudicated by village head-
 men. Criminal cases and a variety of civil matters are adjudicated under a 17th cen-
 leal d     revised in 1965, which applies to all citizens regardless of ethnic
 origin. udges are accountable to the King are responsible for all aspects of a case,
 inclug investigation, filing of charges, prosecution, and judgment.
 Defendants have the right to appeal to the High Court, and maw make a final
 appeal to the King, who traditionally delegates the decision to the Royal Advisory
 Council. The lega system does not provide for jury trials or the right to a court-
 appointed defense attorney, although it does allow or  e appointment of a    -jambi,"
 a person trained in the law, if the defendant so desires. Defendants are not pre-
 sented with written charges; instead they answer to accusations made orally.
 Questions of family law, such as marriage, divorce, and adoption are resolved ac-
 cording to a citizes religion: Buddhist law for the majority Buddist population; and
 Hindu law, which predominates in areas inhabited by ethnic Nepalese.
 The Government tried and convicted about 40 people over the past 2 years on
 charges of treason and other "antinational" activities related to ethnic Nepalese re-
 sistance to the 1985 Citizenship Act and its enforcement by the Government. In ad-
 dition, some or all of the 129 persons detained in Chemgang Prison in connection
 with anti-national activities may be political prisoners. TekNath Rizal, an ethnic
 Nepalese and internationally recognized political prisoner, remained in prison fol-
 lowing his 1993 conviction under the National Security Act.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-There
 are no laws providing for these rights, but cultural traditions are highly respectful
 of personal privacy. However, the uGovernment has undermined these traditions by
 its emphasis on promoting national integration. For example, a royal decree issued
 in 1989 made Drukpa national dress compulsory for allcitizens. Ayone found violat-
 ing the decree may be fined or sentenced to jail for a week. Although observance
 of the decree is lax, there are occasional drives to stiffen enforcement, which exposes
 ethnic Nepalese to intimidation. According to human rights groups, police regularly
 conduct house-to-house searches for suspected dissidents without explanation or
 legal justification.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-With an adult literacy rate around 30 percent,
 Bhutan's population is relatively uninfluenced by the print media. Kuensel, the Gov-
 
 
 1216
 ernment's weekly newspaper, with a circulation of 10,000, is the countrys only regu-
 lar publication. The authorities allow indirect criticism of the King in the National
 Assembly and Kuensel sometimes covers such criticism. Indian and other foreign
 newspapers are available, but authorities confiscate and censor editions carrying ar-
 ticles critical of the royal family or government policies.
 Bhutan has no television broadcast service. In 1989 the Government ordered the
 dismantlement of all private television antennas and satellite receiving dishes.
 The government radio station broadcasts each day in the four mijor national lan-
 guages (Dzongkha, the language of the western highlands; Nepali, English; and
 Sharchop).
 At the end of 1990, the Government banned the Nepali language as a medium
 of instruction in Bhutanese schools.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-These freedoms are restricted.
 Citizens may engage in peaceful assembly and association only for purposes ap-
 proved by the Government. Although the Government allows civic and business or-
 ganizations, there are no political parties. The Government regards two parties or-
 ganized by ethnic Nepalese exiles--the the BPP and BNDP -as terrorist and
 antinational" organizations and has declared them illegal. The parties do not con-
 duct activities inside the country. The BNDP advocates a constitutional monarchy
 with a parliamentary democracy. The BPP seeks an ethnic Nepalese government.
 A third exile-based opposition party, the Druk National Congress, was launched
 in mid-1994 by reform-minded persons of the Drukpa elite.
 c. Freedom of Religion.--Buddhism is the state reigion. The Government sub-
 sidizes monasteries and shrines and provides aid to about a third of the Kingdom's
 12,000 monks. The monastic establishment enjoys statutory representation in the
 National Assembly and Royal Advisory Council and is an influential voice on public
 policy. Citizens of other faiths, mostly Hindus, enjoy freedom of worship but may
 not proselytize. Under the law, conversions are illegal. The King has declared major
 Hindu festivals to be national holidays, and the royal family participates in them.
 Foreign missionaries are not permitted to proselytize, but international Christian
 relief organizations and Jesuit priests are active in education and humanitarian ac-
 tivities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--Some citizens enjoy considerable freedom of movement, but many re-
 ports indicate that ethnic Nepalese face travel restrictions within Bhutan. The
 southern border with India is open, and people residing in the immediate vicinity
 cross it freely. The Government has informally limited the admission of tourists to
 4,000 a year, a limit which includes Indians who enter the country by airplane or
 stay in hotels. There were 2,985 such arrivals in 1993. By treaty, citizens may re-
 side and work in India.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government. Bhutan is an absolute
 monarchy, with sovereign power vested in the King. The Government has resisted
 democratic changes.
 Decisionmaking is centered in the royal palace and involves only a small number
 of officials in the civil and religious establishment. Although the present King and
 his father have made some attempts to integrate women and ethnic Nepalese into
 the body politic, the system is still dominated by the male members of an aristoc-
 racy of Mahayana Buddhist ancestry.
 Political parties do not legally exist, and their formation is discouraged by the
 Government. The Government prohibits two parties established by abroad by ethnic
 Nepalese (see Section 2.b.).
 We National Assembly, established in 1953, is composed of 105 members elected
 by limited franchise: by village headmen in Buddhist areas and heads of families
 in Hindu areas. Twelve members of the Assembly are elected by monastic establish-
 ments and 33 members are high-level government officials appointed by the King.
 The Assembly enacts laws, approves senior government appointments, and advises
 the King on matters of national importance. Voting is by secret ballot, with a simple
 majority needed to pass a measure. The King may not formally veto legislation, but
 may return bills for further consideration. The Assembly occasionally rejects the
 King's recommendations or delays implementing them, but in general, the King has
 enough influence to persuade the Assembly to approve legislation he considers es-
 sential or to withdraw proposals he opposes. The Assembly may question govern-
 ment officials and force them to resign by a two-thirds vote of no confidence.
 
 
 1217
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government does not allow local human rights groups. At least three roups
 established by ethnic Nepalese exiles, HUROB, PFHRB, and the Association of
 Human Rights Activists-Bhutan (AHURA), operate abroad and take depositions
 from ethnic Nepalese refugees arriving in Nepal (see Section 1.c.). The Government
 accuses these groups of working for the opposition and does not permit them in
 Bhutan. These groups also conduct international campaigns to put pressure on the
 government and provide human rights education in the refugee camps. However,
 they rarely report violations committed by dissident political groups.
 The Government continued to cooperate with humanitarian groups. ICRC rep-
 resentatives continued their periodic prison visits, and the Government for the first
 time allowed them access to temporary detention facilities in the south, an area in-
 habited by ethnic Nepalese. The Government also allowed a visit by a team from
 Refugees International, which traveled widely in the south.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability Language, or So-
 cil Status
 Women-Bhutan has not developed a rigid caste system or customa that seques-
 tr or disenfranchise women. Family land is divided equally between sons and
 daughters, and dowry is not practiced, even among ethnic Nepalese Hindus. A study
 by the Uited Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)found that boys and girls receive
 equal treatment regarding nutritin and health care. This equality is reflected in
 data showing little difference in child mortality rates between the sexes. UNICEF
 found that among Among urban dwellers, girls are given "ecpaal or nearly equal op-
 portunities" to pursue education. However, government data indicate that is ac-
 count for only about 40 percent of the school population nationwide. Although tradi-
 tional cultural paten place girls in a lower status than boys, girls are still cher-
 ished, as women generally care for parents in old age.
 The sexes mix freely, and plygyny is sanctioned as Iong as the first wife gives
 her permission. Marriages may be arranged by partners themselves as well as by
 their parents. Divorce is common. Recent legislation requires that all marriages
 must be registered and favors women in matters of alimony. About 10 percent of
 government employees are women. Women in unskilled jobs are generally paid less
 f~an men.
 Rape was made a criminal offense in 1953, but that law had weak penalties and
 was poorly enforced. In 1993 the National Assembly adopted a revised Rape Act
 with clear definitions of criminal sexual assault and stronger penalties. In cases of
 rape involving minors, reportedly a growing problem, sentences range from 5 to 17
 years. In extreme cases, a rapist may be imprisoned for lfe.
 Chidren.-Childre     renj oy a pri soged position in society and benefit from inter-
 national development programs focused on maternal and child welfare. There is no
 known pattern of societal abuse against children.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Ethnic Nepalese arrived in Bhutan in large
 numbers at the turn of the centuiy. The Citizens hip Law of 1958 granted citizen-
 ship to all ethnic Nepalese adults who owned land and had lived in Bhutan for at
 least 10 years (also see Section 2.d.). However, the Government maintains that
 large-scale illegal immigration continued and was not detected until the 1988 cen-
 sus. The discovery that ethnic Nepalese were close to becoming a majority prompted
 the Government to launch an aggressive campaign to reassert Bhutanese, or
 Drukpa, culture, restric immigration, and expel many ethnic Nepalese. The ruling
 elite feared that Bhutan s Budis society would be overwhelmedby the Hindu eth-
 nic Nepalese--as happened in neighboring Sikkim, which was annexed by India in
 1974.
 Early efforts at halting the unfavorable demographic trends focused on limiting
 hnmiUr-ation and attempting to assimilate the existing ethnic Nepalese. Attempts at
 assimilation included inancial incentives for intermarriage, education for some stu-
 dents in regions other than their own, and direction of economic development funds
 othe south. By 1989 assimilation gave way to policies aimed at Bhutanization.
 Measures intended to preserve a national identity required the wearing of Bhuta-
 nus dress, made the teaching of Dzongkha compulsory, and banned instruction in
 Nejpali.
 Beginning in early 1988, the Government sought to reduce the ethnic Nepalese
 population by enforcing a 1985 law that significantly tightened the requirements for
 citizenship. Until 1985, citizenship was conferred upon children if their father was
 a citizen under the 1958 Nationality Law. However, the 1985 act raised this stand-
 ard by requiring that both parents must be citizens to confer citizenship on their
 
 
 1218
 children. The Government declared as illegal immigrants all residents who could not
 meet the new requirement.
 Residents wholost their citizenship under the 1985 act may apply for naturaliza-
 tion, but only after satisfying arigorous set of standards that include proficiency
 in the Dzongkha language and proof of residence during the previous 15 years.
 Exile political groups complain the law makes unfair demands for documentation
 on largely illiterate people in a country that has only recently adopted basic admin-
 istrative procedures. They claim many ethnic Nepalese whose families have been in
 Bhutan for generations were expelled because they were unable to document their
 claims to residence. The Government denies this and asserts that the word of village
 leaders is an acceptable substitute for written documentation. Refugee groups claim
 that village elders are not present when citizenship interviews are carried out.
 The 1985 Citizenship Act also stipulates the revocation of citizenship of any natu-
 ralized citizen who "has shown by act or speech to be disloyal in any manner what-
 soever to the King, country and people of Bhutan.7 The Home Ministry, in a circular
 notification in 1990, advised that 'any Bhutanese national leaving the country to
 assist and help the antinationals shall no longer be considered as a Bhutanese citi-
 zen * * * such people's family members living under the same household will also
 be held fully responsible and forfeit their citizenship." Human rights groups charge
 this provision was widely used to revoke the citizenship of ethnic Nepalese who
 were subsequently exiled from southern Bhutan.
 Arrivals of refugees in the eight camps run by the UNHCR and its cooperating
 agencies in Nepal peaked during 1992. By mid-1994, arrivals had fallen to slightly
 more than 60 per month, reflectin a significant decrease in the number of families
 emigrating from Bhutan. Independent lGO's reorted that many of the refugees ar-
 riving inNepal in 1994 had unquestioned Bhutanese citizenship and made no
 claims of political persecution in Bhutan. Most of the arrivals reported that they de-
 parted Bhutan because of the depopulation in the southern districts, a heightened
 sense of apprehension and insecurity, and the desire to be reunited with family
 members already in Nepal. A group of 284 who arrived in April was reportedly com-
 posed of bona fide Bhutanese citizens who left because of a land dispute.
 By May 83,817 refugees were registered in the UNHCR camps, of whom about
 66,000 arrived in 1992. Between 5,000 and 15,000 other refugees are believed to
 have settled with family members in India. The total outflow of approximately
 100 000 people in 2 years is equal to about 15 percent of Bhutan's population.
 The Government maintains that those who have been expelled are Nepalese or
 Indian citizens who arrived in Bhutan after the enactment of the 1958 Nationality
 Law. It also claims the majority of those in Nepal departed Bhutan voluntarily after
 selling their land and property. Nonetheless, there are credible reports that these
 "voluntary" emigrants were compelled to sign away their property by government
 officials.
 A Nepal-Bhutan joint ministerial committee met in February, April, and June to
 discuss ways to determine which refugees might be entitled to return to Bhutan.
 These discussions achieved little progress.
 As concern spread about the growing refugee population in Nepal, international
 pressure mounted on the Government. In response, the Government tried to reduce
 the outflow of migrants from southern Bhutan. The Government issued a royal de-
 cree which made the forcible eviction of a citizen a criminal offense. Three govern-
 ment officials were convicted on charges of intimidating ethnic Nepalese. The decree
 also exempted ethnic Nepalese from paying rural taxes and contributing labor for
 development projects in 1992. However, the exodus had gained momentum and by
 early 1994 visitors reported that much of southern Bhutan had become depopulated
 (see Section 2.d.)
 By law southerners may own land and establish business in the north, and north-
 erners have the same right in the south. Nonetheless, it is reportedly still difficult
 for ethnic Nepalese, except government officials, to buy property in Buddhist areas.
 Residents are required to provide certificates issued by the police for admission
 to school and government jobs. For example, a February 16 advertisement in the
 national newspaper required a police certificate from students seeking to enter a
 government-supported training course. Human rights gups claim these certificates
 are used to prevent ethnic Nepalese citizens from taking jobs or educational slots
 in many districts of Bhutan.
 Exiles student groups accuse the Government of revoking the scholarships of eth-
 nic Nepalese students who were accused of supporting the dissident movement. Gov-
 ernment critics claimed families with ties to the palace and senior levels of the Gov-
 ernment are strongly favored in their access to government employment and state
 scholarships for foreign education. The Government contends it has made a serious
 effort to send qualified minority candidates for education overseas.
 
 
 1219
 People With Disabilities.-There is no evidence of official discrimination toward
 people with disabilities but the Government has not passed legislation mandating
 accessibility for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Assocaton.-Trade unionism is not permitted, there are no labor
 unions, workers do not have the right to strike, and the Government is not a mem-
 ber of the International Labor Organization.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There is no collective bargain-
 ing or labor legislation pertaining to industry, which accounts for about 25 percent
 of the gross domestic product but only a minute fraction of the total work force. The
 Government affects wages in the manufacturing sector through it control over
 parastatal wages. There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Government uses a system of
 compulsory labor taxes to compensate for its low financial tax base. Under various
 rural development schemes, a typical family of 8.5 persons may be required to pro-
 vide up to 40 worker-days each year. There is no evidence to suggests that domes-
 tics or children are subject to coerced or bonded labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-There are no laws governing the
 employment of children. Children are not employed in the industrial sector but
 many assist their families in the traditional economy. In road-building, eligibility for
 employment determined by there applicant's height, not age. Although most workers
 are at least 15 a UNICEF study suggested that children as young as 11 are some-
 times employed with road-building teams.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-As noted above, there is no labor legislation,
 no legislated minimum wage, standard workweek, or health and safety standards.
 Labor markets are highly segmented by region, and monitoring wage developments
 is inhibited by the preponderance of subsistence agriculture and the practice of bar-
 ter. The largest salaried labor market is the government service, which has an ad-
 ministered wage structure last revised in 1988. Only about 18 industrial plants em-
 ploy more than 50 workers. Apart from a few of these larger plants, the entire in-
 dustrial sector consists of home-based handicrafts and some 60 privately owned
 small- or medium-scale factories producing consumer goods. Bhutan's rugged geog-
 raphy and land laws that prohibit a farmer from selling his last five acres result
 in a predominantly self-employed agricultural labor force.
