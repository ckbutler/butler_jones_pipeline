 WESTERN SAMOA
 Western Samoa is a small Pacific island country located 1,600
 miles northeast of New Zealand. It is a parliamentary
 democracy with certain concessions to Samoan cultural
 practices. The Constitution provides for a Samoan head of
 state, a unicameral legislature of matai (family heads) elected
 by universal suffrage, an independent judiciary, protection of
 Samoan land and traditional titles, and guarantees of
 fundamental rights and freedoms. Executive authority is vested
 in the Head of State, with the Government administered by the
 Cabinet, consisting of the Prime Minister and 12 ministers
 chosen by him. All legislation passed by the Legislative
 Assembly needs the approval of the Head of State. The present
 Head of State, Malietoa Tanumafili II, holds the position for
 life. 'His successors will be elected by the  Legislative
 Assembly for 5-year terms.
 The culture of Western Samoa is essentially Polynesian but
 uniquely Samoan. Traditional authority is vested in the matai
 who is appointed by a consensus of the aiga (extended family)
 or by decision of the fono (council of matai). Ownership of
 land is legally vested in the matai whose responsibility is to
 direct the economic, social, and political affairs of the
 aiga. There are 362 villages in Western Samoa with a total of
 over 25,000 matai (Samoa's population is approximately
 160,000). Each village is governed by a fono, which can fine
 or otherwise punish offenses against village rules. Western
 Samoa does not have a defense force. The small national police
 force is firmly under the control of the Government but has
 little impact beyond the capital city.
 The economy is primarily agricultural, with limited potential
 for development. It is susceptible to shifts in world prices
 for its export commodities, such as coconut oil. Western Samoa
 is heavily dependent on foreign aid and on remittances sent to
 family members by more than 100,000 Samoans living abroad in
 'Australia, New Zealand, and the United States.
 Western Samoan society is based on a collective value system in
 which obligations and responsibilities, to the aiga are often
 given precedence over individual rights. The rule of law is
 tenuous outside the capital, Apia, and most disagreements are
 settled by decision of the fono (which can include corporal
 punishment, banishment, and destruction of houses).
 Principal human rights problems arise out of discrimination and
 violence against women; societal pressures may interfere with
 the ability to conduct fair trials. A government-established
 public defender's office and an ombudsman's office help Samoans
 in their dealings with the courts'and the Government.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Such killings are not known to occur.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no reports of politically motivated
 disappearance.

 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, such as
 torture, are prohibited by law, and there have been no reports
 of such practices by police br other government authorities.
 However, villages are controlled by customary law, and the
 fonos mete out beatings, stonings, the burning of houses, and
 other traditional punishments on occasion.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The law contains safeguards against arbitrary arrest and
 preventive detention, and these are observed.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Western Samoan law assures the right to a fair public trial,
 which is honored by the official court system, modeled on the
 British system. However, many civil and criminal matters are
 not handled by the Western-style courts but by village fonos.
 The 362 village fonos each have their own procedures handed
 down by oral tradition, and they differ considerably both in
 their decisionmaking style and in the number of matai involved
 in the decisions. The Village Fono Law of 1990 gave legal
 recognition to the decisions of the fono but gave recourse of
 appeal to the Lands and Titles Courts. The Supreme Court has
 yet to review the law to determine whether appeals on
 constitutional grounds will.be permitted.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Samoan law provides for protection from invasion of the home or
 seizure of property without substantive and procedural
 safeguards, including search warrants. Practically, however,
 there is little or no privacy in the village. Village
 officials by law must have permission to enter homes, but there
 can be substantial social pressure to grant such permission.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and of the press are fundamental parts of the
 Constitutio   Two major newspapers are printed regularly in
 the country   In addition to the government radio station, a
 private rad ) station is also permitted to broadcast. There is
 no televisi a in Western Samoa, but broadcasts from American
 Samoa are readily available to viewers.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the right of peaceful assembly
 and the right to form associations. There are no significant
 restrictions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution, along
 with freedom of thought and conscience. There is no
 government-favored religion. Nearly 100 percent of the
 population is Christian. While the Constitution grants each
 person the right to change religion.or belief and to worship or
 teach religion alone or with others, in practice the matai

 WESTERN SAMOA
 often chooses the religious denomination of the aiga. There is
 strong societal pressure to support church leaders and projects
 financially with contributions often totaling more than 30
 percent of income.- Younger Samoans have begun to resist these
 enforced payments.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution provides for freedom of internal movement and
 resettlement in Western Samoa, but in practice some citizens
 are or have been banished either from village activities or
 completely from the village. This is one of the harshest forms
 of punishment in this collective society. Emigration is
 actively supported by the Government because it is a "safety
 valve" for the disenfranchised, frustrated, and potentially
 rebellious youths, and because it increases foreign income
 through remittances. Foreign travel is not arbitrarily
 restricted. The right of citizens to return is guaranteed.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Samoan citizens have the right to change their government
 through direct, multiparty elections.. Following a plebiscite
 held in 1990, suffrage, previously granted only to matais, was
 extended to all citizens above the age of 21. This new right
 was exercised for the first time in the April 5 national
 parliamentary elections, which returned the ruling Human Rights
 Protection Party to power. The right to run for 47 of the 49"
 seats in Parliament, however, remains the prerogative of the
 approximately 25,000 matai (virtually all of whom are men).
 The remaining two seats are filled by citizens not of Samoan
 heritage. While all Samoans may now vote, matai continue to
 control local government through the village fono. The matai
 system is conservative but does allow for change, as the 1990
 plebiscite demonstrated. While Samoans must show respect and
 obedience to their matai in family and communal affairs, the
 matai have well-defined responsibilities which, if not met, can
 result in their removal.
 Western Samoa has only rudimentary political parties. The
 first one, founded in 1982, was the Human Rights Protection
 Party (HRPP); its leader, Tofilau Eti, is currently Prime
 Minister. Two of the HRPP.'s 32 seats in Parliament are
 occupied by women. Although a second party, the Samoan
 National Development Party (SNDP), was formed in 1988,
 replacing the previous Christian. Democratic Party founded in
 1985, the political process in Western Samoa is very much a
 function of personality rather than party. As a result,
 several previous governments fell before the end of their
 prescribed 3-year terms when supporters defected to the
 opposition. On November 25, the Parliament passed an amendment
 to the Constitution extending the term of Members of Parliament
 to 5 years.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 .Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 While there are no official restrictions, no official or
 private human rights organizations exist. There are no reports
 of any international or nongovernmental requests for
 investigations of alleged violations of human rights.

 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Samoa is a homogeneous society with no significant ethnic
 minorities. Samoan politics and culture are the product of a
 heritage of chiefly privilege and power, and members of certain
 families have some advantages. There is clear discrimination
 based on social status and sex, with women traditionally
 occupying a subordinate role. The passage of universal
 suffrage and the establishment of a Women's Affairs Ministry
 provide substantial new political rights for women; however,
 their subordinate social position is expected to change only
 gradually.
 Abuse of women is prohibited by law, but it is believed to be a
 problem and is often unreported or ignored. No reliable data
 about its extent are available. Some view wife beating as a
 male prerogative. As noted above, traditional punishments
 sometimes involve beatings; this is generally directed more at
 men than women. There are many cases of rape that go
 unreported. The few convictions generally result in light
 punishment.
 The Constitution makes special provision to preserve the
 political rights of non-Samoans. Persons of mixed ancestry who
 are culturally Samoan are fully accepted and can attain
 positions of considerable wealth and influence. Several of
 them have held or hold cabinet positions and a number serve in
 the Parliament.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Western Samoan workers have complete and unrestricted rights to
 establish and join organizations of their own choosing. While
 trade unions have not emerged in the private sector, the
 Government does not restrict efforts to develop them. The
 Public Service Association, representing government workers, an
 increasingly important sector of the work force, functions as a
 union. The Supreme Court has upheld the right of government
 workers to strike, subject to certain restrictions imposed
 principally for reasons of public safety. The Public Service
 Association freely maintains relations with international
 bodies and participates in bilateral exchanges.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 While workers have the right to engage in collective
 bargaining, there is little practice of this right because of
 the absence of unions in the private sector. However, the
 Public Service Association engages in collective bargaining on
 behalf of government workers. Arbitration and mediation
 procedures are in place to resolve labor disputes, although
 these rarely arise. Labor law and practice in the one export
 processing zone are the same as in the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 While the Government does not demand compulsory labor and it is
 prohibited by law, in this collective society people are
 frequently called upon to work for their villages. Most people
 do so willingly, but, if not, the matai compel them to do so.

 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Under the terms of the Labor and Employment Act of 1972 and
 Regulations of 1973, it is illegal to employ children under 15
 years of age except in "safe and light work." The Director of
 Labor refers complaints about illegal child labor to the
 Attorney General for enforcement. The law does not apply to
 service rendered to the matai, some of whom require children to
 work at what might be considered child labor, primarily on
 village farms.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Labor and Employment Act of 1972 and Regulations of 1973
 established for the private sector a 40-hour workweek and a
 small minimum wage. This minimum wage suffices for a minimum
 standard of living when supplemented by the subsistence farming
 and fishing in which most families engage.
 The law also establishes certain rudimentary safety and health
 standards, which the Attorney General is responsible for
 enforcing. Independent observers report, however, that the
 safety laws-are not strictly enforced except when accidents
 highlight noncompliance. In addition, many agricultural
 workers, among others, are inadequately protected from
 pesticides and other dangerous conditions because of limited
 employer awareness of the hazards. Government education
 programs are addressing these concerns. The law does not apply
 to service rendered to the matai. Government employees are
 covered under different, more stringent regulations, which are
 adequately enforced.
