 GUYANA
 'The Co-Operative Republic of Guyana is a small, multiracial,
 developin- nation of about 750,000 people. The only English-
 speaking country on the South American continent, culturally
 and politically, Guyana is considered to be a part of the
 Caribbean. Guyana is also an independent republic within the
 Commonwealth, .its government is headed by an executive
 president, it has'a unicameral parliament; an independent
 judiciary, and a multiparty system.
 The Peoples National Congress (PNC) party, led by President
 Hugh Desmond Hoyte, governs Guyana. The President is both the
 Head of Government-and Head of State aswell as the leader of
 the party. Under'the 1980 Constitution, presidential,     -
 parliafientary, and regional/municipal elections are held every
 5  years.   ..  -                    -
 .Although a number of political parties compete, the PNC has
 dominated political life in Guyana.since the 1964 elections.
 The oppositiov.parties boydotted the December 1986 municipal
 electons; scheduled for the fir-st time since the early1970's;
 alleging that-they.would not be free and fair since the ruling
 party controlled.the electoral machinery.
 Although Guystise.society and political-life are inflUenced by
 ethnic -differences between the Afro-Guyanese and Indo-Guyanese,
 peaceful doeiistence prevaIs, The .ruling PNC.iz largely
 dominate'c by  urban.-Afro-Guyanese, as is the-Guyana-Police Force
 (i3PF), tbe-iGuyana.Defense Force (GDF), and other security-
 forced t While .IndoGuyanese'dominate agricultural and business.
 sectors.-'.-ifes.identHoyte has made a significant effort to  -
 bring more Indo'-Guyanese into party and mimisterial positions.
 The Constiution-mandates a "t-isectoral* economy, -i.e., private
 sector, publio sector -afid cooperatives.- Two of Guyana's major
 export inddstries,--sugar and bauxite, are controlled by.public
 corporations, which employ.-abourl7'percent of the work force.
 The third cprincipal export-industry; rice, is primarily in the
 hands of private persons. President Hoyte has bedn'taking - -
 steps to enhance the role of the local private sector, -as well
 as to encourage private foreign investment. In 1987 the
 countryts economy showed signs of improvement; although it is
 still plagued by external debt, sluggish growth, hand a'
 deteriorating infrastructure. People are free to pursue private
 interests;,and-rights.to private property are respected.
 In 1987 Guyana"s human rights record showed some improvement,
 although tbe police occasionally demonstrated lapses in
 discipline, resulting in allegations of abuse. These
 allegations of-police killings and beatings were investigated
 during 1g87 but with mixed results. The Government continued
 to recognize the right of opposition newspapers toreport
 freely. Freedom of religion is generally respected. In its
 1987 Report, the Guyana Human Rights Association (GHRA)
 expressed-concern that the liberalization with respect to human
 rights initituted by President Hoyte has not yet been given the
 administrative, legal, and institutional framework sufficient
 to guarantee its continuation. In 1986 the Government
 appointed a commission to investigate and report on the need
 for a code of ethics for public office holders. In August
 1987, the commission reported that there had been a breakdown
 in standards of behavior in the public service, recommended a
 code of conducti-and called for election reform. In December,
 Parliament approved unanimously a motion endorsing the
 Integrity Commission's report.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 No politically motivated killings are known to have occurred in
 recent years. Summary executions do not take place.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no reports of politically motivated
 disappearances, clandestine detentions, or abductions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by the Constitution. Opposition
 newspapers have reported incidents of police brutality and have
 charged that prisoners awaiting trial at Georgetown's Brickdam
 jail are often mistreated. Several low-ranking police officers
 have allegedly been involved in burglaries and robberies,
 occasionally resulting in the beating and shooting of their
 victims. The Government opposes police misconduct. When
 incidents of police harassment and misconduct occur, those
 persons found responsible have frequently been disciplined and
 dismissed from the force, arrested, and even prosecuted. The
 government-owned media reported on at least four court cases
 concerning alleged human rights abuses committed prior to 1987
 by members of the Guyana Police Force and the Guyana Defense
 Force. Several of these cases resulted in convictions. The
 three policemen involved in the May 1986 torture of an
 Amerindian were not prosecuted. The police force disciplined
 the sergeant involved with a loss of pay and the two constables
 were released from the force. In October the Director of
 Public Prosecutions ordered an inquest into the death of Walter
 Rodney, a leading Marxist WPA official and political writer,
 who died in a 1980 bomb explosion under mysterious
 circumstances.
 Prison conditions in Guyana are Spartan, and prisoners' diets
 are reportedly inadequate.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Constitutionally, no person may be deprived of personal liberty
 except as authorized by law. The Constitution provides the
 right to a judicial determination of the legality of detention.
 Individuals are not arrested, detained, or exiled for their
 political views. The National Security Act provides for the
 detention without charges for up to 3 months of persons
 suspected of crimes. However, to date, no one has been detained
 under provisions of the Act. In the past, Government officials
 sought to use the legal system to harass their opponents through
 frequent libel suits, but this practice is waning.
 Forced labor is not employed in Guyana.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Guyana employs the British common law system and legal
 procedures. Half the lawyers and almost all members of the
 Guyanese judiciary were trained in the United Kingdom. The
 Constitution provides that anyone charged with a criminal
 
 
 GUYANA
 offense has the right to a hearing by a court of law, and this
 right is respected in practice. Guyana has a functioning bail
 system and defendants are accorded fair public trials; they are
 represented by counsel, who are court appointed when necessary.
 Timely charges are presented, and appeals can be made to higher
 courts. There are no political prisoners or special courts for
 political security cases.
 Some opposition lawyers complain that the judiciary is prone to
 grant lengthy postponements in trials affecting. government or
 law enforcement officials; however, postponements are routinely
 granted to botl the defense and prosecution.- Delays in judicial
 proceedings are most often cauqed by shortages of trained court
 administrative personnel.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government generally respects its citizens' right to
 privacy. There were no allegations of government surveillance
 of political opponents.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Ereedom of Speech apd Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and press. The
 Government, through ownership of the.counktry's only daily,
 newspaper.and radio statian,and through impoit licensing of
 newsprint and printing presses, maintains some control over the
 media. Howeier, EheGpvernment improved its record in this
 regard anofreedom ofthe.press made advances in 1987. The
 StabroeoNewp,.an independently owned newspaper, began
 publishing weekly in December 1986. The Stabroek News and the
 Catholic Standard, the newspaper of the. Catholic Diocese, were
 allowedto import thdir own printing presses. In September
 1987 the  , ernmentdenied-the Catholic Standard permission to
 import a gift of newsprint froii a Trinidadian newspaper. The
 import license was later granted'and the paper was also allowed
 to purchase newsprint from the gpvernment-owned newspaper..
 Guyanese can receive printed materials from abroad without
 restrictions, 6ut scarce foreign exchadge generally is not made
 available by the Government for subscriptions to foreign
 publications. The Caribbean Contact, a monthly regional
 newsiaper published in Barbados, that* is consistently critical
 of the Guyanese Government, is freely available and sold
 locally 'for Guyanese currency. Newsweek and South magazines
 are the'only international news magazines sold for local
 currency.
 Guyana does not have an official public television station, but
 satellite television transmissions from the United States are
 rebroadcast by two local businessmen. They also carry regular
 broadcasts of Cable Network News. Foreign and regional radio
 stations pan be heard on medium and shortwave bands.
 The country's only radio station, the Guyana Broadcasting
 Corporation (GBC), is highly selective in reporting the views
 and activities of opposition parties. 'Some of the GBC's radio
 interview and commentary programs allow public criticism of the
 Government, but, in general, they faithfully reflect government
 policies. The government-owned daily newspaper, the Guyana
 Chronicle, has significantly improved its coverage of news and
 
 
 506
 GUYANA
 commentaries that differ from government views, but information
 on the Government's activities and operations remains carefully
 controlled.
 The Government's record on academic freedom is good. Several
 opposition activists in the Marxist Working Peoples Alliance
 (WPA) and GHRA teach at the University of Guyana. Opposition
 parties have organized student groups there. The Government
 remains sensitive to public criticism of Guyana, particularly
 by foreigners. In two instances in 1987, articles written by
 foreigners and critical of living conditions in Guyana, which
 appeared in foreign publications, resulted in the Government
 asking the author of one article to leave Guyana, and
 threatening the author of the other with expulsion.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The constitutional provisions regarding these freedoms are
 generally observed. The Government does not impose any
 restrictions on joining private associations. The Public Order
 Act requires police permits for mass political meetings. At
 his discretion, the Police Commissioner can refuse permission
 for a meeting without explanation. In the past, opposition
 political parties have complained of delays in receiving
 permission from the police. In 1987 opposition parties freely
 organized several rallies and marches.
 Workers in Guyana enjoy the right of association in voluntarily
 formed, free, and independent trade unions. Guyanese workers
 also enjoy the right to strike. In 1987, in the public sector,
 the state-owned sugar industry again experienced a number of
 wildcat strikes, most lasting no more than 2 days. In the
 private sector, a sawmill company was struck for 1 week. The
 Government has the authority to declare any strike "political"
 or "illegal" but has not done so since the late 1970's. The
 chief labour officer and his staff in the Ministry of Labour
 provide the machinery for consultation and dialogue between
 employers and workers to resolve labor disputes. Approximately
 80,000 of Guyana's work force of 240,000 are organized.
 Twenty-four of the country's 25 labor unions belong to the
 Guyana Trade Union Congress (TUC), the umbrella organization of
 the nation's labor union movement.
 The TUC is affiliated with the Caribbean Congress of Labour and
 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. The PNC
 and, to some extent, other political parties exercise
 considerable influence over the union movement. Seventeen of
 the TUC's 24 unions either are controlled by or affiliated with
 the PNC. The largest union, the Guyana Agricultural and
 General Workers Union( GAWU), is affiliated with the Communist
 PPP.
 Unions can bargain collectively directly with private sector
 employers. The 1984 law which stipulated that only the TUC
 could engage in collective bargaining with the Government was
 declared unconstitutional by the Court of Appeal, the country's
 highest court, on October 28. The Government subsequently
 proposed a constitutional amendment which, if passed in its
 present form, would have the effect of nullifying the justices'
 ruling.
 Guyana sent a tripartite delegation to the 73rd session of the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) conference in Geneva in
 June 1987 but it is not a voting member because of the country's
 financial arrears in that organization. Trade associations,
 
 
 507
 GUYANA
 private organizations, and other professional bodies also freely
 maintain relations With recognized international groups in their
 fields.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution provides for freedom of thought and religion,
 and thereis general religious tolerance. Christians, Hindus,
 Muslims and Baha'is are free to practice their religion without
 restrictions. There is no favored or official state religion.
 All religions in Guyana are allowed to select their places of
 worship and are free to maintain their links with coreligionists
 in other countries. There are no restrictions on religious
 travel.overseas. In the past, foreign missionaries were
 permitted to enter the country to proselytize. However, in
 1987, owing in part to the strained relations with some
 officials.of the Catholic Church, who have adopted a position
 of oppositiQn to the Guyanese Government, foreign Catholic
 priests seeking to renew their resident visas encountered-many
 bureaucratic delays and were often able to obtain only limited
 extensions.
 d. Freedomof Movejpnn Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within Guyana is provided for in the-
 Constitution. However, travel to certain Amerindian areas
 requires government permission, a~xregulation dating from
 colonial times designed.to protect the indigenous peoples from
 exploitation. The GHRA,,opposition politicians, and the
 Catholic Ckurch charge that permits are routinely denied to
 missionary and non-PNC politicians and that the regulations are
 being used to maintain PNC influence among the Amerindians.
 Guyanese are free to travel abroad, to emigrate, and to
 return  Guyana is neither a refugee receiving nor generating
 country. There are-no displaced persons, and citizenship is
 not denied on political grounds.
 Sectioh 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Guyanese are free to express their political views and to join
 or support a variety of political parties. Constitutionally,
 all citizens 18-years of age or older are eligible to
 participate in the political p;ocess and to vote. Presidential,
 national, and regional elections are held every 5 years. The
 leader of the winning party-is elected President and forms .a
 cabinet.
 Opposition parties vigorously criticize the Government and are
 free to field candidates for election. However, since 1964,
 the People's National Congress (PNC), a predominately
 Afro-Guyanese party, has dominated political life through
 questionable~eleptoral practices. Opposition parties regularly
 charge the ruling party with fraudulent practices. Following
 the 1985 elections, opposition parties, including the Communist
 PPP, joined in the Patriotic Coalition for Democracy (PCD).
 The PCD seeks reforms in Guyana's elections laws, demanding,
 for example, that ballots be counted at the polling places
 rather than at a central counting place. The PCD charges that
 without such changes, the PNC will continue to dominate the
 electoral process and deny-the country free and fair
 elections.- The Iitegrity Commission, which was appointed- by
 the Government in 1986 to investigate the need for a code of
 
 
 508
 GUYANA
 ethics for public officials, also called for electoral reform,
 including greater dialogue with opposition parties, in order to
 implement the structural reforms needed for free and fair
 elections.
 Race is still a factor in Guyanese political life, with parties
 basically organized along ethnic lines, a situation that
 predates independence. President Hoyte has appointed a number
 of Indo-Guyanese to ministerial and other government positions
 and attracted still others to the PNC.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government regards outside criticism of its human rights
 practices as interference in its internal affairs. However, in
 1987 the government-owned media continued to pay increased
 attention to human rights matters, reporting more frequently on
 charges of police abuses and subsequent investigations.
 The GHRA is a nongovernmental organization formed in 1979 with
 support from trade unions, professional organizations, and
 churches. The GHRA issues periodic press releases and
 publishes an annual report on human rights in Guyana. It
 gathers information from members, victims of abuse, trade
 unionists, churchmen, other interested parties, official
 documents, and newspapers. The GHRA has attempted to draw
 international and regional attention to the human rights
 situation in Guyana but has, on occasion, been hampered in its
 campaign by an inability to document and detail its findings.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of race
 or sex. Women are found at all levels and in all types of
 employment but only infrequently do they occupy positions of
 major responsibility and authority. Women in Guyana primarily
 fulfill the traditional roles of homemaker and mother but
 increasingly they are in the salaried economy.
 The Guyana Chronicle and the Women's Revolutionary Socialist
 Movement (WRSM), the women's arm of the PNC, report that sexual
 harassment is still a problem in the society. In its findings,
 the Integrity Commission also identified the practice of sexual
 harassment in the workplace and called for greater reporting of
 these incidents to the authorities. In its findings, the
 Integrity Commission also identified the practice of sexual
 harassment in the workplace and called for greater reporting of
 these incidents to the authorities. The Government does not
 condone these abuses and has vigorously declared its support
 for the equality of women. In line with this policy, and as
 part of the income tax reforms announced in the 1987 budget
 speech, the Government declared that women will be allowed to
 file their own income tax returns, regardless of their marital
 status. Formerly, married women were not allowed to file
 independently of their husbands.
 There is no pattern of discrimination in housing, employment,
 education, or other social services. Education and medical
 care in the Georgetown hospital are free, although, due to-a
 shortage of funds, the quality of the services is poor. Guyana
 has a small-ethnic Amerindian population, composed of nine
 tribal groups, living in scattered reservations throughout the
 
 
 509
 GUYANA
 interior of the country. -elative to most Guyanese, their
 standard of living is low. In 1987 the GHRA again alleged that
 Amerindians are subjected to government control of their
 leaders and land titles, as well as limitations on access to
 their rqservations by priests and other outsiders. The
 Government has made an effort to integrate Amerindians into the
 mainstream of Guyanepe society in many interior communities.
 In general, the Amerindians seem-to suffer more from neglect
 than from any policy of active discrimination.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR,:
 The Factorigs Act of 1947 provides the legislative basis for
 regulating conditionsof.,labor in Guyana. Under the law, no
 one unde�.age 14 can.beoemployed'in a. factory, and no one under
 17 can work-between the hours of 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. Government
 policy, bpwever, isstricter; no-one under 18 can be employed
 outside thp fAmily. The.Ministry of Labour has, in practice,
 extended the law's definition of "factory" to nearly all
 workplaces except offices and rental shops. Most workers work
 an 8-hour day and a 40-hour week.
 In-April 1987, the Government and the Guyana Trade Union
 Congress (TUC) signed a new wage agreement providing a daily
 .minimum wage of $2.37 for public sector employees, a 40 percent
 increase. Earlier,-.the TUC had.-published a cost-of-living  -
 survey whichi asserted that a family of six must earn at least
 $5.20 per day to live IJut above the poverty -line.  -,
 The Ministry of Labour's enforcement of workplace health and
 safety standards is- severely limited,by shortages of funds and
