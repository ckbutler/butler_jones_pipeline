 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 The Republic of Korea is governed by a directly elected president and a unicam-
 eral national assembly selected by both direct and proportional voting. The judiciary
 
 
 646
 operates independently of the executive branch. The Government continued to re-
 form the political system in 1995, holding fair local elections in June. As a result,
 control oflocal government administration in major cities such as Seoul and in sev-
 eral provinces passed into the hands of opposition parties.
 Under the law, responsibility for maintaining internal security lies with the Na-
 tional Security Planning Agency (NSP), the Korean National Police, and the Defense
 Security Command. There is an independent intelligence oversight committee. Leg-
 islation passed in 1993 restricts the NSP from interfering in domestic politics; it has
 investigative authority only in cases involving terrorism, espionage, and inter-
 national crime organizations. There continued to be credible reports of some NSP
 infringements of suspects' rights during the interrogation process.
 As a result of strong growth in 1994, Korea has one ofthe world's largest econo-
 mies as measured by gross national product. Continued strong growth in 1995 was
 expected to push annual per capita income past $10,000. In the near term, economic
 growth is expected to remain robust due to high exports, investment in plant and
 e uipment, and, increasingly, consumer spending. However, labor shortages, an in-
 efficient agricultural sector, and inadequate infrastructure continue to constrain the
 performance of an otherwise extremely successful, market-based economy.
 The Government generally respects the human rights of its citizens; however,
 problems remain in some areas. The use or threatened use of the National Security
 Law (NSL) continued to infringe upon citizens' civil liberties, including the right to
 free expression. There was no progress toward reform of the NSL, although in some
 instances court decisions limited the NSL's application in order to protect free
 speech. Labor practices in Korea remained below international standards. There
 continued to be credible reports that in some instances police deprived suspects of
 timely access to counsel and subjected detainees to threats, physical abuse, and
 sleep deprivation during interrogation. Women continued to face legal and societal
 discrimination; violence against women and physical abuse remained serious prob-
 lems. There is still no effective legal redress for these problems. However, judges
 continued to demonstrate their independence by blocking the prosecution of dis-
 sidents under the NSL, and the Ministry of Justice implemented new guidelines re-
 quiring that suspects be told at the time of arrest of their right to remain silent
 and their right to a lawyer.
 The Government continued its surveillance of some released politicalprisoners
 and required some of them to make regular reports to the police under the Social
 Surveillance Law. In August the Government issued amnesty and pardons to a
 number of political dissidents, including some prisoners who had been incarcerated
 since the Korean War. However, the Government did not authorize independent in-
 vestigations of the cases of prisoners who had received sentences on charges be-
 lieved to have been fabricated by previous governments. Some of these prisoners
 had reportedly been subjected to torture to extract confessions and received trials
 that did not meet international standards of fairness.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Iling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings. In an effort to punish past abuses, prosecutors inves-
 tigated former President Chun Doe Hwan and other former high-ranking military
 officials for their alleged role in the army's suppression of demonstrations in
 Kwangju in 1980, which resulted in the death of several hundred civilians. At year's
 end, prosecutors were in the process of determining whether criminal charges
 should be filed against Chun and other officials for ordering the use of excessive
 force.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Government has ordered authorities to protect the human rights of suspects
 and investigate allegations of abuse while in custody. Nonetheless, prosecutors con-
 tinued to place much emphasis on extracting confessions from suspects. In spite of
 government directives discouraging sleep deprivation as an interrogation technique,
 there continued to be credible reports of police use of sleep deprivation and verbal
 or physical abuse. There also continued to be reports that police denied suspects
 timely access to an attorney. For example, Professor Park Chang-Lee was reported
 to have been deprived of sleep, beaten, and threatened after his April arrest under
 the NSL. In March courts acquitted three persons on murder charges because of evi-
 dence that police had in 1994 tortured the defendants in order to extract confes-
 sions.
 
 
 The Government continued to investigate and consider cases in which former de-
 tainees argued that they deserved redress for torture suffered in the past. However,
 the Government failed to provide an effective mechanism for redress, such as an
 independent body to investigate complaints of past human rights violations. It re-
 mained relatively rare for officials accused of abuse or harassment of suspects to be
 p rosecuted. In February the Government ratified the United Nations International
 Convention on Torture, which will allow the U.N. Committee Against Torture to
 bring cases of human rights violations to the International Court of Justice.
 Prison conditions are Spartan. Prison diets are adequate, but the prisons offer lit-
 tle protection against cold in winter and heat in the summer. Consequently, some
 prisoners claim that the conditions have damaged their health. There have been a
 few claims that prison guards have used excessive force or have needlessly mana-
 cled prisoners. Prisoner access to reading materials has improved significantly in re-
 cent years, and they have been granted permission to receive television and radio
 broadcasts. There is little independent monitoring of prison conditions, although
 representatives of human rights groups may visit certain prisoners at the discretion
 of the prison warden.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Korean law is vague with respect to de-
 tention, and prosecutors have wide latitude to interpret the law. The NSL defines
 espionage in broad terms and permits the authorities to detain and arrest persons
 who commit acts viewed as supportive of North Korea and therefore dangerous to
 the Republic of Korea. Authorities arrested not only persons spying on behalf of
 North Korea but also those who praised North Korea, its former leader Kim I1 Sung,
 or the DPRK's "self.reliance" (luche") political philosophy. (See also the North
 Korea report.) The U.N. Human Rights Committee termed the NSL "a major obsta-
 cle to the full realization of the rights enshrined in the International Covenant on
 Civil and Political Rights." The Government arrested over 200 dissidents under the
 NSL during the year.
 Article 7 of the NSL permits the imprisonment for up to 7 years of anyone who
 "with the knowledge that he might endanger the existence or security of the State
 or the basic order of free democracy, praised, or encouraged, or propagandized for,
 or sided with the activities of an antistate organization." The legal standard for
 knowing that one might endanger the existence of the State is vague. Consequently,
 a number of citizens have been arrested for what appeared to be the peaceful ex-
 pression of opposing views. For example, in March Professor Kim Mu Yong, a 34-
 year-old history lecturer, was arrested under Article 7. He was accused of support-
 ing North Korea through conclusions he had reached and published about the Ko-
 rean guerrilla movement of the 1940's and 1950's.
 The Government's rationale for keeping the NSL is the claim that North Korea
 is actively trying to subvert the South Korean Government and society, and that
 special circumstances call for limiting some forms of expression to block the greater
 danger to freedom and democracy psed by totalitarianism. The effect is to some-
 times relieve the Government of the burden of proof in a court of law that any par-
 ticular speech or action does, in fact, threaten the nation's security. Citizens contin-
 ued to be arrested for unauthorized travel to North Korea (see Section 2.d.).
 The Criminal Code requires warrants to be issued by judges in cases of arrest,
 detention, seizure, or search, except if the person is apprehended while committing
 a criminal act, or if a judge is not available and the authorities believe that the sus-
 pect may destroy evidence or escape capture if not quickly arrsted. In such emer-
 gency cases, judges must issue arrest warrants within 48 hours after apprehension,
 or, ifra court is not located in the same county, in 72 hours. Police may detain sus-
 pects who voluntarily present themselves for questioning for up to 6 hours but must
 notifyv the suspects' families. The police generally respected these legal require-
 ments.
 Upon issuance of an arrest warrant, the security services normally must release
 suspects arer 30 days unless an indictment is issued. Hence, detainees are a rel-
 atively small percentage of the total prison ppulation.
 The Constitution specifically prvides for the right to representation by an attor-
 ney, but attorneys are not allowed to be present during a police interrogation. The
 Government began in 1993 to permit supcts to consult with "duty lawyers" during
 breaks in the interrogation. The Justice Ministry also in 1995 issued guidelines re-
 quirg police to inform suspects at the time of arrest about their rig t to be rep-
 resented by a lawyer. In at least one case, prosecutors refused to issue an arrest
 warrant because the police had not read the suspect his rights when subdued by
 police. Despite these regulations, there continued to be complaints that access to a
 ayer was restricted. There is a functioning bail system, but human rights lawyers
 say that bail is generally not granted in cases involving serious offenses, and, even
 
 
 648
 when the offense is relatively minor, bail often will not be granted unless the victim
 of the alleged crime agrees to the bail request.
 Exile is not used as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary. The President appoints the Chief Justice and most justices of the Constitu-
 tional Court. Although judges do not receive life appointments, in recent years the
 judiciary has shown increasing independence, and that trend continued in 1995.
 Judges cannot be fired or transferred for political reasons. Judicial officials gen-
 erally considered committed to the independence and integrity of the judiciary were
 appointed to important positions in 1995.
 The judicial system has local courts presided over by judges who render verdicts
 in all cases. There is no trial by jury. Defendants can appeal a verdict to a district
 appeals court and to the Supreme Court. Constitutional challenges can be taken to
 t e Constitutional Court. The Constitutional Court, which began operation in 1988,
 continued to expand its role of interpreting the Constitution. The Constitution pro-
 vides defendants a number of rights in criminal trials, including the right to a
 speedy trial, the right of appeal, presumption of innocence, protection against self-
 incrimination, and freedom from retroactive laws and double jeopardy. When a per-
 son is physically detained, the initial trial must be completed within 6 months of
 arrest. These rights are generally observed. Trials are open to the public, but the
 judge may restrict attendance if he believes spectators may seek to disrupt the pro-
 ceeamgs.
 In a notable instance of judicial independence, in April a Seoul appellate court ac-
 quitted Lee Chang Bok, a leader of the National Alliance for Democracy and Reuni-
 fication of Korea, after he had been sentenced to 10 months' imprisonment by a
 lower court. In reversing the conviction, the appeals court ruled that the simple co-
 incidence of a citizen's political views with North Korean policy cannot be used as
 grounds for prosecution. The NSL conviction of Park Chi Kwon, an editor of the
 monthly magazine "Man and Workplace," was alo reversed by the courts; Park had
 been convicted after publishing a book by a North Korean author. The appeals court
 ruled in May that the NSL should not be interpreted to make publishing the novel
 a criminal offense.
 Judges generally allow considerable scope for examination of witnesses by both
 the prosecution and defense. The same courts try cases involving national security
 and criminal cases. Although convictions are rarely overturned, appeals often result
 in reduced sentences. Death sentences are automatically appealed.
 The courts continued to investigate allegations of past abuse of political dis-
 sidents. Human rights groups believe that many of these dissidents were sentenced
 to long prison terms during the 1970's and 1980's on trumped up charges of spying
 for North Korea. Furthermore, they reportedly had been held incommunicado or up
 to 60 days after their arrest, subjected to extreme forms of torture, forced to make
 "confessions," and convicted after trials that did not conform to international stand-
 ards for a fair trial. The Government granted amnesty to a number of these pris-
 oners in 1995, including long-term prisoners Kim Son Myong and Ahn Hak Sop.
 Human rights      ups allege that other political prisoners have been denied early
 parole because they refused to renounce real or alleged Communist beliefs. Some po-
 ltical prisoners who have been released are subjeed d to police surveillance and are
 required to report their activities regularlyt the plice.
 It is difficurtto estimate the number ofpolitical prisoners, because it is not clear
 whether particular persons were arrested for merely exercising the right of free as-
 sociation or were detained for committin  or lanning acts of violence or espionage.
 Despite an extensive amnesty announced by Prsident Kim Young Sam in August,
 some human rights monitors estimate the number of political prisoners in Korea to
 be as high as 400. However, these monitors' definition of political prisoner generally
 includes all persons imprisoned for acts that were politically motivated, without dis-
 tinction as to whether the acts themselves included violence or other criminal be-
 havior. The number of political prisoners and detainees as defined by international
 standards appears to be under 200.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-In gen-
 eral the Government honors the integrity of the home and family. In the past, the
 security services conducted vaiying degrees of surveillance, including telephone
 monitoring, of political dissidents. The Antiwiretap Law and the law to reform the
 NSP were designed to curb government surveillance of civilians, and appear largely
 to have succeeded. The Antiwiretap Law lays out broad conditions under which the
 monitoring of telephone calls, mal, and other forms of communication are legal. It
 requires government officials to secure a judge's permission before placing wiretaps,
 or, in the event of an emergency, soon after placing them, and it provides for jail
 terms for those who violate this law. Some human rights groups argue that a con-
 
 
 649
 siderable amount of illegal wiretapping is still taking place, and assert that the lack
 of an independent body to investigate whether police have employed illegal wiretaps
 hinders the effectiveness of the Antiwiretap Law.
 Citizens are not allowed to listen to radio broadcasts from North Korea in their
 homes or read books published in North Korea if the Government determines that
 they are doing so for the purpose of helping North Korea. Student groups make
 plausible claims that government informants are posted around university cam-
 puses. Persons with backgrounds as political or labor activists may find it difficult
 to obtain some forms of employment or advance in such fields as government, broad-
 cast media, and education.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-While most political discourse is unrestricted,
 under the NSL the Government limits the expression of ideas that the Government
 considers Communist or pro-North Korean. Broad interpretations of the NSL allow
 for restrictions on the peaceful expression of dissenting views. Although most radio
 and television stations are state supported, the stations maintain a large degree of
 editorial independence in their news coverage.
 While the Government has abandoned direct control over the news media, it con-
 tinues to exercise considerable indirect influence. Journalists and editors practice
 some degree of self-censorship, avoiding or softening criticism of the Government in
 order to advance their careers. Moreover, while the Government's anticorruption
 campaign curtailed politicians' payments of money to reporters, it did not eliminate
 these payments. Nevertheless, press criticism of the Government is widespread, and
 the Government did not use heavy-handed or repressive measures to influence
 media reporting.
 The Government or other complainants sometimes use libel laws to win judg-
 ments against publications for articles that are unflattering. In 1994 Kim Hyon
 Chol, President Kim's son, sued the Hangyoreh Sinmun newspaper after being the
 subject of an unflattering article. At the end of 1995, the case had not yet been adju-
 dicated.
 Prosecutors continued to indict dissidents under the NSL for producing, selling,
 or distributing pro-North Korean or pro.Communist materials. Court precedents
 allow Koreans to possess these kinds of publications for purely academic use, profit,
 or curiosity, but not with the intent of subverting the State. Because prosecutors
 are allowed wide latitude in determining motives for possessing or publishing such
 material, people continued to be arrested for such NSL violations. For example,
 Moon Ki Seh and Lee Kyung Ryol were arrested in March for producing and distrib-
 uting a pamphlet at the funeral of a former political prisoner who had fought for
 North Korea during the Korean War. The pamphlet was alleged to have praised the
 political prisoner's past exploits. Both of the dissidents involved in this case received
 suspended sentences.
 The Government continued to allow, within its guidelines, an increase in media
 coverage of North Korea. South Korean television networks continued to broadcast
 edited versions of North Korean television programs. The media extensively re-
 ported on US. and South Korean talks with North Korean officials.
 The Government censorship board, which screens movies for sexual or violent con-
 tent before release, has followed more liberal guidelines in recent years.
 Beginning in 1994, authorities began investigating eight Kyongsang University
 professors whose textbook on Korean society was deemed by prosecutors to endorse
 North Korean ideology. This investigation triggered extensive criticism in the schol-
 arly community as constituting a serious infringement on academic f redom. Pros-
 ecutors attempted to arrest several of the professors under the NSL but were denied
 warrants for insufficient evidence. At year's end, it did not appear that further ac-
 tion would be taken against the professors, but they remained under formal nves-
 ti gation.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Law on Assembly and
 Demonstrations prohibits assemblies considered likely to undermine pubic order. It
 forbids outside interference in peaceful assemblies approved by the authorities. The
 law requires that the police be notified in advance of demonstrations of a  types,
 including tpoitical rallies. Polie must notify organizers if they consider the event
 impermissible under this law. Associations, except those whose aim is deemed by
 the Government to be the overthrow of the State, operate freely. The Government
 did not generally interfere with rallies in 1995.
 c. Freedom of RelAion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this provision in practice.             .              It
 d. Freedom ofMoement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigratonv and Re-
 patriation.-For most citizens, there is universal freedom of movement within the
 
 
 650
 country. However, police may restrict the movements of some former prisoners. For-
 eign travel is generally unrestricted, but travel to North Korea is allowed only with
 government approval. One of the conditions is that the trip must not have a political
 purpose-that is, to praise North Korea or criticize the South Korean Government.
 Travelers to North Korea who do not receive government permission are likely to
 be arrested upon their return to South Korea. For example, authorities arrested
 Park Yong Kil, the 75-year-old widow of Reverend Mun Ik Hwan, in July. Like her
 deceased husband, Par visited Pyongyang without government authorization, and
 reportedly met with high-level North Korean officials. In addition, Ahn Ho Sang and
 Kim Son Jok, leaders of the Korean folk religion Daejonggyo, were arrested when
 they returned from an unauthorized 5-day trip to North Korea in April.
 In the past, the Government forbade some Koreans convicted of politically related
 crimes from returning to Korea, and some citizens would face sanctions upon return.
 In 1994 the NSP lifted the entry ban on composer Yun I Sang, a dissident who has
 been living in Berlin for a number of years. However, the Government required that
 he refrain from any political activity while in Korea, and that he give an accounting
 of his political activities overseas before authorities would allow him into the coun-
 try. Yun refused these conditions and decided against returning to South Korea.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
 Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees, and there
 were no reports of forced expulsions of those having a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to elect their own government. The Constitution, as
 amended in 1987, provides for the direct election of the President and for a mixed
 system of direct and proportional election of legislators to the unicameral National
 Assembly. The President serves a singie 5-year term and may not he reelected. The
 National Assomblys term is 4 years. All citizens aged 20 or above have the right
 to vote, and elections are held by secret ballot.
 Kim Young Sam, who took office in February 1992, is Korea's first chief executive
 in nearly 30 years not to have a career military background. In June the Govern-
 ment he d local elections deemed to be free and fair. The elections also resulted in
 increased representation for opposition parties.
 Because of" cultural traditions and discrimination, women occupy few important
 positions in government. In the current and past overnmnents, the only woman in
 the Cabinet has  een the second minister for poitical affairs, whose portfolio is
 Women's Affairs. In addition, a woman was elected mayor of Kwangmyong City, and
 a female legislator chairs one of the special committees of the National Assembly.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several nongovernmental private organizations are active in promoting human
 rights, and they operate without government restriction. Chief among these groups
 are the Lawyers for a Democratic Society, Sarangbang, the Human Rights Commit-
 tee of the National Council of Churches in Korea, the Korean Bar Association, and
 "Mingahyup," an association of the families of political prisoners. These groups pub-
 lish reports on the human rights situation in Korea and make their views known
 both inside and outside the country. Government and ruling party officials generally
 have been willing to meet with international human rights groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution and equal opportunity statutes forbid discrimination on the
 basis of rare, sex, religion, disability, or social status, and the Government respects
 these prvisions. However, traditional attitudes sometimes limit opportunities for
 women and the disabled. thnic minorities face both legal and societal discrimina-
 tiWomen.-Violence against women remains a problem and some women's rights
 group maintain that it" has worsened in the past few years. The law does not pro-
 vide adequate protection to victims of abuse.
 Rape remained a serious problem, with 6,173 cases reported in 1994 (the last year
 for which statistics are available). Many incidents of rape o unreported because of
 the stigma associated with being a rape victim. The activities of a number of wom-
 en's groups have increased awareness of the importance of reporting and prosecut-
 ing rapes as well as offenses such as sexual harassment in the workplace. However,
 in July a Seol appellate court overturned a landmark 1994 sexual harassment deci-
 sion by ruling that evidence that a professor coerced or damaged the alleged victim
 was insufficient. A female researcher at Seul National University had been award-
 
 
 651
 ed approximately $40,000 in damages for being sexually harassed. According to
 womens ihts gups, most cases involving sexual harassment or rape go
 unprosecuted and perpetrators, if onvicted, often receive ery lenient sentences.
 Spousal abuse is a continuing problem and has reportedy increased in recent
 years. The amended Family Law, which went into effect in 1991, permits women
 to head a household, recognizes a wife's right to a portion of the couple's property,
 and allows a woman to maintain greater contact with her children aner a divorce.
 Although the revisions helped abused women, divorce remains a social taboo, and
 there is little government or private assistance for divorced women. These factors,
 plus the fact tat divorced women have limited employment opportunities and have
 difficulty remarrying, lead some women to stay in abusive situations. The Govern-
 ment has created some shelters for battered women and increased the number of
 child care facilities, which gives women in abusive environments more options, but
 women's rights groups say they fall far short of dealing effectively with the problem.
 As a result of conservative Confucian tradition, women are subordinate to men
 socially, economically, and legally. There has been some limited and gradual change
 in social mores and attitudes affecting women; for example, women have full access
 to education, and a few have become government officials and hold elected office.
 Despite the passage of equal employment oportunity legislation in 1988, few
 women work as company executives or leading oicials in government.
 Children.-Children's human rights and welfare have not been prominent social
 policy issues, although the Government has demonstrated a commitment to promote
 children's health and welfare. The Government continued to devote an increasing
 share of the overall budget to social expenditures, which includes those related to
 the welfare of children.
 Child abuse has not been studied extensively, and statistics on such abuse are
 limited. Reported cases of child abuse have generally numbered less than 50 per
 year in recent years. Although experts believe that a number of cases go unreported,
 instances of child abuse still appear to be relatively rare. According to official statis-
 tics, the number of runaway children each year has dropped from about 7,000 in
 the past to approximately 1,000. The Seoul metropolitan government runs a chil-
 dren s counseling center, which investigates reports of abuse, counsels families and
 cares for runaway children. In the absence of a specific law against child abuse,
 however, it is not possible to prosecute and punish child abusers unless they commit
 a crime punishable under a separate law.
 The traditional preference for male children continues, although it is less pro-
 nounced among younger generations. Although the law bans such practices, fetal
 sex testing andabrtion of female fetuses are still believed to occur frequently;, hard
 evidence to support this conclusion is unavailable.
 People With Disabilities.-Community and social organizations have begun to con-
 sider the rights and treatment of people with physical and mental disabilities. Al-
 though there were public displays of concern for the disabled, such as the Special
 Olympics and television documentaries, public facilities for their everyday care and
 use remained inadequate. The Government did not discriminate officially against
 the disabled who were capable of attending regular schools, but societal pressures
 and cultural biases influenced parents to send disabled children to special schools.
 After a dramatic suicide in the spring by a wheelchair-bound street vendor who
 claimed that the Government's crackdown on unlicensed vendors deprived him of
 the chance to make a living, the Government stepped up efforts to help the disabled.
 President Kim announced in late April that his Government would expand job train-
 ing programs, medical benefits, and welfare facilities for disabled citizens. Since
 1991 Korean firms with over 300 employees have been required by law either to
 hire disabled workers or pay a fee. After human rights groups publicized a recent
 survey indicating that 89 percent of such companies either paid the fee or evaded
 the law, the Labor Ministry announced it would increase the subsidies provided to
 companies that hire the disabled. In 1995 new public buildings were required to in-
 clude facilities for the disabled such as a ramp access to entrances, a wheelchair
 lift, and parking spaces for the disabled; these requirements were generally met.
 Nationial/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Republic of Korea is a racially homo-
 geneous country with no ethnic minorities of significant size. Citizenship in Korea
 is based on blood, not location of birth, and Koreans must show as proof their family
 genealogy. Ethnic Chinese born and resident in Korea cannot obtain citizenship or
 bome ublic servants, and sometimes have difficulty being hired by some major
 corporations. Due to legal as well as societal discrimination, many ethnic Chinese
 once resident in Korea have emigrated to other countries since the 1970's.
 Amerasian children are usually able to obtain Korean citizenship, and no legal dis-
 crimination against them exists. Informal discrimination, however, is prevalent and
 makes it difficult for Amerasians to succeed in academia, business, or government.
 
 
 652
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution gives workers, with the exception
 of public service employees and teachers, the right to free association. There are
 some blue-collar pubic sector unions in railroads, telecommunications, the postal
 service, and the national medical center. The Trade Union Law specifies that only
 one union is permitted at each place of work and that all unions are required to
 notify the authorities when formed or dissolved. About 10 percent of Korean workers
 are members of a union.
 In the past, the Government did not formally recognize labor federations which
 were not affiliated with the country's two legally recognized labor rupi -the
 Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU) andthe Independent Korean Federa-
 tion of Clerical and Financial Workers. In the past several years, however, the
 Labor Ministry officially recognized some independent white-collar federations rep-
 resenting hospital workers, journalists, and office workers at construction firms and
 government research institutes. The courts ruled in 1992 that affiliation to the
 FKTU is not required in order to be registered as a legal labor federation. In prac-
 tice, labor federations not formally recognized by the Labor Ministry existed and
 functioned without government interference, unless authorities considered their in-
 volvement in labor disputes disruptive.
 The Government, however, did arrest unionists it viewed as acting as third par-
 ties in instigating labor disputes. By year's end, 30 workers had been arrestedfor
 violating the labor laws according to Ministry of Labor statistics, and 21 of them
 remained in prison. This statistic does not include workers who were charged with
 violating other laws during a labor disturbance. In the spring, for example, authori-
 ties issued arrest warrants for about 20 unionists at the Korean telephone company,
 Korea Telecom, who police said had committed provocations such as disrupting
 board of directors meetings and assaulting company managers.
 The Government continued the ban on labor union activities by public and private
 schoolteachers, arguing that the teachers' union (Chonkyojo) is essentially a political
 organization with radical aims. The Government continued its program of reinstat-
 ing those among the 1,500 fired teachers who agreed to resign from Chonkyojo.
 No minimum number of members is required to form a union. Election and labor
 laws forbid unions from donating money to political parties or participating in elec-
 tion campaigns. However, trade unionists have circumvented the ban by temporarily
 resigning from their union posts and running for office on the ticket of a political
 party or as an independent.
 Strikes are prohibited in government agencies, state-run enterprises, and defense
 industries. By law, unions in enterprises determined to be of "public interest," in-
 cluding public transportation, utilities, public health, banking, broadcasting, and
 commumcations, can be ordered to submit to government-ordered arbitration in-
 stead of striking. The Labor Dispute Adjustment Act requires unions to notify the
 Labor Ministry of their intention to strike, and it mandates a 10-day "cooling-off pe-
 riod" before a strike may legally begin. (This period is 15 days in public interest
 sectors.) Labor laws prohibit retribution against workers who have conducted a legal
 strike and allow workers to file complaints of unfair labor practices against employ-
 ers.
 Kwon Yong Kil, Chairman of the dissident Korean Council of Trade Unions
 (KCTU), was arrested in November for labor law violations stemming from his in-
 volvement in disputes such as the 1994 railway workers' strike. The authorities
 charged that he had fomented illegal strikes in the public sector. Human rights
 groups argued that Kwon was arrested for attempting to exercise the legitimate
 functions of a leader of a trade union federation in consulting with unions involved
 in a dis pute. His case had not been adjudicated at year's end, and Kwon remained
 in custody.
 The F~KU is affiliated with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
 (ICFTU). Most of the FKTU's 20 constituent federations maintain affiliations with
 international trade secretariats, as does the KTUC Metalworkers Council. In re-
 sponse to freedom of association complaints lodged by Korean dissident and inde-
 pendent unions, the International Labor Organization (ILO) Committee on Freedom
 of Association issued a report in 1994 recommending that the Government bring Ko-
 rean labor law and policy up to international worker rights standards in accordance
 with the principle of free association.
 The Government under President Kim continued to cultivate a more neutral
 stance in labor disputes. Nevertheless, police were dispatched to the Hyundai auto-
 mobile factory in Ulsan in May when workers there who opposed the policies of
 their union president staged a wildcat work stoppage that paralyzed the plant. Also,
 authorities served arrest warrants and took into custody Korea Telecom unionists
 
 
 653
 for disrupting board of directors meetings and committing other provocations. There
 were no reports of employer-hired squads assaulting workers.
 Since July 1991, South Korea has been suspended from the US. Overseas Private
 Investment Corporation (OPIC) insurance programs because of the Government'g in-
 fringements on freedom of association and other worker rights.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution and the
 Trade Union Law provide for the right of workers to cllective bargaining and collec-
 tive action. This law also empowers workers to file complaints of unfair labor-prac-
 tices against employers who interfere with union organizing or practice discrimina-
 tion against unionists. Employers found guilty of unfair practices can be required
 to reinstate workers who were fired for union activities.
 Extensive collective bargaining is practiced, even with unions that are not legally
 recognized by the Government. The labor laws do not extend the right to organize
 and bargain collectively to government employees, including employees of state or
 public-run enterprises, defense industries, and pubic and private schoolteachers.-
 Korea has no independent system of labor courts. The central and local labor com-
 missions form a semiatonomous agency of the Labor Miistry that adjudicates dis-
 putes in accordance with the Labor Dispute Adjustment Law. Each labor commis-
 sion is composed of equal representation from labor (represented by the FKTU),
 management, and the pubic interest." Local labor commissions are empowered to
 decide on remedial measures in cases involving unfair labor practices and to medi-
 ate and, in some situations, arbitrate labor disputes. Arbitration can be made com-
 pulsory in sectors of the economy (e.g., utilities and transportation) that are deemed
 essential to public welfare.
 The Trade Union Law and Labor Dispute Adjustment Law forbid third-party
 intervention in union and labor disputes by federations not recognized by the Gov-
 ernment (such as the dissident federation, injunochong) but they allow recognized
 labor federations, principally the FKTU, its affiliates, ani some independent White-
 collar federations, to assist member unions. The ban on third-party intervention also
 exempts mediation efforts by lawyers, experts, and others who have the consent of
 both labor and management, a policy much criticized by non-FKTU labor leaders.
 Workers in Korea's two export processing zones (EPZ's)-designated by the Gov-
 ernment as public interest enterprises--whose rights to organize were formally re-
 stricted, have gradually been given all the rights enjoyed by workers in other sectors
 of the economy.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Co mpudsory Labor.-The Constitution provides that no
 person shall be punished, placed under preventive restrictions, or subjected to invol-
 untary labor, exept as provided by law and through lawful p rocedures. Forced or
 omp~uIsy labor is not ondoned by the Government and is notpracticed.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Standards Law pro-
 hibits the employment of persons under the age of 13 without a special employment
 certificate from the Labor Ministry. Because there is compulsory education until the
 age of 13, few special employment ertificates are issued for full-time employment.
 Some children are allowed to hold part-time jobs such as selling newspapers. In
 order to gain employment, children under age 18 must have written approval from
 their parents or guardians. Employers may require minors to work oily a limited
 number of overtime hours and are prohibited from employing them at night without
 special permission from the Labor Ministry. Child labor laws and regulations are
 clear and usually enforced when violations are found, but the Government employs
 too few inspectors to carry out regular inspections.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government implemented a minimum
 wage law in 1988. The minimum wage level, whh apisto all firms with 10 or
 more employeees, is reviewed annually. As of September, the minimum wage was
 raised to approximately *1.65 (1,275 won) per hour. Due to Korea's tight labor mar-
 ket, however, most firms pay wages well aboye the minimum in order to attract and
 retain workers. The FKTU and other unions continue to claim that the current min-
 imum wage does not meet the minimum requirements of urban workers. In fact, a
 worker earning the minimum wage would have some difficulty in providing a decent
 standard of living for himself and his family, despite the fringe benefits such as
 transportation expenses with which Korean companies normally supplement sala-
 ries. (The Government notes that the money an average Korean blue-collar worker
 takes home in overtime and bonuses significantly raises the total compensation
 package.) According to the Minisy of Health and Social Affairs, 5.2 percent of the
 population lived be Iow the poverty level in 1992.
 Foreign workers, most of whom come from China, the Philippines, Bangladesh,
 Nepal, and Pakistan, often face difficult working conditions. The Government has
 sought to ameliorate the problems of illegal workers by initiating a program where-
 by 50,000 foreign workers were allowed to enter Korea legally to work at established
 
 
 654
 wages and with legal safeguards. In March the Government also announced its in-
 tention to ratify ILO conventions concerning foreign workers. Illegal foreign work-
 ers, who probably number more than 60,000, still suffer significant hardships at the
 workplace. It is difficult for illegal workers to seek relief for loss of pay or unsatis-
 factory living and working conditions because they are always under the threat of
 being deported. The Government has, however, established counseling centers that
 will hear complaints from illegal foreign workers facing deportation about such is-
 sues as overdue wags and industrial accidents.
 Amendments to the Labor Standards Law passed in 1989 brought the maximum
 regular workweek down to 44 hours, with provision for overtime to be compensated
 at a higher wage, and the law also provides for a 24-hour rest period each week.
 However, labor groups claim that the Government does not adequately enforce these
 laws, especially with regard to small companies.
 The Govement sets health and safety standards, but South Korea suffers from
 unusually high accidentrates.Theaccidentratontinuestodecline gradually, due
 to public and union pressure for better working conditions. However, the number
 of deaths resulting from work-related accidents remains very high by international
 standards. The Lor Ministry has improved enforcement of safety standards, but
 still lacks enough inspectors to enforce the laws fully. The Industrial Safety and
 Health Law does not guarantee job security for workers who remove themselves
 from dangerous work environments.
