 VANUATU
 Vanuatu, a South Pacific island nation with a population of 170,000, became inde-
 pendent in 1980 after many years of joint British-French rule. It has a parliamen-
 tary system of government with a prime minister and a 48-member parliament. The
 President has largely ceremonial powers, except when he is acting on the advice of
 the ouncil ofMnitrs. Vanuatu's citizens are divided by a variety of languages,
 by its separation into mre than 80 islands that make up the nation, andvby the
 colonial experience. Over time Vanuatu has largely overcome these differences to
 forge a strong se  of nationhood. Potical legitimacy is based on majority rule,
 supported by both Melanesian and Western tradition.
 The civilian authorities control the small police and paramilitary mobile forces.
 Because the Vanuatu economy is dependent on international trade, it is vulner-
 able to shifts in world market prices. In the past, tourism earned more foreign ex-
 change than all exports combined. The downward trends in tourism and forein in-
 vestment started by cyclone Ura in early 1987 and exacerbated by civil strife in
 1988 and~ subsequent poitical unertainty, have been reversed. Growth in tourism
 and Vanuatu's offshore banking center again led other sectors of the economy in
 1992.
 Restrictions on freedom of speech and press were reduced in 1992; treatment of
 women remains the major human ights prmblem
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kipling.-Neither the Government nor any or-
 ganized group resorted to political or other extrajudicial killin .
 b. Disappear'ce.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.

 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Constitutional provisions against torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treat-
 ment are observed in practice and enforced by the courts. While the law provides
 that prisoners shall have recourse to an ombudsman, that position has not been
 filled since Vanuatu became independent. In October the Government announced its
 intention to recruit a Swedish ombudsman with the assistance of the Swedish Gov-
 ernment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-There were no reports of arbitrary ar-
 rests in Vanuatu. Arrest is by warrant. The constitutional prevision that suspects
 must be informed of charqls and given a speedy hearing before a judge is observed
 in practice. There is no exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria.-The courts uphold constitutional provisions for a
 fair public trial, presumption of innocence until guilt is proven, prohibition against
 double jeopardy, the right of habeas corpus, and appeal to the Supreme Court. The
 courts are free of military or executive interference. There were no reports of arbi-
 trary or unfair exercise of judicial authority in 1992. There are no political pris-
 oners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-There
 is no arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution provides for freedom
 of speech and press, there are significant restrictions in practice. The Government
 controls the country's national newspaper and manages the national radio stations.
 There is no independent newspaper or radio.
 In 1992 the Goverment established a second radio station and Vanuatu's first
 television station. The country's sole newspaper began publishing letters to the edi-
 tor and the Government announced the intention to introduce a radio talk show
 which would allow the public openly to comment on economic, political, religious,
 and social issues. Media coverage of controversial issues has become more com-
 prehensive and balanced.
 Despite these positive indications of greater press freedom, the political opposition
 claims with some justification that it sometimes encounters difficulty in getting
 press statements broadcast and published in the state-controlled meiia and that
 publication or broadcast of opposition statements is delayed until the Government
 as prepared its response.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Permits must be obtained to
 hold public demonstrations and rallies. There were no allegations in 1992 that the
 Government placed restrictions on the timing and venue of political rallies.
 There are no restrictions on the formation of political parties or other groups.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is protected by law and has been gen-
 erally respected in practice. Missionaries of various Christian denominations work
 without restriction. With the dissolution of the constitutional review committee es-
 tablished by the government of former Prime Minister Lini, moves to restrict the
 activities of other than established religious groups have abated.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-All Vanuatu citizens are free to travel internally and externally and to
 return from abroad without restrictions.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right freely to change the government through periodic
 multiparty elections. The Constitution provides for parliamentary elections every 4
 years. The Government of Prime Minister Maxime Carlot Korman is comprised of
 the Prime Minister's francophone Union of Moderate Parties (UMP) which has 19
 Members of Parliament (M.P.'s) and the anglophone National United Party (NUP)
 which has 10 M.P.'s. In opposition are the Vanua'aku Party (10 M.P.'s) and four
 other parties (7 M.P.'s). Campaigns and voting are considered by outside observers
 to be fair. Elections to provincial and local councils have also been freely contested
 and fair.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Although there are no restrictions on the formation of local nongovernmental
 human rights organizations, none has been founded to date. There were no requests
 for investigations bv outside human riahts organizations.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, ReLwon, Languge. or Social States
 Most of the population is comprised of Melanesians whose ancestors probably mi-
 grated from New Guinea. The small minorities of Chinese, Fijians, Vietnamese,
 Tongans, and Europeans, generally concentrated in the two towns and on a few
 plantations, experien  discrimination with regard to land ownership Although
 there have been alleans of corrupt practices by members of the     vernment,
 there is no evidence to suggest a pattern of ethnic discrimination in the provision
 of basic services. However there are reports of discrimination in hiring and the pro-
 vision of services against both persons and communities suspected or known to sup-
 Port~oposition political candidates.
  e women have equal rights under the law, they are only slowly emerging
 from a traditional culture characterized by male dominance, a general reluctance to
 educate women, and a widespread belief that women should devote themselves pri-
 marily to childrearing. There are no women serving as leaders in Vanuatu's munici-
 pal or village councils, churches, or chambers of commerce. In 1992 there was one
 female M.P.
 Nevertheless, women made modest progess in enhancing their professional status
 in 1992. A woman appointed to the Cabinet as Minister of Health became the first
 female member of the Cabinet, and two women became the first female police con-
 stables in the paramilitary Vanuatu Mobile Force. An increasing number of women
 are also finding work in unskilled, semiskilled, and service occupations. Members
 of the National- Council of Women (NCW) view village chiefs as a primary obstacle
 to the attainment of social, political, and economic rights by women. With the dis-
 bandment of the constitutional review committee in early 1992, concerns expressed
 by the NCW that the committee might strengthen the legal authority of village
 chiefs abated.
 While no accurate data are available, violence against women, particularly wife
 beating, is reportedly common. Several severe cases have been reported in which
 victims have died. Although there are no specific laws against spouse beating, the
 courts have dealt severely with such cases, using common law assault as a basis
 for imposing punishment. However, very few cases of wife beating are brought to
 the attention of the authorities, and even fewer are actually prosecuted. Usually the
 cases are dropped by the women involved before going to court. The police are reluc-
 tant to intervene in what are considered purely domestic matters.
 The majority of women in Vanuatu enter into marriage through "bride price pay-
 ment." On those islands where the custom of paying "brideprice" is observed, the
 woman is often regarded as the property of the husbnd an thus to be dealt with
 as he chooses. The NCW is working to educate women about their rights and to
 urge establishment of legal protection for women against abuse and neglect.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Vanuatu's workers have the right to organize
 unions, choose their own representatives, and strike but strikes have seldom oc-
 curred, due in part to high rates of unemployment. Unions may not affiliate with
 international labor federations without government permission. The fundamental
 legislation establishing the right to organize unions, setting out the scope of union
 activity, and providing for the arbitration and conciliation of labor disputes consists
 of the Trade Union Act of 1983 and the Trade Disputes Act of 1983.
 Complaints of antiunion discrimination are referred to the Commissioner of
 Labor. The high percentage of the population still engaged in subsistence agri-
 culture and fishing however, serves as a deterrent to extensive union activity.
 There are 5 trade unions (over 4,000 members in the private and public sector
 unions), grouped under an umbrella organization, the Vanuatu National Committee
 of Unions which is a member of the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions. TRe trade unions are independent of the Government.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions in Vanuatu exercise
 the right to organize and bargain collectively. Labor unions negotiate wages and
 conditions directly with management. If the two sides cannot agree, the matter is
 referred first to the Labor Department for conciliation. If conciliation fails, the dis-
 pute is referred to a three-member Arbitration Board appointed by the Minister of
 Home Affairs. The Board consists of one -representative from organized labor, one
 from management, and the Senior Magistrate of the Magistrates Court. While a
 dispute is before the board, labor may not strike and management may not dismiss
 union employees. Unions and management, however, generally reach agreement on
 wages without having to refer the matter to arbitration. There are two nonwage
 cases currently before the Arbitration Board; both concern charges of unfair dismis.
 sal.
 There are no export processing zones.
 
 
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law, and there have been no reports that either is practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.--Children under 12 years of age
 are not permitted to work outside of family-owned agriculture, where many children
 assist their parents. Employment of children from 12 to 18 years of age is restricted
 by occupational category and conditions of labor-such as shipping and nighttime
 employment. The laws are effectively enforced by the Labor Department. The high
 level of adult unemployment discourages the use of child labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Vanuatu has a legislated minimum wage,
 which is effectively enforced by the Labor Department. Minimum wage rates were
 last raised in November 1991 from approximately $80 monthly to $120 monthly for
 urban workers and from approximately $70 monthly to $105 monthly for rural
 workers. There are also minimum wages for agricultural workers tied to the market
 prices for copra and cocoa. Most workers are not in the wage economy and are thus
 outside the scope of the minimum wage laws. For those covered by them, they pro-
 vide an adequate standard of living within the local context.
 Various laws regulate the rights to sick leave, annual vacations, and other condi-
 tions of service, including a 44-hour maximum workweek. Vanuatu's Employment
 Act, enforced by the Labor Department, includes provisions for safety standards.
 However, the 1987 safety and health legislation is inadequate to p retest workers en-
 gaged in logging, agriculture, construction, and manufacturing. It lacks provisions
 for sanitation and protection against substandard electrical wiring, machinery, and
 exposure to agricultural and industrial chemicals. The International Labor Organi-
 zation is working with the Government to revise these standards.
