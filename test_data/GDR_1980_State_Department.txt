 GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
 The German Democratic Republic (GDR) is a tightly controlled
 Communist state with substantial restrictions on the exer-
 cise of civil and political rights. The Socialist Unity
 Party (SED) controls all aspects of society except the
 churches, which retain some autonomy.
 The GDR faces a situation unique in Eastern Europe. It
 shares with the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) the most
 sensitive strategic position in Europe. There are nearly
 400,000 Soviet troops on GDR territory. At the same time,
 there are profound historical, cultural, and family ties
 between the people of the GDR and the FRG that the 35-year
 old division of Germany has not eradicated. These ties are
 kept alive by millions of West German visitors, as well as
 unjammed television and radio broadcasts which daily expose
 the GDR's Western-oriented population to Western ideas and
 attractions.
 As the Berlin Wall testifies, the GDR tightly controls emi-
 gration and travel. Over the past decade there has been
 significantly increased access to the GDR for Western
 visitors, although the GDR's mandatory currency exchange
 requirements recently were sharply increased. Today, despite
 its signing of the 1975 CSCE Final Act in Helsinki, the GDR
 severely limits the ability of its citizens of preretirement
 age to travel to the West or to emigrate. Those attempting
 to cross the border illegally run the risk of imprisonment
 or death from border guards or automatic shooting devices,
 though border shooting incidents have greatly declined in
 recent years.
 The GDR has made substantial progress in meeting the social
 and economic needs of its citizens. It has a highly-indus-
 trialized economy, a high standard of living, and a strong,
 extensive welfare system.
 In regard to civil and political liberties, however, the
 general posture remains poor. There is complete censorship
 of the media and publications, GDR citizens are regularly
 arrested for criticizing the government or party, and in 1979
 the GDR substantially toughened penal code provisions in
 order to discourage East Germans from criticizing the state
 or providing "unhelpful" views or information to Westerners.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is specifically prohibited in the GDR by the Inter-
 national Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which took
 effect as law in 1976. No instances of torture have been
 reported in 1980.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Information on prison conditions comes mostly from former.
 inmates who have emigrated to the West. A large number of
 prisoners (over 1,000 per year) reportedly are brought out
 of the GDR by arrangement with the Federal Republic of
 Germany. From these and others there are frequent and
 credible reports of cruel and inhuman treatment in GDR
 prisons. The allegations are almost all against prisons run
 by the Interior Ministry where inmates are sent after con-
 viction. Treatment of pre-trial prisoners reportedly is
 better.
 
 
 786
 According to former inmates, beatings by guards and other
 inhuman punishments for minor infractions or on trumped-up
 charges occur frequently in the prisons. Sometimes the
 prisoner, after being severely beaten, is denied medical
 care and placed in an isolation cell for weeks without
 adequate heat, food, or sanitary conditions. Some prisoners
 have died from lack of medical treatment of their injuries.
 Suicides and suicide attempts occur regularly in the
 prisons. In some instances, prisoners have found fellow
 inmates dead under conditions pointing to foul play by
 prison guards. Prison officials list the deaths as suicides.
 Inmates convicted of common crimes and political crimes are
 mixed together and generally treated the same. Prison
 conditions reportedly are inadequate in several respects,
 including over-crowding in cells, poor food, and inadequate
 sanitary facilities. Although prisoners are supposed to
 have access to medical facilities, prisoners with severe
 medical problems have been refused permission to see a
 doctor. There are allegations of scarcity of medications
 and treatment by personnel with little or no medical train-
 ing. There have been no reports in recent years of the use
 of the death penalty. Prisoners, except those being
 punished for infraction of prison rules, are generally
 allowed to exercise their right to have two visitors per
 month.
 c. Disappearances
 No reports of prolonged or permanent disappearance have
 been received in 1980.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The GDR penal codes are written in vague and general langu-
 age so that it is not always clear what objectively
 constitutes an offense. Many political actions are defined
 as criminal. For example, Section 220 of the Penal Code
 states a person can be sentenced up to three years for
 "making available writings, objects, or symbols which are
 collected in order to prejudice the state or public order,
 to disturb the socialist community or to bring contempt
 upon the state or social order." Section 99 of the Code
 states that the transmission of information (even if it is
 not secret) to a foreign organization can be considered
 treason. Another political crime is attempting to flee the
 country or helping someone else to flee the country. A few
 people are known to have been arrested simply because they
 have applied for permission to emigrate and refused to give
 up their application. The authorities consider this
 "agitation against the state."
 There are no firm figures on how many political prisoners
 there are in the GDR, but estimates from private human
 rights groups in the FRG range from 4,000 to 5,000. Amnesty
 International reports the majority of East German cases in
 which it is interested are those of individuals who sought
 to leave the country. Approximately 1,500 political
 prisoners were estimated to have been released in an
 amnesty between October and December, 1979. Reportedly,
 some have been rearrested. In the last amnesty before that,
 in 1972, the GDR allowed 2,087 amnestied prisoners to
 emigrate to the West. Although many of the prisoners
 amnestied in 1979 reportedly want to move to the West, the
 GDR has allowed fewer than ten of them to do so. Many of
 those amnestied reportedly are living in the GDR under tight
 police controls.  For instance, they cannot be out late at
 
 
 787
 night and friends cannot overnight with them without first
 obtaining permission from the police. Most of the amnestied
 people have been able to find jobs and housing. The GDR
 government referred in the 1972 amnesty to "political prison-
 ers," thus acknowledging their existence. According to
 published reports, the GDR is continuing the practice of
 releasing detainees to the West in return for substantial
 payments.
 The right of habeas corpus does not exist in the GDR.
 According to paragraph 103 of the preliminary proceedings
 section of the criminal procedure code, a person can be
 held up to three months before charges are filed., The
 public prosecutor may extend the detention period indefinitely
 if the investigation cannot be finished within that time.
 The officials reportedly have extended this detention period
 in several political cases.
 No specific charge must be brought to detain a citizen under
 house arrest. According to the law on house arrest of 1961,
 the public prosecutor can, with the approval of a court,
 order the house arrest of a person, "even if a violation of
 a particular law has not occurred," if this person is
 considered to be a threat to public security and order. The
 officials used this law to hold a prominent dissident,
 Robert Havemann, under house arrest for three years between
 1976 and 1979.
 In most political cases, it reportedly takes longer than 24
 hours and often many weeks before interested parties are
 notified. According to paragraph 128 of the criminal pro-
 cedure code, the public prosecution may postpone notification
 of the relatives and employer of the prisoner if "the
 objective of the investigation would be endangered by the
 notification." The notification will then take place
 immediately after the elimination of the grounds of endanger-
 ment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Although GDR law provides for fair public trial for all
 defendants, the judge can authorize a closed trial. This is
 done in almost all political trials. Although defendants
 are guaranteed the right to a lawyer of their choice, there
 are many obstacles to obtaining effective counsel. For
 instance, defendants are often not allowed to pick a lawyer
 until a few days before the trial. Even if there is
 sufficient time to prepare a defense, the defense attorney
 cannot discuss the specifics of the case with his client
 until the investigation is completed and formal charges are
 brought, which may be a period of months. The defense
 attorney also must receive permission to meet his client in
 private and there is no guarantee that this will be granted.
 Trials tend to be short and perfunctory and, in cases with
 high political interest, inevitably the prosecution wins.
 GDR courts are not independent. According to the constitu-
 tions, the courts are under the control of the executive
 body the Council of State. As with most other institutions
 in this defacto one-party state, the courts are in reality
 controlled by the Socialist Unity Party, which determines the
 appointments to the courts. A judge may be recalled at any
 time by the Volkskasmer or Council of State. Military
 courts are responsible for trying civilians only in military
 espionage cases.
 
 
 788
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The police have the authority to enter a home almost at
 will. By law, they need an authorization to enter and
 search a house (unless there is a threat to public order
 or security), but the police can authorize entry themselves
 and the courts will retroactively give approval. The
 authorities reportedly do not investigate complaints of
 abuse. The police do not have to give a receipt for
 confiscated materials.
 It is legal for the authorities to tap telephones and to
 open mail; evidence collected in these ways can be used in
 court. The authorities reportedly practice these methods
 and the "bugging" of homes on a regular basis.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 The GDR has a highly-industrialized and centrally-planned
 communist economy. It is basically an importer of raw
 materials and an exporter of manufactured goods. All large
 industrial, retail, and agricultural operations are state-
 owned, but small businesses with fewer than ten employees
 are allowed. According to official GDR statistics, three
 percent of the net national product is produced by private
 enterprise.
 The GDR, like most other Eastern European communist countries,
 compiles macroeconomic statistics in a different manner than
 most of the rest of the world. For that reason it is diffi-
 cult to devise precise statistical comparisons between the
 GDR's standard of living and that of other countries. The
 GDR has a relatively high standard of living, undoubtedly
 the highest in the communist bloc. A 1978 study by a major
 international bank which attempted to calculate the 1976
 .real per capita GNP" for industrialized countries set the
 figure at $4,221 for the GDR. Official GDR statistics state
 that as a whole the country's economy has grown at an
 average annual rate of about four percent over the last
 few years.
 Almost all GDR citizens can be considered middle class.
 Since the GDR is committed to the ideals of communism, it
 seeks to maintain a relatively small variation in wages.
 There is little real poverty in the GDR. Over the last
 five years the average income of a GDR worker has climbed
 at an annual rate of about three percent. In 1979 the
 average monthly income of a fully employed worker was 1,000
 East Marks, about $560 at the official exchange rate. In
 1978, the last year for which such statistics are available,
 the average household income for a GDR family of four was
 1,670 East Marks per month, about $930 at the official
 exchange rate.
 Prices of basic goods and services have remained stable
 throughout the last decade because of heavy government
 subsidies. In 1980 the GDR plans to expend 16.4 billion
 East Marks, about $9.2 billion at the official rate, for
 such subsidies. Although official GDR statistics show that
 the retail price index for 1979 stood at 98.0, using 1970
 as the base year, most outside observers feel that prices
 have been rising at a low rate over the last few years.
 Shortages of consumer goods are periodic but not pervasive.
 Basic goods and services are usually in good supply, but
 other consumer goods such as bed linen, candles, and furni-
 
 
 789
 ture often disappear from the stores for long periods.
 The demand for certain big ticket items regularly outpaces
 the supply; for example, the average waiting time for a new
 compact automobile is currently about eight years. Western
 goods can be bought at high prices in some GDR stores or at
 more reasonable prices in the "Intershop" stores which accept
 only Western currency, obtained most frequently from West
 German relatives.
 The most serious shortage in the GDR is housing, especially
 in the cities. The government is now committed to a major
 housing construction program lasting until 1990, and some
 810,000 apartments have been built or modernized since 1976.
 Today over 90 percent of the units built each year are
 constructed by the state, and the great majority are apart-
 ments. The vast majority of housing in the GDR is owned by
 the state and rents are low by Western standards. However,
 GDR citizens can acquire legal ownership of a house through
 family inheritance or if they obtain the approval of local
 authorities to buy or build a house. The waiting time for
 those who are requesting a plot of land on which to build
 a house can run into years.
 Special privileges for housing, foreign travel, education,
 and consumer goods exist for people in certain job categories.
 These special benefits, which can be much more important
 than wages in determining status and living standards, tend
 to create a privilegd class. Conversely, those who are not
 in political favor suffer discrimination when seeking employ-
 ment and educational opportunities. Although the government
 claims that all citizens are treated equally, many people in
 the religious communities complain of discrimination in
 employment and education.
 There is an extensive welfare system which includes a
 comprehensive child care system for working parents. In
 1979 there were about 266,000 places in pre-school care
 centers for children under the age of three (in that year
 the GDR population included 619,000 children under three).
 Free medical care is comparable to that of Western Europe.
 In 1979, per 1,000 citizens the GDR had 1.98 doctors, .55
 dentists, and 10.5 hospital beds. There were approximately
 13 deaths in the first year of life for every 1,000 births.
 Free and universal education is supplied through the 12th
 grade. Literacy is just about universal. However, there
 is not enough room in the institutions of higher learning
 for all those who wish to continue their education.
 Competition is keen for these spaces, and allocation is
 usually made on the basis of the political acceptability
 of the applicant. In 1979, the last year for which
 statistics are available, there were about 76 college or
 university students per 10,000 people. Fifty percent of
 college students are women. Social services are provided
 to rural residents as well as to urban dwellers. In 1979
 the GDR devoted approximately seven percent of its budget
 expenditures to education, seven percent to medical and
 social services, and twenty percent to social insurance
 and pensions.
 In economic matters women am more or lehs equal to men in
 theory and in practice. Their salaries are generally
 equivalent. About 78 percent of women of working age are
 actually employed, compared to about 88 percent of the men.
 Women can be found in significant proportions in all pro-
 fessions except the militia. For example, 44 percent of
 the industrial work force is female, as are 42 percent of
 those employed in agricultural and forestry. There are
 
 
 790
 very few women, however, in the highest positions of the
 party, government, economy and the professions, though
 there are four women on the Council of State and three
 candidate members of the ruling Politburo are women. It
 is still unusual to find women in senior executive or
 official positions outside the fields of education, health
 and medicine. Party membership in a communist state offers
 a good indicator: women constitute about 26 percent of the
 Socialist Unity Party's membership and about 26 percent of
 the Party's mid-level officers are women.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Although all these freedoms are guaranteed in theory by the
 GDR constitution, the only freedom allowed to a certain
 degree in practice is freedom of religion. Individuals are
 frequently arrested for expressing views which are consider-
 ed "anti-socialist" or contrary to the interests of the
 state. Views which are critical of the government or the
 party are generally not allowed to be expressed publicly,
 although some latitude is allowed for discussion of specific
 economic problems. Many of the literary figures who have
 published works in West Germany critical of the regime have
 been pressured to move to the West; some have been told
 either to leave or face imprisonment. Recently the GDR has
 told a small number of such "temporary exiles" that they
 may be able to return to the GDR. None have done so yet.
 In August 1979, new, harsher penal code provisions took
 effect. The tougher penalities were designed to discourage
 dissidence and criticism of the state -- especially that
 which was covered by the West German news media. The minimum
 penalty for criticizing the GDR's political system or
 authorities -- even if the East German was abroad -- rose
 from two to three years. It became possible for an East
 German to receive twelve years in jail if convicted of giving
 Westerners derogatory but unclassified information. It
 also became punishable for an East German to disseminate
 or cause to be disseminated abroad news likely to harm the
 state's interests. Though the new penal code provisions
 have no led to many new arrests, they severely reduced the
 willingness of East Germans to talk frankly to Westerners.
 All forms of the media are government-controlled and censored.
 Western publications are not allowed in the GDR unless they
 are politically acceptable, such as the newspapers of
 Western communist parties. Travelers to the GDR will have
 their Western publications confiscated by border officials.
 A GDR citizen found in possession of such publications will
 be arrested. Almost all areas of intellectual   inquiry,
 such as academic work, are heavily controlled by the Party
 and the State.
 Western journalists must apply for permission from the govern-
 ment before they can interview a GDR citizen. This is used
 to prevent Western journalists from interviewing prominent
 critics of the regime. The GDR implemented these restrictions
 in 1979 because of television broadcasts from West Germany
 showing GDR citizens criticizing their government. At
 first, the main effect of these new restrictions was to de-
 crease severely the number of East Germans willing to talk
 to a Western journalist, rather than to prohibit directly
 a Western journalist from travelling or covering certain
 events. In October 1980, however, the GDR toughened imple-
 mentation by refusing to permit West German journalists
 to attend and report on a Lutheran synod meeting in Dresden.
 
 
 79i
 The GDR also informed Western theater critics that they must
 also receive permission to attend and report on GDR cultural
 performances. In spite of the restrictions, the government's
 cohtrol of information is greatly hindered because most GDR
 citizens watch FRG television and listen to FRG radio broad-
 cats. The GDR does not try to prevent its citizens from
 receiving these broadcasts.
 Although the ruling party is atheistic, the freedom to practice
 religion is permitted within certain limits. The churches face
 major problems, however, especially the difficulty of attract-
 ing youth in the face of continuing discrimination against
 church members for job and educational opportunities. The
 Evangelical-Lutheran Church, which is the largest in the GDR
 with a nominal allegiance of 50 percent of the population, has
 gained many concessions from the government in recent years.
 For example, applications for television broadcasts by the
 Church are routinely approved, ministers are now allowed to
 work in the prisons, and several churches in new housing
 areas are being built. It has criticized specific govern-
 ment policies, and the State has until recently tolerated
 these criticisms. The GDR churches receive considerable
 financial aid from churches in the FRG. The state provides
 rather substantial funding for activities such as church
 hospitals, homes for the aged and child care centers, as
 well as the upkeep of cemeteries.
 The other Protestant churches and the Roman Catholic Church,
 with a nominal allegiance of about eight percent of the people,
 are generally allowed to practice their work. The very small
 Jewish community receives government financial support for
 its activities, including the building and maintenance of
 synagogues and the maintenance of an old-age home. There are
 no Jewish schools and no resident rabbi. One sect, the
 Jehovah's Witnesses, is specifically prohibited.
 There is no freedom of assembly. Individuals are not allowed
 to organize into groups which are not officially controlled,
 with the exception of the churches. There is only one trade
 union organization, and it is controlled by the party.
 Strikes are not permitted.
 The only ethnic minority in the GDR is the Sorbs, a Slavic
 people who make up 0.2 percent of the population. The GDR
 supports the maintenance of the cultural identity of the
 Sorbs by teaching the language in local schools and through
 a special publishing house for Sorbish literature.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Travel within the country is generally not controlled unless
 a person is under house arrest, and travel is comparatively
 easy to the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. On
 October 28, however, the GDR severely restricted tourism
 to and from Poland, ending nine years of visa-free travel by
 requiring travelers to have officially certified invitations
 from friends or relatives in the other country. Travel to
 the West, however, is almost impossible for most GDR citizens
 under retirement age (60 for women, 65 for men). The sector
 line between East Berlin and West Berlin and the border between
 the GDR and the FRG are among the most impregnable frontiers
 in the world. To cross the border without permission is a
 crime punishable by up to five years in prisons. Persons
 attempting to escape to the West also risk wounding or death
 by border guards or automatic shooting devices, though known
 incidents of wounding or death have declined substantially
 
 
 792
 
 in recent years , although shootings were reported in
 1980.
 Until recently the GDR had eased the situation by permitting
 each year over nine million visits by Westerners, the vast
 majority being West Germans and West Berliners. On October 9,
 however, the GDR substantially reduced the flow of visitors
 by drastically increasing the amount of currency each
 Westerner has to exchange, abolishing the different rates
 for East Berlin and the GDR, and dropping the exemptions
 for pensioners, invalids and children.
 The government closed off the last open access to the West
 when it built the Berlin Wall in 1961. While GDR propaganda
 justifies the heavily-fortified frontier as protection against
 "imperialism," the real reason is that over two million GDR
 citizens fled to the West from 1945 through 1961. This
 created a severe labor shortage problem, especially in
 skilled work and professions, which still exists. Despite
 these obstacles, hundreds of GDR citizens manage to escape
 across the border each year. Many more (over 4,000) flee
 to the West via other East European countries.
 There is no indication how many GDR citizens would emigrate
 to the West if they could, but after the Helsinki Final Act
 of CSCE was signed in 1975, tens of thousands of GDR citizens
 reportedly applied to emigrate legally to the West. The vast
 majority of those applications for exit permits, as well as
 subsequent ones, have been refused by the GDR. Many who apply
 to emigrate lose their jobs and are harassed and sometimes
 imprisoned. Most of those who do succeed in leaving legally
 are allowed to do so because they have relatives in the West,
 usually in the FRG.
 The GDR contains no large refugee groups from other countries.
 They have welcomed some leftists who have fled their own
 country. For example, an undetermined number of Chilean communists
 took up residence in the GDR after the overthrow of the Allende
 government.
 Most people who leave the GDR, legally or illegally, do not
 try to return. Most who depart legally are forced to give up
 their GDR citizenship. All people who left the GDR illegally
 before 1972 have been stripped of their GDR citizenship. Of
 the rest, only a small number have applied to repatriate
 themselves to the GDR. The GDR has reportedly denied permission
 in most of these cases.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Nominally the GDR is a multi-party state. In fact, the
 political system is totally dominated by the Socialist Unity
 Party (SED). There are four other parties, but they defer to
 the SED on important policy matters. Only once since the GDR
 was founded has one of the parties voted in the parliament
 against a bill. (This was the Christian Democratic Union,
 which voted against a bill legalizing abortion.) The delega-
 tions in the parliament are apportioned among the parties, and
 the SED holds a plurality. No opposition parties are permitted.
 All parties have their own newspaper, but all follow SED policy
 lines. All citizens are expected to vote, although there is
 *only a single list of candidates on the ballot. In fact, a
 citizen can be imprisoned for refusing to vote.
 
 
 793
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The GDR claims that inquiries into its human rights policies
 are interference in the internal affairs of the GDR. Requests
 by Amnesty International and other private human rights groups
 in the West for information about human rights conditions in
 the GDR have not been answered by the government. The govern-
 ment does not permit visits to the GDR by these groups. There
 is an official GDR committee for human rights, but it claims
 that there are no human rights violations in the GDR. No
 internationally-affiliated or recognized human rights groups
 exist in the GDR.
 
 
 794
 FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY
 The protection of basic human rights in the Federal
 Republic of Germany remained at a high level in 1980. The
 West Germans are very conscious of the central importance
 of human rights and civil liberties because of the remaining
 memories of the atrocities of the Nazi period. There also
 are millions of living examples of the consequences of
 that period found in the divided families of East and West
 Germany and the ethnic German minorities of Eastern Europe.
 Consequently, there is fundamental agreement among the
 populace, and clear policy determination in the government,
 to protect and preserve human rights.
 Terrorism, which had virtually ebbed away in 1979,
 re-emerged in one particularly gruesome bombing at Munich's
 Oktoberfest. This appeared to be the work of a single,
 right-wing fanatic. Police also obtained evidence
 in the spring of 1980 that the leftist anarchists of the
 recent past were in the process of planning another terrorist
 "spectacular." Despite the increased activism of a few
 individuals, there is no sign that radicalism-- either right
 or left--is growing in any broad way among the public. In
 the recent general election, the Communist and neo-Nazi parties
 both lost votes in comparison to 1976. The DKP, German Communist
 Party, dropped from 118,000 to 72,000 (0.2 percent of the total
 votes cast) and the NPD, National Democratic Party of Germany,
 fell from 123,000 to 68,000 (also 0.2 percent of the total votes
 cast). But it seems clear that West German society will
 continue to experience new pressures, such as the growing number
 of non-Germans permanently present, which will lead some individuals
 to react irrationally or even violently. The government is
 taking action to address these pressures through reform
 and tighter control of the asylum/refugee process, while
 at the same time preserving its commitment to the human
 rights process.
 Perhaps the most dramatic change in the human rights area
 in 1980 was the surge in applicants for political asylum.
 Based on conservative estimates, the number will easily
 reach 100,000 in 1980--double that of 1979. With strong
 evidence that most of these applicants are not primarily
 fleeing political or religious suppression but hoping
 to improve their economic existence, the government moved
 to amend its very generous asylum regulations. While
 this was done partly in self-interest to preserve the economy
 from a horde of job-seekers, it also kept the asylum channels
 open for legitimate victims of political persecution. The
 Federal Republic's attitude toward human rights is further
 indicated by its continuing assistance to developing countries,
 its human rights role at the United Nations, and its
 contributions to the resettlement of the 2,800 Indochinese
 refugees who arrived in the country during the first half
 of 1980.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from%
 a.   Torture
 Torture is constitutionally prohibited in the Federal
 Republic. Article 104 of the Basic Law states, in part:
 "Detained persons may not be subjected to mental nor to
 physical ill-treatment." Insofar as is known, there have been
 
 
 795
 ne allegations of the use of torture in the Federal Republic
 during 1980.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There are no summary executions in the Federal Republic. Capital
 punishment was abolished by Article 102 of the Basic Law.
 Physical punishments are not given or administered as
 sentences for criminal convictions. Conditions in West German
 places of detention are believed to be generally acceptable.
 Amnesty International has criticized the government for
 holding some convicted terrorists in long-term isolation,
 claiming that more than 100 prisoners have been subjected to
 such treatment at some time. Nevertheless, there is no
 systematic attempt to degrade any class or group of
 convicted criminals by detention under particularly
 harsh circumstances.
 c.   Disappearances
 No reports have been received that persons are abducted,
 secretly  arrested or secretly held by West German authorities.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Prisoners and detainees are held in-accordance with
 generally accepted principles. Freedom from arbitrary
 arrest is proclaimed in Article 104 of the Basic Law and
 exists in practice. The same article creates the equivalent
 of the right of habeas corpus by requiring any person
 provisionally detained by the police to be brought before a
 judge within twenty-four hours. Preventive detention
 is not practiced in the FRG. In the only exception to this,
 a detainee may be held~-1onger than twenty-four hours while
 awaiting formal charge if there is evidence that the detainee
 may seek to flee the country to avoid prosecution. Bail
 bond, however, does not exist in theFederal Republic, and
 individuals accused of a crime can be incarcerated for
 some time before the prosecution assembles sufficient
 evidence for a trial.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A defendant stands before the West German court system
 armed with fundamental protections provided in the Basic
 Law. Article 103 in effect prohibits ex post facto laws
 and double jeopardy and guarantees due process. A defendant
 must be charged by a judge within twenty-four hours after
 arrest. Article 104 of the Basic Law, speaking of the
 defendant, states, "The judge shall inform him of the
 reasons for the detention, examine him, and give him an
 opportunity to raise objections." Article 97 provides for
 the independence of the judiciary--a provision which is
 clearly maintained in the Federal Republic. There are no
 political or security courts, and civilians are not tried
 by military courts.
 f.   Invasion of the Rome
 The sanctity of the home is guaranteed in the constitution
 (Article 13) and respected in practice. A warrant signed
 by a judge is required in most cases before the police may
 make a forcible entry. The law permits public prosecutors
 to issue warrants in an emergency if a judge cannot be
 found. Some Germans have suggested that this "loophole"
 may have been abused in certain narcotics and terrorist cases
 in the past. "Bugging" of homes requires a court warrant,
 as well. Demolition of homes and forcible sealing of doors
 and windows do not occur.
 2.   Government   Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 
 
 796
 The West German economy is rooted in an economic philosophy
 that emphasizes (with some exceptions) free market forces
 and private enterprise. The population of about 61 million
 is expected to decline slowly in the future. The country
 is highly urbanized and industrially advanced, with a working
 force of nearly 25 million and an average unemployment rate
 in 1979 of 3.8 percent. The GNP (current prices) in 1979
 was DM 1,395 billion, (approximately $700 billion), with
 a GDP per capita of DM 22,743, approximately $11,500.
 Average weekly income for industrial workers at the end of
 October 1979 stood at DM 534 ($270) compared to DM 282
 ($140) in 1970.
 German society is basically open and free of major
 social disturbances. There are some long-standing problems
 of integration of foreign workers into the mainstream of
 German life but the government is working, with some success,
 on various solutions. Under consideration, for example,
 is the election of foreign guest workers, even though not
 citizens, to advisory bodies to local governments. Increasing
 the urgency of such efforts is West Germany's growing
 attractiveness as an economic haven to Third World peoples.
 The number of arrivals from poor, under-developed countries--
 claiming political asylum, but clearly looking primarily
 for economic freedom--has already reached 87,000 (end of
 August) for 1980, as compared to 51,000 in 1979.
 There is a large and well-developed program of social
 assistance to all, including disadvantaged segments of
 German sociebty. Social welfare programs, including health
 insurance, unemployment benefits, and disability compensa-
 tion, are comprehensive. The tax structure is generally
 progressive.
 Private ownership of property is widespread. About 40
 percent of the population lives in single family dwellings,
 mostly owner-occupied; 20 percent live in duplex units; and
 40 percent live in apartments, some of which are condominiums.
 In 1979, there were 352 motor vehicles per thousand inhabitants.
 Health care is excellent and Germans are well covered by
 extensive compulsory public as well as private health insurance
 schemes. The value in 1979 of social services, such as
 pensions and social security, totaled DM 450 billion ($225 billin)
 or approximately 30 percent of total national product.
 The status of women is legally equal to men in every
 respect. Women have achieved positions of high status in all
 fields, but their overall participation in political and
 economic life is not growing rapidly. In many areas they
 remain under-represented and at the bottom of the pay
 scale. Part of the explanation for this is the lingering
 strength of the traditional German view of what constitutes
 proper or expected roles for women. It should be noted, for
 example, that there are no women in military service, despite
 a manpower pool shortage.
 The Laender are responsible for the entire educational
 system. School attendance is compulsory from the ages of
 six to fifteen, i.e., for nine years, and attendance at all
 public schools is free. Study materials, in particular school
 books, are put at the pupil's disposal partly free of charge.
 There is an extensive system of vocational training, and more
 than 20 new universities have been founded in the last 15
 years. The number of university students has increased five-
 fold compared to 20 years ago, and university training has
 become more accessible to all strata of society.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 
 
 797
 Freedom of speech and press is fully protected. Conversation
 is unrestricted and criticism of the government in both
 serious and satirical veins is widespread. There is no
 censorship of the media, a right specifically (and successfully)
 protected by Articles 5, 17, and 18 of the Basic Law. Neither
 is there censorship of domestic or foreign books or artistic
 works. Journalists have not been intimidated since the 1962
 Spi_el affair. The government does not impede academic
 inqui;r.
 The only important restriction on the right to assemble
 or demonstrate is the requirement to request and obtain a permit
 from the authorities--unless there is good evidence that the
 demonstration was genuinely spontaneous. The Federal Republic
 has had some painful experience in 1980 in maintaining this
 freedom. Anti-military activists have successfully applied
 for permits to demonstrate at Bundeswehr induction ceremonies,
 and the results on several occasions, particularly at Bremen,
 were bloody confrontations between the police determined to
 maintain order and demonstrators bent on disruption.
 Labor unions have effective rights to organize, negotiate
 and strike--although labor disputes seldom result in strikes.
 Professional associations and scientific bodies exist freely
 and have not been harassed by the government or persecuted.
 There is no state religion in any formal or official sense.
 The government does, however, aid the major Christian
 denominations, e.g., by collecting revenue for them through
 the tax system--if the individual taxpayer so chooses--or
 through school subsidies. Articles 3, 4, and 7 of the Basic
 Law guarantee freedom of religion. No evidence has come to
 light that any religious minorities are discriminated
 against or that adherence to any particular faith confers
 advantage or disadvantage in the various facets of German
 life.
 b.   Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 The Federal Republic is one of the chief defenders (and
 beneficiaries)of the right of repatriation. One of the
 cardinal goals of its foreign policy is to gain the right for
 as many as possible of the 3 million ethnic Germans living
 in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to obtain permission to
 emigrate to the Federal Republic, should they wish to do so.
 Conversely, the Federal government, which under Article 73
 of the Basic Law has exclusive authority in West Germany to
 legislate on emigration policy, places virtually no restrictions
 on those citizens who wish to leave.
 The Basic Law's Article 16 (supported by Article 18)
 has provided the basis for one of the world's most open
 asylum policies for political refugees. The number of
 people taking advantage of this provision has risen sharply
 in the past few years: 1976 - 11,000; 1977 - 16,000; 1978 -
 33,000; 1979 - 51,000; 1980 (end of August) - 87,000. These
 figures are for applicants who have somehow managed to arrive
 in West Germany, frequently coming from East to West Berlin and
 thence to other parts of the country. Probably only 10 percent
 of those who apply actually will be granted full asylum
 status by the administrative courts. During the lengthy
 appeal process, however, the "new" arrivals reside in the country.
 The problem for the Germans is that most of the new "refugees"
 are clearly coming to get a job. Most of them are from
 Turkey or developing countries to the southeast, whose history
 and culture are different from those of Western Europe. The
 major sources of the 87,000 refugees provisionally admitted
 in the first eight months of 1980 are as follows:
 
 
 798
 Turkey         50,000
 Pakistan        5,000
 India           5,000
 Afghanistan     4,000
 Ethiopia        3,400
 Vietnam         2,800
 Sri Lanka       2,100
 The West Germans already regard themselves as living in a
 crowded country.. As the presence of the new economic
 refugees becomes even more obvious, some expressions of concern
 or opposition have begun to emerge from various parts of
 the public. The prospect of heightened unemployment--real
 or imagined--is frequently mentioned. Resentment towards
 immigrants who do not conform to German cultural modes but
 retain their former way of life is not uncommon. On the
 other hand, the government has publicly pointed out that
 Germany has a continuing need for manual labor.
 In answer to public pressure, the Federal government has
 taken a number of steps to control the influx of purely
 economic asylum-seekers. These include:
 -- A block on work permits for new asylum-seekers during
 the first year of their stay;
 -- Cessation of child-support payments during the period
 of adjudication of the asylum application;
 -- New v.sa requirements for travelers from Bangladesh,
 India, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Ethiopia and Somalia;
 -- Changes in the federal law to speed the total
 processing/adjudication period for an asylum application.
 Freedom for West Germans to travel within their country
 or abroad is unimpeded. This is true for both women and
 men. The government places no restrictions on emigration
 and welcomes ethnic Germans from other countries who wish to
 immigrate/repatriate to West Germany.
 c.   Freedom To Participate in the Political Process
 Participation in the political system is open to all
 citizens, and this right is widely exercised. Opposition
 parties function freely and actively. The media are available
 to all parties, and public meetings are not restricted. There
 continues to be some public debate over the procedures for
 hiring federal and state employees and granting them
 permanent civil service status. There are periodic
 allegations of excessively strict interpretation of laws
 designed to bar extremists from public employment. Related
 to this problem is the fact that the individual states, which
 have responsibility for screening most applicants for civil
 service positions, do not administer the screening procedures
 uniformly. The only major group denied suffrage is the
 foreign workers. "Denied" is not entirely accurate, since
 most of the foreign laborers have not sought to change their
 national status. The government continues to wrestle
 with the question of what nationality the children of foreign
 workers should possess (many of whom were born or educated in
 West Germany). Otherwise, problems of statelessness are
 largely non-existent. Article 16 of the constitution states
 that German citizenship may not be taken away except through
 specific legal process and only if the person is not left
 stateless.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 
 
 799
 The government's attitude toward human rights investigations
 is generally open and cooperative. It has provided responses
 or information to all serious investigators. Most recently
 the government has cooperated with Amnesty International's
 review of the prison system. The latter organization is
 perhaps the best-known group active in human rights affairs
 in Germany, although the German chapter's focus is primarily
 on other countries. Amnesty International has local groups
 in every major city of the country, and operates openly with no
 personal or professional danger to its members. Another active
 organization is the Frankfurt-based Society for Human Rights.
 This group looks chiefly at the human rights practices in
 Eastern Europe and the German Democratic Republic.
