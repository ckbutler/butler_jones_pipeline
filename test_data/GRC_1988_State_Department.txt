 GREECE
 Greece is a constitutional republic and parliamentary
 democracy. The party or coalition with the majority of seats
 in Parliament names the Prime Minister, who forms the
 Government. Elections are freely and vigorously contested by
 a full spectrum of political parties. The next parliamentary
 elections must be held by June 1989. The President, the
 largely ceremonial Head of State, is elected by Parliament.
 Activities of the police and security services are strictly
 monitored by the Government and the independent judiciary.
 Reported abuses are largely confined to occasional rough
 handling of ordinary criminals during police investigations.
 A developed country and member of the European Community (EC),
 Greece benefits from EC subsidies designed to bring its per
 capita gross national product into line with that of other EC
 members. Economic development is hampered by a bloated public
 sector. Current government policy has the declared aim of
 freeing the private sector from excessive government
 intervention.
 The full range of fundamental human rights is provided for by
 the Constitution. Attention focussed in 1988 on the demand
 for nonmilitary service for conscientious objectors and for
 stricter observance of the rights of pretrial detainees.
 Treatment of the respective Muslim and Greek minorities in
 Greece and Turkey continues to be a subject of political
 dispute between the two countries.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killing by
 government forces in 1988. However, terrorism and political
 assassination claimed 15 Greek and foreign victims. The
 domestic terrorist group "November 17" is the greatest single
 threat. In addition to a nonlethal attack on an Athens police
 station, it carried out in 1988 the murders of industrialist
 Alexandros Athanassiades and U.S. Defense Attache William
 Nordeen. Barring a breakthrough by local authorities,
 "November 17" will continue its attacks on Greek and foreign
 figures; to date it has not indiscriminately targeted the
 general populace. Other incidents included theattack on the
 excursion boat "City of Poros" (9 dead) by the Abu Nidal
 organization and the assassination of Armenian militant leader
 Hagop Hagopian by rival Armenian terrorists.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of official abductions, secret arrests,
 or clandestine detentions during 1988.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from torture is provided for by the Constitution, and
 a November 1984 law makes the use of torture an offense
 punishable by sentences ranging from 3 years to life
 imprisonment. Several incidents of intimidation or beating of
 
 
 1076
 GREECE
 detainees by police were reported in the press in 1988,
 leading to inquiries by a public prosecutor. No policeman has
 yet been convicted under the 1984 law. Greek human rights
 groups contend that police overreliance on confessions
 occasionally leads to abuses and that Greek courts admit
 illegally acquired evidence.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is ensured by
 the Constitution and respected in practice. Preventive
 detention does not exist in Greece. A person arrested on the
 basis of a warrant or while committing a crime must be brought
 before an examining magistrate within 24 hours and charged.
 This magistrate must issue a warrant of imprisonment or order
 the release of the detainee within 3 days of the examination
 unless special circumstances require a 2-day extension of this
 time limit.
 The maximum duration of detention pending trial may not exceed
 1 year (6 months for misdemeanors), extendable (by 6 or 3
 months respectively) only in exceptional circumstances by
 decision of a judicial council. Most trials occur within 6
 months of the charges being submitted. Release pending trial,
 with or without bail, is granted only in exceptional cases, by
 a decision of a judicial council.
 Exile is unconstitutional and does not occur. With regard to
 forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair and public trials are ensured by the Constitution and
 provided for in practice. Greece has a regular system of
 civil and criminal courts, with an independent judiciary,
 though critics charge that the Government puts improper
 pressure on judges during politically sensitive trials.
 Defendants enjoy a presumption of innocence. Defense lawyers
 are available to all accused; at public expense if necessary.
 A defendant or his attorney may confront witnesses. Court
 sessions are public unless the court decides that privacy is
 required for the protection of victims or in matters of
 national security. The latter provision is not abused. A
 defendant may appeal a court verdict to an appeals court.
 Military courts have no jurisdiction over civilians. Greece
 has no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The inviolability of the home and of the individual's personal
 and family life is protected by the Constitution. No house
 search may be made except in conformance with specified legal
 standards and always in the presence of representatives of the
 judiciary. Warrants, issued by a public prosecutor (who is
 considered a judicial officer in Greece), are required for an
 official to enter a private home. These constitutional
 provisions are respected in practice. The Constitution
 requires punishment and "liability for full damages to the
 sufferer" for violations of the sanctity of the home and for
 the abuse of power. There is no compulsory membership in
 political groups. The Constitution further protects privacy
 of correspondence and communication. Opposition parties
 accused the Government of illegal surveillance activity during
 
 
 1077
 GREECE
 1987 and 1988. A parliamentary investigation in one case was
 inconclusive, and a prosecutor was appointed in the other.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is provided for in the Constitution
 and respected in practice. Censorship is prohibited.
 Opposition viewpoints are constantly presented in the active
 Greek press, and criticism of the Government is unhampered.
 Greek television stations are government owned and operated,
 with the exception of a satellite retransmission station run
 by the municipality of Thessaloniki. The Government is
 challenging the legality of this station. The Government
 began rebroadcasting foreign satellite television programs in
 a few cities on an experimental basis in late 1988. New
 legislation in 1988 legalized municipal and privately operated
 radio stations, which now broadcast a wide range of
 viewpoints. Though the activities of opposition political
 leaders are covered by radio and television, opposition
 parties assert that news and information programming tends to
 reflect the political perspective of the governing party while
 their own views are neglected. During elections, television
 time is given to all major political parties according to
 their relative strength in Parliament.
 The Constitution allows for seizure, by order of the public
 prosecutor, of publications which insult the President, offend
 religious beliefs, contain obscene articles, a~vocate a
 violent overthrow of the political system, or disclose
 military and defense information. No periodicals or
 newspapers are known to have been seized in 1988. Greece has
 strict libel laws, violations of which are prosecuted under
 established legal procedures with the safeguards of due
 process. Although Greek libel law makes it relatively easy to
 convict publishers for defamatory articles, the light
 penalties usually assessed do not signicantly hamper newspaper
 operations. Academic freedoms are protected by democratically
 chosen faculty organizations, though such groups tend to be
 highly politicized.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is ensured by the Constitution. Limits
 may be imposed on outdoor public meetings, however, if police
 authorities determine that a serious disturbance of social and
 economic life is threatened. A few demonstrations by small
 extremist groups were prohibited in 1988 following such
 determinations.
 The right of association is protected by the Constitution and
 observed in practice. All citizens are free to establish and
 join organizations of their own choosing, including political
 groups and private organizations, without previous
 authorization or government interference.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and prohibits
 discriminatory practices against religious minorities, which
 
 
 1078
 GREECE
 in Greece include small communities of Muslims, Jews, and
 non-Orthodox Christians. The Constitution nevertheless
 establishes the Greek Orthodox Church, to which 98 percent of
 the population at least nominally adheres, as the "prevailing"
 religion. In addition, it prohibits proselytism by any
 religious group. The number of foreign missionaries arrested
 has decreased since the Greek courts ruled that simple
 distribution of literature does not constitute proselytism.
 In the first 7 months of 1988, 88 Jehovah's Witnesses were
 arrested for proselytism, and 2 were sentenced to 4 and 3
 months' imprisonment respectively. The latter conviction was
 upheld by the Supreme Court and was appealed in August to the
 European Commission for Human Rights, the first such
 submission from Greece.
 The Constitution declares that "no person shall be exempt from
 discharging his obligations to the State or may refuse to
 comply with laws by reason of his religious convictions."
 Although Greece provides for alternative noncombatant military
 service, it has no provision for nonmilitary alternative
 national service. Jehovah's Witnesses and a small number of
 other conscientious objectors of military age, who refuse
 alternative noncombatant military service, are tried and
 sentenced by military courts to military prison for a term
 twice that of normal service. In September there were 460
 Jehovah's Witnesses and two other conscientious objectors
 serving such sentences. A portion of this sentence may be
 served in a civilian minimum security prison (frequently
 agricultural), where each day served is credited as 2 days
 toward fulfillment of the sentence. In 1988 the average time
 actually served was reportedly from 36 to 42 months.
 In the spring, two conscientious objectors unconnected with
 the Jehovah's Witnesses went on a hunger strike in prison to
 press the Government to introduce a law creating nonuniformed
 alternative service. Such a draft law was introduced in July
 but was not formally considered, reportedly due to
 disagreements within the ruling party. The law as proposed is
 considered insufficient by human rights activists, due to its
 insistence on doubling the length of service and on screening
 by a committee of military officers and a psychiatrist. In an
 effort to move the new law forward, the conscientious
 objectors resumed their hunger strike in September and also
 reportedly submitted an appeal to the European Commission on
 Human Rights. One of the conscientious objectors was released
 from prison in December.
 In late 1987, a lower court in Crete held that Jehovah's
 Witnesses do not constitute a "known" religion and are thus
 not entitled to legal protection, since their doctrine of
 refusal to serve in the military violates Greek law. The
 appeal of this decision, scheduled to be heard by the Supreme
 Court in October 1988, was postponed until late 1989.
 Jehovah's Witnesses also complain that the Government does not
 recognize that Jehovah's Witnesses clerics are entitled to the
 same exemption from military service as that accorded to
 Orthodox and other recognized clerics; two Jehovah's Witnesses
 clerics are currently serving prison terms.
 Some non-Orthodox churches experience difficulties in building
 or acquiring new meeting places, when necessary permits from
 the Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, which must
 consider the opinion of Orthodox Church hierarchy, are denied.
 
 
 1079
 GREECE
 Greece has a Muslim minority of approximately 126,000, made up
 of ethnic Turks, Pomaks, and Gypsies, located principally in
 Thrace in northeastern Greece. Their freedom of religion was
 guaranteed under the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, and some 250
 mosques exist. Under that treaty, the Government names the
 Mufti (religious leader with some administrative powers) of
 the two main cities after consultation with Muslim notables.
 Certain members of the community protest that the Muftis
 should be elected by the community itself, as was provided
 under a 1920 law, which the Government contends was never
 implemented and is invalid.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution ensures freedom of movement within the
 country, foreign travel, and emigration, and these rights are
 generally respected. Persons intending to emigrate, and
 emigrants who return to Greece, experience no discrimination.
 However, the Greek citizenship code makes a legal distinction
 between Greek citizens of ethnic Greek and nonethnic Greek
 descent. Citizens of nonethnic Greek descent can- be deprived
 of their citizenship if they move abroad with the apparent
 intent not to return. A small number of Greek Muslims who
 have moved to Turkey have had their Greek citizenship
 revoked. The Government states this provision is used
 sparingly, and only after it is determined that the citizen in
 question has severed material ties with Greece and established
 permanent residence elsewhere. The Muslim community protests
 this practice as discriminatory.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Greece is a multiparty democracy in which all citizens enjoy
 full political rights without regard to race, sex, religion,
 or political persuasion. Greek citizens freely choose the
 officials and laws governing them. The President is elected
 to a 5-year term, and members of the unicameral Parliament to
 maximum 4-year terms. Suffrage is universal over age 18. The
 opposition parties function freely, have broad access to the
 media, hold public meetings, and serve as a check on actions
 by the Government.
 Women still play a secondary role in political life. Of 300
 parliamentary deputies elected in 1985, 11 are women. The
 present Cabinet has one female minister.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has not objected to visits and investigations
 by human rights organizations. Domestic human rights
 organizations are allowed to operate freely and actively
 assist those who believe that their rights have been
 violated. The Government also participates in multilateral
 human rights organizations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Both the Constitution and the revised family law provide women
 the same individual, political, and social rights as men.
 Women made up 34 percent of the nonagricultural work force in
 
 
 1080
 GREECE
 1985 and 32 percent of recent university graduates. The
 percentage of women in traditionally male jobs and the
 professions is small but growing. Though the law mandates
 equal pay for men and women, women's pay averaged about 82
 percent of that of men in 1988, due to less overtime, fewer
 bonuses, and no family supplements. Over the past decade, the
 Government has instituted significant reforms in marriage,
 divorce, and property laws and has expanded services to women
 in unemployment, family planning, and child care.
 The Treaty of Lausanne (1923) includes provisions protecting
 the political and cultural rights of the Muslim minority. Two
 Muslim members serve in the national Parliament. Many
 villages in Thrace regularly elect Muslim mayors.
 Members of the Muslim community complain that Greek officials
 have obstructed the entry of teachers and educational materials
 from Turkey for Turkish-language schools. Greek officials
 contend that the Government of Turkey has not acted to revise
 materials found unacceptable under the terms of a 1968
 agreement on reciprocal imports of textbooks. In the current
 impasse, Turkish-language schools in Greece are widely
 considered inadequate to prepare students for a modern
 economy. Muslim Greeks who study in Turkey complain that
 their professional credentials are not accepted by Greek
 professional bodies.
 A Thessaloniki court in 1988 sentenced a Muslim doctor and his
 associate to 30 and 15 months' imprisonment, respectively, for
 forgery and "spreading false accusations," for having
 presented a petition at a conference in 1987 protesting
 government treatment of the Muslim minority. Muslim leaders
 complain about barriers to land purchases from non-Muslims and
 about discrimination in approval of building permits and
 issuance of drivers' licenses. At the doctor's trial, the
 Government presented detailed statistics to refute claims of
 such discrimination. A clear perception exists among many
 Muslims, however, that they are at a disadvantage in their
 economic and political dealings with the Government.
 Tensions between Greece and Turkey have made each country's
 perception of the treatment of its coreligionists in the other
 country a sensitive issue, and both countries have viewed
 human rights questions in light of historical and political
 differences. There is no independent corroborating evidence
 of a generalized pattern of political, religious, or cultural
 repression of the Muslim community or a deliberate policy of
 discrimination by the Greek Government.
 Certain conservative elements of the Greek public adopt a
 critical view of the open exercise of unfamiliar religions.
 The permission to use a sports stadium in Piraeus for a
 Jehovah's Witness rally in August was canceled due to
 opposition from the Orthodox Church. Municipal authorities in
 Thessaloniki did not allow Jehovah's Witnesses to register
 their religious affiliation on identity cards and other
 official documents. A review by the Interior Ministry is
 reportedly pending. Greek authorities did successfully
 prosecute a group of villagers who attacked a member of the
 Jehovah's Witnesses in 1988.

 GREECE
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The right of association is provided for by the Constitution
 and by specific legislation passed in 1978 and amended in
 1982. Over 4,000 unions exist in Greece with 3 levels of
 organization: local, industrywide or branch federations, and
 two confederations (private workers and civil servants). In
 1987 an estimated 35 percent of Greek wage and salary earners
 were organized in unions.
 The only restriction on the right to strike is the Government's
 power of civil mobilization of workers when there is a danger
 to national defense, life, or property, or to the social and
 economic life of the country. The Government uses this power
 sparingly. Employees in public services must notify employers
 of their intention to strike 4 days prior to the strike and
 cover basic services during the strike. Security personnel
 (military, police, fire, port police) are prohibited from
 forming unions and from striking.
 Unions receive most of their funding from a Ministry of Labor
 organization, the "Worker's Hearth," although a few unions
 have their own additional sources of funding. Although unions
 are highly politicized and closely linked to political
 parties, they are not controlled by the Government in their
 day-to-day operations. Trade unionists are protected by law
 from dismissal for union activities. Individual worker
 grievances may be brought for investigation, to labor
 inspectors of the Ministry of Labor.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize and bargain collectively was ensured by
 legislation passed in 1955. This law established a system of
 compulsory arbitration by tripartite labor courts in the case
 of disputes. Compulsory arbitration is no longer favored by
 any of the parties concerned, and in 1988 the Ministry of
 Labor proposed a system of voluntary arbitration; draft
 legislation is under consideration. There are no restrictions
 on collective bargaining for private workers; civil servants
 negotiate their demands with the Ministry of Interior but have
 no formal system of collective bargaining. Greece has no
 exporting processing zones, and labor law and practice are
 uniform throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is strictly prohibited by the
 Constitution and is not practiced. '
 d. Minimum Age for Employment for Children
 The minimum age for work in industry is 15. However,
 legislation and regulations provide alternate minimum ages for
 work in specified aAeas or specific jobs. For example, those
 performing loading or unloading work must be at least 18 years
 of age, while workers for the ports of Thessaloniki and
 Piraeus must be 21. In family businesses, theaters, and the
 cinema, the minimum age is 12. These age limits are generally
 respected, except in families engaged in agriculture or
 merchandising, in which younger children often assist part
 time or full time.
 
 
 1082
 GREECE
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The minimum daily wage as of September 1, 1988, was $14.90,
 sufficient for a decent standard of living. Minimum wages and
 salaries, established by the national collective bargaining
 agreement and by branch collective bargaining agreements, are
 generally respected by employers. Workers who believe that
 they receive less than the minimum to which they are entitled
 may file a complaint with either the Ministry of Labor or the
 National Social Security scheme (IKA) which investigates the
 allegation. The workweek is 40 hours in the private sector
 and 37.5 hours in the public sector.
 Minimum standards of occupational health and safety are
 provided for by legislation. New regulations are under
 consideration for underground work. Although the Greek
 Confederation of Greek Workers characterizes health and safety
 legislation as satisfactory, it charges that enforcement of
 the legislation is inadequate and cites the high number of
 job-related accidents. The National Statistical Service
 reported that in 1985, 2.3 percent of workers insured by IKA
 were injured at work. Enforcement reportedly suffers because
 of inadequate inspection, failure to enforce compliance with
 regulations, and outdated industrial equipment and plant.
