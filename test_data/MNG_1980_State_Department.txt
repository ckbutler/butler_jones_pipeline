 MONGOLIAN PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC
 The Mongolian People's Republic is a communist country
 almost totally dominated by the Soviet Union. There is a
 paucity of information on Mongolia, and much of what is
 available comes directly from the Mongolian regime. The
 few resident diplomats and occasional visitors are mainly
 limited to the capital city of Ulaanbaatar and get only
 brief and opaque glimpses of Mongolian life in other parts
 of the country. The United States does not recognize or
 have diplomatic relations with the Mongolian People's
 Republic.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There is no information concerning the use of torture by
 Mongolian authorities.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There is no information concerning cruel, inhuman or
 degrading treatment or punishment by Mongolian authorities.
 c. Disappearances
 There is no information concerning disappearances.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 There is no information concerning arbitrary arrest or
 imprisonment by Mongolian authorities.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Mongolian history from the 1920s to 1949 includes a series
 of Soviet-type purges and trials based on secret police
 methods and trumped-up evidence. The 1949 civil and
 criminal codes stipulate the right of the accused to
 judicial process, a legal defense, and an open trial
 "except as stipulated by law." Since the criminal code
 places heavy emphasis on crimes against the state and
 permits star chamber proceedingd in such cases, and since
 the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) controls
 all legal systems, those accused of serious crimes are
 unlikely to receive due process.
 f: Invasion of the Home
 There is no information concerning the invasion of the home
 by Mongolian authorities.

 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 While it is impossible to verify the economic claims of the
 current regime, it seems likely that the daily lot of most
 Mongolians has improved when compared to conditions before
 the revolution. For example, Mongolian figures indicate
 that there were 20.9 physicians per 10,000 population in
 1978 as opposed to .03 per 10,000 in 1925. Other data
 indicate similar improvements in education, employment, and
 food production.
 Despite this substantial rise in the Mongolian standard of
 living over the last fifty years, the country remains
 extremely backward. An inefficient and overcentralized
 bureacracy, a centrally-run economy integrally incorporated
 within the Committee for Mutual Economic Assistance and
 designed to serve Soviet rather than Mongolian interests, a
 lack of resources, extreme geographic isolation, and a
 severe climate conspire to keep the quality of Mongolian
 life poor by any objective international standard.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The constitution provides for freedom of speech, demon-
 stration and assembly. The constitution specifically
 states, however, that these "freedoms" are provided "in
 order to strengthen the socialist state system of the
 Mongolian People's Republic," and it is probable that any
 persons who exercise these freedoms in ways that are not
 viewed by the authorities as contributing to this goal
 would rapidly find themselves in difficulties. Control is
 exercised through various mass organizations extending down
 to the block committee level. The Supreme Court is respon-
 sible for guaranteeing the constitutional rights of
 individuals.
 The current Mongolian regime strictly controls religion.
 As a consequence, the Buddhist church, which was a central
 force in Mongolian life sixty years ago, has been reduced
 to a few showcase monasteries and a handful of monks, who
 serve primarily as propagandists in Soviet attempts to
 manipulate the international Buddhist movement.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Few Mongolians travel abroad, even to the Soviet Union, and
 none are known to have requested repatriation to Mongolia.
 All Mongolians over 16 years of age must have internal
 passports and must obtain permission from the militia in
 order to travel from one area of the country to another.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Mongolian Communist Party does not tolerate political
 groups outside its control. Communist party organization
 is hierarchical, and it is assumed that lower-ranking mem-
 bers have no real ability to influence or criticize the
 decisions of superiors.

 The constitution provides that all citizens over 18 (except
 the mentally ill) have the right to vote and to be elected.
 The constitution also provides for equal rights irre-
 spective of nationality or religion. There is no evidence,
 however, of religious persons or those other than the domi-
 nant Khalka Mongols occupying elite party or "government"
 positions. In elections, only one canditate is listed for
 each office so the choice is to vote for him or to cross
 out his name. Not surprisingly, many elections result in a
 99.9% turnout, with the winning candidate receiving 99.9%
 of the vote. Obviously the method for participating fully
 in the political process is through joining the MPRP and
 moving up carefully through the party ranks.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Mongolian accession to the United Nations Covenant on Civil
 and Political Rights came into force on the same day as
 that of the Soviet Union, March 23, 1976. Although the
 Mongolians have acceded to this covenant, the current
 Mongolian regime can be expected to echo the Soviet human
 rights policy and practice, whether or not it is consistent
 with the covenant. There have been no known attempts by
 outside investigators to examine human rights violations by
 the Mongolian People's Republic. It is highly unlikely
 that the Mongolian officials would permit such investiga-
 tion by any outside authority or organization.
