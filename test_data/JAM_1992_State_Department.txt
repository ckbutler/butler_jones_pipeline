 JAMAICA
 Jamaica is a constitutional parliamentary democracy and a member of the Com-
 monwealth of Nations. The Governor General, appointed by the Crown on the advice
 of the Prime Minister, represents the Queen as Head of State. The elected Prime
 Minister, the leader of the majorityparty in Parliament, is the country's chief execu-
 tive. The Parliament is composed o an elected House of Representatives and a Sen-
 ate appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister and the
 Leader of the Opposition. Two majorpelitical parties have alternated in power since
 the first elections under universal adult suffrage in 1944. In the last general elec-
 tion, held in February 1989, the People's National Party (PNP) won 45 of the 60
 seats in the House of Representatives (it has since gained another). The opposition
 Jamaica Labor Party (JLP), which formed the Government from 1980 to 1989, holds
 the remaining 14 seats.
 The security forces consist of the Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF-police), the
 Island Special Constabulary Force (ISCF-auxiliary police), and the Jamaica De-
 fense Force (JDF-army, air wing, and coast guard). The JCF and ISCF report to
 the Ministry of National Security. The JDF is responsible to the Prime Minister in
 his capacity as Defense Minister. According to the U.S. Arms Control and Disar-
 mament Agency, total military expenditures for 1989 were $36 million. The Govern-
 ment has made substantial reductions in these expenditures and is likely to con-
 tinue to do so in the near future. Since 1974, the JDF has been authorized to con-
 duct joint operations with the JCF to maintain peace and order under the Suppres-
 sion of Crime Act (SOCA). In July JDF platoons were deployed on anticrime patrols
 in the island's tourist centers. The police continued to be responsible for incidents
 of human rights abuse.
 Jamaica's economy emphasizes the private sector and is based on primary prod-
 ucts (bauxite/alumina, sugar, bananas), service industries (tourism) and light manu-
 facturing (garment assembly). The Government has promoted private investment to
 stimulate economic growth and modernization, pursuing in the process a sometimes
 painful program of structural adjustment.
 Extrajudicial killings, beatings, and threats perpetrated by police and prison
 guards, often with impunity, remain Jamaica's principal human rights problems.
 Conditions in Jamaican jails and prisons remain appalling, with serious overcrowd-
 ing, poor sanitary conditions, and inadequate diet the norm. An inefficient and over-
 burdened judiciary is responsible for lengthy delays in trials, sentencing, and ap-
 peals.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other E.trajudicial Killing.-While there were no reports of polit-
 ical killings in 1992, there continue to be credible reports that the JCF engages in
 the summary execution of suspects under the guise of shootouts." Police statistics
 collected over several years show that the number of people shot and killed by the
 police routinely exceeds the number shot but only wounded. In the first 9 months
 of 1992, these statistics listed 69 people shot and wounded by police officers, while
 107 were shot and killed. For the same period in 1991, the figures were 81 shot and
 wounded, 116 shot and killed.

 In 1992 a number of persons in. police custody died under circumstances that
 strongly suggest extrajudicial killing. Specific incidents included deaths in police
 lock-ups in Savannah-La-Mar, Ramble, and Kingston, and in the maximum security
 prisons in Spanish Town and Kingston. The Jamaica Council on Human Rights
 (JCHR) believes this pattern represents the continuation of longstanding practices
 by the JCF.
 Police are seldom punished for extrejudicial killings. Media reports indicate that
 three members of the JCF had been charged with murder by July 1992. A March
 1992 report indicated that one JCF officer had been sentencedto death for the 1991
 murder of a Crown witness in a drug trial. Government sources did not provide any
 information on the 33 JCF officers charged with murder in 1991, although a media
 report in August 1992 stated that 13 JCF members were convicted of "various crimi-
 nal offenses in 1991.
 Allegations surfaced of official involvement in the February 1992 death of Lester
 Lloyd Coke, who died when a fire swept his cell in the general penitentiary. A coro-
 ner's inquest into the incident "was inconclusive and no charges were brought, but
 credible reports indicate that security personnel delayed Coke's passage to receive
 medical treatment after he was pulled from his cell. Coke, who had been linked po-
 litically with the opposition JLP, was facing extradition to the United States on
 murder and drug charges.
 Vigilantism, involving spontaneous mob executions, occurs with some frequency in
 Jamaica, and a number of accounts of such cases appeared in the news media in
 1992. In an August case, a Kingston neighborhood watch group beat an accused rob-
 ber to death; in a September incident in Twickenham Park, St. Catherine vigilantes
 killed a would-be rapist with fists and machetes. Police rarely brought charges
 against vigilantes, and in the few cases that do go to court, acquittals are common.
 b. Disappearance.-There was no evidence of abduction or disappearances per-
 petrated by the security forces in 1992.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture and other abuse of prisoners and detainees are prohibited by law. Nonethe-
 less, there were numerous credible complaints of beatings, some fatal, by guards
 and security personnel of inmates held in jails and prisons. One particularly trou-
 blIng case lodged with the JCHR detailed two separate 1992 beatings of a Jamaican
 fiaherwoman by police, which left her unconscious and with eye damage. During the
 second incident, the woman alleges that police beat and stripped her at one police
 station, took her naked to another, and left her overnight in the police lock-up,
 bleeding heavily. While efforts by the Government to improve the situation through
 police training continue, few officers were tried and sentenced for such abuses dur-
 ing the year. Two JCF constables who were charged with "mistreatment of pris-
 oners" in a 1991 administrative procedure by the JCF were reprimanded in early
 1992 but did not face criminal proceedings.
 Senior-level police officials on several occasions indicated publicly that serious
 problems existed with excessive use of force by the JCF, an the JCF included a
 seminar with the JCHR as part of its basic training regime for incoming policemen
 for the first time in 1992. In addition, legislation to create a police civilian review
 board was passed by Parliament in June; the Governor General named the three
 members of the board on December 16.
 As in past years, some persons brought civil suits successfully against the police
 for unlawful actions. Damages paid by the Government averaged $265,000 annually
 over the past few years. In September 1992, a man who was shot by a police officer
 in 1989 and subsequently charged with assault and illegal possession of a firearm
 won his civil suit against the Attorney General for false imprisonment and was
 awarded damages of$40,000 arising from the loss of his leg. In a June 1992 inter-
 view Police Commissioner Roy Thompson stated that 123 members of the JCF and
 ISCF were facing criminal charges for various offenses, while an August media re-
 port indicated that 99 policemen had been dismissed from the force since March
 1991. Of the 123 arrested, 33 were charged with murder, 5 with manslaughter, and
 12 with unlawful assault upon civilians.
 There were no significant changes in conditions in maximum security prisons and
 police lock-ups, which remain abysmal. Sanitary conditions are appalling, food inad-
 equate at best, and overcrowding the rule rather than the exception. At the general
 penitentiary in Kingston, up to six men are held in the 7- by 10-foot cells in the
 remand section, in near-total darkness, for 16-20 hours a day. In October, 3 men
 died in the Constant Spring Police lock-up after having been held in a 7- by 7-foot
 cell with minimal ventilation for mere than 48 hours with 16 other detainees. The
 coroner's report indicated they died of asphyxiation. There was some evidence that
 stab wounds were inflicted on the bodies after they were pulled from the cell by po-
 lice, three days after their initial detention. In December a coroner's inquest jury
 
 
 returned a verdict of criminal negligence; by year's end, the Director of Public Pros-
 ecutions had not decided which police officers at Constant Spring were to be charged
 with manslaughter.
 Another longstanding problem is the failure to provide timely and adequate medi-
 cal attention to prisoners and detainees. Prisoners who can afford to pay find access
 to medical treatment, supplemental food, and other amenities. Prisoners without ac-
 cess to money from family members and friends must subsist on the 60 cents a day
 rinmate budgeted for food. Conditions at Bellevue Hospital, the main mental
 health facility in Jamaica, were highlighted in a 1992 television news series which
 alleged that patients were going hungry while the staff diverted food supplies for
 private sale.
 , d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or ExiLe.-The Suppression of Crime Act (SOCA),
 Adopted in 1974 and still in force in Kingston, St. Andrew, and St Catherine par-
 ishes, allows police to make arrests and conduct searches without warrants of-the
 homes and property of persons "reasonably" suspected of having committed a crime.
 It has also been used as justification for curfews in urban areas. The SOCA also
 applies to the territorial waters off Jamaica. In response to increases in some cat-
 egories of violent crime, the Government initiated a combined JCF-JDF program,
 called "Operation Ardent," in late October. Three joint police-military task forces
 were created as rapid-response units for the entire island, while foot patrols by joint
 units were increased. The task forces were also given authority over specially con-
 structed detention centers to be commanded by the military.
 Although Prime Minister P.J. Patterson denounced the SOCA in July as legisla-
 tion whose time had passed, it was reinstituted islandwide in September, in re-
 sponse to threatened industrial action by the police federation. Islandwide applica-
 tion was revoked 2 days later, leaving the Act in force in Kingston and the two adja-
 cent parishes.
 Detention of suspects without a warrant occurs regularly, particularly in poor
 neighborhoods. According to the JCHR, many detainees are held for several weeks
 without being brought before a judge or magistrate. For Jamaican suspects charged
 with a crime, there is a functioning bail system. Foreign detainees, however, are
 regularly denied bail. Persons unable tojpost bail while waiting for a judicial hear-
 ing are often detained for long periods. One group of some 80-100 persons is being
 held indefinitely without the riqht to trial, generally for capital offenses committed
 as minors. They are subject to indefinite detention; many Wave been held for more
 than 10 years. Others in the group, mostly mentally ill, have been judged unfit to
 plead. In response to a September media report of a man held without trial for 23
 years as unfit to plead, the Ministry of National Security and Justice stated that
 such cases were being processed for possible review by the Governor General. By
 year's end, some 5-10 of these detainees had been released.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-There is a well established right to counsel for
 persons charged with criminal offenses; indigents, however, must have been accused
 of a "serious offense" (e.g. murder, rspe, r bbery, firearms offenses) to qualify for
 court-appointed counsel. The Court of Appeal and the Parliament may refer cases
 to the judicial committee of the PriWy Council in the United Kingdom-
 A special gun court, established in 1974, considers all cases involving the illegal
 use or possession of firearms and ammunition. Public attendance is restricted, and
 cases are heard by a panel of three judges, with less rigorous rules of evidence than
 in regular court proceedings. In capital cases, hearings before the gun court serve
 as preliminaries to jury trials under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.
 The judicial system, although independent, is overburdened and operates with in-
 adequate resources. Budgetary shortfalls have resulted in a steady attrition of
 trained personnel causing further delays. Some cases take years to come to trial,
 and others have had to be dismissed because case iles could not be located. The
 Government has in recent years taken some steps to reverse the deterioration of the
 legal system. These include raising judicial salaries, increasing training for justice
 personnel, and upgrading court house facilities.
 There are no political prisoners in Jamaica.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits arbitrary intrusion by the State into the private life of the
 individual. Under the SOCA, however, homes or businesses believed to be occupied
 by persons "reasonably" suspected by the police of having committed a crime may
 be searched without a warrant. There have been numerous credible reports of
 abuses of this authority. In November, a media report told of two plainclothes po-
 licemen who entered a five-room house owned by a 74-year-old woman, told her they
 were searching for guns, and proceeded to ransack the premises without a warrant.
 Upon finding a knife under the bed of the woman's son, they threatened to arrest
 
 
 438
 her. No charges were filed, nor was the woman offered recompense for the damagd
 done to her property.
 Although the use of telephone taps without court order is officially limited td
 cases involving the drug trade, terrorism, and subversion of the Government, the
 opposition JLP and the union representing rank and file police officers charged in
 September that their phones were being tapped.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and ress.-Freedom of speech and press are provided for
 in the Constitution and are observed in practice within the broad limits of libel laws
 and the Official Secrets Act.
 The government-owned Jamaica Broadcasting Company (JBC) operates two radio
 stations and the island's only television channel. The Government's influence over
 JBC program content, previously strong, diminished significantly over the past few
 years, due at least in part to the 1991 installation of a nonpartisan board of direc-
 tors for the JBC. Three JBC regional radio facilities were sold in 1989-90 to groups
 of private investors, and another private radio station went on the air in December.
 A private group was granted a license to begin operating a second television chan-
 nel, but the start-up was delayed by financial problems. The Government's Broad-
 cast Commission has the right to regulate programming during emergencies. There
 are now more than 25,200 satellite antennas serving 26,600 households on the is-
 land, permitting many Jamaicans to watch foreign television broadcasts, principally
 from the United States, without any government restriction.
 Jamaica's four largest newspapers, all privatel owned, regularly report on al-
 leged human rights abuses, particularly those involing the JCF.
 Foreign pubhcations are widely available. There is no censorship or interference
 in academic institutions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association. Public rallies are staged by all political par-
 ties. Such events require a police permit, which is normally granted. Large numbers
 and varieties of professional, business, service, social, and cultural associations func-
 tion freely.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is provided for by the Constitution
 and is well established in Jamaica. More than 80 percent of the population belongs
 to various Christian denominations and religious groups of all kinds operate freely.
 Evangelical Christian movements iave gained a significant following, and foreign
 evangelists visit regularly.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides Jamaican citizens freedom or movement and
 immunity from expulsion from the country. Apart from persons under criminal in-
 vestigation, there are no restrictions on foreign travel or emigration. Citizenship is
 not rvoked for political reasons.
 Those who apply for refugee status are handled on a case-by-case basis. In coordi-
 nation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the Jamaican
 Government established a facility which processed more than 100 Haitian boat peo-
 ple, who were housed, clothed, and fed at the Montpelier camp throughout 1992. By
 year's end, most had been voluntarily repatriated to Haiti.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 All citizens age 18 and over have the right to vote by secret ballot and in general
 exercise that right freely. In some urban electorates, however, gangs are known to
 intimidate voters and reportedly interfere with the electoral process. In the May
 1992 by-election for East Kingston and Port Royal, the ruling PNP's candidate was
 elected with little opposition (the JLP, which had announced it would not contest
 by-elections ahead of the next general election, did not participate, leaving the tiny
 Republican party as the only competition). Although exit polls suggested a 40-per-
 cent voter turnout, the final tally showed a 70-percent turnout, wit several polling
 stations listing more votes for the winner than there were legally registered voters.
 No government action was taken with regard to these anomalies.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no restrictions on human rights organizations in Jamaica. The JCHR
 the country's only formal human rights organization, has vigorously protested
 abuses by the police and has called for corrective reforms. Its work was hampered,
 however, by a lack of adequate resources. In August the JCHR's offices were broken
 into and several files taken, while others were burned. Some office equipment was
 also stolen, and some destroyed. There was extensive speculation in the media, in-
 
 
 439
 cluding the popular radio call-in shows, that elements of the JCF were responsible
 for the break-in. The JCF had not identified a suspect in the break-in by year's end.
 The JCHR's coordinator chairman, and vice-chairman have all received death
 threats since 1989 related to, inter alia, their opposition to the death penalty.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Jamaican women are accorded full equality under the Constitution, and the 1975
 Employment Act requires equal pay for equal work. In practice, because of cultural
 and social traditions, women often still suffer economic discrimination, which is fre-
 quently evidenced in hiring practices.
 Reports of violence against women increased in 1992. Rape reports increased from
 1,006 in 1990 to 1,091 in 1991. Complaints filed with the JCHR alle ging police at-
 tacks on women increased dramatically from 1991 to 1992, leading the organization
 to focus formally on women's issues for the first time since its creation in 1968. The
 Women's Crisis Center and Sistren (a women's resource collective) both reported in-
 creases in the number of, and level of violence involved in, attacks against women.
 Women remain reluctant to bring assault charges against their domestic partners
 when jail is seen as the likely result.
 There are several community groups descended from freed blacks and escaped
 slaves, some of whom claim descent from the Arawak Indians, the original inhab-
 itants of Jamaica. These people, who are called Maroons, live in separate commu-
 nities in the interior of the island and since British colonial times have enjoyed a
 degree of autonomy granted by treaty. There is no provision under the Jamaican
 Constitution for special or separate treatment for the Maroons, and no evidence of
 discrimination against them.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution specifically provides for the right
 to form or join a trade union and obligates the Government to protect the person
 and property of trade unionists. Labor unions function freely. The Labor Relations
 and Industrial Disputes Act (LRIDA) codifies worker rights. There is a spectrum of
 independent national unions, some of which are associated with political parties.
 Jamaican law neither authorizes nor prohibits the right to strike, but unions and
 workers do strike. Striking workers can interrupt work without criminal liability
 but cannot be assured of keeping their jobs. Workers in 10 broad categories of "es-
 sential services" are prohibited from striking, a provision of the LRIDA which the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) has repeatedly condemned as overly inclu-
 sive. There was a major increase in strikes and other industrial actions by a wide
 variety of unions and professional associations in 1992. The announced layoff of
 8,000 government employees, and the erosion of real wages through inflation (which
 exceeded 100 per cent in one 12-month period in 1991-1992) were the most common
 reasons for industrial action.
 Jamaican unions maintain a wide variety of regional and international affili-
 ations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to organize and belong to labor unions, and LRIDA provisions include
 guidelines for labor, management, and government on issues such as organizing
 work sites, negotiating agreements, and conflict resolution. The Government rarely
 interferes with union organization efforts, and judicial and police authorities effec-
 tively enforce the LRIDA and other labor regulations. However, in 1992 the ILO
 once again criticized Jamaican labor laws for giving too much power to the Labor
 Minister and infringing on the workers' right to bargain collectively, in the latter
 case through excessive ballot requirements.
 Labor, management, and the Government remain firmly committed by law and
 in practice to collective bargaining in contract negotiations and conflict resolution,
 even in some nonunion settings. When labor and management fail to reach an
 agreement, cases may be referred to the Ministry of Labor for conciliation; when ne-
 gotiation and conciliation fail, parties to the dispute may agree (or, in cases affecting
 the national interest, the Labor Minister may decide) to refer the matter to an inde-
 pendent Industrial Disputes Tribunal (IDT). Any cases not resolved by the IDT pass
 to the civil courts. The LRIDA prohibits antiunion discrimination; for example, em-
 ployees may not be fired solely or union membership. This law has been effectively
 enforced. On the other hand, union affiliation may not be a prerequisite for employ-
 ment.
 Domestic labor laws apply in the 'free zones" (export processing zones); however,
 there are no unionized companies in any of Jamaica's free zones. Union organizers
 attribute this to resistance by foreign owners in the zones to organizing efforts.
 Wages and conditions within the free zones are set by management and are gen-
 
 
 440
 erally better than those in similar industries outside the zones. Before the April
 1992 reductions in the civil service, inspections of labor standards occurred every
 few months inside the free zones; in factories outside the zones, inspections often
 occurred only once a year. Since the reduction in force of the Labor Ministry
 through civil service la offs, however, no inspections of labor standards have oc-
 curred in any of the free zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution does not specifi-
 cally address the matter of forced or compulsory labor. However, Jamaica is a party
 to both ILO conventions which prohibit compulsory labor, and there have been no
 allegations that this practice exists in Jamaica.
 d. Minimum Ae for Employment of Children.-The Juvenile Act provides that
 children under the age of 12 years shall not be employed except by parents or
 guardians, and that such employment may be only in domestic, agricultural, or hor-
 ticultural work. Children under 12 years of age may not be employed at night or
 at industrial sites, but enforcement is erratic, and children under 12 can be seen
 peddling goods or services on city streets. There is no evidence of widespread illegal
 employment of children in other sectors of the economy. The Educational Act stipu-
 lates that all children aged 6 to 11 must attend elementary school. Industrial safety,
 police, and truant officers are charged with enforcement. Given the difficult eco-
 nomic circumstances of the past few years however, thousands of children were
 kept home for varying periods to help with housework and to keep expenses down.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In July the Government raised the minimum
 wage by an unprecedented 87 per cent, in an effort to keep pace with inflation of
 over 275 per cent since the previous increase. Although the legal minimum wage
 rate is widely considered inadequate, most salaried workers receive a living wage.
 Work over 40 hours per week or 8 hours per day must be compensated at overtime
 rates, according to the LRIDA. This provision is widely complied with, reducing the
 need for enforcement.
 The Labor Ministry's Industrial Safety Division enforces industrial health and
 safety standards- however, it is hampered by an inadequate number of inspectors.
 The standards themselves are extensive and include legal protection for workers
 who remove themselves from a workplace they believe to be unsafe. Industrial acci-
 dent rates were once again low in 1992. The Ministries of Labor, Finance, Public
 Service, and National Security are charged with enforcing labor laws and regula-
 tions; again, however the reduction of the public service by 8,000 positions had a
 grave impact on the ability of those Ministries to enforce the law.
