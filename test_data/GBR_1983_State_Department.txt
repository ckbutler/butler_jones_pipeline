 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 The United Kingdom (U.K.) is a constitutional monarchy, whose
 government takes the form of a multiparty, parliamentary
 democracy. Human rights are traditionally respected and
 zealously guarded, both by the British people and their elected
 governments.
 Human fights concerns in the United Kingdom are distinctly
 different depending upon whether the focus is on Great Britain
 (England, Scotland, and Wales), or on those activities related
 to Northern Ireland. In Great Britain, human rights practices
 are exemplary, with few, if any, demonstrated or alleged abuses
 by the Government or opposition. However, the long-established
 tradition of exemplary human rights practices has been much
 tested in Northern Ireland, and in matters directly affected by
 the Northern Irish situation in the rest of the Kingdom, where
 the British Government strives to combat the continuing
 terrorism and civil strife carried out against British
 officials and Protestant Loyalists by militant organizations
 demanding the forcible unification of Ireland, as well as less
 frequent acts of violence by both militant nationalists and
 loyalist groups against Catholics.
 The U.K. enjoys a highly developed industrialized economy with
 a mix of private and state-owned industries. Individuals may
 freely own property and pursue private economic interests under
 the law. The well-educated population benefits from a large
 and comprehensive social welfare program. Public policy.
 supported in some cases by legislation and in others by
 tradition, opposes discrimination on the basis of race,
 religion, sex, or political opinion.
 During 1983 there have been broad public discussion and review
 of existing and proposed laws and policies affecting human
 rights, including the Prevention of Terrorism Bill (repealing,
 re-enacting, and extending key provisions of the 1976
 Prevention of Terrorism Act); the Police and Criminal Evidence
 Bill (including proposals for increased powers of search and
 detention); and the Data Protection Bill (designed to protect
 individuals against the misuse of personal data stored in
 computers).
 Security is maintained by a civilian police force except in
 Northern Ireland, where British Army units supplement the
 police in an effort to maintain public safety against the
 background of a sharply divided society beset by terrorist
 violence.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 British Government sources report that during 1983 over 80
 persons lost their lives as a result of terrorist incidents
 related to the issue of Northern Ireland. All but six of the
 killings occurred in Northern Ireland itself. Over half the
 victims were civilians as, for example, in the highly
 publicized shooting in a Pentecostal Church in County Armagh,
 Northern Ireland and in the bombing of Harrod's Department
 Store in London just before Christmas.
 (1157)
 
 
 1158
 It is against British law and stated government policy for
 government forces to practice unlawful or arbitrary deprivation
 of life. Under the law, police may use such force as is
 reasonable in the prevention of crime. In this regard, human
 rights activists have expressed concern over two aspects of
 government practice in Northern Ireland. First, the use of
 plastic baton rounds by security forces for the purpose of riot
 control, to stun or temporarily disable, (authorized only as a
 last resort, when intense violence is directed against law
 enforcers) has already led to several deaths in recent years,
 in which some of the victims were children. After the
 Government declined to prosecute in any of the incidents, the
 National Council for Civil Liberties assisted in bringing a
 case based on these practices which is still pending before tbe
 European Commission on human rights. The Commission has
 referred the case to the British Government for a response;
 thus far, no further information is available on the status of
 the case. Concern has also been raised about fatal shootings,
 in separate incidents in November and December 1982, of one
 unarmed member of the Provisional Irish Republican Army and one
 unarmed member of the Irish National Liberation Army. Four
 officers of the Royal Ulster Constabulary have been charged
 with murder in the incidents.
 b. Disappearance
 British Government authorities do not abduct, secretly arrest,
 or hold persons in clandestine confinement, nor do they sponsor
 or condone such activities. During the reporting period, there
 were no allegations of disappearance sanctioned by the
 government in any of the component parts of the United Kingdom.
 Northern Ireland office sources report that during 1983 over 40
 persons were abducted, kidnapped or illegally detained by
 terrorists in incidents related to the issue of Northern
 Ireland.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The United Kingdom is a signatory to and has ratified the
 European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits the use of
 torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
 British domestic law forbids mistreatment or torture of
 prisoners, and provides penalties for such abuse. Confessions
 obtained by torture or any other inhuman or degrading treatment
 are not admissible as evidence in court.
 The British authorities do not practice deliberately cruel,
 inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment of prisoners.
 However, the Government itself acknowledges that British
 prisons, many of which were built during the nineteenth
 century, are unsatisfactory and overcrowded, with many
 prisoners spending the greater part of their days in cramped,
 unhygienic cells. In 1983, prisons in England and Wales,
 officially capable of holding roughly 39,000 persons, held
 close to 45,000. The Government is attempting to relieve the
 overcrowding by building new prispn, modernizing old ones, and
 releasing prisoners early. As part of the effort to assure
 proper treatment of prisoners, in 1983 the Inspectorate of
 Prisons proposed that Parliament establish a Code of Prisoners'
 Rights.
 
 
 1159
 There have been complaints about "strip searching" in Northern
 Ireland jails. Strip searching of prisoners is standard
 practice at all prisons in the U.K. other than "open prisons."
 (open prisons are minimum security facilities for persons
 serving short sentences for non-serious crimes.) At Armagh
 Prison, the searching had been relaxed until a smuggling
 incident caused prison officials to reintroduce it for
 prisoners leaving and returning to the prison for home visits
 or court appearances. In contrast, visitors to the prison,
 including government officials, are subject to a "rub down
 search," which involves an officer passing his or her hands
 over the visitor's clothing to detect hidden weapons. Despite
 allegations to the contrary, visitors to the prisons', unlike
 the prisoners themselves, are not subject to strip searches.
 As a rule, in questioning arrested persons, police are expected
 to comply with the Judges' Rules and Administrative Directions
 to the Police, except where superseded by the Northern Ireland
 (Emergency Provisions) Act of 1978 (see Section d below).
 These rules serve as guidelines only, and do not have the force
 of law.
 While police compliance with codes of behavior is generally
 good, in 1983 it was revealed that four prisoners in Birmingham
 had claimed that police tortured them by placing plastic bags
 over their heads and cutting off their air supply in order to
 obtain signed confessions. The allegations are currently under
 investigation.
 In 1983 the Police Federation (representing officers below the
 rank of superintendent), jointly with the Law Society, proposed
 the establishment of an Independent Police Complaints Board,
 with its own investigators, to examine all serious complaints
 of police violations of accepted standards of behavior.
 In response to a June 1978 report by Amnesty International
 calling for a public inquiry into alleged maltreatment of
 suspected terrorists in Northern Ireland, the British
 Government established an independent Committee of Inquiry
 (Bennett Committee). The Government accepted and implemented
 the Committee's Recommendations on Police Practices and
 Procedures, which include closed-circuit TV in interviewing
 rooms, greater access to counsel, and closer supervision of
 interrogators by their superiors. Allegation of RUC
 mistreatment of suspects in North6rn Ireland declined through
 1981. However, the 1983 Jellicoe Report documented an upward
 trend in such allegations in 1982.
 Prisoners convicted of crimes committed for allegedly political
 reasons are placed according to their crimes, rather than their
 motives. The Government has resisted attempts by convicted
 terrorists in Northern Ireland to achieve the status of
 political prisoners. These attempts included prison protests,
 sometime fatal hunger strikes, and complaints to the European
 Commission on Human Rights, which were dismissed. Some of
 these prisoners, convicted of offenses committed prior to 1976,
 had been accorded special category status (not the same as
 political status). This status, however, was phased out after
 November 1975.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 74
 
 
 1160
 In the United Kingdom the powers of arrest and detention are
 exercised in accordance with the law as set forth below. The
 United States Government is aware of no allegations in the
 reporting period that such powers were exercised arbitrarily.
 The Criminal Law Act of 1967 and the Criminal Law Act (Northern
 Ireland) of 1967, which applies similar provisions to Northern
 Ireland, empower a constable to arrest without warrant any
 person whom he, with reasonable cause, suspects has committed,
 is committing, or is about to commit what is, or what he
 reasonably suspects to be, an arrestable offense. Procedures
 for bail, judicial determination of the legality of detention,
 and suits for false imprisonment are routinely utilized in the
 United Kingdom.
 Except as noted below, anyone arrested without a warrant must
 be released on bail if he or she cannot be brought before a
 magistrate's court within 24 hours, unless the alleged offense
 is serious. If detained in custody the defendant must be
 brought before a magistrate's court as soon as practicable. In
 some cases, however, remand prisoners have been held for
 periods of up to eighteen months before trial.
 British common law allows for the abrogation of individual
 liberties by the executive in an emergency situation, subject
 to review by Parliament. Continuing violence in Northern
 Ireland has presented the Government with a serious problem of
 protecting the rights and safety of the province's population
 as a whole. Acting on the premise that the fundamental *right
 to life' was in serious jeopardy due to the troubles in
 Northern Ireland, the British Government adopted two acts to
 deal with the threat: The Northern Ireland (Emergency
 Provisions) Act of 1973, now amended and consolidated as the
 Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act of 1978, which is
 applicable only to Northern Ireland; and the Prevention of
 Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act of 1976, which is
 applicable to the entire United Kingdom. Although both these
 acts empower the restriction of personal liberties, they are
 subject to Parliamentary review and to mandatory renewal at
 frequent intervals--the 1978 Act at six month intervals and the
 1975 act at annual intervals. Both acts were renewed upon the
 occasion of their most recent review. Some groups have
 questioned the effectiveness of the review procedure, not so
 such on grounds of structure as of practical effect, since
 debate has taken place before a relatively small number of
 Members of Parliament and on occasion at an hour not conducive
 to major debate. A recent independent review of the 1976
 legislation by Lord Jellicoe confirmed that it had effectively
 reduced terrorism and'recommended that the powers contained in
 the Act be extended to combat international terrorism and not
 just that associated with Northern Ireland. The Jellicoe
 Report also recommended improved safeguards to minimize the
 risk of abuse, including a maximum life of the legislation
 beyond which'it would become lapse unless reenacted by
 Parliament. Lord Jellicoe's recommendations were subsequently
 incorporated into the new Prevention of Terrorism bill,
 introduced in Parliament in July 1983 and currently under
 debate. In May 1983, the Secretary ot State for Northern
 Ireland authorized Sir George Baker to begin an independent
 review of the 1978 Act. A report is expected in the Spring of
 1984.
 
 
 1161
 Under the 1978 Act the police in Northern Ireland are empowered
 to arrest without warrant any person suspected of being a
 terrorist, and to detain that person for up to 72 hours on
 their own authority. The 1978 Act also gives the police the
 power to arrest without warrant a person suspected of having
 committed, or being about to commit a "scheduled" offense
 (i.e., one listed on a schedule attached to the law). For the
 purpose of doing so, the police may enter and search without a
 warrant any premises or other place where that person is, or
 where the police suspect him of being.
 The Prevention of Terrorism Act of 1976 also gives the police
 the power to arrest without warrant persons anywhere in the
 country whom they reasonably suspect to be involved with
 terrorism. Under this act such persons may be detained for up
 to 48 hours after their arrest. The Secretary of State for
 Home Affairs, the Secretary of State for Scotland, and the
 Secretary of State for Northern Ireland may extend the period
 of 48 hours by a further period not exceeding five days. This
 power extends throughout the United Kingdom. Furthermore, as
 noted in the Jellicoe Report, officials have the power to
 detain not only persons suspected of involvement in terrorism,
 but also, in practice, persons from whom they wish to obtain
 information. Such detentions may extend up to a period of
 seven days.
 Under the 1978 Act, members of the armed forces on duty may
 arrest suspected terrorists without a warrant and hold them for
 up to four hours, after which they must be transferred to
 policy custody or released. There have been allegations that
 these limits have been exceeded by the police or the armed
 forces, but they cannot be substantiated. In Northern Ireland,
 the police have accepted the Bennett Committee recommendation
 that persons arrested under the provisions of the Terrorism Act
 and the Emergency Provisions Act have the right to access to a
 solicitor after 48 hours of detention. Human rights activists
 report that the 48 hour rule is not always followed, however.
 e. Denial of a Fair Public Trial
 In the United Kingdom, fair trial is guaranteed by law and
 observed in practice. All criminal proceedings are conducted
 in public, with the exception of cases involving public
 security; cases heard in the juvenile courts, from which the
 public, but not the press, is excluded; and cases in which, on
 the ground of public decency, the judge has discretion to close
 the court while evidence of a particularly intimate character
 is being given by a child or young person. In the trial of
 charges under the Official Secrets Act, the court can be closed
 only during the hearing of such parts of the trial as the
 judge, in his discretion, deems desirable; the sentence must
 always be passed in public.
 Cases related to Northern Ireland are often tried by a judge
 sitting alone, under legislation which decreed that terrorist
 offenses be tried in this manner. This form of criminal trial
 was introduced after the Diplock Committee, set up in 1972 to
 consider legal procedures to deal with terrorist activities in
 Northern Ireland, had recommended that, for scheduled offenses,
 trial by judge alone should take the place of trial by jury for
 the duration of the emergency. Among the arguments for this
 recommendation were that jurors were open to and afraid of
 
 
 1162
 intimidation or acts of physical violence against them, and
 that there was a continuing risk of perverse verdicts by
 partisan juries. Unlike other courts in the United Kingdom,
 the Diplock courts may admit in evidence statements made in
 custody by the accused, provided that such statements were not
 made as a result of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment.
 The absence of a jury and the ability to convict solely on the
 basis of confession have been the subjects of criticism. Some
 human rights activists see an increasing tendency to rely on
 confessions rather than the search for independent evidence of
 guilt or innocence. Critics also maintain that the conviction
 rates in the Diplock courts are unusually high. Judges in these
 courts must give written reasons for their decisions, which are
 made public. Defendants convicted in Diplock courts have an
 automatic right of appeal to the three-judge court of appeals
 (criminal), on any ground, against conviction of a sentence.
 During 1983 there was considerable public discussion over the
 increased use of evidence provided by terrorist informers
 ("supergrasses") in non-jury courts. Government officials
 state that the use of these informers has led to a marked
 reduction in the level of violence in Northern Ireland. While
 the evidence of an accomplice has always been admissible in UK
 courts, in non-jury courts the judge alone must decide whether
 the evidence of the "supergrass" is credible, bearing in mind
 the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of an
 accomplice. Critics assert that this places too great a burden
 of objectivity on a single individual, no matter how
 well-intentioned he or she may be. Critics also question
 whether the gains to security and public safety arising from
 the "supergrass" procedure outweigh the dangers to the
 credibility of judicial system in Northern Ireland. Moreover,
 there are indications that the system is becoming overburdened
 by the sheer number of these "supergrass" cases, with the
 result that defendants held on the basis of an informer's
 allegations could be kept on remand for long periods while
 awaiting trial. In trials conducted during 1982 and up to the
 autumn of 1983, 78 Republicans and 49 Loyalsits faced charges
 under the "supergrass" procedure, of whom 36 Republicans and 38
 Loyalists were convicted.
 The Criminal Law Jurisdictions Act, enacted by both the British
 Government (1975) and Irish Government (1976), permit trial in
 the Republic of Ireland, in Northern Ireland, or in Britain of
 those accused of certain terrorist offenses, regardless of
 where the offense was committed.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In Britain the distinction between public life and private
 life, in which the Government does not interfere, is a
 long-standing tradition. The right of privacy is well
 respected in the United Kingdom, though there is not yet a
 comprehensive body of laws and regulations concerning it. In
 1983 a number of significant developments occurred in this area.
 Both a Data Protection Bill, designed to protect individuals
 against misuses of personal data stored in computers, and a new
 Police and Criminal Evidence Bill gave rise to animated debate
 in Parliament in 1983. Human rights advocates there sought to
 ensure that the new laws would provide adequate protection from
 
 
 1163
 disclosure, search, and seizure of confidential records
 maintained by journalists, doctors, priests, social workers,
 and others. The Home Office undertook a review of its
 guidelines on the use of surveillance technology, as
 controversy arose over police use of hidden video cameras. The
 Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure recommended that a
 magistrate's warrant be required for such use, which presently
 can be authorized by police officials themselves. Police use
 of telephone tapping also came under fire in a case referred to
 the European Court of Human Rights in 1983.
 Warrants are generally required for the search of private
 premises.  However, under the Northern Ireland (Emergency
 Provisions) Act of 1978, in Northern Ireland any member of the
 armed forces on duty or any constable may enter any premises or
 other place, if he or she considers it necessary to do so in
 the course of operations for the preservation of peace or the
 maintenance of order. This provision was introduced in
 recognition of the practical difficulty of obtaining a warrant
 in certain situations involving terrorist incidents, but it has
 been criticized for allowing excessively broad powers of entry
 on mere suspicion of wrongdoing.
 The issue of prisoners' correspondence arose during 1983 when
 the European Court of Human Rights held that government
 interference with prisoners' personal correspondence between
 1972 and 1976 was a violation of the European Convention. In
 December 1981, the Government introduced revised regulations on
 prisoners' correspondence to achieve compliance with the
 Convention.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Personal liberty and freedom of speech are well established by
 British history, custom, and tradition.
 Some radio and television stations are state-owned, but
 represent viewpoints independent of the Government. The
 organization of the British Broadcasting Corporation is
 intended to preserve this independence. Newspapers and
 periodicals represent widely differing views and do not
 hesitate to criticize the Government.
 There is no Government intimidation or censorship of the media,
 or of foreign and domestic books and artistic works. However,
 on matters of national security falling under the Official
 Secrets Act, the Government may prevent the publication of
 certain materials.
 Self-policing by the media is practiced by such independent
 bodies as the British Board of Film Censors, operating under
 clear, published, apolitical guidelines. Moreover, under
 certain very restricted circumstances a court injunction may be
 obtained under civil law to prevent publication of particular
 items shown to be defamatory.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association are a part of the
 long established tradition of civil liberties in the United
 
 
 1164
 Kingdom. Except in cases of extreme civil disorders where
 public safety is judged to be at risk, the British authorities
 do not exercise their statutory right to limit individuals'
 freedom to attend public meetings of their choice. Neither is
 any limitation placed on individual freedom to join
 associations, including trade unions, with the exception of
 several avowedly terrorist organizations, such as the Irish
 National Liberation Army or the Provisional Irish Republican
 Army.
 British trade unions have full rights to organize, negotiate
 and strike on behalf of their own members. The Employment Act
 of 1980 does make unions liable under civil law for "sympathy"
 strikes, however. In the rare instance where the right to
 strike is prohibited, e.g., by police officers, there are other
 means to resolve labor differences.
 The Government does not control or influence unions and other
 associations, nor does it practice intimidation, harassment, or
 persecution, or limit in any way their freedom to maintain
 relations with recognized international bodies. However, in
 1983, there were some news reports stating that British
 businesses had set up an independent intelligence network
 designed to identify and ultimately to deny employment to
 militant union activists who had caused their employers
 problems in the past.
 The only significant exception to freedom of association in the
 United Kingdom arose in response to terrorist violence
 associated with Northern Ireland. The Prevention of Terrorism
 (Temporary Provisions) Act of 1976 and the Northern Ireland
 (Emergency Provisions) Act of 1978 include sections prohibiting
 membership in or support of organizations (Loyalist and
 Republican) which are involved in terrorism. These
 organizations are specifically listed in the Statutes. The
 lists do not include political parties, even those such as
 Provisional Sinn Fein with close links to tertorist
 organizations which carry out terrorist acts. Persons
 prosecuted under the 1978 Act are brought to trial in
 accordance with the trial procedures laid down by that Act.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 As a matter of Government policy and in general practice,
 everyone in Britain has religious freedom (in teaching,
 worship, and observance) without interference from the
 community or the state. Churches and religious societies may
 own property, conduct schools, and propagate their beliefs in
 speech and writing. There is no religious or denominational
 bar to the holding of public office except in the case of the
 sovereign, who must be a member of the Church of England. The
 sovereign's children must be raised in this church.
 England and Scotland both have established churches. The
 established church's relationship with the state is one of
 mutual obligation--privileges accorded to the church balanced
 by certain duties which it must fulfill. The sovereign must
 always be a member of the Church of England: Church of England
 archbishops, bishops, and deans are appointed by the sovereign
 on the advice of the Prime Minister; all clergy take an oath of
 
 
 1165
 allegiance to the Crown, and Parliament has the power to revise
 the Prayerbook of the Church of England. However, the state
 bakes no direct financial contribution to church expenses.
 The Church of Scotland, while deriving its status as a national
 :hurch from laws and treaties dating back to 1707, is
 zompletely self-governing both in spiritual and administrative
 matters. The Church of Ireland and the Church of England in
 ales have been disestablished.
 rhe existence of these established churches does not limit the
 freedom or access to public life of members of other churches.
 In Northern Ireland, the Constitution Act of 1973 specifically
 prohibits discrimination on the basis of religious belief or
 political opinion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 In general, citizens of the United Kingdom have freedom of
 movement within the country, foreign travel, emigration and
 repatriation. One exception to this general principle is
 contained in the Prevention of Terrorism Act of 1976. The Act
 gives the Home Secretary the authority to exclude or prevent
 from entering Great Britain (comprised of England, Scotland and
 Wales) anyone he believes may be connected with terrorism
 involving Northern Ireland, unless that person was born in
 Great Britain and has been ordinarily resident there, or has
 been ordinarily resident there for twenty years. Over 300
 people have been excluded under his provision, most of them
 from Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The
 Secretary of State for Northern Ireland also has the power to
 exclude people from that province on the same grounds, unless
 they were born and have been ordinarily resident in Northern
 Ireland, or have been ordinarily resident there for twenty
 years. In addition, the power exists to exclude from the
 United Kingdom any person who may be ordinarily resident in the
 United Kingdom, but who is not a United Kingdom citizen, who is
 involved in terrorism in relation to Northern Ireland. Once
 excluded from a region of the United Kingdom, the person is
 forbidden to reenter that area. These powers have been
 referred to by many, including the National Council for Civil
 Liberties, as a system of internal exile.
 With the 1983 entry into force of the British Nationality Act,
 a new category of British overseas citizens (i.e., citizens of
 the United Kingdom and the colonies who had no "close
 connection with the United Kingdom") lost some of the travel
 rights they had previously held as U.K. citizens, becoming
 subject to increased control over their freedom to enter and
 leave the country under the immigration rules.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 The United Kingdom is ruled by a Government formed on the basis
 of a majority of Parliamentary seats won in freely contested
 elections. Participation in the political process--discussion,
 debate, publication of dissenting opinions--is open to all
 persons and all parties, of which there are several,
 representing a broad range of political views.
 
 
 1166
 For Parliamentary and local elections, the franchise is given
 to all citizens 18 years of age and over who are not subject to
 any disqualification. Disqualified persons include peers,
 sentenced prisoners and mental incompetents. The right to
 citizenship itself was significantly affected by the British
 Nationality Act, which came into force on January 1, 1983.
 Under one of its provisions, the automatic, unchallengeable
 right to British nationality, previously accorded to virtually
 every child born in Britain, now extends only to those children
 born on British soil, of whom one parent has the right of
 permanent residence in the U.K. This provision has been
 criticized by immigrants' welfare groups as likely to leave
 many children born in Britain (of refugees, stateless persons,
 and transients) effectively stateless and deportable. The Act
 also affects the status of citizens of British dependent
 territories and former colonies.
 One anomaly resulting from the Act is that certain persons born
 in Northern Ireland, while not entitled to British citizenship,
 still hold Irish Republican Nationality under Irish law, and as
 such, under existing British laws still enjoy the rights of
 abode, the right to vote, and the right to hold office in
 Britain.
 Women have full rights of participation and are represented at
 all levels of British political life, but in relatively small
 numbers. Of 650 members of Parliament, for example, only 23,
 including the Prime Minister, are women. The Chief Women's
 Officers of both major political parties have complained of de
 facto discrimination against women within their respective
 parties.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The United Kingdom is a participant in several major
 international and regional human rights bodies, including the
 European Commission on Human Rights, the U.N..Human Rights
 Commission, and the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women.
 Its experts participate in the U.N. Subcommission on the
 Prevention of Discrimination and the Protection of Minorities,
 the U.N. Human Rights Committee, and the Working Group on
 Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances. In addition Britain is
 a party to major human rights conventions, such as the
 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial
 Discrimination. The British Government is an advocate of
 measures to further improve the human rights machinery of the
 United Nations.
 The British Government generally maintains an open attitude
 toward international inquiries into alleged violations of human
 rights in the United Kingdom. It cooperates fully with the
 European Commission on Human Rights in investigations of
 complaints and takes steps to rectify its own laws and policies
 when they are found not to be in conformity with the European
 Convention on Human Rights. However, a recent attempt by a
 European Parliament Committee to investigate the situation in
 Northern Ireland encountered government criticism as
 unwarranted interference in Britain's internal affairs.
 
 
 1167
 Britain is the host country to several international
 non-governmental human rights organizations, such as Amnesty
 International. Moreover, there are over 100 active national
 organizations in this field, which operate freely in London and
 throughout the country.
 Amnesty International's 1983 report expressed its concern that
 the so-called "Diplock courts" in Northern Ireland may not
 conform to international standards for a fair trial. Freedom
 House rates the United Kingdom "free," although it noted that a
 limited number of human rights violations have occurred in
 Northern Ireland as a result of a "severe security situation."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The United Kingdom has been a pioneer in the development of the
 welfare state. Its national health scheme provides
 comprehensive medical services to the entire population.
 British governments have given high priority to education and
 housing and to care for needy persons.
 In 1983, the population was 56,006,000 with a growth rate of
 0.1 percent. Life expectancy at birth in 1980 was 73.1 years.
 The infant mortality rate is 11.2 per 1,000 live births. The
 1981 per capita gross national product was about $8,000. The
 ratio of calorie supply available for consumption relative to
 nutritional requirements is roughly 133 percent,and virtually
 all of the population has access to safe water. The primary
 school enrollment ratio was 105 percent in 1978, and the adult
 literacy rate is 99 percent.
 By and large these advantages are well distributed among the
 population. It is acknowledged, however, that more needs to be
 done to eliminate economic and social disadvantages still
 suffered by women and members of ethnic minorities. A recent
 Home Office report states that despite the proscriptions of
 law, some de facto discrimination continues in the provision of
 goods and services.
 The Race Relations Act of 1976 bars discrimination on the basis
 of race, color, or national or ethnic origin in the provision
 of goods, facilities, and services, in employment, training,
 and related matters, and in education, housing, and
 advertising. A Commission for Racial Equality was established
 under the Act to work toward the elimination of discrimination
 and to promote equality of opportunity and good relations among
 different racial groups.
 The Commission has studied racial discrimination in housing
 allocation and made recommendations to public housing
 authorities. Other studies have documented a black
 unemployment rate that is nearly double that of whites, black
 over-representation in manual jobs, and racial discrimination
 in job recruitment. In 1983, the Commission proposed, and the
 Government accepted, a Code of Practice on Employment, slated
 to take effect in April 1984. Although the Code does not have
 the force of law, it can be used as a standard of good practice
 by industrial tribunals in racial discrimination cases and can
 serve as a guideline for firms in eliminating direct and
 indirect forms of discrimination.

 Equal status for women is provided in the Sex Discrimination
 Act of 1975 and the Sex Discrimination (Northern Ireland) Order
 of 1976. There is equal opportunity under the law for women in
 the professional fields and under the Equal Pay Acb of 1970
 (and corresponding legislation for Northern Ireland); women are
 entitled to equal pay with men for doing work that is the same
 or broadly similar. The Equal Opportunities Commission assists
 in the enforcement of these Acts. There is a separate
 Commission for Northern Ireland.
 Despite their legal rights to equal employment, however, in
 practice women have yet to achieve fully equal status in the
 United Kingdom. Roughly one-third of public bodies surveyed by
 the Equal Opportunities Commission contained no women at all.
 Although nearly half of all white-collar civil servants are
 women, the senior grades are less than five percent female,
 while three-quarters of the junior grades are occupied by
 women. Similarly, women hold three-quarters of Britain's
 lowest-paying jobs. The average female wage-earner takes home
 only three-quarters the pay of her male counterpart. In 1982,
 the European Court of Justice found that Britain had failed to
 institute a fair system of ensuring equal pay for equal work
 and ordered the U.K. to establish a means of requiring
 employers to introduce job classification systems on the basis
 of which equal pay claims could be adjudicated. Trade unions
 have complained of discrimination against women in occupational
 pension schemes, unemployment benefits, invalid care
 allowances, and housewives' non-contributory invalidity
 pensions.
 Coexisting with laws that guarantee equality, there are a
 number of provisions in British law that treat women
 unequally. For example, women do not enjoy the same rights as
 men to have foreign spouses join them in the United Kingdom.
 Other unequal laws concern taxes, pensions, and, in Scotland,
 the right to choose the location of the family home.
 On the other hand, progress toward women's equality is also
 visible. In November 1983, a rule change in the Social
 Security Benefit Payments System went into effect, allowing
 women to be treated as head of the household and to claim
 benefits in ways that only men could do so previously. A
 proposed Social Security bill giving men and women equal state
 pension rights was introduced in Parliament. Over twice as
 many women as men have been recruited into the civil service
 over the past few years, in what may be an attempt to redress
 previous imbalances.
 In Northern Ireland, there have been allegaticns over the years
 of differences in economic status and privileges of the
 Protestant and Catholic communities. The Protestant community
 is more prosperous and highly skilled, and controls much of the
 local economy. The unemployment rate in Northern Ireland is
 substantially higher than that of the United Kingdom as a
 whole. And this burden falls disproportionately on the
 Catholic population. The reasons for this are complex,
 involving a long history of discrimination by one community
 against another for the purpose of maintaining its
 traditionally dominant position. British government policy
 attempts to alleviate the problem by promoting equal
 opportunities, attracting more investment to the area, and
 subsidizing the economy through public sector spending.

 Since the 1969 unrest, and especially since 1972, when direct
 British rule was introduced in Northern Ireland, specific
 measures have been instituted to combat religious
 discrimination against Catholics that had existed previously in
 politics, housing, and employment. These measures included:
 institution of universal suffrage, along with proportional
 representation in place of single-member districts for local
 council elections, and abolition of voting limitations based on
 wealth or property ownership; prohibition of religious or
 political discrimination by any level of government;
 establishment of a Commissioner for Complaints to deal with
 grievances against local councils and public bodies and a
 Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration; establishment of
 a Central Housing Authority to meet the problem of sectarian
 discrimination in housing and allocation and launching of new
 housing projects; prohibition of discrimination in employment,
 and establishment of a Fair Employment Agency to promote
 equality of opportunity; establishment of a Standing Advisory
 Commission on Human Rights; and a special.effort to recruit
 more Catholics into the civil service and the police. While
 not disputing the value of these structures, critics are not
 satisfied with the results achieved to date. They point to
 slow progress in remedying historical imbalances, and in some
 cases question the resolve of those charged with implementation
 of the measures.
