 NAMIBIA
 The Republic of Namibia became independent on March 21, 1990,
 ending 74 years of South African rule. Its independence-
 supervised by the U.N. Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) and
 attended by many world leaders-marked the end of colonialism
 in Africa. The new nation of Namibia is a functioning
 multiparty, multiracial democracy. Its Constitution contains
 an entrenched bill of rights, which provides for freedom of
 speech, press, assembly, association, and religion. It also,
 provides for free presidential elections by secret ballot
 every 5 years, a two-term presidency, a bicameral parliament
 (the National Assembly), an independent judiciary, and
 abolition of the death penalty. Efforts at national
 reconciliation among Namibia's many racial, ethnic, and
 regional groups are being vigorously pursued.
 The South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) won
 Namibia's first free election in November 1989 with 57 per
 cent of the vote. The Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA),
 SWAPO's major opposition, and five other minor parties are
 also represented in the National Assembly, which selected the
 SWAPO leader, Sam Nujoma, as the country's first President.
 The SPAPO-led Government has one non-SWAPO member among its 16
 cabinet ministers. There were several key questions of
 government policy and organization still outstanding at the
 end of 1990, including the establishment of a second chamber
 in Parliament, regional and local elections, and land reform
 issues.
 The main security force is the Namibian Defense Force (NDF),
 which is comprised of former soldiers of the People's
 Liberation Army of Namibia (SWAPO's erstwhile military wing )
 and former members of the South West African Territorial Force
 (SWATF)--forces that fought each other in the years prior-to
 independence. A small police force assists in maintaining
 internal security. For a brief period in 1990, there was a
 special constabulary force composed of former SWAPO guerrillas
 charged with patrol and police responsibilities on the
 northern border. This special force was disbanded in August
 after it was charged with serious human rights violations, and
 its duties were taken over by the NDF. The President's
 November appointment of Major General Solomon "Jesus" Hawala,
 accused of torturing SWAPO detainees in Angola in past years,
 as army commander of the NDF created a storm of controversy
 and much discussion in Parliament, but he was confirmed by the
 National Assembly in December.
 The dominant feature of the Namibian economy is its dualism,
 with a modern market sector producing most of its wealth and a
 traditional subsistence agricultural sector (mainly in the
 north) supporting most of its labor force. The mainstays of
 the market sector are mining, ranching, and fishing, still
 mostly controlled by white Namibian businessmen. In 1990
 President Nujoma stressed the leading role of the private
 sector, and a new investment code was approved by the Cabinet
 and adopted by Parliament in December.
 Namibia had a generally favorable human rights record in
 1990. Much of the controversy over human rights centered on
 how to come to terms with abuses committed under the previous
 administration and by the SWAPO opposition. In 1990 the
 principal human rights issue was the accounting of missing
 detainees formerly held by SWAPO in Angola and by the former
 South African (SA) authorities in Namibia. Human rights
 
 
 262
 NAMIBIA
 organizations were especially active in keeping the issue
 alive, and, bowing to public pressures, Parliament established
 a committee to investigate the fate of missing persons, which
 could become a principal issue in the crucial regional
 elections and the formation of the second house of
 Parliament. In November a parliamentary committee suggested
 that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), in
 coordination with an eminent Namibian citizen, investigate the
 whereabouts of persons still unaccounted for after the end of
 the war. At the end of 1990 the ICRC had not received a
 formal request from the Namibian Government to do so, and no
 eminent person had been named. SWAPO repeatedly stated that
 it has released all former detainees, but the Government
 agreed to work with the parliamentary committee to account for
 the missing persons, estimated at between 250 and 600. Some
 former SWAPO and SA detainees began to seek compensation for
 past abuses through the judicial system.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reported political or extrajudicial killings in
 1990. In the only known instance of killing attributable to
 government forces, a case was brought in September against
 three NDF soldiers for a fatal shooting of a 13-year-old boy.
 The plainclothes soldiers were purportedly searching without
 authorization for a Baster Rehoboth district politician in his
 farm Rehoboth. As they drove up, they encountered a truck
 similar to that which belonged to the politician. The
 .soldiers opened fire on the truck and accidentally killed the
 boy. The three soldiers face murder charges and were cited
 for dereliction of duty by senior NDF officials. The shooting
 was publicly condemned by the Prime Minister.
 Several charges of politically motivated killings remained
 unresolved from 1989. Anton Lubowski, a senior white official
 of SWAPO, was shot outside his home by an unknown gunman in
 September 1989. A 54-year-old Irish national, Donald Acheson,
 who reportedly had links to a rightwing South African group
 suspected of other politically motivated crimes in South
 Africa, was arrested for the crime. The case never came to
 trial because South Africa would not, in the absence of a
 Namibia-South African extradition treaty, extradite South
 African citizens considered crucial witnesses in the case.
 Acheson was released in April.
 Another prominent case concerned the bombing of the UNTAG
 offices in Outjo (northern Namibia) prior to the 1989
 elections in which a local guard was killed. The three
 accused of the bombing escaped from police custody in early
 January and killed a policeman during the escape. The three
 fugitives also reportedly had links to South African rightwing
 groups, and two are believed to be in hiding in South Africa.
 The third turned himself in soon after the escape and awaited
 trial at year's end.
 David Calitz, a former member of South West Africa's (SWA)
 police counterinsurgency unit, Koevoet (Afrikaans for
 crowbar), was sentenced to 10 years in prison in January for
 beating a civilian to death in northern Namibia in December
 1987. Calitz's amnesty appeal, made under the South African
 
 
 263
 NAMIBIA
 Defense Act, was reportedly denied in January. He was allowed
 to serve his sentence in South Africa's Pollsmoor Prison, but
 in February he was reportedly freed with several others under
 the last South West Africa Administrator-General's amnesty
 program for certain former members of the SWA security forces.
 b. Disappearance
 Most, if not all, disappearances involved either- persons
 detained by SWAPO or those arrested and unaccounted for by the
 former South African authorities. From January to March 1990,
 the number of SWAPO detainees not accounted for was estimated
 to range from 256 to 541 but, by the end of the year, the
 number of detainees not accounted for ranged from 256 to
 1,400. The last list compiled in 1989 by the special ad hoc
 committee of the UNTAG-empowered to investigate the SWAPO
 detainee issue-identified 256 persons as still missing. The
 UNTAG committee also stated that during its investigation it
 could find "no evidence" that reported SWAPO torture camps-or
 dungeons existed in either Angola (near Lubango) or Zambia.
 The UNTAG investigation has been criticized by some local
 human rights groups, particularly the Namibian National
 Society for Human Rights (NSHR),and the Parents' Committee.
 The NSHR, in a October 3, 199G, press statement said that 541
 people remained unaccounted for. At the end of 1990, an NSHR
 press release alleged that over 1,400 Namibians were still
 being held in Angola, of whom the identities of 549 were known
 to NSHR. The disparity in numbers will continue until a full
 investigation by the Government is completed. Since the 1989
 UNTAG committee's report, no official follow-up investigations
 have been conducted. The NSHR continues to monitor the issue;
 its higher figure is a reflection of information received from
 friends and relatives of those missing.
 The NSHR claims that many detainees are still being held in
 Angola. Most of the SWAPO detainees were reportedly suspected
 and accused by SWAPO of being"South African spies." The
 SWAPO security service allegedly was responsible for torturing
 detainees. SWAPO has repeatedly stated that it is no longer
 holding anyone in detention, but in June, under parliamentary
 pressure, SWAPO agreed to.lead an all-party parliamentary-
 investigation into the outstanding allegations. The motion
 was proposed by the opposition, led by National Patriotic
 Front leader, Moses Katjiuongua, and backed by the Prime
 Minister. In October the Prime Minister, as chairman of the
 all-party parliamentary investigation committee, announced in
 the National Assembly that the Government would ask the ICRC
 and an eminent individual of unspecified nationality to lead
 an investigation into the missing persons issue. Parliament
 later referred the issue of identifying the eminent individual
 to the Chief Justice. By year's end no one had been named,
 and no request had been made to the ICRC.
 The whereabouts of people detained by the former South African
 (SA) administration in Namibia also remained unclear. U.N.
 Security Council Resolution 435 stipulated that the former SA
 authorities had to release all Namibian political prisoners
 and detainees. Previously, SA authorities had unlimited
 arrest and detention powers. The number of SA detainees
 fluctuated and releases were not always made public. However,
 according to a. recent NSHR report, the whereabouts and fate of
 59 people remained unknown.
 
 
 264
 NAMIBIA
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Since independence, there have been no allegations of torture
 or other inhuman treatment by police and military forces.
 Namibia's new police and defense forces are being trained by a
 British military assistance team. The new Government has made
 a concerted effort to emphasize the importance of human rights
 in the training process of both the police and military.
 Many of the legal actions brought by past detainees involve
 charges of torture, usually against SA authorities (see
 Section l.e.). However,'the most controversial charge raised
 in 1990 concerned one SWAPO military leader, Solomon "Jesus"
 Hawala, who has been accused by local human rights groups and
 opposition parties of torturing detainees in Angola. Charges
 against Hawala have not been proven in a court of law.
 However, his appointment as the new commander of the Namibian
 Defense Force produced strong protests from local and foreign
 human rights groups, Amnesty International, opposition
 leaders, and the usually SWAPO-aligned Council of Churches of
 Namibia (CCN).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Namibia's Constitution forbids arbitrary arrest or detention.
 According to the Constitution, persons who are arrested must
 be informed of the reason for their arrest "promptly in a
 language they understand," and they must be brought before a
 magistrate within 48 hours of their detention. A trial must
 take place within "a reasonable time" or the accused must be
 released. The accused is entitled to defense by a legal
 counsel of his choice; the State will provide a lawyer for the
 indigent. These rights and protections have been afforded in
 practice since independence.
 The President may "at a time of national disaster or a
 situation threatening the life of the nation or the
 constitutional order" declare a state of emergency. Such a
 declaration must be approved by the National Assembly by a
 two-thirds majority within 7 days, if the Assembly is sitting,
 or 30 days after publication of the declaration in the
 Government Gazette, if the Parliament is not in session.
 During a state of emergency, persons may be held in indefinite
 administrative detention but with mandatory review procedures.
 Even in a state of emergency, however, the right to a fair
 trial, and freedom of expression and speech are protected.
 Since the 1989 election process and independence, the most
 blatant abuse of authority involved the arbitrary arrests and
 detentions reportedly carried out by the "special constables,"
 the northern border auxiliary police force. The auxiliary
 police were former members of SWAPO's guerrilla forces
 excluded from the Namibian Defense Force for budgetary
 reasons. They were assigned border patrol and police duties
 in northern Namibia by the Ministry of Home Affairs. Repeated
 claims of harassment, arbitrary arrest, beatings, and
 detention of citizens were made against the special constables
 who had no formal police training and only rudimentary
 military training. Police officers reportedly could not
 control their behavior. The situation reached a crisis point
 when two South African tourists were reportedly detained and
 beaten on August 15. The auxiliary force was soon disbanded,
 and the Namibian Defense Force (NDF) was assigned northern
 border patrol responsibilities. A ministerial-level
 
 
 NAMIBIA
 commission was established to investigate allegations against
 the auxiliary police force, but it had not issued a public
 report by the end of the year. Reports from the north
 indicate that the security situation has significantly
 improved under the more disciplined NDF.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Namibia has an independent judiciary, and under the new
 Constitution all Namibian citizens have the right to a fair
 trial. Namibia has retained the Roman-Dutch court system 'it
 inherited from South Africa. There are three court levels:
 Magistrate, High, and the Supreme Court. The latter also
 serves as the court of appeals and as a constitutional review
 court. The new Supreme Court has also been tasked with
 hearing cases of persons who claim to have been tortured by
 former SA authorities.
 The tenure of judges is unaffected by changes in government.
 Parliament is still debating the-number of judges that will be
 required, and the jurisdiction, if any, of tribal courts.
 Traditionally, tribal courts have dealt with minor criminal
 offenses, such as petty theft and infractions of local
 customs. The Constitution guarantees that anyone claiming
 that his fundamental rights have been violated may seek
 redress in court and-approach the Ombudsman for free legal
 advice.
 In the postindependence period- no one was denied the right to
 a fair trial. The 1989 murder case of Immanuel Shifidi by six
 SA security force members at a political rally is in the
 process of being transferred to the Namibian Supreme Court
 from the former appellate court in Bloemfontein. Former South
 African State President P.W. Botha stopped the trial of the
 six security force members, and the case was later forwarded
 to the Bloemfontein Court of Appeals. It now falls under the
 purview of the new Namibian Supreme Court, and a decision is
 still pending as to whether the six should be remanded for
 trial.
 Reported crimes by former members of the South African Defense
 Force (SADF) and police forces came to trial in 1990. Three
 former members of the SADF were convicted in 1990 of raping a
 woman in May 1989. They received sentences of 7 years in
 prison, which were later reduced to 5.
 Redress for other alleged crimes by the SADF may hinge on the
 outcome of a landmark case brought before the'Namibian courts
 in September. In this case Israel Mwandingi is seeking
 redress for alleged crimes committed by the SADF, SWATF, or
 SWA Police in a 1987 shooting in Ongwediva, northern Namibia.
 Mwandingi wag shot in the back and claims that the assault was
 carried out by members of either SADF, SWATF, or SWA police.
 He originally brought the claim against the South African
 Minister of Defense. There are reportedly 20 such cases
 arising from past actions by the South African security
 forces. Most of these alleged crimes were committed in the
 north, and many are being handled by the Legal Assistance
 Center. If the decision goes in favor of Mwandingi, the
 Namibian Government and Ministry of Defense could end up
 paying substantial amounts in damages.
 
 
 266
 NAMIBIA
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Respect for privacy is safeguarded by the Constitution and was
 respected in practice in 1990. Arresting officers must have a
 warrant. Prior to independence, South African law enforcement
 officials had almost unlimited powers of search and seizure,
 as well as extensive powers of arrest and detention. In most
 cases these officials were given immunity from prosecution.
 SWAPO also had a security service (preindependence) that was
 reportedly responsible for the arrest of SWAPO members accused
 bf spying for South Africa.
 No evidence exists that electronic surveillance or
 interference with correspondence are conducted against
 Namibian citizens.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for these fundamental freedoms,
 including academic freedom in institutions of higher learning,
 and it states these rights may not be suspended in time of war
 or during a state of emergency. In practice, these freedoms
 have been respected since independence. Political parties of
 very different persuasions hold meetings and rallies in all
 parts of the country. There were no known instances of
 government interference with the press, human rights groups,
 political parties, or other public groups or gatherings, even
 when there was foreknowledge that through their activities
 they might criticize the Government and its policies.
 However, in August police warned the editor of The Namibian
 that she might be charged under the Protection of Information
 Act for printing secret information about an alleged coup
 conspiracy. The editor, whose office had just been bombed,
 refused to reveal to police-the source of her article.
 The sole provision of the Constitution that may limit speech
 is Article 23, which prohibits "the practice and ideology of
 apartheid." No postindependence case has tested this
 provision of the Constitution.
 All radio and television services are operated by the
 government-owned Namibian Broadcasting Corporation (NBC); a
 government-appointed board sets policy for the organization.
 The new NBC board is more broadly representative of the
 Namibian population than that of its predecessor, the South
 West African Broadcast Corporation, although it includes some
 holdover members. The NBC routinely gives prominent coverage
 to the activities of government officials, although it has
 begun to put more opposition spokespersons on the air.
 Print journalism in Namibia is free and vigorous. At present
 there are five daily, four weekly, and one semiweekly
 newspapers of general interest. At least three newspapers are
 owned by political parties. One daily (Windhoek Advertiser)
 and two weeklies (Windhoek Observer and Namibia Nachrichten)
 make reasonable claims of political independence. There was
 no apparent self-censorship by print media, aside from the
 constraints of libel laws (which impose stricter limits with
 regard to public figures than does U.S. law) and a general
 circumspection with regard to the person of the President.
 
 
 NAMIBIA
 b. Freedom of Assembly and Association
 The new Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 association. Various organizations, including political
 parties, held large meetings and gatherings during 1990
 without interference.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Even before independence, Namibians enjoyed total freedom of
 religion. Most Namibians are Christian; the single largest
 denomination is the Evangelical Lutheran Church (ELCIN).
 Roman Catholic, Anglican, Methodist, African Methodist
 Episcopal, and Dutch Reform churches are also active. The
 Jewish, Mormon, and Muslim communities are small. In contrast
 to the preindependence period, there are no travel
 restrictions on church leaders in independent Namibia.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Since independence, Namibians have enjoyed full freedom of
 movement and foreign travel. During and after the transition
 to independence, a total of 42,736 Namibian exiles (returnees)
 returned to the country as part of the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) repatriation program. The
 UNHCR ended its assistance program to Namibian returnees in
 June 1990. Many returnees have been absorbed into mainstream
 Namibian life. Some development organizations are assisting
 those who have not established a new life for themselves.
 Several voluntary resettlement communities for returnees were
 being established in the north.
 Namibia plans to sign the U.N. Convention and Protocal
 Pertaining to Refugees and did not engage in any forced
 repatriations. At the end of 1990 the Government had not
 developed a policy on asylum seekers and reviewed each request
 on a case-by-case basis. As a'result, the status of a few
 persons, all Africans, remained undecided. Some are being
 held in Windhoek prison, others are given unofficial temporary
 residence with the proviso that they should make plans to
 leave the country as soon as possible. Officials of the Legal
 Assistance Center (see Section 4) regularly visit them. Two
 Burundi citizens, who requested political asylum in April,
 were eventually accepted by Canada.
 In August the Government repatriated from East Germany 100
 children (reportedly dependents of SWAPO detainees) who had
 been sent there in 1989.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens have the right to change their government.
 Nonracial, universal, multiparty elections were held in
 Namibia from November 7 to 11, 1989, and were certified as
 "free and fair" by the United Nations Special Representative.
 Over 97 percent of Namibia's 700,000 registered voters turned
 out to cast their vote. (Namibia's population is
 approximately 1.5 million.)
 The Constitution establishes a bicameral parliament, the
 National Assembly, and calls for free general elections by
 secret ballot every 5 years and regional elections every 2
 years. In 1990 only the lower house was functioning. At
 
 
 268
 NAMIBIA
 year's end, a date for crucial regional elections, which will
 provide representation for the large number of tribal and
 other groupings (see Section 5), had not been set. Regional
 elections, which could be held in 1991 or early in 1992, will
 determine the number of representatives to the second chamber,
 the National Council. Nothing outside the constitutional
 provision calling for the establishment of the National
 Council within "two years of independence" mandates its
 formation by a certain date. According to the Constitution,
 the National Council will include two representatives from
 each electoral region. An all-party parliamentary
 delimitation committee is in the process of deciding how many
 electoral regions the country will have. According to the
 Constitution, Namibia's President may serve only two 5-year
 terms.
 There are seven political parties presently represented in the
 Namibian National Assembly. The SWAPO-led Government has 41
 of the 72 seats in Parliament, and the DTA, the major
 opposition party, holds 21 seats. The DTA, together with the
 other non-SWAPO parties in Parliament (the United Democratic
 Front, four representatives; the Action Christian National
 Party, three representatives; and the Namibia National Front,
 National Patriotic Front, and Federal Convention of Namibia,
 one representative each) can block constitutional changes,
 which require a two-thirds majority.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Several local human rights organizations operate freely in
 Namibia. Local organizations such as the National Society for
 Human Rights (NSHR), the Parents' Committee, and the Legal
 Assistance Center (LAC), operate openly, and in 1990 they
 criticized the new Government's handling of the SWAPO detainee
 issue and other matters. Unlike the Parents' Committee and
 the LAC, which existed before independence, the NSHR is a new,
 private Namibian human rights organization, established in
 early 1990. Like the Parents' Committee, its principal focus
 is the SWAPO detainee issue and accounting for persons who
 disappeared while in custody under the previous Government.
 Along with the Parents' Committee, it reports frequently on
 the status of the missing detainees. The LAC is highly
 regarded for its assistance, especially to indigent
 defendants. The LAC also follows the SWAPO detainee issue and
 handled some cases filed in 1990 concerning alleged past
 crimes by former SA authorities.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Namibian Constitution prohibits discrimination based on
 race, creed, sex, or religion. However, from the long years
 of South African administration, racial and ethnic
 discrimination has been built into society to the same extent
 as in South Africa in such important areas as education and
 medical services which, prior to independence, were
 administered for the 12 ethnic groups by 13 "second-tier
 authorities." In 1988, for example, the white second tier
 authority representing about 6 percent of the population had a
 budget of about $22 million, while the Ovambo authority,
 representing almost 50 percent of the population, had a budget
 of only about $330,000. The 13 second-tier authorities
 coincided generally but not precisely with the ethnic groups:
 
 
 NAMIBIA
 Ovambo, whites, Damara, Herero, Kavango, Nama, colored (mixed
 race), Kaokovelder, Bushmen, Rehoboth Baster, Caprivian, and
 Tswana. The second-tier administrations were abolished by
 Parliament immediately after independence. The education and
 health sectors are being restructured to eliminate previous
 discriminatory practices. The new Government has replaced the
 administrators of the second-tier authorities with regional
 commissioners, and regional elections are scheduled to be held
 in 1991. An all-party parliamentary delimitation committee is
 working to divide the country into electoral regions in an
 effort to diffuse ethnic voting patterns and establish the
 second chamber of Parliament, the National Council.
 Despite constitutional protections, discrimination against
 women, stemming from pervasive cultural and traditional
 practices of all races, persists. Women's rights are
 guaranteed by the Constitution, but in practice, inequality in-
 the law, employment, and educational opportunities still
 exist. Several women's groups are working to change these
 inequalities to ensure that constitutional guarantees for
 women are put into practice. For instance, under community
 property laws married women of all groups may not legally
 acquire or purchase property or enter into a legal contract
 without the signature and consent of the husband. Any
 property brought into a marriage by a woman is transferred to
 the ownership of her husband, who has the authority to decide
 its disposition without her consent. A woman is considered a
 ward of her father until she marries; then she becomes a ward
 of her husband. The law also does not compel men to provide
 economic support for their children in case of divorce.
 Therefore, single and divorced mothers often have financial
 difficulties. There are no social assistance programs for
 indigent mothers, but several developmental and international
 organizations are now focusing on this issue.
 There is also discrimination against women in education and
 employment. This is not the result of Government policy but
 of traditional practices. Women are not barred from pursuing
 higher education but tend to be directed to certain
 educational fields and areas of employment, such as clerical
 and secretarial work, teaching, and domestic service. Women
 are not encouraged to study technical or scientific
 disciplines. However, with a revamping of the country's
 educational system, this systemic issue is also being
 addressed. Several organizations such as the Women's Council,
 Namibian Women's Voice, and Women of Namibia focus on women's
 rights issues.   Each political party also has a women's
 branch. The President has stated he is committed to improving
 the status of women and has appointed several women to high-
 level positions, including the post of Minister of Local
 Government and Housing.
 Violence against women is reportedly widespread, particularly
 wife beating and rape. The courts treat cases of wife beating
 as assaults, but because of traditional attitudes regarding
 the subordination of women, most such cases do not reach the
 courts. Some cases of wife beating are not reported. Others,
 which are brought to the attention of the police, are
 .reportedly dismissed as frivolous, and the alleged perpetrator
 is not charged. Women's groups and other women's rights
 advocates contend that rape and wife beating are not taken
 seriously by police, claiming that police prefer not to
 interfere in domestic disputes and that prosecutions of and
 convictions for rape are the exception. In 1990 three former
 members of the South African army were convicted in Windhoek
 
 
 270
 NAMIBIA
 Supreme Court of raping an Owambo-speaking women in May 1989.
 The men received a 7-year sentence, later reduced to 5 years.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Namibia's Constitution provides for the right of association,
 and in practice persons are free to form and join labor unions
 without previous authorization. Unions are independent of
 government and have the right to form federations and
 confederations. The right to associate is entrenched and may
 not be revoked during a state of emergency. The principal
 trade union organization is the SWAPO-aligned federation, the
 National Union of Namibian Workers (NUNW) which claims a
 membership of 60,000 to 70,000, organized into 6 trade unions,
 out of a formal sector work force of 200,000. About 70
 percent (mostly black) of all workers in the mining industry,
 the largest private sector employer, are union members. The
 country's 20,000 to 30,000 farm workers, mostly employed on
 white-owned farms, remain unorganized.
 Labor issues and politics are linked in Namibia. Many black
 union leaders are also SWAPO officials, serving in Parliament
 or other government positions. Recently, however, the senior
 leadership of the labor movement has called on people to
 choose between the movement and public office. For the most
 part, the trade union movement backed SWAPO in the November
 1989 elections.
 Namibian workers, except civil servants, enjoy and exercise
 the right to strike. In 1990 some public and private workers
 continued to strike over pay and other issues. Workers often
 stopped work in 1990 before observing all the required steps
 for the settlement of disputes which are mandated by the Civil
 Affairs and Manpower Employment Code, and which is a carryover
 from the previous administration. Until a new labor code is
 adopted, employers have the right to dismiss legally or
 illegally striking employees, and in the past have done so
 with relative impunity. Currently there is no machinery for
 appealing such dismissals.
 South West Africa/Namibia has been a member of the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) since 1978. SWAPO was
 recognized by the ILO and had observer status. Trade unions
 are free to exchange visits with foreign trade unions and to
 affiliate with international trade union organizations. The
 NUNW is affiliated with the Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity, the British and Canadian Trade Union Congress,
 the Congress of South African Trade Unions, and with the
 Communist-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions. The
 NUNW indicated that it would review its membership with
 affiliated organizations at its June 1991 congress.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 In 1985 the Namibian Supreme Court recognized the right of
 collective bargaining without intervention by other government
 agencies. Collective bargaining is not widely practiced;
 wages are set by the companies. The Conciliation Board is the
 only legal recourse for workers in the case of wage disputes.
 A proposed new labor code, being drafted by the labor movement
 with input from the ILO and the LAC, seeks to lay down minimal
 standards, conforming with international labor practices, and

 guarantee employees the right to bargain individually or
 collectively.
 Until it is adopted, labor-management disputes are still
 resolved through the Conciliation Board process under the Wage
 and Industrial Conciliation Ordinance of 1952. In February
 the National Building Workers' Union used the Conciliation
 Board process to win wage increases of 40 to 93 percent and
 periodic wage rate reviews. When labor and management are far
 apart, however, as in the wage dispute at year's end between
 the mineworkers' union and the Tsumeb Corporation, the
 Conciliation.Board process often fails to produce results.
 The current law does not prohibit antiunion discrimination by
 employers against union members and organizers. For the most
 part, the Conciliation Board has been used for labor union
 wage disputes and on occasion working conditions and overtime
 hours. Employers do not have to recognize a union and may
 dismiss members and organizers if they wish. Legally,
 antiunion discrimination is not an issue that may be brought
 to the Conciliation Board.
 There are no export or offshore processing zones or facilities
 in Namibia.
 p. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is prohibited by law, but there is no mechanism
 for enforcing the prohibition. The implementation of the
 United Nations independence plan threw additional light on
 labor practices in the white farming sector. Reports by
 former SWAPO fighters, who were released from a police-run
 farm in September 1989, indicated that conditions which
 purportedly amounted to forced labor existed prior to
 independence. Illiterate and isolated farm workers received
 little or no compensation for labor, could not leave the farm
 without the owner's permission, and were forbidden to speak
 with outsiders. There were also some reports that farm
 workers were subject to physical punishment by their
 employers. In one court case in September 1989, evidence
 given by witnesses revealed that workers on one farm were
 being paid as little as 30 cents a day. The workers resorted
 to poaching game to feed their families. Overall working
 conditions in the farming sector remained a problem in 1990.
 In some cases, what amounts to slave labor is still being
 practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment is 15 years. Age regulations
 are generally enforced in the wage sector pursuant to section
 12 of the Employment Act of 1986. However, children below the
 age of 15 often work on family and commercial farms and in the
 informal sector.
 There is no mechanism for enforcing the Employment Act of
 1986. In the past inspectors from the offices of Civil
 Affairs and Manpower would visit companies if a complaint were
 lodged. Today, for the most part, companies claim they follow
 the rules outlined in the Employment Act, but there is no
 regular or consistent official monitoring of labor practices.

 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no statutory minimum wage law in Namibia. An
 unskilled worker in the mining sector earns an average of $275
 a month. Nonwhite skilled employees earn less than their
 white counterparts doing the same job or whites performing
 unskilled tasks. For example, a December press release by the
 NSHR and December press reports in The Windhoek Observer claim
 that SWAWEK, the national power company, and the First
 National Development Corporation are engaged in discriminatory
 wage practices. NSHR claims that the entry level salary for
 white security guards at SWAWEK is $800 per month, while for a
 nonwhite security guard salaries begin at $280. Overall,
 unskilled workers can expect a basic monthly salary of $140.
 This is not enough to maintain a decent standard of living for
 a worker or his family. The cost of living is high in Namibia
 and, for the most part, the nonwhite population is living much
 below the standard of the white population. The Government is
 doing as much as possible to correct these historical
 inequalities.
 The standard legal workweek is 46 hours (which the proposed
 new labor code would reduce to 45 hours). If the employee
 freely agrees, up to 10 hours of overtime per week is allowed
 at time-and-a-third pay. The law also mandates annual and
 sick leave (including maternity leave). Most employees are
 entitled to 21 calendar days of leave per year. Legally, more
 than 10 hours per week of overtime has to be approved by the
 Government. However, in practice, during the preindependence
 period these provisions were not widely observed or enforced
 and continue to be neglected since independence.
 Government-mandated occupational health and safety standards
 exist, but enforcement by the Ministry of Labor is weak.
 However, the Government is prosecuting the Tsumeb Corporation
 Limited, one of the country's largest mining companies, on
 charges of negligence in connection with a devastating flood
 in 1988, which killed eight miners and nearly destroyed the
 mine. Improved safety conditions remained a strong union
 demand in all sectors, particularly mining.
