 CANADA
 Canada is a constitutional monarchy with a federal
 parliamentary form of government. Representatives in the
 multiparty political system are elected by universal suffrage
 at local, Provincial, and Federal levels. Government
 responsibilities are defined by a national Constitution
 subject to interpretation by an independent judiciary.
 Federal and Provincial election mandates last a maximum of 5
 years. Elections are completely free and often result in a
 changeover of power to opposition parties.
 Canada has an open economic system that encourages private
 ownership, investment, and entrepreneurship.
 National and local law enforcement are carried out by Federal,
 Provincial, and municipal police forces. Canada's armed
 forces are under the authority of the elected civilian
 government and have no role in domestic law enforcement except
 in extreme circumstances under the War Measures Act (last
 invoked in 1970 during the terrorist kidnapings in Quebec).
 The Charter of Rights and Freedoms, added to Canada's revised
 Constitution in 1982, guarantees fundamental individual rights
 and freedoms to-everyone in Canada. Government and private
 organizations work actively to ensure that these rights are
 respected in practice at all levels of society. Canada is a
 leader in actively promoting respect for human rights around
 the world.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no politically motivated killings in 1986.
 However, police arrested a number of Canadian Sikhs for
 alleged involvement in terrorist activities, and authorities
 believe that Armenian terrorists also remain active in Canada.
 b. Disappearance
 Secret arrest, clandestine detention, and politically
 motivated disappearances did not occur.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 These abuses are prohibited by law, and none was reported
 during 1986. Prison conditions are generally good.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Canadian law prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment, and
 this prohibition is respected in practice.
 The Federal Government may enforce the War Measures Act and
 the Official Secrets Act in exceptional circumstances to
 override certain constitutional guarantees. In the event of
 war or peacetime crisis, the War Measures Act of 1914,
 augmented by a 1981 Federal Cabinet order, permits the Federal
 Parliament to declare a state of national emergency with
 suspension of certain basic civil liberties. The 1939

 CANADA
 Official Secrets Act prohibits the private possession,
 distribution, and publication of information deemed
 prejudicial to the interests of the state and provides that
 individuals under suspicion may be arrested
 without a warrant.
 Canada prohibits the use of any form of forced labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In criminal trials Canadian.law provides for a presumption of
 innocence of the defendant until proven guilty, as well as the
 right to a public trial and full rights to counsel. Free
 counsel is provided to indigents. The Official Secrets Act
 allows for trials under its provisions to be held in secret
 with certain presumptions in favor of the state. Prosecutions
 under this statute are extremely rare, and convictions hard to
 maintain on appeal.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Federal and Provincial Governments do-not interfere with the
 basic rights of individuals except when there is a reasonable
 basis for presuming that an individual is involved in criminal
 activity. Police officials face judicial penalties if they
 abuse a person's-privacy without first obtaining a search
 warrant.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are guaranteed by the Constitution
 and respected in practice. Laws prohibiting certain forms of
 hate literature and pornography, provincial film censorship
 boards, and legislation which specifically protects language
 and cultural rights are the sole exceptions to these
 freedoms. Two persons were convicted in 1985 under provincial
 statutes prohibiting promotion of race hatred. Both cases
 generated widespread publicity, and the convictions remain
 under appeal to higher courts.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is guaranteed.
 Workers in both the public and private sectors have the right
 to organize, associate freely, bargain collectively, and
 strike. In practice, certain groups of essential public
 sector employees have limited collective bargaining rights and
 are not allowed to strike. All labor unions have full access
 to mediation, arbitration, and the judicial system. In 1985
 and 1986 the International Labor Organization censured four
 provinces for restricting the bargaining rights of public
 sector workers. The offending legislation has been removed in
 the province of Ontario, but no action to change legislation
 has yet been taken by the Governments of Alberta, British
 Columbia, or Newfoundland.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is complete freedom of religion.

 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within or outside
 Canada, including the right of emigration and repatriation.
 Canada is a haven for many refugees and displaced persons.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Canada is governed by Federal and Provincial Governments that
 are genuinely elected by the Canadian people through universal
 suffrage. Legislative elections must be held at least every 5
 years and voter participation rates are high. The Governor
 General is Queen Elizabeth II's representative as Head of
 State. Power is exercised in practice by the Prime Minister
 and the Cabinet, who usually are elected members of the
 282-seat House of Commons. Three politically diverse parties
 are represented in the Commons, and several others function at
 the Provincial level. All Provinces and Territories have
 similar freely elected legislatures.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigations of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Canada actively promotes human rights in international forums,
 and the Federal Government encourages nongovernmental
 organizations to pursue investigations of human rights abuses
 throughout the world. The Canadian Human Rights Commission
 and its Provincial counterparts investigate and resolve
 complaints of discrimination in public and private sector
 activities under governmental jurisdiction.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Article 15 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees
 equal benefits and protection of the law regardless of race,
 national or ethnic origin, color, religion, sex, age, or
 mental or physical disability. Those rights are respected in
 practice.
 Food, shelter, health care, and education are available to all
 inhabitants regardless of race, religion, sex, ethnic
 background, or political opinion.
 Women participate freely in Canadian society. Women's rights
 are overseen by a Federal Cabinet minister responsible for the
 status of women and by the Federal and Provincial human rights
 commissions.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Labor standards vary from province to province, but all
 guarantee a sufficient minimum wage and limit the standard
 workweek to 40 or 48 hours. Federal and Provincial
 legislation ensure that working conditions are not hazardous
 for employees. Child labor legislation also differs among the
 provinces. The Federal Government generally prohibits those
 under 17 years of age from working for the Federal Government
 while school is in session. Provinces generally prohibit
 those under age 15 or 16 from working without parental consent,
 working in any hazardous employment, or working at night.
