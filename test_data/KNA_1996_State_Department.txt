 ST. KTrS AND NEVIS
 St. Kitts and Nevis is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy and a member of
 the Commonwealth of Nations. The Constitution provides the smaller island of
 Nevis considerable self-government, as well as the right to secede from the Federa-
 tion in accordance with certain enumerated procedures. A Prime Minister, a Cabi-
 net, and a bicameral Legislative Assembly comprise the Government. A Governor
 General, appointed by the British Monarch, is the titular head of state, with largely
 ceremonal powers. After national elections in June 1995, Dr. Denzil Douglas of the
 St. Kitts and Nevis Labour Party became Prime Minister and formed a government
 with 7 of 11 seats in the legislature. The judiciary is independent.
 Security forces consist of a small police force, which includes a 50-person Special
 Services Unit that receives some light infantry training, and a small coast guard.
 The mixed economy is based on sugar cane, tourism, and light industry. Most
 commercial enterprises are privately owned, but the sugar industry (the country's
 largest economic enterprise) and 85 percent of arable land are owned by a state cor-
 poration.Per capita gross domestic product was about $3,500 in 1994.
 Human rights were generally respected, although the Government continued to
 restrict access by the opposition to government-controlled media. Violence against
 women is a problem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no political or other
 extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Law enforcement authorities abide by the constitutional prohibitions against the use
 of torture or other forms of inhuman or degrading treatment or punishiment. Family
 members, attorneys, and clergy are permitted to visit detainees regularly.
 St. Kitt's prison was built in the 1830's. Prisoners suffer from severe overcrowd-
 ing, poor food, and lax security. These conditions have contributed to riots in the
 past, although none occurred in 1996.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention, and this provision is respected in practice. The law requires that
 persons detained be brought before a court within 48 hours. There were no reported
 cases of exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides that every person ac-
 cused of a crime must receive a fair, speedy, and public trial, and these requim-
 ments are generally observed.
 The judiciary is highly regarded and independent. The court system comprises one
 high court and four magistrates' courts at the local level, with the right of appeal
 to the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States Court of Appeal. Final appeal may
 be made to the Privy Council in the United Kingdom. There are no military or polit-
 ical courts. Legal assistance is available for indigent defendants.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-There
 were no reports of arbitrary government or police interference in the private lives
 of individuals. The law requires judicially issued warrants to search private homes.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and, for the most part, the authorities respected these provisions in
 ~ractie. Xowever, the Government owns the only radio and television station on St.
 tts, and these media generally did not adequately publicize rallies and conven-
 tions held by the op position political party. There is a religious television station
 and a rivately owned radio station on Nevis.
 St. Kitts and Nevis does not have a daily newspaper, each of the major political
 parties publishes a weekly or biweekly newspaper. A third weekly newspaper is
 nonpartisan. The papers are free to criticize the Government and do so regularly
 and vigorously. The nonpartisan paper claims that politicians both in opposition and
 the Government have threatened to close it down; however, the paper recently cele-
 brated its second anniversary without interruption of its publication. International
 news publications are readily available.
 The Government does not restrict academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly. Political parties organized demonstrations, rallies,
 
 
 and public meetings during the 1995 election campaign without significant govern-
 ment interference. Many meetings sponsored by the Nevis Island administration
 and opposition, arties were held in Nevis to discuss the secession question.
 c. Freedomo Religion.-The Constitution provides for the free exercise of religion,
 and religious practices are not restricted. All groups are free to maintain links with
 coreligionists in other countries.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not restrict travel within or departure from the
 O formal government policy toward reftgee or asylum requests exists. The issue
 of provision of first asylum did not arise. There were no reports of forced expulsion
 of anyone having a valid claim to refugee status; however, government practice re-
 mains undefined.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens are free to change their government by peaceful means. A vigorous
 multiparty political system exists in which political parties are free to conduct their
 activities. Periodic elections are held in which all citizens 18 years of age and older
 may register and vote by secret ballot.
 he Legislative Assembly has 11 elected seats; 8 for St. Kitts and 3 for Nevis.
 In the June 1995 elections, Dr. Denzil Douglas' St. Kitts and Nevis Labour Party
 won seven of eight seats at stake in St. Kitts with 60 percent of the popular vote,
 and Douglas became Prime Minister. The People's Action Movement (PAM), the
 former ruling party, took only one seat, but received 40 percent of the vote. The
 Concerned Citizens Movement won two of the three Nevis seats; the Nevis Reforma-
 tion Party won the remaining one. The island of Nevis has considerable self-govern-
 ment and its own legislature.
 In accordance with its rights under the Constitution, the Nevis Island Assembly
 in July initiated steps towards secession from the Federation when a bill of seces-
 sion passed unanimously on irst reading. On second readin in November, however,
 two opposition members abstained and the bill failed to obtain the required two-
 thirds majority of the five-seat Assembly. The bill would have authorized drafting
 a new constitution and, after a 6-month period to allow the citizenry time to debate,
 the holding of a Nevis-wide referendum. The secession referendum would require
 two-thirds of the votes cast on Nevis in favor for secession to be ratified. All parties
 involved have been following constitutional procedures, and no acts of violence have
 been recorded in connection with the secession question.
 Although the Constitution prhibits discrimination on grounds of political opinion
 or affiiation, the opposition PAM alleges widespread employment discrimination by
 the St. Kitts Labour Party against public sector employment of persons perceived
 to be opposition supporters. PAM alleges that the ruling party dismissed or demoted
 many PAM supporters from their jobs in order to replace them with its own sup-
 porters. A government official confirmed that opposition members of Parliament
 voted out of oice and entitled to pension benefits did not receive those payments.
 There are no impediments in law or in practice to the participation of women in
 leadership roles in government or political parties. St. Kitts and Nevis' sole female
 member of Pariament chose not to run             o in the June 1995 elections,
 and there were no other female candidates. However, women do hold such high gov-
 ernment offices as permanent secretary and are active withi the political parties.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vest igation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While there are no governmental restrictions, no local human rights groups have
 been formed. There were no requests for investigations or visits by international
 human rights groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cido Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on grounds of race, placeiof origin, birth
 out of wedlock, political opinion or affiliation, color, sex, or creed, and the Govern-
 ment generally respocts these provisions in practice.
 Women.-6The role of women in soiety is not restricted by law but is cir-
 cumcribed by culture and tradition. According to a government official, violence
 against women is a problem, but many women are reluctant to file complaints or
 pursue them in the courts. Despite this reluctance, there were publicly reported
 cases of both domestic violence and rape, and a few convictions. A special police unit
 works closely with the Ministry of Women's Affairs to investigate domestic violence
 and rape cases.
 
 
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's rights and welfare and has
 incorporated most of the provisions of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the
 Child into domestic legislation.
 People With Disabilities.-Although there is no legislation to protect the disabled
 or to mandate accessibility for them, the Government and the Constitution prohibit
 discrimination in employment, education, and other state services.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of all work-
 ers to form and belong to trade unions. The law permits the police, civil service, and
 other organizations to have associations which serve as unions. The major labor
 union, the St. Kitts Trades and Labour Union, is affiliated with the St. Kitts and
 Nevis Labour Party and is active in all sectors of the economy. There is also an
 independent teachers' union, a union representing dockworkers in the capital city,
 and two taxi drivers' associations.
 The right to strike, while not specified by law, is well established and respected
 in practice. There were no major strikes. Unions are free to form federations or con-
 federations and to affiliate with international organizations.
 The islands' unions maintain a variety of international ties. St. Kitts and Nevig
 became a member of the International Labor Organization in June and assumed all
 its obligations for enforcement of labor standards.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Labor unions are free to orga-
 nize and to negotiate for better wages and benefits for union members. The law pro-
 hibits antiunion discrimination but does not require employers found guilty to rehire
 employees fired due to antiunion discrimination. However, the employer must pay
 lost wages and arrange for severance pay. There is no legislation governing the or-
 ganization and representation of workers, and employers are not legally bound to
 recognize a union, but in practice employers do so if a majority of workers polled
 wish to organize. Collective bargaining takes place on a workplace by workplace
 basis, not industrywide. The Labour Commission mediates all types of disputes be-
 tween labor and management on an ad hoc basis. In practice, however, few disputes
 actually go to the Commission for resolution. If neither the Commission nor the
 Minister of Labour can resolve the dispute, legislation allows for a case to be
 brought before a civil court.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution forbids slavery
 and forced labor, and they do not occur in practice.  ,
 d. Minimum Age for Em      ment of Children.-The minimum legal working age
 is 14 years. The Labour Minitry relies heavily on school truant officers and the
 community affairs division to monitor compliance, which they do effectively. Local
 law mandates compulsory education up to the age of 16.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.- A 1984 law, updated in 1994, establishes mini-
 mum wage rates for various categories of workers, such as domestic servants, retail
 employees, casino workers, and skilled workers. The minimum wage varies from
 $56.18 (EC$ 150) per week for full-time domestic workers to $74.91 (EC$ 200) per
 week for skilled workers. These provide an adequate, though Spartan, living for a
 wage earner and family; many workers supplement wages by keeping small animals
 such as goats and chickens. The Labour Commission undertakes regular wage in-
 spections and special investigations when it receives complaints; it requires employ-
 ers found in violation to pay back wages.
 The law provides for a 40-q to a-hour workweek, but the common practice is 40
 hours in 5 days. Although not required by law, workers receive at least one 24-hour
 rest period per week. The law provides that workers receive a minimum annual va-
 cation of 14 working days. While there are no specific health and safety regulations,
 the Factories Law provides general health and safety guidance to Labour Ministry
 inspectors. The Labour Commissioner settles disputes over safety conditions. Work-
 ers have the right to report unsafe work environments without jeopardy to contin-
 ued employment; inspectors then investigate such claims.
