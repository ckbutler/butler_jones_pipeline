 MONGOLIA
 In January 1992, the legislature approved a new Constitution which codified Mon-
 golia's transition from a highly centralized Communist state to a multiparty democ-
 racy. The new Constitution established Mongolia as a sovereign republic, provided
 a broad range of rights and freedoms, retained the offices of President and Prime
 Minister, and restructured the legislative branch of government into a unicameral
 State Great Hural (SGH) of 76 members. The Prime Minister and the Cabinet are
 nominated by the President and approved by the SGH. Continuing the positive
 trend of the previous 3 years, Mongolia in 1993 took further steps to consolidate its
 fledgling democracy and to enhance the protection of human rights.
 In the preliminaries to the June 1993 presidential election, the Mongolian Peo-
 ple's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) withdrew its support for then incumbent Presi-
 dent Ohirbat and supported the candidacy of MPRP news aper editor Tudev. The
 Mongolian National Democratic Party (MNDP) and the Social Democratic Party
 (SDP), along with other opposition parties, formed a coalition to support Ochirbat a
 candidacy.   is first-ever democratic presidential election in Mongolia's history,
 held on June 6, 1993, was monitored by international observers, who judged it open
 and fairly contested. Ochirbat won with 57.8 percent of the popular vote; some 92.7
 percent of eligible voters participated in the election.
 The state security apparatus--now a department responsible to the Cabinet-con-
 tinues to redefine its role in Mongolia's post-Communist society. A State Security
 Law enacted in 1992 establishes SGH control and supervision of the Department
 of State Security (DSS) and its budget, presidential control of policy, and govern-
 ment oversight of daily activities, with the State Procurator also overseeing the
 legal aspects of security operations. However, the new law also provides the Depart-
 ment a special right to conduct surveillance in order to carry out its duties and es-
 tablishes the presence of security representatives in all public enterprises. There
 have been some reports of police using excess force in dealing with those suspected
 or accused of criminal activity.
 Despite increasing industrialization and urbanization, a large portion of the popu-
 lation is engaged in agriculture, with an emphasis on livestock raising and associ-
 ated light industry. After decades of nearly total dependency on the former Soviet
 Union Mongolia is increasing its foreign trade with other countries and making the
 difficult transition to a market economy. The new Constitution lays the legal
 groundwork for this transition by establishing the right to private ownership of
 property and to conduct private commercial activity. However, these efforts have
 een handicapped by a severe foreign exchange shortage and a general economic
 slowdown.
 The new Constitution establishes the basis for continued significant progress in
 most human rights categories. It forbids discrimination of any sort and clearly es-
 tablishes freedom of speech and press, assembly, and the right of citizens to change
 their government. This year the SGH considered severl laws concerning basic
 rights enumerated in the Constitution, including emigration, labor relations, and re-
 ligion.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There has been no evidence of such
 killing in recent years.
 bi   sappearance.-There were no known instances of politically motivated abduc-
 tions or disappearances in recent years.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 According to the new Constitution, "no person shall be subjected to torture, inhu-
 man, cruel, or degrading treatment." There have been no reports that torture or
 other such treatment or punishment has been practiced in the recent past.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-There were no confirmed reports of arbi-
 trary arrest, detention, or exile.
 Under the new Constitution, no person shall be searched, arrested, detained, or
 deprived of liberty except by law. A person arrested for committing a crime, his fam-
 ily, and his legslcounsel are to be notified of the reasons for the arrest within a
 period of time established by law. A number of new procedural laws have been
 passed, but Mongolia's Legal Code has not been completely revised. Until that revi-
 
 
 sion is complete, the existing Legal Code remains in force. That Code permits police
 to arrest those in the act of committing a crime and hold them for up to 72 hours
 without a warrant. For incarcerations of longer duration, or when the actual crime
 was not witnessed, a warrant must be issued by a prosecutor. Prosecutors are ap-
 pointed by the State Prosecutor for a 5-year term. The State Prosecutor was ap-
 pointed by the former (pre-SGH) Great People's Hural for a 5-year term.
 Under the existing Legal Code, a person in detention has no statutory right to
 see an attorney, and defense attorneys have been routinely denied access to their
 clients prior to trial. The new Constitution, however, provides for the right to legal
 assistance upon request but does not provide for free legal counsel for the indigent.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The new Constitution provides the right to a fair
 trial, legal assistance, appeal of a court judgment, and request for pardon.
 The new Constitution also provides for a number of structural changes in the
 court system that have not yet been implemented. The Supreme Court is the high-
 est judicial body, while the Constitutional Court has sole authority to interpret the
 Constitution.
 While the Supreme and Constitutional Courts are now functioning, further re-
 structuring of the court system must await enactment of implementing legislation
 by the SGH. In the intenim, the existing three-level ourt system remains in oper-
 ation. The local (or "people's") courts handle most routine criminal and civil cases
 such as assault, petty larceny, traffic accidents, and liability disputes. Provincial
 courts hear serious cases such as murder, rape, grand larceny, official corruption,
 and security cases. Provincial courts also review local court decisions. The Supreme
 Court serves as an appeals court for the people's and prvincial courts. To date the
 Supreme Court has rarely overturned the verdicts of the lower courts. Supreme
 Court judges were appointed by the former Great People's Hural for 4-year terms.
 Lower court judges were appointed by provincial hurals, also for 4-year terms. Cur-
 rent civil and criminal codes provide for the right of the accused to judicial process,
 a legal defense, and public trial "except as stipulated by law." Closed proceedings
 are permitted in cases involving crimes against the State, rape cases involving mi-
 nors, and particularly brutal murders. Witnesses are usually required to appear at
 trials, but written testimony is sometimes accepted instead. The accused must an-
 swer all questions put to him by the prosecutor.
 Under the provisions of a 1993 law on the judicial system, the formerly separate
 military justice and railway court systems have been abolished. All legal actions are
 now considered by a single unified national court system.
 In the past the courtshave been nominally independent, but in reality were close-
 ly controlled by the MPRP. Since the 1990 revolution, there has been a comprehen-
 sive review of the Legal Code and the structure of the judiciary in order to establish
 a legal system which will conform to international standards. The new Constitution
 stipulates that the judiciary will be independent and strictly guided by law; it re-
 mains to be seen how this stipulation will be implemented.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 right to privacy of Mongolian citizens their families, correspondence, and homes is
 provided for in the new Constitution. bespite political reforms and reductions in the
 apparatus of government, however, the Government, under old regulations still in
 force, retains the authority to exercise control over individual activity. Warrants
 must be issued by a prosecutor before persons or premises may be searched.
 According to the 1992 State Security Law, the DSS, despite internal reforms, still
 reserves the right to use special surveillance methods (e.g., wiretaps) in order "to
 carry out its duties." No information is available on the extent of these practices,
 but the authority of the DSS seems significantly less than what it was before the
 1990 democratic revolution.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech, press, and "expression of
 opinion" is provided for in the new Constitution and is now widely respected in prac-
 tice, although some limits remain. Lively debate covering a broad range of political,
 economic, and social topics continued in 1993. Newspapers are able to publish and
 circulate freely. However, except for those newspapers which were able to import
 newsprint directly or obtain it as a gift, newsprint shortages prevented most news-
 papers from a ppearing regularly. The Government controls the allocation of news-
 print imported through official trade, and opposition parties and other publishers
 continued to allege that limitations on the quantities of newsprint effectively pre-
 vented them from publishing as frequently as the MPRP newspaper, Unen.
 A new "independent" but government-financed television company was formed in
 mid-1992 and now broadcasts 30 hours of programming a week. Government-owned
 
 
 Mongolian radio and television remain the only national broadcast systems. Al-
 though both the opposition and the Government at times have criticizedMongolian
 television's coverage, it regularly broadcasts the views of opposition parties as well
 as those of the Government, and its news programs are generally considered bal-
 anced.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The new Constitution provides
 for freedom of peaceful assembly. Demonstrations-including hunger strikes-over
 various issues, mainly protesting government economic policies, were held through-
 out 1993 without interference by the authorities. Although permits are required for
 demonstrations, this requirement is not enforced. The new Constitution also grants
 the right to form a political party or other public organizations and to unite volun-
 tarily in associations according to social interests or convictions.
 c. Freedom of Religin.-The new Constitution provides for the right both to "wor-
 ship and nonworship;" there is no state religion. The Constitution explicitly provides
 for the separation of church and state. Freedom of religion is respected in practice.
 On December 10, a new law on religious activity went into force. This law placed
 limits on religious expression and explicitly favored Buddhism, Islam, and
 shamanism. However, on January 12, 1994, the Constitutional Court declared those
 provisions of the law unconstitutional.
 Muslims, Buddhists, and Christians all practice their faiths without government
 interference. The Association of Mongolian Religious People, formed in 1990, contin-
 ued to function freely. The Government has not interfered with the activities of
 Christian and other missionaries, and proselytizing is permitted. However, a Min-
 istry of Education announcement stipulates that, because the new Constitution re-
 quires that education be kept separate from religion, foreign language teaching
 must not be used as a means of conducting missionary activity.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The new Constitution provides Mongolians the right to move freely
 within the country, choose their residence, travel and reside abroad, and return to
 Mongolia. The right to travel abroad may, however, be limited by law in order to
 ensure national security and protect public order. At least some Mongolians are re-
 quired to surrender their assports upon completion of foreign travel and must re-
 ?uest their return for furthier use. Mongolia does not receive many refugees, but a
 ?ew who have come from China's province of Inner Mongolia have been accepted for
 resettlement.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The 1992 Constitution provides citizens the right to change their government
 through periodic, free elections with universal suffrage. President Ochirbat, sup-
 ported by a coalition of opposition parties, won a second term in June in Mongolia's
 first open presidential election.
 The Constitution establishes the unicameral Statc Great Hural (SGH) as the su-
 preme organ of government. Its 76 members are elected by direct, secret ballot for
 4-year terms. The SGH has the right to set the date of SGH and presidential elec-
 tions and can remove the President. The President of Mongolia serves as Head of
 State and is elected to a 4-year term (with a limit of two terms) by national secret
 ballot. The Government has a 4-year mandate and is nominated by the party that
 wins a majority in the SGH. The SGH, in consultation with the President, will con-
 tinue to elect the Prime Minister and approve his Cabinet.
 There are no legal impediments to the participation of women in government and
 politics. According to the new Constitution, "men and women shall be equal in polit-
 ical and economic fields...." In 1991 women constituted about 30 percent of the
 MPRP membership. Three women were elected to the SGH in June 1992.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A local human rights group, the Mongolirn Human Rights Committee, was
 formed in 1990. There are no known impediments to its ability to monitor and re-
 port on human rights developments. The Government has cooperated with inter-
 national nongovernmental human rights organizations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The new Constitution provides that "...no person shall be discriminated against
 on the basis of ethnic origin, language, race, age, sex, social origin, or status..." and
 that "...men and women shall be equal in political, economic, social, cultural fields,
 and family affairs."
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 There appears to be little discrimination in education on the basis of race, sex,
 or religion.
 Women.-According to government statistics, the percentage of women in the
 work force was 51.3 percent in 1992. Women formed about half-of trade union mem-
 bership and also hold high professional positions in such institutions as the courts,
 schools, research centers, and hospitals. By law and in practice, women receive
 equal pay for equal work. Women are, however, virtually absent from the highest
 ranks of government and the professions.
 There is little historical information about the extent of domestic violence, includ-
 ing spousal and child abuse. Only recently has the issue surfaced in the media;
 many believe that the incidence of such violence is growing as more and more fami-
 lies are confronted by economic and social dislocations, including unemployment and
 alcohol.
 Children.-The Government believes that the growing number of orphaned and
 abandoned children is becoming a serious national problem that requires additional
 government action. Mongolia's National Children's Center has been relocated in the
 Ministry of Social Welfare and Labor, which is helping to prepare new legislation
 on child rotection. A few group shelters have been established for abandoned and
 street chldren.
 People with Disabilities. -People with disabilities have formed several groups to
 represent their interests. Under p resent law, government benefits vary according to
 the degree of disability. Those who have been disabled in industrial accidents have
 the right to be reemployed when ready to resume work. The Government also pro-
 vides tax benefits to enterprises which employ the disabled and some firms do so
 exclusively. No legislation mandates access for the handicapped.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The right of association for professional associations
 and trade unions is provided for in the new Constitution. The charter of the Mongo-
 lian Trade Unions Confederation (MTUC) provides for the unionization ofpolice and
 military personnel. Although at present neither group belongs to the federation,
 their affiliation is under consideration. The MTUC represents some 400,000 Mongo-
 lian workers.
 Union officials are elected by secret ballot.
 There are no arbitrary restrictions on who may be a union official. Union mem-
 bers, other than civil servants and essential service workers have the right to
 strike, and several strikes took place during the year. Essentiaf services employees
 are those critical for national defense and safety, including the police, employees of
 power plants, water works, public transportation, and public communications, and
 certain railway employees.
 Most unions in Mongolia are currently affiliated with the MTUC, which formerly
 was a part of the MPRP. The MTUC separated from the party during the 1990 revo-
 lution, and its charter now states that all unions have the right to leave it should
 they so desire. The MTUC also maintains there is no requirement for new unions
 to register with it or with any government body. The MTUC is apparently no longer
 an instrument of government control. According to the Constitution, no political par-
 ties can be directly represented in the workplace. During 1990 a new union move-
 ment called "The Association of Free Trade Unions" (AFTU) emerged. It includes
 some 70 unions. In 1992 another new union organization, called "Blue Mongolia,"
 came into existence with approximately 40,000 members. Although the AFTU still
 functions, Blue Mongolia no longer appears to be active.
 The new Constitution places no restrictions on the political activity of unions or
 union officials. There is no statutory prohibition against unions forming federations
 or joining international bodies. Mongolian unions, formerly affiliated exclusively
 with international Communist organizations, are broadening their contacts with
 Western labor movements. The MTUC in 1993 sent representatives to various Inter-
 national Labor Organization, International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, and
 specialized federation meetings in Japan, Singapore, Thailand, Hong Kong, the Phil-
 ippines, Israel, and Taiwan.
 'b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Although amendments to the
 existing Labor Law passed in early 1993 provide for collective bargaining, there are
 so far no known instances of such agements. Wage setting is an issue still in flux.
 According to the MTUC, wages and other work-related issues are supposed to be
 decided in tripartite contract. negotiations between the enterprises, the Government,
 and unions. The Government's role is to be limited to making sure that the contract
 meets legal requirements, e.g., hours of work and safety conditions. In practice,
 wages usually set by the employer alone, whether that employer is a private enter-
 prise or the Government itself. Virtually all enterprises have been privatized, in-
 
 
 702
 cluding manufactured and service industries. The Government, however, in addition
 to employing its own ministry officials and teachers, also owns the communications
 systems, mines, airlines, and other organizations. Where the Government acts as
 employer, it sets the wages, although the MTUC member unions are trying to carve
 out a role in it for themselves, e.g, as when the teachers in late 1992 struck for
 higher wages. However, the unionstave not yet established a formal role.
 The Labor Law prohibits antiunion discrimination. According to the law, an em-
 ployer must show work-related cause and must obtain the union's approval to fire
 a union official who is an employee. The courts have the right to order reinstate-
 ment. In practice, in the several known instances of union officials who were faced
 with dismissal, the matter was resolved and the official continued working without
 resort to court intervention.
 Export processing zones do not exist in Mongolia.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is spe-
 cifically prohibited by law. However, students are frequently mobilized to help farm-
 ers harvest their crops. In 1993 about 9,000 of the 30,000 university students par-
 ticipated in the harvest, while the others paid a fine equivalent to about $5 to avoid
 such labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law prohibits children under
 the age of 16 from working, with the exception of those aged 14 and 15 if allowed
 by the local trade union committee and given permission by their parents. Those
 under 18 are statutorily prohibited from working at night, from doing arduous work,
 or from working in dangerous areas such as mining or construction. Enforcement
 of these prohibitions, as well as all other labor regu ations, is the responsibility of
 state labor inspectors assigned to regional and local offices. These inspectors visit
 workplaces and have the authority to order and, reportedly, compel immediate com-
 pliance with labor regulations.
 Prior to 1991 child employment was banned by the Constitution, and no statistics
 were kept on such employment. However, in 1991 the Government created the Na-
 tional Commission for Children. The Commission, under the Ministry of Labor, is
 responsible for verifying the extent and condition of child labor. As a first step, the
 Commission requested basic information from Mongolian firms, and its staff also
 visited businesses to obtain data. At the end of the year, firms had still not re-
 sponded to the Commission's 1992 request for data on child labor. No alternate
 source of data on child labor appears to exist. In the rural areas, there appears to
 have been a noticeable drop in school attendance by school-age children. Part of this
 drop is undoubtedly due to problems faced by rural schools (primarily lack of heat),
 but part is due to some children having been withdrawn to work in the newly
 privatized herds.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The government-established minimum wage
 applies to all workers. The minimum wage was raised in June 1993 to $0.03 per
 hour (approximately 11 tugriks at December 1993 exchange rates) and again in De-
 cember 1993 to around $0.065 (25.74 tugriks). Few workers, however, make only the
 minimum wage; most salaried positions pay three or four times that rate. The mini-
 mum wage has not been indexed to reflect the serious inflation of the past 3 years.
 While it is difficult to determine what portion of the work force is paid at the mini-
 mum wage, this wage, together with subsidies provided workers, appears to provide
 an adequate standard of living, although that is endangered by continuing inflation.
 The Labor Law sets 46 hours as the standard workweek, and establishes a mini-
 mum rest period of 42 hours between workweeks. For those under 18 the standard
 workweek is 36 hours: overtime is forbidden by law, except in case of national emer-
 gency or natural disaster, such as an earthquake or floods, and then only with the
 concurrence of the local labor union.
 Both government and organized labor recognize the importance of worker health
 and safety issues, but no specific laws on these topics have yet been presented to
 the SGH. At present, the Labor Law, the Cooperatives Law, and the Enterprise Law
 provide occupational safety and health standards, and the Ministry of Labor sets ad-
 ditional standards. These standards are enforced by the Government with the help
 of the trade unions; violators may be fined and imprisoned. There were no reported
 incidences of such punishments levied in 1993. According to the Labor Code, work-
 ers do have the right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations and still
 retain their jobs. The Labor Inspector Force (37 investigators) has taken action
 even to close factories if the building involved does not meet minimal health and
 safety regulations. Nonetheless, given Mongolia's near total reliance on outmoded
 machinery and continuing problems with spare parts and maintenance, accidents
 are frequent. In the past year, over 300 workers were reportedly killed in industrial
 accidents.
