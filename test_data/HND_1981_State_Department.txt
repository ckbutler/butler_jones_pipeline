 HONDURAS
 In July 1980, Honduras ended seven and a half years of
 direct military rule with the inauguration of a popularly
 elected constituent assembly. The country completed
 this transitional political process with general elections
 on November 29, 1981, in which a president, congress
 and local officials were selected. The Liberal Party
 candidate, Roberto Suazo, was elected president. The
 present provisional government was installed in July
 1980, composed of representatives from both major parties
 and the military. It is scheduled to turn over power
 to the newly-elected constitutional government in January
 1982. During its tenure, the constituent assembly drafted
 a new constitution and electoral law, under whose provisions
 the new administration -- the first freely elected government
 in a decade -- was chosen.
 Honduras experienced an increase in internationally inspired
 terrorism in 1981, mostly in the form of kidnappingd
 and bank robberies aimed at financing violent revolutipnary
 activities. In the two most prominent kidnapping cases,
 the Honduran businessmen in question were released after
 payment of ransom. An avowedly Marxist group also took
 credit for the attempted assasination in September, 1981,
 of a group of unarmed United States military personnel
 driving to work in Tegucigalpa. Finally, in November
 and December of 1981, the government uncovered three
 major arms caches and an underground "people's prison"
 which, according to information from captured terrorists
 who were former Sandinista Army members, formed part
 of a plan to increase revolutionary violence in Honduras.
 Honduras is a developing country with serious economic
 and social problems -- illiteracy, poverty, malnutrition
 and inadequate health care. Government revenues are
 not adequate to alleviate these symptoms of under-development.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 There were no verifiable reports of torture during 1981,
 although some prisoners held in connection with politically
 motivated crimes alledged that they were tortured during
 the investigative interrogation process. Torture is
 specifically prohibited by the Honduran constitution
 and by criminal legislation.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punish-
 ment
 There were reports during 1981 of summary executions
 by the police of habitual criminals and accused terrorists.
 The government has denied these allegations. The press
 continues to report freely on frequent allegations of
 mistreatment by local police. The use of unnecessary
 force and brutality during the arrest process is often
 alleged. Members of the police are subject to dismissal
 for abuses against the public, a sanction reportedly
 applied frequently during 1981. No figures covering
 those dismissed have been published.  With few exceptions,
 jail conditions are poor. Access to prisoners is generally
 not a problem for relatives, attorneys, consular officials
 
 (465)
 
 
 466
 or international humanitarian organizations. On occasion,
 press visits are allowed.
 c. Disappearances
 There have been reports of as many as 60 mysterious dis-
 appearances during 1981. Disappearances have previously
 occurred only rarely in Honduras. The government has
 denied allegations of security service involvement in
 these reported disappearances.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Legal guarantees against arbitrary arrest or imprisonment,
 are generally observed, although the administration of
 justice is hindered by an overburdened and inadequately
 financed court system.
 There are no verifiable reports of political prisoners
 in Honduras. Habeas corpus is guaranteed by the consti-
 tution, and Honduran law provides for arraignment within
 24 hours of arrest. This appears to be the standarcl
 practice, although hearings are often delayed due to
 administrative backlogs. When there is reasonable indi-
 cation of an offense, Honduran legal procedures permit
 the judge to hold a person for up to six days for ques-
 tioning before determining if formal charges are warranted.
 If the judge determines there is sufficient evidence,
 charges are specified in a court order. The individual
 may then be held pending further investigation. Bail
 is allowed in many cases. Extremely lenient bail provisions
 and penalties for such crimes as airplane hijacking,
 drug trafficking, and kidnapping have led to efforts
 to reform and modernize the Honduran penal code.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Efficient application of justice suffers from a lack
 of tenure for judges, an outdated legal code and a chronic
 shortage of funds. Access to legal services usually
 varies with the socio-economic standing of the litigant.
 Inordinately long delays are frequently encountered in
 the administration of justice, and the system is overbur-
 dened. With all of its problems, the judiciary does
 act, and it maintains substantial independence from the
 executive and the military.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Sanctity of the home is guaranteed by the constitution
 and generally observed.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of speech, press, religion and assembly is respected.
 There is no censorship of the media, although books and
 other materials are sometimes confiscated from travelers
 returning from communist countries. These confiscations
 are often vigorously denounced in the press.
 Restrictions imposed since 1972 on freedom of assembly
 for political parties were lifted in early 1980, and
 party activities have since continued without interference.
 A number of small radical groups, including the Honduran
 
 
 467
 Communist Party, exist and are tolerated. The revised
 electoral law passed in 1981 was an effort to encourage
 all political groups to participate in the electoral
 process, and has made access to the ballot easier. Student,
 worker, peasant and other interest groups have full freedom
 to organize and hold frequent public demonstrations without
 interference.
 The Honduran populace is among the most organized in
 Central America, with strong labor, cooperative and sectoral
 movements. The Honduran press conducts a lively national
 debate free of government control. In spite of occasional
 government expressions of annoyance, the media criticizes
 both government programs and civilian and military govern-
 meht leaders frequently and freely. No incident of official
 interference with the media has been recorded for several
 years.
 Honduras has a long tradition of effective and delaocratic
 trade union activities. The labor movement is well organized
 and has a history of service to its constituency. Trade
 unions are not hampered by the government and provide,
 members with advisory services, health benefits and housing
 benefits. Although unions are guaranteed the right to
 organize and bargain, Honduras' labor code includes a
 cumbersome procedure of negotiation and arbitration before
 a union can strike legally. Some strikes have been declared
 illegal because unions have not followed these procedures.
 Subsequent agreements generally render these declarations
 of illegality moot.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 These rights are respected in Honduras. Previously exis-
 ting restrictions on travel to and from El Salvador were
 lifted in 1981 in the aftermath of a peace treaty between
 the two countries, signed in December 1980. Starting
 in 1980, Salvadorans began seeking refuge in Honduras
 from the conflict in El Salvador. By the end of 1981,
 the number- of such refugees receiving UNHCR assistance
 in Honduras had leveled off at about 18,000. Because
 of a number of incidents on the Salvador/Honduras border
 affecting the refugees, the Honduran government is giving
 full support to plans by the UNHCR to move all Salvadoran
 refugees to a secure location further inland where refugees
 will be easier to protect and care for. At year's end,
 3000 Salvadoran refugees had been moved to the new site,
 with the expectation that all of them shall have been
 transferred early in 1982. Honduran authorities have
 responded well and generously to these refugees' needs,
 despite the remoteness and poverty of the region, and
 they have facilitated the work of local and international
 relief agencies. There have been frequent allegations,
 however, that Honduran military authorities have permitted
 Salvadoran military or paramilitary forces to cross the
 border to abduct refugees sheltered in Honduras. In
 another refugee area, as the year ended, there was a
 sharp surge in Miskito Indians seeking refuge from Nicaragua's
 Atlantic coast, raising the number of these refugees
 under UN assistance in Honduras from 250 to 3200 in a
 three-week period beginning in mid-December 1981. This
 rising trend is likely to continue. The sudden increase
 in the number of these refugees has temporarily strained
 the facilities provided by the UN and relief agencies
 in the Mosquitia region.

 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Honduras, during 1981, was in a period of accelerated
 return to constitutional rule. Its first stage culminated
 in the elections of April 1980 for a constituent assembly.
 The process concluded on November 29, 1981, as about
 1,200,000 voters, a turnout of slightly over 80 percent
 of registered voters, freely elected a president, congress
 and local officials under the terms of the revised consti-
 tution and electoral law drafted by the constituent assembly.
 The return to fully constitutional civil rule, interrupted
 in December 1972, will be completed with the inauguration
 of the congress and newly-elected President Roberto Suazo
 in January 1982.
 Even during the post-1972 period of military government,
 civilian and political parties, labor unions, trade organ-
 izations and other interest groups were free to organize
 and articulate their positions, and did so. Political
 parties and interest groups continue to have access to
 the media. While no parties are formally banned, 661y
 those which are legally recognized can appear on the.
 ballot. Recognition is granted upon completion of a
 process provided for in the electoral law.
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Viola-
 tions of Human Rights
 Honduras was one of the first countries to ratify the
 Inter-American Human Rights Convention. The Honduran
 government cooperated fully with a 1976 Amnesty Interna-
 tional investigative mission, as well as with one which
 visited in 1979 to look into the camps Fst up for refugees
 from Nicaragua's civil war. During 1981, two groups
 representing Amnesty International visited Honduras.
 Amnesty International states that it has received reports
 of human rights violations, involving both Salvadoran
 refugees and Honduran citizens, allegedly committed by
 both Salvadoran and Honduran security forces and paramilitary
 groups in Honduras. In April 1981 Amnesty International
 expressed its concern to the Inter-American Commission
 for Human Rights (IAHRC) and to the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees about such reports, and urged
 the IAHRC to "take all measures to ensure full investi-
 gations into such incidents."
 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 Honduran per capita gross national product is approximately
 $565. During the period 1975-78 the country enjoyed
 a growth of real gross domestic product averaging 7.5
 percent per annum. Agriculture export gains resulting
 from high international commodity prices and expanded
 production were the most dynamic factors spurring the
 increase. However, during 1980, real growth dropped
 sharply to 2.5 percent, and this downward trend continued
 during 1981. Disappointing export performance, related
 in part to falling coffee prices, soaring petroleum costs
 and a severe shortage of credit, together with a large
 domestically financed budget deficit, explain the decline.
 Until recently, inflation had been relatively moderate
 (6.5 to eight percent per year). However, during the
 past two years it has been in double-digit figures and,
 at times, has fluctuated to as high as 20 percent.
 
 
 469
 Agriculture is the mainstay of the Honduran economy.
 Historically, bananas dominated the scene, but in recent
 years there has been considerable diversification of
 export crops. Since the late seventies, coffee has vied
 with bananas as the principal foreign exchange earner.
 Coffee production is distributed among over 45,000 families,
 most of.whom are small landowners. Meat, lumber, minerals,
 cotton and tobacco are other important exports. About
 62 percent of the population lives in rural areas. Most
 are small farmers producing at little more than subsistence
 level. Agrarian reform laws passed in 1962 and 1975
 were originally implemented with relative success. Although
 more than 30,000 families were resettled on agrarian
 reform land during the mid-seventies, implementation
 of the program has slowed greatly since 1976. Agrarian
 and labor unrest, with attendant land or building occu-
 pations, are a frequent source of tension in Honduras.
 Pressure tactics are frequently used by peasant groups
 to force more rapid implementation of agrarian reform
 laws, and by urban squatters to press a claim to empty
 lots. Honduran military and police seek, generally suc-
 cessfully, to handle agrarian, urban and labor incidents
 without serious violence and, in many cases, resolve
 land-invasion cases through existing legal remedies by'
 awarding the same or equivalent land to the occupiers.
 Despite the economic progress achieved in recent years,
 Honduras has many problems to overcome, including malnu-
 trition (calorie supply available is only 89 percent
 of nutritional requirements), inadequate health care
 and a population growth rate approaching 3.5 percent.
 The government has been relatively ambitious in addressing
 these concerns. In 1974 it embarked on a five-year develop-
 ment plan, the primary objectives of whiih were to integrate
 the rural poor into the national economy and substantially
 increase social services in rural areas. This effort
 was relatively successful. The present (1979-83) five-
 year plan was intended to continue this commitment.
 However, drastic and unexpected shortfalls of government
 revenue commencing in 1980 and extending through 1981
 have curtailed implementation. Government expenditures
 for economic and social development in agriculture, educa-
 tion and health have nevertheless increased substantially
 over former years and in 1979-81 represented about 40
 percent of the total budget. In contrast, defense (in-
 cluding police forces) accounted for 7.5 percent of the
 budget. Under the five-year plan, investments are being
 made in basic infrastructure, including transportation,
 communications and energy, as well as in health, education,
 health care delivery and agrarian reform.
 Efforts to increase agricultural productivity suffer
 from shortages of capital and technical assistance.
 Agricultural research and extension programs urging crop
 diversification and shortage are being expanded. In
 1975 the Ministry of Health instituted a program to extend
 basic health services to the rural area. Primary education
 is provided to an estimated 54 percent of primary school-
 age children, although a high percentage of these never
 finish primary or begin secondary school. Just over
 half the population can read and write.
 By reason of tradition and custom, most women participate
 in activities involving the home. Women aged 15 to 60
 constitute 18.4 percent of the labor force. Based on
 1974 census data, outside of the agricultural sector,
 women most often are employed as domestic servants, clerical
 workers, itinerant or market vendors, and in food processing
 or other manufacturing. In public service there are
 now several women members of the constituent assembly.
 Women also serve as members of the uniformed police force.
