 GABON
 Gabon is a one-party state in which political power is
 effectively concentrated in the Presidency. Given the
 country's economic prosperity, small population, and
 lack of ethnic tensions, there is little opposition to
 the present leadership, which has been in office since
 1967. While political activities are circumscribed to
 within the single party, civil and individual rights
 are generally respected.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by law in Gabon, and this prohibi-
 tion appears to be followed in practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punish-
 ment
 We have no information that such treatment or punishment
 occurs.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment are rare. Political
 detentions have occured, but the practice is not wide-
 spread or systematic. Prolonged detention is usually
 based on court sentences. We have no information to
 confirm that Gabon holds any detainees.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair, public trial is respected in
 civil and criminal cases.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Invasion of the home does not occur with government
 sanction.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:

 Gabon's large mineral and timber resources (oil, ura-
 nium, manganese, unexploited iron ore) and its small
 population (600,000) have led to distortions in economic
 policy which the government has begun to address. Given
 its substantial foreign exchange earnings, Gabon has
 tended to import virtually everything it needs from
 Europe. An increasingly urban population has learned
 to live off of imported foodstuffs purchased at inflated
 prices because of domestic production short-falls.
 Earlier Gabonese capital investment programs focused
 primarily on development of mineral resources. In the
 past year, however, the government has become increas-
 ingly aware of the need to improve agricultural produc-
 tivity, and to better the condition of the rural dweller.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion,
 and Assembly
 Freedom of thought and speech are generally unrestricted
 except in the political domain. Although President Bongo
 has converted from Catholicism to Islam, there are no
 restrictions on religious worship or missionary activities
 in the country. While there are also no legal restrictions
 on the right of assembly, the existence of a single politi-
 cal party, the Democratic Party of Gabon (DPG), and a
 government-approved labor federation means that in practice
 all assembliesfor political purposes above the village
 level require de facto government approval. Organized
 labor in Gabon is closely affiliated with the ruling
 political party. The press is goveinment controlled.
 The government makes no effort to restrict freedom of
 thought or intellectual enquiry.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no significant restrictions on emigration and
 the freedom of movement within or travel outside the
 country.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Gabon is a one party state and all candidates for politi-
 cal office must have the approval of the party. The
 President is elected by universal suffrage for a seven-
 year term concurrently with the deputies of the unicameral
 National Assembly.

 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 Gabon has not always been responsive to requests for
 outside investigations. Although Amnesty International
 did not include a section on Gabon in its 1977 report,
 the 1976 report stated that the Gabonese government did
 not cooperate with the organization's campaign for a
 general amnesty in the country. However, the report
 states that in December 1975, President Bongo announced
 an amnesty for all political prisoners who were sen-
 tenced six months earlier, with the exception of one.
