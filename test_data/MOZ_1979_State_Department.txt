 MOZAMBIQUE
 Mozambique obtained independence from Portugal in 1975
 following a ten-year conflict between the Portuguese and
 Frelimo (Front for the Liberation of Mozambique). Frelimo
 is now the sole political party in Mozambique. Both the
 party and the Government of the People's Republic of
 Mozambique (GPRM) have declared that they subscribe to the
 principles of Marxism-Leninism. During the past year the
 GPRM has further restricted religious practice. Many people
 are still detained without formal charges in reeducation
 camps. While there is movement toward a uniform code of
 justice, there are few trained judges and the administration
 of old Portuguese codes and GPRM decree laws is sometimes
 capricious. Civil and political liberties are considerably
 circumscribed. The Government is trying to meet the basic
 needs of the population, and programs in preventive
 medicine, literacy, and food production have made progress.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 There have been no reports of torture being practiced or
 countenanced.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Conditions in prisons and reeducation centers are harsh with
 food and medical care barely adequate. Prisoners held for
 ordinary crimes are sometimes allowed visitors, but
 political prisoners are not.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Detention without trial is frequently practiced, ostensibly
 for purposes of rehabilitation and political "reeducation."
 The GPRM has not divulged how many persons are held in
 detention throughout the country, but the total number
 appears to be considerable. This includes common criminals
 as well as political dissidents accused of conduct "harmful
 to Mozambique's security, anti-social behaviour or crimes
 against economic development." Habeas Corpus is sometimes
 honored, but persons are often d  -etaned-landestinely and no
 information about their status is provided to relatives.
 Detainees often serve indeterminate sentences in prisons or
 rural reeducation centers and are released only when the
 government decides that they are ready to be integrated into
 society. In October, President Machel announced the first
 massive release of detainees since independence when 553
 persons were released from a reeducation center in Niassa
 Province, and 600 persons who had deserted Frelimo during
 the revolution.
 d.   Denial of Fair and Public Trial
 The Constitution provides that the accused shall be entitled
 to a defense, that judges are to be independent, and that no
 person can be jailed or tried except under the law. Such
 provisions are not necessarily followed. In urban areas,
 courts established during colonial times and, largely using
 the legal codes from the Portuguese era, still function. In
 rural areas "People's Courts" with ordinary citizens as
 judges have been created. In many cases, persons are tried
 and sentenced by a state security official and do not have
 recourse to a public trial. All legal counsel is provided
 by the state. The private practice of law was abolished in
 1975. Most trials are not held in public.

 The Revolutionary Military Tribunal (RMT) is a military
 court established in March 1979 to try cases involving
 crimes against the people and state security. The RMT
 appears to be exercising the powers reserved by the
 Constitution for the "Supreme People's Court," which has yet
 to be created. Civilians are tried by the RMT and sentences
 have ranged from eight years in prison to death. Some of
 the executions ordered by the RMT were apparently not
 subject to appeal and the death sentences carried out a few
 days after the rulings were made. Standards controlling the
 RMT have not been made public.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 The sanctity of the home is guaranteed by the constitution.
 It is not respected when officials believe there may be a
 threat to state security.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillmept of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 The Mozambique government has chosen a socialist and
 centralized model for its economy. However, the right to
 own private property is guaranteed by the constitution.
 Some foreign investment is permitted if it advances the
 government's objectives. Production was severely retarded
 by the departure of about 200,000 Portuguese, the backbone
 of the economy at the time of independence. Floods,
 drought, and tropical storms have also inhibited production.
 The closing of Mozambique's border with Rhodesia and the
 spill-over from the Rhodesian conflict are estimated to have
 cost the country between 100-150 million dollars yearly.
 Per capita GNP is estimated at $170. Commercial marketing
 of corn and rice increased in 1978, but the government
 continues to import wheat, corn, and rice, and to subsidize
 grain prices. Self-sufficiency in basic foodstuffs is a
 government goal for the early 1980s.
 Four years ago over 95 percent of the population was
 illiterate, and national literacy campaigns have been
 successful in training over 100,000 workers annually. Basic
 education is free, but limited by the number of teachers.
 The total student population has tripled in the past five
 years and there are over 95,000 in high schools.
 Mozambique has stressed preventive medicine and the creation
 of health delivery centers. A nation-wide vaccination
 campaign was completed in early 1979 and was very successful
 in reaching virtually all Mozambicans. Medical care is
 nationalized and is available at very low cost. Infant
 mortality rates have fallen markedly. New housing is being
 constructed in urban and rural areas, and the government is
 redistributing rental housing under its control.
 Mozambique has strict wage and price policies to dampen
 inflation. The tax system is progressive. Corruption is
 not a significant problem. When cases are discovered in or
 out of government, the accused are severely disciplined.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion, and Assembly
 The constitution provides that all citizens enjoy freedom of
 opinion, assembly, and association. In reality, these are
 severely restricted. The constitution guarantees the
 
 
 135
 freedom "to practice or not to practice" a religion; that
 Mozambique is a secular state with absolute separation
 between state and religious institutions; and that
 activities of religious institutions must comply with the
 law.
 Public criticism of officials, the party, and its policies
 is almost never allowed. Persons who publicly criticize the
 government or its policies may be sent to reeducation
 centers for political education. The media in Mozambique
 are government-controlled and are not accessible to those
 who might wish to question government policies. Journalists
 practice self-censorship, but articles pointing up specific
 economic or political problems are published. Religious
 freedom is guaranteed by the constitution, but the
 government has curtailed religious practices. Party
 publications call religion one of the undesirable heritages
 of colonialism. The Catholic church is a particular target
 for repression and harassment because of its alleged support
 for Portuguese colonialism. The media have lauched several
 campaigns against religious activities; priests have been
 expelled; church buildings have been closed in areas where
 they competed with state-run schools or social centers;
 clergy must seek government permission to travel outside
 their parish or publish tracts; churches cannot operate
 schools, hospitals, or social centers; and religious
 vocations are discouraged. The number of priests in
 Mozambique in 1975 was about 60 percent less than the
 number at independence. The media criticize Islamic
 practices such as extended fasting as being dangerous to
 health. Some Protestant churches continue to operate and
 hold annual conventions.
 Freedom of assembly does not exist. Mass groups such as the
 National Women's Organization and the National Youth
 Organization are supervised by Frelimo.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, and Emigration
 There is freedom of movement within the country, except in
 some combat-affected areas adjacent to the Rhodesian border.
 The right to emigration for non-citizens resident in
 Mozambique has been maintained. There are strict
 regulations on the removal of money and property. Foreign
 travel and emigration by Mozambicans are permitted only at
 the discretion of the government. Foreign travel is usually
 permitted for purposes of business, education, medical
 treatment, and visiting relatives. The right of return is
 honored, and there are no excessive passport fees.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Mozambique is a one-party state controlled by Frelimo.
 Membership in the party is confined to a small segment of
 the population. The party has adopted the principles of
 Marxism-Leninism. There is universal suffrage, but all
 competition among candidates takes place within the Frelimo
 party structure. There is some opportunity for intra-party
 debate, and ordinary citizens are encouraged to make their
 views known to officials. At the local level there are
 spirited contests for elective office. Election to national
 office is indirect and undertaken by district and provincial
 assemblies. Opposition political movements are not
 
 
 136
 permitted. Women are constitutionally guaranteed the same
 rights and duties as men. Mozambican women may participate
 in all aspects of social, economic and political life. The
 National Women's Organization is given special attention by
 the party and government in order to ensure that women enjoy
 equal rights and the full protection of the law. The
 Women's Organization is making its presence felt in economic
 development projects, adult education, and social services.
 Trade unions are prohibited by the government. The
 government and party have emphasized the creation of quasi-
 official workers' assemblies, production councils, and
 "dynamizing groups" at industrial and commercial
 establishments to resolve the problems of labor and
 management. The rights to strike, organize freely, and
 bargain collectively are not recognized.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No outside investigations of human rights are known to have
 been carried out in Mozambique or to have been requested by
 international organizations.
