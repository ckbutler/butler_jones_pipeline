 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a federation, formed in 1971,
 of seven autonomous emirates. The Provisional Constitution,
 adopted at independence and renewed in 1976, makes the Supreme
 Council, composed of the rulers of the seven constituent
 emirates, the country's highest legislative and executive
 authority. From its membership, the Supreme Council elects a
 president and vice president. The president appoints a prime
 minister and a cabinet. A Federal National Council of 40
 members, each appointed by the ruler of the emirate he
 represents, advises the federal government on legislation and
 reviews government operations. Its recommendations, although
 not binding, receive serious government consideration.
 By constitutional provision, and by the force of tradition, the
 individual emirates retain extensive powers over such vital
 issues as economic policy (including petroleum policy),
 internal security, and even defense. Their rulers' legitimacy
 is based on long-standing traditions of tribal leadership. The
 rulers spend most of their time on emirate matters, and seldom
 meet as a federal Supreme Council.
 The economy is based almost entirely on oil production, which
 has made the national per capita income one of the world's
 highest. A small citizen population, estimated at
 200,000-300,000, controls the country's economic life but
 depends heavily on a much larger contingent of foreigners,
 estimated at approximately I million, to provide most of the
 manual labor and technical skills to sustain the economy. In
 recent years, economic recession, a consequence of the slack
 world oil market, has brought cutbacks in the number of foreign
 workers and greater government vigilance about immigration and
 labor regulations.
 There was no appreciable change in the human rights situation
 in 1985. Increasing tensions in the Iran-Iraq war raised the
 UAE's level of security preparedness, but without precipitating
 terrorist incidents or significant security-related
 restrictions on personal freedoms. The ruling families and
 their close allies continued to dominate political life and to
 play a major role in its economic and commercial life. There
 was no discernible movement to expand the powers of the Federal
 National Council or to extend political participation beyond
 the ruling circles.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 No political killings were reported during 1985.
 b. Disappearance
 No disappearances were reported in 1985.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Provisional Constitution prohibits torture or degrading
 treatment of any person, and the physical or moral abuse of an
 
 
 1410
 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 accused person. No instances of torture were reported in
 1985. Prison conditions, including diet and medical
 facilities, are adequate. Prisoners are permitted visits from
 family members, friends, and lawyers. Consular access to
 imprisoned foreign nationals is permitted, although it is
 sometimes slow to be approved. There is no evidence that the
 authorities allow mistreatment of prisoners.
 There were no instances in 1985 of the amputation of a hand for
 theft or a stoning for adultery under the system of Shari'a law
 which is an integral part of the judicial system. There have
 been instances of public caning for consumption of alcohol. A
 sentence of stoning for adultery, imposed on a married Muslim
 male who confessed his guilt, was overturned when the man
 denied guilt on a retrial ordered by the ruler of the emirate
 in which the case was heard.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Provisional Constitution prohibits arrest, search,
 detention, or imprisonment except in accordance with the law,
 and the laws of each emirate prohibit arrest or search without
 probable cause. Prolonged detention without charge is rare,
 although instances have been reported, especially in national
 security cases. One known case of arbitrary arrest and
 prolonged detention, first reported in 1984, was resolved in
 1985 with the release, without charge, and deportation of the
 person detained. By law, the police must report any arrest to
 a judge within 48 hours for his determination whether to
 charge, release, or, with sufficient police justification,
 allow limited further detention of the person as the police
 continue their investigation. Once charged, suspects come to
 trial expeditiously. In 1985, there were no reported instances
 of preventive detention. Forced labor is not practiced. The
 Provisional Constitution prohibits the exile of citizens.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The UAE has a dual system of Shari'a courts and Western-type
 courts, both of which deal with both criminal and civil cases
 from first instance through a multilevel appeal process. The
 determination of which court system hears a particular case can
 depend on the choice of the plaintiff or on the nature of the
 case.
 Legal counsel is readily available and permitted to represent a
 defendant in both court systems. The court may appoint legal
 counsel if counsel agrees to provide services free; no system
 of state payment of public defenders exists.
 There are no jury trials. All cases, except national security
 cases and those deemed by the judge likely to upset public
 morality, are open to the public. Most judges are foreign
 nationals, primarily from other Arab countries. Interference
 in the judicial process by rulers is said to occur
 occasionally. Nonetheless, the court system is generally
 regarded as fair and its judgments well-considered.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Provisional Constitution prohibits entry of homes without
 permission, except in accordance with strict legal provisions.
 Surveillance of private correspondence is not practiced.
 
 
 1411
 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 Except for rare instances involving national security, no cases
 of arbitrary interference with privacy have been reported in
 the past 2 years.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Emirate citizens are constitutionally guaranteed freedom of
 speech. As a matter of practice, most inhabitants, especially
 foreign nationals, are circumspect in public discussion of
 sensitive political topics.
 Most of the.local English and Arabic language newspapers are
 privately owned, but all except one receive government
 subsidies. The press operates under a law which codifies the
 powers of censorship and media closure and under guidelines for
 reporting which, with self-censorship by journalists, make the
 actual imposition of censorship relatively rare. Local
 newspapers are seldom critical of government policy. They are
 cautious in reporting on the.ruling families, national
 security, and relations with neighboring states. In general,
 the Arabic press is more open, particularly on domestic issues,
 than the English press.
 The censorship department of the Ministry of Information and
 Culture scrutinizes all imported newspapers, periodicals,
 films, and-videos and bans items considered pornographic,
 violent, derogatory to Islam or Christianity, favorable to
 Israel, unduly critical of friendly countries, or critical of
 -the ruling families.
 The Ministry of Information and Culture and some emirate
 governments own the radio and television stations and assure
 programs and news reporting in conformity with standards
 imposed on the other media.
 Visas.for foreign journalists are tightlycontrolled, but, once
 in the UAE, a journalist is free to travel, interview, and file
 stories, which are, however, subject to censorship on security
 grounds.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political parties are not allowed. Organized public gatherings
 require a government permit. In practice, public gatherings
 are rare. The citizen population normally confines its
 political discussion and debate to the numerous "assemblies,"
 held in private homes, which are a local tradition.
 -There is no legal provision for the right of workers to
 organize, to engage in collective bargaining, or to strike.
 Foreign workers attempting to do so would almost certainly be
 deported. For the resolution of work-related disputes, workers
 have access to conciliation committees, organized by the
 Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, and to special labor
 courts. These committees and courts are regarded as effective
 and fair.
 Because foreign workers can stay in the UAE only with the
 continuing approval of the Government, and because many face
 unemployment or lower wages in their country of origin, they
 sometimes fall prey to abuse or exploitation by employers who
 take advantage of their reluctance to protest. The Government
 
 
 1412
 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 has taken steps to improve the labor law covering conditions of
 employment, compensation, inspection of the workplace, and
 enforcement procedures.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the official religion of the UAE, but non-Muslims
 (predominantly foreign Christians) are free to practice their
 faith in their own places of worship, served by their own
 clergy, so long as they do not publicly proselytize or
 distribute religious literature. Although the relocation in
 1982 of the Catholic and Anglican churches from prominent
 seafront locations in Abu Dhabi raised fears of possible
 restrictions, both these churches, along with other Christian
 denominations and other non-Christian faiths, have flourished.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel. Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on freedom of movement or relocation
 within the country except for such security areas as defense
 and oil installations. Unrestricted foreign travel and
 emigration are permitted to citizens. Exit visas are not
 required. The right of return is extended to all citizens.
 There are no known instances of revocation of citizenship for
 political reasons. Foreign workers who terminate employment
 are normally required to leave the country for at least 6
 months before they may return to take up a new job. However,
 some categories of skilled personnel have been exempted from
 this provision.
 The UAE and its member-emirates have long accepted groups of
 displaced persons, such as Palestinians, and those attracted by
 economic opportunity, such as Iranians. Except for those who
 were settled in the area long before the UAE's independence,
 few of these persons have become citizens. Although lacking a
 formalized procedure for accepting refugees, the UAE
 occasionally grants Iranians refuge if they can demonstrate
 that they would face persecution in Iran. However, most
 Iranians if intercepted attempting to enter the country
 illegally, are turned back.
 The UAE is host to a U.N. Development Program office which can
 assist those claiming refugee status to get to a United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) mission abroad. The
 Government contributes to the United Nations Relief and Works
 Agency and the UNHCR.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The UAE has no formal democratic institutions. Most of its
 citizens have little or no say in the process of government or
 in the choice of leaders. The bulk of executive and
 legislative power is in the hands of the seven emirate rulers
 and their families. Intermarriage and alliances between the
 ruling families and other influential families extend the
 network of informal participation by which most major decisions
 are made.
 The positions and powers of individual rulers are not defined
 constitutionally. They are the product of traditional concepts
 of authority. Although the rulers and ruling families are
 presumed to have a right to rule, their incumbency ultimately
 
 
 1413
 
 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 depends on the quality of their leadership and responsiveness
 to their subjects' needs. Emirate rulers are accessible to any
 subject who has a problem or a request. The choice of a new
 ruler falls to the ruling family, which is supposed to choose
 its-most capable and respected eligible member. In practice,
 to avoid violent succession disputes which were common in the
 past, primogeniture has become increasingly common.
 The political-dominance of the ruling families is intertwined
 with their substantial involvement and influence in economic
 life. The ruling families and their close allies control and
 profit from petroleum production, and, with important merchant
 families, have a major stake in the UAE's commercial life.
 Women play virtually no public role in the UAE's conservative
 male-dominated society. However, pressure for change may come
 from the generally superior educational performance of girls
 (who are restricted from educational opportunities abroad) and
 their increasing secondary and university enrollment.
 Foreigners, with few exceptions, play almost no direct
 political role in order to avoid jeopardizing their residence
 status.
 In 1985, there were few indications of movement toward more
 formal democratic institutions. The country's most
 representative institution, the Federal-National Council,
 continued to meet and debate government policy, but with no
 sign of change in its advisory status or in its nonelective
 method of selection.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations-of Human Rights
 The UAE is responsive-to foreign criticism of its human rights
 situation. For example, it has improved its labor laws in
 response to criticism that low-paid foreign workers were being
 mistreated. The UAE has no internal groups which monitor human
 rights. No outside human rights group visited the UAE in 1985.
 In its 1985 report, Amnesty International expressed concern
 about the use of cruel, inhuman, and degrading punishment. It
 also noted its concern about the continued imposition of the
 death penalty, but welcomed the commutation of such sentences.
 Freedom House rated the UAE "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The total population is estimated at 1,286,000, growing by an
 estimated 3.1 percent-annually. The per capita gross domestic
 product of $22'870 is exceptionally high. Approximately 20
 percent of the population are UAE citizens and 80 percent are
 foreign nationals. The Government has developed employment
 guidelines designed to increase-the number of citizens in
 managerial positions. Nevertheless, foreigners still dominate
 technical, managerial, and professional positions. UAE
 citizens predominate in high-level government positions.
 Local attitudes toward foreigners are ambivalent. Most UAE
 citizens acknowledge that massive economic development would
 have been impossible without them. At the same time, many fear
 that their culture may be inundated by foreign influence.
 Although many foreigners have lived in the UAE for years and
 have held highly responsible positions in the public and
 
 
 1414
 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 private sectors, very few, even fellow Arabs, have been granted
 citizenship.
 In 1985, the economy continued its downward trend, affected by
 a weak world oil market. The downturn has affected the
 commercial sector and the rental market, on which many citizens
 depend for their income, and has threatened the banking
 sector. Nonetheless, most UAE citizens, beneficiaries of laws
 and regulations which assure their economic participation,
 still enjoy a high standard of living.
 The federal Government and the individual emirate governments
 have inaugurated an extensive social welfare program. Good
 quality medical treatment, free only to citizens, is available
 in all but the most remote areas. Life expectancy at birth is
 72 years; infant mortality is 36.3 per 1,000 live births. The
 Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare administers a social
 security payment system designed to assure poorer citizens a
 minimum monthly income. Virtually all citizens, urban and
 rural, have access to safe water.
 Education is compulsory to age 12. There are approximately
 250,000 children of all nationalities in approximately 545
 elementary and secondary schools. UAE citizens and noncitizen
 employees of the Government can send their children to school
 free. Other foreign nationals must pay to send their children
 to private schools or lower-cost government evening schools.
 Adult literacy, enhanced by programs enrolling over 25,000
 adults in 1985, is estimated at 65 per cent.
 Labor regulations prohibit employment of youths below 18 and
 restrict hours of work to 8 hours per day, 6 days per week.
 There is no minimum wage. The Government has adopted some
 occupational safety standards which are generally enforced.
 Conservative attitudes about women's roles and the frequency of
 early marriage still limit their educational opportunities.
 However, women's education is advancing and opportunities for
 women are growing in such areas as government service and the
 news media, besides the more traditional fields of education
 and health.
