 CONGO
 The People's Republic of the Congo is a one-party state of
 Marxist political orientation. Many individual freedoms
 are constrained but the trend toward increasing respect
 for human rights noted in 1980 continued through 1981. The
 Congo has allowed a major part of its economy to remain in
 private hands and is actively encouraging private investment
 in an effort to improve economic conditions. The Congo has
 one of the highest literacy rates in the third world and is
 in the middle range of African countries as regards per
 capita gross national product.
 Since independence in 1960, the country has experienced
 protracted periods of political instability often related
 to regional and ethnic animosities which have negatively
 affected human rights conditions in the past. The present
 government, in its third year, continues extensive efforts
 to achieve national reconciliation, economic development
 and regional cooperation.
 These efforts have often resulted indirectly in improved
 human rights practices. As of 1980 the government
 stated that only two political prisoners remain, one of
 whom is former President Joachim Yhomby-Opango.
 A medal of honor given to the Papal Nuncio in 1981 and the
 participation of religious groups and organizations in
 National Day activities are examples of the Congo govern-
 ment's continuing affirmation of the inviolability of
 religious freedom.
 National, regional, and communal assemblies elected on
 single lists in July 1979 met regularly and addressed a
 broad range of grassroots economic issues. The 120-member
 national assembly expanded political expression and
 evinced concern over economic rights by engaging in
 vigorous interpellation of ministers during its two
 sessions, particularly in regard to budgetary matters.
 Citizen concerns were taken into account by the highest
 government officials in economic policy formulation.
 For example, the five-year plan scheduled to go into
 effect for 1982-1986 underwent extensive review in 1981
 by all levels of the government and citizens' organiza-
 tions. Rural agricultural development continues to be a
 priority of the government and problems plaguing farmers
 continue to be examined with the aim of improving their
 economic situation.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The new constitution of July 8, 1979 guarantees the
 inviolability of the person and makes the state respons-
 ible for the respect and protection of the individual.
 There were no allegations of torture in the Congo during
 1981.
 
 
 67
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There were no reports of cruel, inhuman or degrading
 treatment or punishment in the Congo during 1981. It is
 not uncommon, however, for the public or the police to
 beat thieves when caught in the act. Nor is it uncommon
 to see immigration officials at the port striking indi-
 viduals for apparently trying to bypass formalities.
 Prison conditions in general are poor and prisoners
 often lack adequate diet and health care. Penal
 conditions reflect a lack of sufficient resources to
 rehabilitate the system rather than government policy.
 Revisions in penal legislation are underway and promise a
 revamping of the prison system.
 c. Disappearances
 There is no evidence of persons being abducted, secretly
 arrested or held in clandestine detention in the Congo.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The constitution provides that 'no one may be
 indicted, arrested or detained except in cases determined
 by laws promulgated prior to the infraction in question."
 In practice, however, a warrant is not required to make
 arrests. There is a habeas corpus provision, but it is
 not always honored. Congolese law allows for detention
 without charge for up to 48 hours. Former President
 Yhomby-Opango, who was accused of deviation from party
 directives and corruption, has been under detention
 since March 1979 in accordance with a resolution of the
 Third Extraordinary Congress of the Congolese Labor Party
 (PCT). He has not been tried in the courts.
 e. Denial of Fair and Public Trial
 By law, the right to fair and public trial exists in
 all cases. This has generally been adhered to in recent
 years, the notable exception being the case of Yhomby-Opango.
 The constitution provides for a supreme court 'and other
 lower courts. The supreme court, the highest court in the
 country, rules on the constitutionality of laws passed
 and controls the jurisdictional activities of the lower
 courts and tribunals. The constitution guarantees the
 right of defense. The right of counsel is assured in
 all circumstances, including cases litigated in military
 courts. Trial procedures are similar to those in other
 states with a Napoleonic Code tradition.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The constitution declares that "the home is inviolable."
 The law requires a warrant to search a house, but the law
 is not always adhered to in practice.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion, and Assembly
 The constitution provides for "freedom of expression, press,
 association, processions and demonstrations under conditions
 prescribed by the law." As a matter of official policy,
 these individual liberties are restricted in conformity with
 the government's perceived interest in state security and its
 Marxist-Leninist orientation. The State regularly censors
 newspapers and movies.
 
 
 The government owns and controls the media, except for
 one church newspaper. On March 26, 1980, a decree lifted
 the import ban imposed by the previous government on some
 thirty foreign magazines and publications. Foreign journa-
 lists are permitted to visit the Congo.
 The constitution guarantees the equality of citizens
 irrespective of religious or ethnic origins. It
 states that "all Congolese citizens are equal under
 the law" and that any act which accords privileges to
 nationals or limits their rights by reason of difference
 of ethnicity, of origin or of religion is contrary to
 the constitution and punishable by penalties foreseen
 in the law." There have been no reports of serious
 ethnic or religious discrimination.
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed by law and generally
 honored in practice. The constitution stipulates: "The
 People's Republic of the Congo guarantees freedom of
 conscience and of religion in the framework foreseen
 by the law. It is forbidden to use religion for
 political ends." Catholic and Protestant churches,
 the latter including the Salvation Army and Kimbanguist
 Church, are active throughout the Congo. Pope John
 Paul II and President Sassou-Nguesso jointly reaffirmed
 the principles of freedom of religion and church/state
 separation during the Pope's historic May 7, 1980 visit
 to the Congo.
 b. Freedom Of Movement Within The Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Although the constitution does not specifically address
 the question, the Congolese government does not restrict
 the internal movement of Congolese citizens. Congolese
 citizens who wish to travel abroad require exit authori-
 zation from the office of state security; in most cases
 this authorization is given routinely. In the past the
 right of return by citizens charged with anti-government
 activity has been withdrawn, especially in periods
 of political turbulence. In his amnesty speech in
 August 1979, the president reaffirmed the right of
 return to the Congo for all exiled citizens who were
 prepared to participate in the Congo's development.
 The constitution accords asylum rights to persons
 persecuted because of "democracy, national liberation,
 freedom, scientific and cultural work or defense of
 the rights of the working classes."
 There are several dozen refugees in the Congo, mostly
 from surrounding central African states. As of early
 1981, some of the Zaiarian refugees who had been de-
 tained the previous year in the Congo had been released
 and permitted to travel to other countries under the
 auspices of the United Nation High Commissioner for
 Refugees.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Political power is centralized in the sole political
 party, the Marxist-Leninist Congolese Labor Party
 (PCT), which determines the opportunities for parti-
 cipation in the political process. PCT membership,
 
 
 69
 which presently numbers about 7,000, is highly controlled
 on the basis of loyalty and performance. The PCT
 Party Congress, which elects the sixty-member central
 committee and the president, is theoretically the
 highest party organ. It meets every five years.
 Although never referred to in the constitution, the
 politbureau, elected by and from the central committee,
 is an important decision-making body whose decisions
 are imposed on all party, state and mass organizations.
 The party president, elected for five years, is also
 president of the republic, chief of state, and presi-
 dent of the council of ministers.
 The council of ministers is the highest executive organ
 of the state and consists of the president, the prime
 minister, and the other ministers.
 Opportunities for political participation other than
 activity in the PCT include the national, regional,
 and local assemblies and the mass and elite organi-
 zations. The assemblies were elected July 8, 1979 in
 single-list elections. The national assembly meets
 twice yearly with each session limited .to a maximum of
 two months.* Mass organizations, which are party
 appendages, include, for example,.the Revolutionary
 Union of Women of the'Congo (URFC) to which all women
 automatically belong. The Union of Socialist Youth of
 the Congo (UJSC) is an example of an elite organization
 whose membership requirements generally are as strict
 as those of the PCT parent party. Other parties are
 not permitted and opposition groups do not exist in
 the.Congo.
 The constitution stipulates that "women have the same
 rights as men in the private, political and social do-
 mains" and that "for equal work, a woman is also entitled
 to the same social welfare rights."
 Although no women are ministers or politbureau members
 at present, women occupy senior government and party
 positions such as counselor to the president. Only
 one of the 60 members of the party's Central Commit-
 tee is a woman. The 120-member national assembly
 includes 12 women, one of whom is assembly vice presi-
 dent. A woman is appellate court counselor and another
 is president of the highest tribunal at Pointe Noire,
 the.Congo's second largest city and economic capital.
 Several Congolese embassies abroad are headed by women
 ambassadors.
 In 1980, the URFC launched three initiatives designed
 to improve the lot of Congolese women: (1) raising the
 level- of women's education; (2) increasing women's
 economic'activities and (3) combatting illiteracy among
 women.  There areas yet few results to be seen from
 these-new emphases but efforts are underway to meet their
 objectives. For example,:URFC members make children's
 clothes and sell them to village families on an install-
 sment basis so that children will not be kept home from
 school for lack of clothing.
 ,Although polygamy is still practiced by some village
 notables, economic, educational and social pressures
 from unremitting urbanization and modernization have
 contributed to a marked .tendency toward monogamy. In
 
 
 70
 secondary schools, increasing numbers of young women
 are enrolled in technical courses and university atten-
 dance among women is on the rise.
 The Congolese Confederation of Trade Unionists
 (CSC) represents workers but, as an appendage of the
 state, is restricted in its right to strike, bargain
 collectively and lobby.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Congolese government has demonstrated its
 willingness to listen and respond to human rights
 inquiries on a case-by-case basis. Several political
 detainees whom Amnesty International cited in its 1978
 report on the Congo, including the celebrated Dr. Pascal
 Lissouba, were among those granted amnesty in 1979.
 Amnesty International in its 1980 report expressed
 concern that former President Yhomby-Opango has been
 detained since March 1979 without trial and expressed
 hope his trial would be fair, open, and held before
 an independent tribunal. In its 1981 report, Amnesty
 International stated that it is still investigating Yhomby-
 Opango's case as well as those of three other alleged de-
 tainees. In 1980, the International Committee of the Red
 Cross was permitted to inspect local prison conditions.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 The present Congolese leadership appears to recognize
 that those who adopt Soviet-style economic management
 methods encounter Soviet-style production problems. The
 state enterprise system, intended to transfer the means
 of production out of capitalist (largely French) hands, has
 imposed a heavy burden of inefficiency on the Congolese
 economy. As a result, despite the government's Marxist-
 Leninist professions, a sizeable private sector flourishes
 in the Congo. Most of this commerce and industry, however,
 continues to be controlled by expatriates.
 The Congo's per capita GNP, in 1979 put at $630,
 places the Congo above many other developed nations. The
 underpinning for this relatively high income level, as
 for virtually all vitality in the Congolese economy, is
 petroleum, which today accounts for 70 percent of the GPRC
 udget and probably close to half of GNP. The combination
 of private enterprise and petroleum earnings has carried the
 Congolese economy to a major recovery since 1979 and enabled
 the government to reduce its balance of payments deficit of
 $192 million in 1979 to $142 million in 1980. In
 addition, the Congo receives development assistance from
 France, the USSR, China, the US and a dozen other bilateral
 and multilateral sources with both capitalist and communist
 alignments.
 The onrush of oil revenues tends to obscure structural
 imbalances in the economy. Although major pockets of
 relative prosperity can be found, sectors of the economy and
 regions of the country lag markedly behind. One estimate
 gives rural agriculture income as $130 per capita annually.
 Income distribution data do not exist.
 
 
 71
 In urban areas, the Congo's oil wealth is distributed
 widely though unevenly, entering the economy largely as
 civil service salaries and spreading out through an in-
 formal welfare network based on the extended family ties.
 The concentration of seventy percent of the nation's popula-
 tion in Brazzaville, Pointe Noire and along the rail line
 connecting them has eased somewhat the task of delivering
 social services. The government has made a commitment to
 improved and expanded health care throughout the country, a
 policy underscored by the 7 percent budget share of the
 health ministry (fourth among all ministries). Life expectancy,
 currently 46 years at birth, has been rising nationally, but
 is probably lower outside urban centers.
 A similar urban/rural dichotomy exists with regard to
 infant mortality. Mothers in cities have access to
 clinics with at least some medications and equipment, as
 well as trained professional staff. Limited care, if any,
 is available in the countryside. Nationwide, the infant
 mortality rate is 180 per thousand live births. While
 the annual population growth rate has accelerated from
 2.1 percent in the 1970's, the Congo with only 1.5
 million inhabitants does not face an overpopulation
 problem.
 Despite the lack of an agricultural tradition and an
 absence of rural infrastructure, the Congo has been
 spared serious nutritional deficiencies, largely due
 to the relative fertility-of the soil. About 103
 percent of the calories required for proper nutrition
 are available, although some shortage of protein exists
 in the national diet owing to heavy consumption of manioc
 (cassava), the staple food. Provision of safe drinking
 water has been a problem in both urban and rural areas,
 and only about one-fifth of the population has consistent
 access.
 The Congo, which devotes about 18.3 percent of its
 operating budget to education, has had notable success
 in maintaining .the high level of literacy (over 50
 percent and, by some accounts, close to 80 percent)
 the county inherited from the colonial period. Primary
 school enrollment is probably close to 100 percent in
 the cities, although the figure drops off in the
 countryside.
