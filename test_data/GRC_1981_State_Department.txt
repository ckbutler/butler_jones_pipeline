 GREECE
 Since the collapse of the military junta and the restoration
 of democracy in 1974, Greece has given strong proof of its
 commitment to human rights and its record in this area has
 been excellent. The full range of universally acknowledged
 human rights is protected by the 1975 constitution, which
 reflects the spirit and includes many of the provisions con-
 tained in the United Nations' universal declaration of human
 rights.
 Parliamentary elections were moat recently held in October
 1981 and were vigorously and freely contested. The judiciary
 is independent of both the executive branch of government and
 parliament and operates within a civil law framework with
 precedents from Roman law and French and German sources. An
 active and unfettered press functions throughout the country.
 Thus, through a combination of constitutional guarantees and
 administrative practices, the Greek government is committed to
 the scrupulous observance of human rights.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom fromt
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by the constitution in
 article 7 which states that torture, and bodily maltreatment,
 impairment of health or the use of psychological violence, as
 well as any other offence against human dignity are prohibited
 and punished as provided by law. This is respected in prac-
 tice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatlent or Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punish-
 ment is also guaranteed by article 7 of the constitution, and
 has been respected in practice during the past year. Summary
 executions do not take place and physical punishments are not
 administered as sentences for crimes. Conditions in prison
 and detention facilities are not a form of intentionally
 degrading treatment. Adequate health care and diet are pro-
 vided. There is no distinction in treatment among prisoners
 of different social class, race, sex, religion or type of con-
 viction. Cases requiring medical treatment do receive special
 attention. Once sentenced, prisoners may be visited by family
 members three times per week.
 c. Disappearances
 People are not abducted, secretly arrested or held in clandes-
 tine detention by the police, who are the only law enforcement
 body in Greece.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaranteed by
 the constitution in article 6, which states that *no person
 shall be arrested or imprisoned without a reasoned judicial
 warrant which must be served at the moment of arrest or deten-
 tion pending trial, except when caught committing a criminal
 act." This provision is respected in practice. Preventive
 detention does not exist in Greece. A person arrested on
 warrant or while committing a crime must be brought before an
 (789)
 
 
 790
 examining magistrate within 24 hours, at which time he is
 charged. This magistrate must issue a warrant of imprisonment
 or order the release of the detainee within three days of the
 examination, unless special circumstances warrant a two-day
 extension of this time limit. Article 6 further states that
 the maximum duration of detention pending trial "may not
 exceed a period of one year in the case of felonies or six
 months in the case of misdemeanors." A decision of a judicial
 council is required to effect extensions of these maximum
 durations (by six or three months, respectively) in excep-
 tional cases. In practice, despite crowded court calendars,
 trials generally take place within four months of the sub-
 mission of charges.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is independent of the executive and the mili-
 tary. Fair and public trials are guaranteed by the constitu-
 tion and respected in practice. Defense lawyers are always
 available. Mandatory public court sessions are provided for,
 with a few special exceptions involving juveniles or those
 charged with morals offenses when the privacy of the victim
 requires protection. There is also a legal provision for the
 possible in camera treatment of sensitive cases dealing with
 public order. In such instances, none of which are known to
 have occurred during the past year, the court by law must
 publicly pronounce its "reasoned decision" on the matters
 heard privately. A defendant may appeal a court verdict to an
 appeals court. Article 96 of the constitution-stipulates that
 military courts shall have no jurisdiction over civilians.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The inviolability of the home as well as of an individual's
 personal and family life are guaranteed by article 9 of the
 constitution, which states that "every person's home is a
 sanctuary." No house search shall be made except when and as
 specified by law and always in the presence of representatives
 of the judicial power. These constitutional guarantees are
 respected in practice. Warrants, issued by a district
 attorney, who is considered a judicial officer in Greece, are
 required for an official to enter a private home. No cases
 are known in which forced entry has been alleged or in which
 the government has otherwise violated the home. The same
 article contains a provision requiring punishment and
 "liability to full damages to the sufferer" for violators of
 the sanctuary of the home and for abuse of power.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includings
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of speech is provided for by article 14 of the consti-
 tution which states that every person may express and propa-
 gate his thoughts orally, in writing, and through the press
 with due regard for the laws of the state.
 Freedom of the press is covered in the same article of the
 constitution, which states that "the press is free. Censor-
 ship and all other preventive measures are prohibited."
 Opposition viewpoints are constantly ventilated in the active
 Greek press and criticism of the government is tolerated. The
 constitution allows for the seizure, by order of the public
 prosecutor, of publications which insult the president, offend
 religious beliefs, contain obscene articles, advocate a
 
 
 791
 violent overthrow of the political system, or disclose mili-
 tary and defense information. No books, periodicals, or news-
 papers were seized in 1981. The owners of the sensationalist
 newspaper Avriani were convicted of slandering the president
 and the prime minister in accordance with Greek law and fair
 judicial procedures, and their newspaper has continued to
 publish without interruption.
 Freedom of assembly is guaranteed by article 11 of the consti-
 tution, which states 'Greeks shall have the right to assemble
 peaceably and unarmed." Limits on outdoor public meetings do
 exist, however, if it is determined by police authorities that
 a serious disturbance of social and economic life is threat-
 ened. In 1981, no public assemblies were prohibited. Police
 on occasion restrict areas where demonstrators can gather, if
 such gatherings pose a clear and present danger to public
 .safety and order.
 The prevailing religion in Greece is Eastern Orthodox. There
 are several small minorities including Muslims, Jews and non-
 Orthodox Christians. Article 13 of the constitution guaran-
 tees freedom of religion and prohibits discriminatory
 practices against religious minorities. This provision is
 respected in practice.
 Minority groups have participated in the increasing prosperity
 of Greece and enjoy full political rights. The Greek govern-
 ment is committed to observe the provisions of the Treaty of
 Lausanne relating to the education and political rights of the
 Muslim minority. Currently there are two Muslim members of
 parliament. Complaints by, members of minority groups have
 been made about alleged bureaucratic difficulties indealing
 with the lower levels of. Greek bureaucracy on such matters as
 driving licenses and land transfers, although these diffi-
 culties do not appear to reflect an official policy of
 discrimination.
 Another area of concern relates to Greece's small community of
 Jehovah's Witnesses and the provision in article 13 which
 states that -no person shall be exempt from discharging his
 obligations to the state or may refuse to comply with laws by
 reason of his religious convictions.* In deference to the
 Jehovah's Witnesses, in 1977, the government modified the com-
 pulsory military service law to provide for alternative, non-
 combat service. While courts of first instance have, on
 occasion, handed down lengthy sentences to conscientious
 objectors who refuse military or alternative service alto-
 gether, prison terms are sharply reduced in the appellate
 process. In addition, individuals convicted of refusing mili-
 tary or alternative service may serve their sentences at farm
 prisons where each day of work reduces the prison term by two
 days. Thus a conscientious objector does not serve a sentence
 longer than his period of military obligation and, in many
 instances, is imprisoned for a considerably briefer period.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Article 5 of the constitution guarantees freedom of movement
 within the country, foreign travel, and emigration. It is
 respected in practice. Those intending to emigrate and those
 returning to the country experience no discrimination.

 Persons accorded refugee status by the Greek government are
 permitted to remain in Greece pending resettlement elsewhere.
 The government operates a refugee camp (with the capacity to
 accommodate approximately 200 persons) to house a portion of
 the refugees awaiting resettlement elsewhere; others are
 housed in hotels. The government also provides medical treat-
 ment, dental care and hospitalization for persons accorded
 refugee status. Recently, those accorded refugee status have
 included Eastern Europeans, a few Soviet citizens, Ethiopians,
 Turks, and some Afghans. There are also a number of Iraqis,
 Iranians, and Afghans whom the Greek government, while not
 granting them formal refugee status, has permitted to remain
 in Greece pending settlement in third countries. The United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) maintains an
 office in Athens and works with the Greek government, the
 Intergovernmental Committee on European Migration (ICEM) and
 four voluntary agencies which also have offices in Athens
 (World Council of Churches, Tolstoy Foundation, International
 Catholic Migration Committee and H.I.A.S.) on refugee
 matters.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Greece is a multi-party democracy in which all citizens enjoy
 full political rights without regard to race, sex, religion,
 or political persuasion. All opposition parties function
 freely, have access to the media, and hold public meetings.
 Women have the same political rights as men and participate
 fully in the Greek society. At present there are 14 women in
 the 300-member parliament, five women mayors and one woman
 member of the supreme council of state.
 Labor rights are guaranteed by the constitution and respected
 in practice. The right to bargain collectively and the right
 to strike are exercised freely. Also, labor legislation and
 industrial practices are undergoing modernization with the
 objective of harmonizing them fully with those prevailing in
 other European Community member countries.
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Greek government has not objected to visits and investiga-
 tions by human rights organizations. Amnesty International
 has a chapter in Greece.
 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 Food, shelter, health care and education are available to all
 Greeks regardless of race, religion, sex, ethnic background or
 political opinion. Free hospital care is available throughout
 Greece. Primary, secondary, and university education is free
 and nine years of'education is compulsory. The Greek consti-
 tution states that "all workers irrespective of sex or other
 distinction are entitled to equal remuneration for rendering
 services of equal value." -While the working woman's status
 may be somewhat circumscribed by the cultural mores of the
 male-oriented society, working women have made significant
 strides in the past decade regarding equal pay and entry into
 professions which were previously male strongholds. A recent
 presidential decree reemphasizes that there should be no
 discrimination against women on the job.
 Gross national product per capita averaged *3,960 in 1979.
 Average population growth over the past decade was 1.0 per-
 cent, while life expectancy at birth had risen to 74. The
 infant mortality rate stood at 20 per 1000 live births. The
 adult literacy rate was 90 percent in 1979, and virtually all
 male and female children of primary school age attended such
 schools. One hundred percent of the population benefited from
 a safe water supply.
