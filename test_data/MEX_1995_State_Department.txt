 MEXICO
 The United Mexican States is a federal republic with an elected President, a bi-
 cameral Congress and a constitutionally mandated independent judicial branch.
 The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has won every presidential election in
 the last 66 years, many of which involved credible allegations of fraudulent prac-
 tices. Most national and international observers, however, regarded the August 1994
 presidential elections as free and fair. The success of those elections carried over
 into many subsequent state elections, with only one state election marred by allega-
 tions of serious fraud. Several southern states, most notably Guerrero, Tabasco, and
 Chiapas, continued to suffer politically motivated violence, often caused by local po-
 litical rivalries. Although the Government's dialogue with the Zapatista National
 Liberation Army (EZLN) has not yet produced a definitive resolution to the conffict
 in Chiapas, both parties remained committed to a negotiated settlement, and peace
 talks continued through the end of the year. The army and the EZLN have not
 clashed since the Government unilaterally declared a cease-fire on January 12,
 1994. The army conducted a limited offensive in February to reassert control over
 some portions of Chiapas, but did not encounter any EZLN resistance.
 Police forces maintain internal security. The army is responsible for external secu-
 rity, but also has some domestic security responsibilities. The security forces, includ-
 ing the federal and state judicial police, federal highway police, and local police, are
 under the control of elected civilian officials. However, members of the security
 forces continued to commit numerous human rights abuses.

 Mexico has a market-based, mixed economy, which the Government has been pro-
 gressively deregulating and opening during the past 12 years. An ambitious pro-
 gram of privatization has reduced state-owned companies from more than 1,160 to
 less than 200. About 22 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) comes from manu-
 facturing, 25 percent from ommerce, 8 percent from agriculture, and 27 percent
 from service industries. There is significant subsistence agriculture, and 27 percent
 of the populace lives in rural areas. Leading experts include automobiles, manufac-
 tured and assembled p roducts (including eectronics and onsumer goods), and pe-
 trochemicals. Although per capita GDP in 1994 was about $4,200, it fell to about
 $2,800 in 1995 as a consequene of currency devaluation and the recession. There
 are severe inequities in income distribution, with large numbers of people living in
 extreme poverty in rural areas, shanty towns, and urban slums.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, although se-
 rious problems remained in some areas, and some states present special concerns.
 Major abuses included the violence and killings in Guerrero, as well as other
 extrajudicial killings, torture, illegal arrests, and arbitrary detention. To address
 human rights abuses, the Government established the National Human Rights
 Commission (CNDH) in 1990. The CNDH is autonomous, although it receives its
 funding from the Government and the President appoints the president of the Com-
 mission. CNDH recommendations have resulted in the firing or censuring of more
 than 2,000 public servants (most of them members of public security forces), but
 critics claim that its effectiveness is limited by its lack of authority to bring criminal
 or civil charges against those accused of human rights abuses, as well as its cum-
 bersome size andureaucracy. The CNDH concluded that from May 1994 to May
 1995 280 governmental organizations were "presumably responsible" for human
 rights abuses. The CNDH cited the federal Attorney General's Office (PGR), which
 has authority over federal police, in 392 complaints. Corruption is rife within police
 ranks. Other abuses included glaring prison deficiencies, discrimination and violence
 against homosexuals, women, and indigenous persons, and extensive illegal child
 labor in the informal economy. The Government continued, with limited success, its
 attempt to end the "culture of impunity" surrounding the security forces through re-
 forms in the PGR continuing support to the CNDH, and implementing a wide-rang-
 ing package of judicial reforms.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-A number of murders were commit-
 ted for ostensibly political reasons. Guerrero state police killed 17 peasants on June
 28, while they were en route to protest the Government's failure to deliver promised
 herbicides. Many were members of the Organization of the Southern Sierra, a small,
 leftist, peasant organization, formerly linked to the national Party of the Democratic
 Revolution (PRD). An investigation by the Guerrero state attorney general's office
 concluded that heavily armed policemen had acted in self-defense, and that the
 peasants had fired first. A CNDH investigation however, determined that the film
 of the scene which officials used to exonerate temselves had been tampered with,
 that at least one deliberate execution occurred, and that police placed weapons into
 the hands of the dead peasants in order to give the appearance that the peasants
 were armed and belligerent. Additionally, the CNDH charged that state investiga-
 tors had been negligent in their conduct of the investigation and had falsified foren-
 sic test results.
 Although he origially accepted the conclusions of the state attorney general's of-
 fice, Governor Run Figueroa ultimately complied with the CNDH's recommenda-
 tion that a number of state officials be suspended until the completion of a special
 prosecutor's investigation. There are credible allegations, however, that a number
 of the suspended state officials, including the former state attorney general, contin-
 ued to exercise considerable influence in the operations of the state government.
 Alejandro Oscar Varela Vidales, formerly of the Mexico City Attorney General's
 office, was named special prosecutor in the case by the Guerrero state congress after
 the position had been vacant for a month. In accordance with CNDH recommenda-
 tions, former special prosecutor Miguel Angel Garcia Dominguez (who left his posi-
 tion to become a state supreme court justice in Guanajuato) brought criminal
 charges against some state officials and ordered the arrest of ten policemen. The of-
 ficers were held on charges of manslaughter, rather than on charges of homicide,
 and by year's end had not been brought to trial. The bodies of the peasants were
 to have been exhumed on December 13. However, next of kin opted to postpone the
 exhumation for up to 3 months because the state government made no provision for
 following-the CNDH's recommendation that independent forensic experts be present.
 
 
 464
 On instructions from Varela, in January 1996 federal 'udicial  lice (PJF) arrested
 4 ex-officials and 18 state policemen in conjunction with e ki ings. They included
 the former state police operations director, Manuel Moreno Gonzalez, first deputy
 state attorney general Rodolfo Espino, former director general of state security
 Esteban Mendoza Ramos, and Gustavo Martinez Galeana, former chief of state secu-
 rity for the Costa Grande region of Guerrero. CNDH President Jorge Madrazo said
 that in spite of the arrests of the four state government officials, other, higher-rank-
 ing officials cited in the CNDH's recommendation as bearing responsibility for the
 crime remained free.
 Unknown assailants killed 12 peasants on July 5 in Ajuchitlan del Progreso,
 Guerrero. The sole survivor, a 14-year-old boy, said that the attackers appeared to
 be police. Also in Guerrero, more than 20 unidentified gunmen killed 5 policemen
 in an ambush on July 7, and on July 15, gunmen allegedly in the employ of the
 state government killed 2 peasant leaders. In addition, five PRD activists were
 killed in random acts of violence in the state between March 25 and June 27; and
 peasants killed a policeman in the town of La Cebada on June 2. Family feuds con-
 tinued to generate more killings.
 Investigations continued into the 1994 assassinations of PRI presidential can-
 didate Luis Donaldo Colosio and PRI secretary general, Jose Francisco Ruiz
 Massieu. One gunman, Mario Aburto, has been convicted of Colosio's murder. A sec-
 ond alleged gunman, Othon Cortes Vazquez, is in custody.
 In an unprecedented action, police arrested Raul Salinas de Gortari, brother of
 ex-President Carlos Salinas, as the intellectual coauthor of the Ruiz Massieu mur-
 der. Gunman Daniel Aguilar Trevino was sentenced in March to 50 years. Manuel
 Munoz Rocha, a PRI legislator and another suspected intellectual coauthor of the
 killing, remained missing and-presumed dead. Former Deputy Attorney General
 Mario Ruiz Massieu, who until November 1994 was responsible for investigating his
 brother's death, was in the United States at year's end awaiting the outcome of de-
 portation hearings. The Mexican Government has charged him with obstruction of
 justice for concealing Raul Salinas' role in Jose Francisco Ruiz's murder. While car-
 rying out the investigation under the direction of Mario Ruiz, police allegedly tor-
 tured suspects and raped one.
 In August the Attorney General's Office released its finding that Cardinal Juan
 Jesus Posadas Ocampo was slain in a case of mistaken identity May 24, 1993 at
 the Guadalajara airport. Edgar Nicolas Mariscal, who remains in police custody, de-
 clared that he mistook the Cardinal's automobile for that of rival narcotics trafficker
 Joaquin Guzman Loera.
 Five men attempted to murder Bishop Arturo Lona Reyes on June 29 in the state
 of Oaxaca. The Bishop opined that the assassination attempt may have been moti-
 vated by local peasant bosses ("caciques") who may have been perturbed by the
 Bishop's campaign to educate peasants about their rights.
 Unknown assailants murdered Government Prosecutor Jesus Humberto Priego
 Chavez and Judge Abraham Polo Uscanga on June 19 and June 20, following the
 government declaration of bankruptcy of a company which formed part of Mexico
 Citys public bus system-Ruta 100-and violent reaction by its leftist union,
 SUTAUR. The Government has not established culpability in either case. Police
 made no arrests for the murder of former SUTAUR secretary general Ignacio
 Chicuellar Vela and ruled as suicide the death of former municipal transit director,
 Luis Miguel Moreno, although many questioned the ruling (see Section 6.a.).
 On May 10, police found former Jalisco state Attorney General Leobardo Larios
 Guzman murdered outside his home in Guadalajara. The authorities arrested Gas-
 ton Ayala Beltran, a former state judicial police officer as Larios' alleged killer, as
 well as three other alleged gunmen of the Tijuana drug cartel in connection with
 the murder.
 Unknown assailants killed one PRD activist and wounded 42 on July 10 in Villa
 Benito Juarez, Tabasco during post-electoral conflict with police. A local newspaper
 in Chiapas reported on September 30 that 19 PRD members had been killed and
 50 wounded in the towns of Tila, Tumbala, and Angel Albino Corzo, since March.
 Local PRD leader Martha Morales died from bullet wounds received October 14 in
 Tecpan de Galeana, Guerrero. The PRD claims that her death brings to 71 the num-
 ber of its members killed in Guerrero. In an August 1994 incident, which some be-
 lieve to have been an assassination attempt, the PRD's candidate for the governor-
 ship of Chiapas suffered severe injury (two other PRD officials died in the incident,
 and two more were also seriously injured) when a trailer truck collided with his
 minivan.
 There were no new developments in the 67 cases of violence (including murders)
 against PRD activists in which CNDH has issued recommendations since 1992. The
 
 
 465
 authorities have fully complied with 28 recommendations, but only partially com-
 plied with the remaining 39.
 Police and vigilantes acting on behalf of local landowners continued to commit
 extrajudicial killings while disloging peasant squatters from rural lands in several
 states. To expand communal land haldigs, for decades peasants have invaded pri-
 vate lands and petitioned for government recognition of the seizures. With recent
 constitutional agrarian reforms, the Government ceased distributing new lands; the
 invasions continue nonetheless.
 Police continued to evict, detain arbitrarily, and destroy the homes of peasant
 leaders in the state of Veracruz. Land disputes in the state, especially those involv-
 ig ranchers and indigenous persons, are the principal cause of such violence, but
 Doie have also alleged EZLN involvement. During a major sweep of the village of
 Beniteo Juarez, Veracruz, on May 29 and 30 to remove squatters from ranches, police
 arbitrarily detained 34 peasants. Eight of the peasants were sentenced to prison on
 charges of having damaged property. The police also beat or robbed many others.
 Fearing further police violence at the behest of local ranchers, over 100 peasant
 families took refuge in surrounding mountains. A mob of mare than 100 town resi-
 dents attacked police in Soledad Atzompa, Veracruz, after the police beat and at-
 tempted to arrest a local peasant for buying a stolen car. Police often fail to inves-
 tigae killing of peasants by ranchers.
 ethe Veracruz state attorney general's office had been neg-
 ligent in implementing its recommendations regarding the Sptmber 8, 1994, kill-
 ing of two local leaders in Plan de Encinal, a community in  h a  e Madero,
 Veracruz. State officials had previously blocked attempts by Amnesty International
 forensic experts to conduct autopsies on the victims. The authorities made no
 progress in the case.
 Some large landowners in Chiapas maintain private militias to defend their prop-
 erty from peasant land invasions. Local authorities do not impede the establishment
 of these militias, which often employ police and military personnel Other land dis-
 putes between ranchers and peasant squatters ontinued in Qaxaca and Tabasco
 and occasionally turned violent.
 Police officer Jose Antonio Verduzco Flares remains in detention, but the authori-
 tieshn hnhim for beating US. citizen Mario Amado to death in 1992
 in a Baja California jail. A new judge has been assigned to the case.
 b. Disappearance.-Anesty International reported one case of politically moti-
 vated disappearance, that of peasant leader Gilberto Romero Vasquez of the Peas-
 ant Organization of the Southern Sierra, in Atoyac de Alvarez, Guerrero on May 24.
 Members of that organization were among the 17 killed by state police on June 28.
 There were pliticaland economic elements in some cases of disappearances due to
 religious differences (see Section 5).
 The CNDH's 1995 annual report states that, of 13 cases of disappearance which
 it reviewed from May 1994 to April 1995, resulted in determinations that the sub-
 ject was deceased or likely to be deceased. The authorities resolved most of the mare
 than 400 cases of disappearance reported during the early stages of the Chiapas
 conflict in 1994.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture continues to be a serious human rights problem, although the CNDH re-
 ported a 68 percent decline in torture complaints over the previous year (from 148
 complaints to 45) and said that torture was its 19th most common type of complaint
 during the year. Incidence of torture reported to the Federal Districts human rights
 commission also fell. However, the CNDH does not maintain statistics on torture
 complaints to state human rights commissions. Of the 31 states and the Federal
 District, 8 of these jurisdictions do not have specific laws to prdvent or punish tor-
 ture. Poorly trained and equipped to investigate crimes, police officers continued to
 attempt to solve crimes by rounding up likely suspects and then exacting confes-
 sions from them.
 The authorities punish few officials for torture, which continues to occur mainly
 because confessions ae the primary evidence in many criminal convictions. The
 CNDH reported that only 13 policemen were jailed on torture convictions during the
 year. By law the defendant must prove that a confession was forced. Many victims
 do not report, or do not follow through on, their complaints against the police far
 fear of reprisals.
 PJF officers abducted, tortured, and ultimately released U.S. citizen Roberto Car-
 los Castillo Zuniga on August 3 in Matamoros aor allegedly stealing marijuana be-
 longing to a local PJF commander. Despite repeated inquiries by consular authori-
 ties, no investigation has been undertaken.
 The Mexico City press reported that police beat and forcibly removed all figer
 and toe nails during an 18-hour interrogation of Daniel Aguilar Trevino, who was
 
 
 allegedly involved in the conspiracy to assassinate Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu.
 Press reports also state that police forced carbonated water into Marco Antonio
 Rodriguez Gonzalez's nose while he was seminaked, bound, and blindfolded, and
 raped and tortured Maria Eugenia Ramirez Arauz, both of whom were subsequently
 convicted of assisting in the assassination plot. The investigation continued at year's
 end, but the authorities had not indicted any police officials in connection with these
 allegations.
 Police in the state of Veracruz, attempting to force suspected EZLN leader
 Alejandr Garia Santiago to turn himselfin, allegedly tortured his parents and
 brother. The CNDH confirmed that police in the Norte Prison in Mexico City tor-
 tured at least four of seven persons whom they had arrested in Yanga, Veracruz
 on suspicion of links to the EZLN.
 According to press accounts, on May 28 Mexico City polie beat, raped, and tor-
 tured Gloria Galito, a member of the politically activist Ivexico City Neighborhoods
 Assembly, while they held her incommunicado.
 In some cases police officers dismissed in one state find law enforcement employ-
 ment in another. The CNDH discovered that even when the authorities censured
 some officers in one law enforcement job, the moved on to other positions and were
 subsequently chad aa     with human rights abuses. In an effort to remedy this
 situation, the CNH publishes lists of censured public servants in its annual report
 and monthly newsletters. Announcing plans for the creation of a national register
 of law enforcement officials in July, P a o Monalvo, Director General of Protective
 Services in the Ministry of Government, said that 30 percent of al "highway rob-
 ers" are or had been policemen. Attorney General Antonio Lozano Gracia estimated
 in October that 80 percent of all federal judicial policemen had engaged in criminal
 activity.
 Standards at prisons vary by state. Many are staffed by undertrained and corrupt
 guards, and some lack adequate facilities or risoners and are overcrowded, despite
 an early release program endorsed by the CNDH and legal reforms reducing the
 number of crimes that carry mandatory prison sentences. Prisoners complain that
 they must purchase food, medicine, and other necessities from guards or bribe
 guard ao alow the oods to be brought in from outside. Drug and alcohol use is
 rampant in prisons . Frequently, prisoners exercise authority within a prison, dis-
 placing prison officials. Conflicts between rival prison groups, often involved in drug
 trafficking, continued to spark lethal violence. While the authorities prosecuted a
 few prison officials for abusing prisoners, it was more common to dismiss .the  or
 to charge them with only minor offenses. The Federal Government began building
 10 new prisons to house an additional 13,000 prisoners, in order to alleviate over-
 crowding.
 On May 3 and 4, at the Pente rande prison in Jalisco state, FederalJudicial
 Police killed seven prisoners whom they fired on without authorization durin a
 riot. Eight more prisoners were killed and at least 20 wounded during further rot-
 ing at the prison on July 6 and7. May 9 rioting at a Cancun prison left one prisoner
 dead and at least seven wounded. Contention over prisoner self-government and
 control of narcotics and weapons touched off a riot in January at the Torreon prison
 in Coahuila, which left at least 28 dead. A riot in Leon, Guanajuato left one dead
 and seven injured on November 6.
 Some prisons, contrary to law, do not separate male and female populations. Offi-
 cials sometimes encourage women to form sexual liaisons with male prisoners and
 guards. In some cases, officials coerce women into sexual relationships. The CNDH
 hias a program to inspect prisons (it visited 53 jails from May 1994 to April 1995)
 and to investigate prisoner complaints.
 The law pro   its incareation for failure to payrivate debts. However, such ie-
 carerations increased dramatically during 1995, probably reflecting the economic
 crisis.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides that the au-
 thorities must present anyone detained before a judge within 72 hours, and must
 try the person within 4 months if the alleged crime carries a sentence of less than
 2 years, or within 1 year if the crime carries a longer sentence. The law requires
 prisoners awaiting trial to be housed separately from those convicted. In practice,
 judicial and police authorities frequently igoredthese time limits. According to the
 CNDH and nongovernmental organizations (NGO's), the authorities often held
 criminal defendants with convicted prisoners and for longer than allowed by law e-
 fore going to trial.
 For the period from May 1994 to April 1995, CD H reported 169 findings of arbi-
 trary detention, and 30 cases in which it found that authorities held prisoners in-
 communicado. Arbitrary arrest and detention continued to be among the most comi-
 
 
 467
 mon human rights abuses. Detention of opposition political activists is neither wide-
 spread nor systematic, but does occur frequently for short periods of time.
 In previous years, judges often failed to sentence indigenous detainees within le-
 galy mandated periods. In a substantial improvement over 1994, authorities sen-
 tenced 69 percent of all imprisoned indigenous persons within legally mandated pe-
 riods. In 1994, 70 percent had not been sentenced, and the authorities had held half
 of them in pretrial detention for longer than allowed by law. At the behest of the
 National Indigenous Institute (INI) and the CNDH, authorities released 480 indige-
 nous detainees from jails from May 1994 to April 1995. Federal prosecutors contin-
 ued to adhere to INs recommendation that they drop charges against first-time of-
 fenders accused of drug cultivation, as drug traffickers often forced indigenous de-
 fendants who do not understand the legal significance of their actions to grow the
 oany detainees report that officials ask them to pay bribes for release before for-
 mal arraignment; many of those arrested report that they are able to bribe officials
 to have them drop charges before they go before a judge. Corruption is rampant
 throughout the system. Sme wealthy drug traffickers have avoided arrests or jail
 sentences by payingoff police officers and judges. Payments by drug kingpin Hector
 "El Guero" Palma Salazar to the Guadalajara city police force totaled $40 million
 per month, according to press accounts. Attorney General Lozano said that the army
 participated in Palmas' arrest because the Government had to assume that entire
 police forces had been compromised. In an attempt to curb police bribe-taking, the
 Federal District raised judicial police salaries by 80 percent in July.
 Robberies committed by policemen are common; four federal judicial police were
 arrested as they attempted to rob President Zedillo's son in March. In a number of
 cases in northern border states, judges, police, and persons posing as attorneys ex-
 torted large sums of money ($3,000 to $10,000) from tourists to "fixe real or fab-
 ricated infractions. State human rights commission authorities in Coahuila, widely
 published a toll-free telephone number for reportingpolice abuses.
 Most Mexicans view the police as corrupt and unelpful: 64 percent of crime-vic-
 tims in Mexico City did not report incidents to law enforcement authorities, and ac-
 cording to a reliable poll 75 percent of those surveyed felt that the justice system
 was riddled with corruption. Police academies in some states, such as Coahuila, Du-
 rango, and Sonora, sought to improve police conduct'by offering special courses
 aimed at greater professionalization. However, such progress among the various po-
 lice forces is highly uneven.
 The law does not permit exile, and it is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public 7ial.-The judiciary is nominally independent but in the
 past has been influenced by the executive branch, and corruption and inefficiency
 were commonplace.                           N
 The federal court system is composed of 98 district courts, over which are 32 cir-
 cuit courts of appeal and a Supreme Court. President Zedillo proposed and Con-
 gress-after considerable debate and the incorporation of amendments proposed by
 the opposition National Action Party (PAN)--approved several extensive judicial re-
 form packages. These reforms include: selecting most lower and appellate federal
 court judges and law secretaries by competitive examinations; creating an independ-
 ent judicial council to administer the federal courts (except the Supreme Court,
 which administers itself); and requiring two-thirds of the Senate to confirm the ap-
 pointment of a Supreme Court justice. The reforms also provide the Supreme Court
 with the authority to strike down a law for unconstitutionality (one-third of the Con-
 gress, one-third of a state Congress, or the Attorney General must ask the Supreme
 Court to review the constitutionality of a law before it can be declared unconstitu-
 tional).
 The judicial trial system is based on the Napoleonic Code and consists of a series
 of fact-gathering hearings at which the court receives documentary evidence or testi-
 mony. In addition officials may add notarized documents to the official case file
 without authentication. While the law requires that these hearings must be open
 to the public, in practice the courts igore this law. Journalists covering judicial pro-
 ceedings must rely on statements of attorneys outside the courtroom as to what oc-
 curred inside. A judge alone in chambers reviews the case file and makes a final
 written ruling based thereon. The record of the proceeding is not available to the
 public; only the parties and, by special motion, the victim, may have access to the
 official file.
 While there is a constitutional right to an attorney at all stages of criminal pro-
 ceedings, the authorities often do not assure adequate representation for many poor
 defendants in practice. Attorneys are not always available during the questioning
 of defendants; in some instances a defense attorney will attempt to represent sev-
 eral clients simultaneously by entering different rooms to certify that he was
 
 
 468
 present although he did not actually attend the full proceedings. In the case of in-
 genous defendants, many of whom do not speak Spanish, the situation is often
 worse. The courts do not routinely furnish translators for them at all stages of
 criminal proceedings, and thus defendants may be unaware of the status of their
 case.
 Some human rights groups claim that activists arrested in connection with land
 disputes and other civil disobedience activities are in fact political prisoners. The
 Government asserts that the system fairly prosecutes for common crimes, such as
 homicide and damage to property, those charged in sometimes violent land inva-
 sions.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the rights to privacy, family, home, and correspondence.
 The law requires search warrants, but there are credible claims that unlawful
 searches without warrants are common. There were no known claims of forced polit-
 ical membership. SUTAUR, a transit workers union, made a formal complaint to the
 CNDH in August that microphones had been illegally placed in the prison cells of
 some of its members. The CNDH is investigating the complaint.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-The military's February 9 deployment into rebel-held territory in Chiapas
 was accomplished without any large-scale armed confrontations. Most of the vio-
 lence in Chiapas appeared to be caused by political rivalries, land disputes, and
 common crime. There were credible allegations that many military personnel gratu-
 itously invaded homes, damaged the contents, and killed livestock when peasants
 fled in fear from the army offensive.
 Amnesty International reports that soldiers kidnaped two indigenous men,
 Alfredo Jimenez Santis and Mario Alvarez Lopez, on February 9. The soldiers tor-
 tured and beat the men for 5 days at a military installation in the state capital,
 Tuxtla Gutierrez, and then released them. Amnesty International also reports that
 soldiers tortured two other indigenous persons on February 13 in order to extract
 confessions of support for the EZLN; the two were released on the following day.
 The military continues to deny any responsibility for abuses committed during the
 early stages of the Chiapas rebellion in 1994. The authorities have failed to sanction
 any military personnel or government officials for committing abuses, although the
 CNDH issued an interim report in May 1994 finding that there was reason to be-
 lieve that the military had injured or killed civilians in aerial attacks, and that
 there were summary executions, illegal detentions, and instances of torture.
 The law does not require civil trial of soldiers involved in civil crimes, and the
 military continues to handle such cases. The military alleges that five suspected
 EZLN guerrillas who were all shot in the head at the Ocosmgo market with their
 hands beund behind their backs in January 1994 were "caught in the crossfire" and
 the Federal Attorney General's Office exonerated the army in April 1994.
 The army claims, however, that an officer, Lt. Arturo Jimenez Morales, murdered
 eight civilians at an Ocosingo, Chiapas medical clinic on January 3, 1994. Army
 sources claim that after questioning him about his role in the murder at defense
 headquarters on April 15, he committed suicide.
 The army continues to stand by its assertion that it was not responsible for the
 deaths of three men in the farm cooperative community of Morelia, Chiapas on Jan-
 uary 7, 1994. The army does, however, admit that its troops were in the town on
 January 6. Residents said that they saw a military ambulance take away the bodies
 of three men, and later discovered their remains. The Government did not file
 charges and closed the case.
 Nearby municipal police took no action to prevent an attack against supporters
 of Bishop Samuel Ruiz outside his offices in San Cristobal de Las Casas, Chiapas,
 on February 19. The CNDH condemned police inaction, and recommended that the
 municipal government improve security at the bishop's offices, which it subse-
 quently did.
 The Chiapas women's rights organization, "Women of San Cristobal de Las
 Casas," has documented 50 cases of rape during the year in the municipalities of
 Altamirano, San Andres Larrainzar, Amatenango, San Cristobal, and Ocosingo.
 They allege some were committed by security forces. A U.S. human rights worker
 who worked on behalf of the EZLN in the United States accused four armed men
 of raping her in Chiapas on October 25 while she was hiking in a national park.
 The CNH has begun to investigate.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the Government generally respects these rights in practice.
 Newspapers, books, and magazines represent a very wide range of opinion across
 
 
 469
 the political spectrum. Broadcast media are similarly free, although some suggest
 that the Governments power to grant or withdraw broadcast licenses has a chlling
 effect on free expression. While there have been charges of delays in renewing li.-
 censes, there are no known instances in which the Government has forced a radio
 or television station off the air. The Government does not censor or inhibit foreign
 publications or broadcasts.
 While Mexicans generally enjoy access to a vast range of information, human
 rights grups and other students of media point to three problem areas: corruption,
 physical violence against reporters, and monopolization of television by one,
 progovernment company. The New York Times and various Mexican newspapers re-
 ported that press access was severely restricted during the 5-day army reoccupation
 of Chiapas in early February.
 Bribing publishers, editors, and reporters has a long history, although it seems
 to be waning. In 1994 the Federal Government began to require all its press offices
 to report all-their expenses to the Office of the Comptroller General. This appears
 to hive reduced cash payments, although noncash favors of more than nominal
 value remain common. Likewise, state and local governments are reforming. In 1995
 the PAN Mayor of Guadalajara announced that his predecessor had paid roughly
 $250,000 to news organizations and journalists the previous year and that he was
 ending the practice. The governor of Baja California did the same in 1987. Editors
 at four Mexico City dailies have adopted codes of conduct for their employees-three
 raised reporters' salaries at the same time and have tried to diminish dependence
 on government advertising revenues. Even so, the bribing of journalists is still com-
 mon.
 The CNDH screens cases involving violations of press and speech rights and re-
 fers the ones it considers to have merit to appropriate officials for investigation and
 possible prosecution. Of 11 complaints received from May, 1994 to May 1995, 5 are
 still under investigation. The CNDH requested judicial investigation in two cases,
 in two cases the complainants withdrew the charges, and one complainant did not
 pursue his case. From May to December 1995,     H re   rted eight new cases, in-
 cluding three alleged assaults, four reports of threats and one complaint about cen-
 sorship. CNDH has acted on seven cases. In one case, it recommended that judicial
 authorities start a formal investigation. Two cases were concluded with the removal
 of a police officer from his position and the initiation of judicial process. CNIDH ad-
 vised two other complainants to follow up on their cases independently. An addi-
 tional two cases are stl under review, and one case was dismissed as being outside
 the mandate of the CNDH.
 The nooern          magazine Revista Mexicana de Comunicacion receives coi-
 plaints but  does not investigate them. The magazine reported on 90 complaints of
 uman rght violations involving journalists in 1994 and 28 cases in 1995. Of the
 28 cases, 4 concerned censorship. There were 13 cases of physical assault (most of
 them by local or federal police authorities), 7 complaints of threats, and 3 assassina-
 tions, including that of a journalist from Tijuana who was investigating drug traf-
 icking. The journalist's father and brother (also journalists) were ahot atr promis-
 ing to reveal the names of the killers in a press conference. At year's end the case
 remained unresolved. According to the magazine, the human rights commission of
 the state of Baja California has recommened that further action be taken by the
 state attorney eneral's office and local authorities. The magazine also reported the
 disappearance m October of a Coahila magazine publisher following allegations in
 the magazine of links between federal authorities and drug traffickers.  maa-
 zine states that the regional human rights commission of La Laguna (northern Mex-
 ic) is investigating this case.             s      a   2 a     in a  t     he
 Some complain that the private Televisa networks h re of pprxima   ly 8 per-
 cent of the television maret would not be permitted were Televisa not so clearly
 progovernment in its broadcasts. However, Televisa's influence faces growing com-
 petition from all kinds of media.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Assoiation.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of assembly, and the Government respects this right in practie. The ony
 requirement for holding demonstrations is that groups  shing to meetin fpuli
 areas inform local police authorities; public demonstrations are held frequently.
 c. Freedom of Relgion.-The Constitution provides for the rightto practice the re-
 ligion of one's choice, and the authorities generally respect this right in practice.
 (However, see Section 5 concerning religious discrimination.) The law bars clergy
 from holding public office and from advocating partisan political positions.
 Immigration authorities detained and on June 22 deported three foreign priests
 who had been working in Chiapas, claiming the had engaged in political activities
 from which foreigners are prohibited by law. After an appeal from Father Loren
 Riebe, a US. priest who clasn   that he took part in no portical activities, the ov-
 
 
 470
 ernment said that it would review his case and his application for a visa to return
 to Mexico. By year's end, the Government had not made a final decision in the Riebe
 case. In September immigration authorities refused permission to two priests, Cana-
 dian Albert Mahoney and American Paul Nadolny, to reenter Mexico and return to
 their parishes in Chiapas. Immigration authorities based their refusal on legal tech-
 nicalities; the priests claim that the decision was politically motivated. President
 Zedillo met with leaders of the Catholic Church on October 13 to discuss expulsions
 of foreign clergy from Chiapas. Church leaders said that they were pleased with the
 results of the meeting, and church and government officials remained in contact on
 the issue.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not generally restrict movement into, out of, or
 within the country.
 The law provides protection for foreigners who face political persecution. The
 CNDH reported that the number of refugees had fallen in 1995 to approximately
 17,000, from the previous year's 23,000. It stated that the principal reasons for the
 diminution were greater numbers of repatriations to neighboring Guatemala as that
 country's civil war abated, and death of refugees due to unhealthy living conditions.
 A July 1994 CNDH survey of 132 refugees in Chiapas found that 67 percent had
 been mistreated, struck, or threatened by authorities; 20 percent had been robbed;
 and that police had extorted money from 44 percent. Ten complained of having been
 tortured, and two of the women claimed that they had been raped. (Similar informa-
 tion is not available for 1995.) Scattered reports of use of illegal immigrants and
 refugees as slave labor on Chiapas farms persisted.
 During 1995 Mexico expelled 83,148 "undocumented" or illegal immigrants, the
 majority of whom were Guatemalans. After Guatemalans, the largest groups were
 Salvadorans and Hondurans. Many of those expelled were en route to the northern
 border with the United States. Illegal immigrants rarely fie charges in cases of
 crimes committed against them. The authorities generally immediately deport ille-
 gal immigrants who come to their attention; therefore, pending cases brought by an
 illegal immigrant are subject to dismissal once the immigrant has been deported.
 Until 1995, children who were in Mexico illegally did not have the right to matricu-
 late in public schools. According to new Education Secretariat guidelines, any child
 may now be registered for public school with a Mexican or foreign birth certificate.
 Implementation of the new guidelines varies widely from state to state, however.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right peacefully to change their gov-
 ernment through periodic elections. The PRI dominates politics and has controlled
 the Government since the party was founded in 1929. It has won every presidential
 election since then and has maintained power, in part, by relying on public patron-
 age, use of government and party organizational resources, and, in the past, elec-
 toral fraud. However, the Government no longer restricts the functioning of political
 opponents.
 Mexico held gubernatorial elections in the states of Jalisco, Guanajuato, Yucatan,
 Baja California, and Michoacan, as well as state and local contests in 11 other
 states. At year's end, the opposition PAN had won three of five governorships. The
 ruling PRI retained the governorships in Yucatan and Michoacan. The PAN unsuc-
 cessfily contested the Yucatan gubernatorial election's outcome, claiming that the
 PRI committed fraud.
 Elections were generally peaceful and orderly. The Government spent hundreds
 of millions of dollars funding the operations of the quasi-independent Federal Elec-
 toral Institute (IFE), whose governing council is under the control of nonpartisan
 civilian directors. Many states undertook electoral reform, modeling state electorai
 institutes after the federal institute. The IFE oversees the national voter registra-
 tion list, and provides technical support to state electoral registers.
 Some domestic observer groups, media outlets, and major political parties con-
 ducted "quick count" operations which confirmed official election results during state
 and local elections. In cases where electoral courts determined fraud, they voided
 the results of the voting stations in question and determined the outcome according
 to returns from other stations in the district.
 A severe failure in the electoral process has been the lack of any meaningful pros-
 ecution of those accused of electoral crimes. Despite numerous accusations of fraud
 in the various state races, authorities declined to prosecute any electoral crimes. On
 the other hand, an electoral tribunal reversed the results of the 1994 Monterrey
 mayor's race, changing a PRI victory to one for PAN.
 
 
 471
 One of the continuing major obstacles to election reform is the deeply entrenched
 antidemocratic tradition of unchecked power exercised by local bosses over peasants
 in rural areas. These bosses often exercise some measure of control over virtually
 every aspect of peasants' lives, including how they vote. One NGO which studied
 the results of the August 21, 1994, elections in a remote district found that there
 were 30 percent more votes for the PRI in polling places where no independent ob-
 servers were present.
 Although there is no systematic exclusion of women aid indigenous persons, they
 are underrepresented in politics. Women, however, hold numerous congressional
 seats, and continue to increase their representation in political offices. For the first
 time in its history, the PRI had a female president, Maria de Los Angeles Moreno,
 who resigned August 19.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operate largely without government re-
 striction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. About
 800 NGO's attended a July conference in Mexico City, demonstrating the rapid
 growth of this sector. Government officials are generally cooperative and responsive
 to NGO views, and the Congress has established a citizen participation committee
 to act as a liaison with NGO's. However, problems remain. For example, Father
 David Fernandez, S.J., and other human rights leaders reported anonymous death
 threats.
 To address human rights abuses, the Government established the CNDH in 1990.
 Since that time, the CNDH has made nearly 1,000 recommendations which have re-
 sulted in the firing or censuring of over 2,000 public servants, most of them mem-
 bers of public security forces. From May 1994 to May 1995, CNDH efforts resulted
 in sanctions against 221 public servants, as follows: 96 criminal actions; 24 dismis-
 sals; 24 declared incompetent for public service; 29 suspensions; 44 reprimands or
 warnings; 1 arrest; and 3 fines. The CNDH publishes the names of all sanctioned
 public servants. In some cases, authorities applied multiple sanctions, but CNDH
 statistics list cases under the most severe sanction applied.
 In its review of the various state human rights commissions' decisions, the CNDH
 issued 74 recommendations for reconsideration or renewal of action between May
 1994 and December 1995. At years end, state commissions complied completely
 with 57 of the recommendations, and partially with 15. Two were in various stages
 of administrative processing. Some N O's note that the CNDH lacks both autonomy
 and enforcement authority. Additionally, some contend that it has become too large
 and bureaucratic and that the state commissions are ineffectual.
 In March the Federal District Attorney General's office announced the opening of
 a new sub section for human rights to address abuses in Mexico City, where one-
 quarter of Mexico's population lives. By July the new office was handling an average
 of two complaints per day against federal district police officers, as well as other
 cases.
 The CNDH had made 1015 recommendations to government authorities by the
 end of the year. Of these, tie authorities fully complied with 599, partially complied
 with 392, and rejected 21 while 52 were in various stages of administrative process-
 ing. The CNDIH cited 60 recommendations which authorities had been "negligent"
 in implementing during the past 4 years.
 Then Defense Minister General Antonio Riviello imprisoned General *Jose Fran-
 ciso Gallardo Rodriguez in November 1993 on a range of charges, including embez-
 zlement and dishonoring the miitary. Gallardo claims that the embezzlement
 charges, which date back 6 years, hadpreviously been abandoned for lack of evi-
 dence. ie maintains that military authorities are persecuting him because of an
 academic dissertation calling for the establishment of a military human rights om-
 budsman's office. The army continues to hold Gallardo, but has reduced the previous
 inordinately high level of security of his incarceration.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that men and women are equal before the law. It also pro-
 vides that education should sustain the ideals of "fraternity and equal rights of all
 mankind, avoiding privileges of race, sects, groups, sexes, or individuals." These pro-
 visions are not effectively enforced.
 Amnesty International cites Mexico as one of the countries in which homosexual
 men and women are most likely to be victims of abuse and violence. Discrimination
 against homosexuals in hiring and promotion is also widespread. At least 12 homo-
 sexuals and 9 male prostitutes were killed in Tuxtla Gutierrez between 1991 and
 
 
 472
 1993. An independent prosecutor took over the investigation of the Tuxtla Gutierrez
 murders in April 1994 but had made no progress in solving them by the end of
 1995. Liborio Cruz, a 19-year-old male prostitute, was beaten to death by a group
 of men in Mexico City in June.
 Women.-Although the Constitution provides for equality between the sexes, nei-
 ther the authorities nor society in general respect this in practice. The most perva-
 sive violations of women's rights involve domestic and sexual violence, which is be-
 lieved to be widespread and vastly underreported. Domestic assault is a crime, but
 in 10 states the "right to correct" wife and children is not a crime unless this abuse
 involves cruelty or excessive frequency. Women are reluctant to report abuse or file
 charges, and even when notified, the police are reluctant to intervene in what soci-
 ety considers to be a domestic matter. The municipality of Chimalhuacan, Mexico
 state, where the average time for police action on rape cases is 2 months, is a typi-
 cal example of the difficulty rape victims experience. This is attributable to police
 inexperience in handling these cases, lack of investigative techniques, and unwill-
 ingness to get involved in what are often considered domestic affairs.
 The Federal District Attorney General's Office operates rape crisis centers around
 the city. Few women, however, avail themselves of the centers' services. Out of a
 municipal female population of more than 10 million, only 627 approached the cen-
 ters. The majority were girls: 27 percent were between 13 and 17, and 25 percent
 were under age 13. Some women who availed themselves of the centers' services re-
 ported abusive, humiliating, and unprofessional behavior by police and medical ex-
 aminers who work as staff in the centers.
 The legal treatment of women's rights is uneven. Women have the right to own
 property in their own names and to file for separation and divorce. However, in
 some states a woman may not bring suit to establish paternity and thereby obtain
 child support, unless the child was a product of rape or cohabitation, the child re-
 sides with the father, or there is written proof of paternity.
 The Labor Code provides that women shall have the same rights and the same
 obligations as men, and that "equal pay shall be given for equal work performed
 in equal posts, hours of work and conditions of efficiency." However, employers, in-
 cluding the Mexico City police department, frequently require women to certify that
 they are not pregnant at the time of hiring.
 The CNDH found that the largest number of complaints against health care insti-
 tutions involved negligence or abuse during childbirth by medical personnel and
 charges of forced sterilization, and that the number of such complaints rose in 1995,
 in large part due to women's increased awareness of their rights. The study noted
 that most sterilizations occurred in public hospitals and were performed on poor and
 illiterate patients who were not informed of the consequences of the medical proce-
 dure. The Constitution and a law protect women from abuses of this kind; the Con-
 stitution states that all persons have the right to make free, responsible, and in-
 formed decisions on the number of children they choose to have. The 1984 General
 Health Law provides for criminal action against those who pressure a woman to un-
 dergo sterilization procedures or perform such procedures without the woman's con-
 sent. In a very few cases, charges have been brought against doctors for sterilizing
 a woman without her consent. The CNDH recommended that medical administra-
 tors train their staffs to be more aware when dealing with such patients.
 Children.--Children under 18 make up over 40 percent of the population. There
 is no societal pattern of abuse against children, but children's advocates report
 many such cases. The U.N. Children's Fund classifies Mexico as "lacking adequate
 strategies" to combat malnutrition among children, and reports that 30,000 children
 die each year of causes related to malnutrition. More than 12,000 children live on
 the streets of Mexico City, many having left or been driven from their homes by al-
 coholic parents. The children themselves often become involved with alcohol, drugs,
 prostitution, and petty thievery. Police in Hermosillo, Sonora conducted "sweeps" of
 street children, incarcerating many for short periods, in order to "clean up" the city.
 While the Government and NGO's conduct a number of programs for street chil-
 dren, corrupt police exacerbated the problem by pressuring children to commit petty
 crimes and extorting profits from them. The CNH has a program for protection
 of children's rights which includes educating children on their rights and reviewing
 legislation to ensure compliance with relevant international conventions. Noting
 that reports of abuse of children in Mexico City had increased 40 percent during
 the year, Andrea Linares, director of the Public Ministry of Family Affairs, an-
 nounced in November the creation of two new Federal District agencies to deal spe-
 cifically with the abuse and kidnapping of children. While the Government is com-
 mitted to children's health and education, it has failed to allocate sufficient re-
 sources for acting on that commitment.
 
 
 473
 People With Disabiities.-The law requires access for disabled persons to public
 facilities in Mexico City, but not elsewhere in the country. In practice, however,
 most public buildings and facilities do not comply with the law. Recognizing that
 disabled persons often suffer employment discrimination, the Federal District insti-
 tuted a new tax rebate program for businesses employing disabled persons. For the
 first time, the Public Education Sub Secretariat for the Federal District mandated
 that all public and private schools grant access to physically (though not mentally)
 disabled children, and that schools make the necessary arrangements (e.g., installa-
 tion of ramps) to facilitate access. The National Public Education Secretariat printed
 27,000 textbooks in Braille in 1995.
 Indigenous People.-he indigenous population has long been victim of discrimi-
 natory treatment. The Chiapas up rising focused unprecedented interest on the de-
 mands of indigenous persons in that state for increased economic and social rights.
 Among its basic demands, the EZLN called on the Government to enact measures
 to protect indigenous cultures, provide more opportunity for employment, and invest
 in schools clinics, and infrastructure projects. The Government, through the IN
 and the CNDH, operates programs to educate indigenous groups (many members of
 which do not speak Spanish) about their political and human rights, and it gen-
 erallyprofesses respect for their desire to retain elements of their traditional cul-
 ture. Of the 94 complaints regarding indigenous affairs received by the CNDH in
 1994 and up to the end of May 1995, 72 had been resolved.
 More than 130 NGO's in Mexico are dedicated to the promotion and protection
 of indigenous rights. Indigenous people do not live on independently governed res-
 ervations, although some indigenous communities exercise considerable local control
 over economic and social issues. These communities apply traditional law to resolve
 a variety of disputes, including allegations of crimes. However, these groups remain
 largely outside the country's political and economic mainstream, a result of long-
 standing patterns of economic and social development, and in many cases their abil-
 ity to participate in decisions affecting their lands, cultural traditions, and allocation
 of natural resources is negligible.
 The 1992 reforms in agrarian law were expected to promote economic develop-
 ment in the countryside, but indigenous groups generally perceived the reforms as
 intended to break up indigenous communal landoldings and prevent the groups
 from obtaining title to new lands. A 1991 amendment to the federal law requires
 that an interpreter be present at every stage of criminal proceedings against indige-
 nous persons, and stipulates that "their customs and traditions shall be taken into
 account." However, the courts continue to try and sentence indigenous people with-
 out the benefit of interpreters. In May 1994, at least 5,874 indigenous persons were
 in jail. During the period from May 1994 through Ray 1995, 480 were released,
 largely through CNDH efforts.
 The general education act states that "teaching shall be promoted in the national
 language (i.e., Spanish) without prejudice to the protection and promotion of indige-
 nous languages. However, many indigenous persons speak only their native lan-
 guages. Non-Spanish speakers are frequently taken advantage of in commercial
 transactions involving bilingual middlemen, and have great difficulty finding em-
 ployment in Spanish-speaking areas. Over 50 indigenous languages are currently
 spoken in Meico.
 Although the law provides some protection for the indigenous, and the Govern-
 ment provides indigenous communities support through social and economic assist-
 ance programs, legal guarantees and social welfare programs are not sufficient to
 meet the needs of all indigenous persons.
 Religious Minorities. -In the highlands of Chiapas and other indigenous areas,
 traditional leaders sometimes acquiesced in, or actually ordered, the expulsions of
 Protestants belonging primarily to evangelical groups. In many cases the expulsions
 involved the burning of homes and crops, beatings, and, occasionally, killings. The
 most significant example of religious inspired expulsions occurred in San Juan
 Chamula, Chiapas, where local authorities have expelled an estimated 30,000
 Evangelicals over the past 30 years. In 1995 violence in San Juan Chamula was di-
 rected against an evangelical group whose members were previously expelled for
 their religious beliefs, who returned in August 1994 under an agreement arranged
 by state and ONDH officials. The latest round of violence resulted in several dead
 and wounded, and several cases of disappearances.
 This violence is due in part to political and economic rivalries, as well as religious
 differences. During state government-sponsored talks in the state capital of
 Chiapas, Tuxtla Gutierrez, the two sides reached agreement on September 4 that
 followers of local political bosses should end their harassment of Evangelicals. How-
 ever, the agreement was shattered when local bosses kidnaped Evangelical Agustin
 Lopez Perez. Both parties tried to reach a solution but Evangelicals eventually re-
 
 
 474
 taliated by kidnaping two party bosses from the town of Arvenza in November
 which set off street fights resulting in six dead and six wounded.
 Police detained 100 indigenous Mhapans, members of an evangelical group, after
 a confrontation near the town of Bochil, Chiapas. The peasants attacked the police
 with rocks; police responded with tear gas. According to press reports, the
 Evangelicals were attempting to take back by force two impounded community
 transport vehicles and kidnap the local official in charge of public transportation.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and the Federal Labor Law (LFT)
 provide workers with the right to form and join trade unions of their choice. About
 30 percent of the total work force is unionized, which implies an effective rate near-
 ly twice that high, as only about one-half the labor force works in the formal sector
 and is accessible to union organization.
 No prior approval is needed to form unions, but they must register with federal
 or state labor authorities to obtain legal status in order to function effectively. Reg-
 istration requirements are not onerous. There are credible allegations, however, that
 federal or state labor authorities occasionally withhold or delay registration of
 unions hostile to government policies, employers, or established unions, or register
 extortionists or labor racketeers falsely claiming to represent workers. To remedy
 this latter problem, Federal Labor Secretariat (STPS) officials require evidence that
 unions are genuine and representative before registering them. The matter of trade
 union registration was the subject of ministerial consultations in 1995 under the
 North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation (the side agreement on labor to
 the North American Free Trade Agreement).
 Unions form federations and confederations freely without government approval.
 Most unions belong to such bodies which also must register to have legal status.
 The largest trade union central is the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM), or-
 ganizationally part of the ruling PRI. The Federal Employee Union Federation
 (FSTSE), the Revolutionary Worker and Peasant Confederation , and most of the
 35 separate national unions smaller confederations, and federations in the Labor
 Congress (CT) are also allied with the PRI. However, several are not, including the
 large teachers' union, which severed its PRI ties several years ago and freed its fac-
 tions to cooperate openly with other parties. Rivalries within and between PRI-allied
 centrals are strong. There also are a few small labor federations and independent
 unions outside the CT which are not allied to the PRI.
 Unions are free to affiliate with, and are often active in, trade union
 internationals.
 Union officers help select, run as, and campaign for, PRI candidates in federal
 and state elections, and support PRI government policies at crucial moments. This
 gives unions considerable influence on government policies, but limits their freedom
 of action to defend member interests in other ways, particularly when this might
 threaten the Government or the PRI. After the 1991 federal elections, the pro rtion
 of CT senators and deputies fell to less than 10 percent, but in 1994 the T, and
 especially the CTM, regained some lost congressional nominations, and nearly all
 labor candidates won easily.
 The International Labor Organization (ILO) Committee of Experts (COE) has
 found that certain restrictions in federal employee labor law, a separate section of
 the Constitution and LFT, violate freedom of association. At FSTSE request, the
 Congress incorporated certain provisions of FSTSE statutes into the LFT. These
 provisions allow only one union per jurisdiction, forbid union members from quitting
 the union, and prohibit reelecton of union officials. The COE and the ILO Con-
 ference Committee on Application of Standards (CAS) strongly reiterated their criti-
 cism and request that the Government amend these provisions. The Government
 promised to study this as part of reforms currently under consideration and report
 the resultant action to the 1LO before next year's conference.
 Two major alleged violations of freedom of association in the public sector oc-
 curred in the spring and were cited in the CAS debate. In the first case, a new Envi-
 ronment Ministry was created, merging the former Fisheries Ministry and much
 larger sections from the Agricultural and Social Development Ministries. The offi-
 cers of the Fisheries Ministry union, rather than negotiate the transition within
 FSTSE, appealed to the Federal Employee Labor Tribunal to become the union of
 the new ministry. The tribunal ruled that the FSTSE should apply its statutes and
 hold a convention to form a new union, dissolving the former Fisheries Ministry
 union. The FSTSE convoked secret ballot elections in the sections of the new min-
 istry for delegates to a convention which formed the new union and elected its offi-
 cers. The dissolved union alleged that this was all just a pretext to get rid of the
 only FSTSE union led by militants of the left, rather than the PRI. While this was
 
 
 a result, it was not the reason for creating the new ministry, and FSTSE procedures
 were scrupulously democratic and in accord with its statutes. In November consider-
 ing a freedom of association complaint on this case, the ILO governing body reiter-
 ated that Mexican public service labor law should allow free formation of multiple
 unions and the most representative union for exclusive bargaining rights should be
 chosen objectively. The press re rted in November that the two unions were nego-
 tiating a compromise solution. InJanuary 1996, a court reversed the tribunal deci-
 sion and restored the dissolved union's registration. A recognition election (see Sec-
 tion 6.b.) will be held to choose between the two unions.
 The other complaint involved Mexico City municipal transit workers. In March
 the Government of the Federal District obtained a court order declaring the grossly
 corrupt Ruta 100 bus company bankrupt. A court also ordered the arrest of 12 lead-
 ers of Ruta 100's SUTAUR union in connection with internal union corruption. In-
 vestigations are still underway into the subsequent mysterious suicide of a city tran-
 sit director who was reorganizing the company and the murders of a prosecutor
 who was working on the case, and a judge who had left the case (see Section 1 a.).
 Some SUTAUR members protested the government reorganization of the Tribunal
 for dissolution of the union. Although SUTAUR proponents contend that the Gov-
 ernment's hasty and heavy-handed manner in dealing with Ruta 100 was as bad
 as any corruption in the company or the union, their claim that the Government's
 actions constitute a violation of freedom of association is not credible.
 The Constitution and the LFT provide for the right to strike. The law requires
 6 to 10 days' advance strike notice, followed by brief government mediation. If fed-
 eral or state authorities rule a strike "nonexistent" or "illicit," employees must re-
 main at work, return to work within 24 hours, or face dismissal. If they rule the
 strike legal, the company or unit must shut down totally, management officials may
 not enter the prmises until the strike is over, and the company may not hire strik-
 er replacements. The law permits public setor stries, but  yare rare. Provisions
 for maintaining essential services are not onerous.
 During the first 11 months of 1995, the Labor Secretariat estimated that 5,810
 strike notices were filed and 96 legal strikes occurred involving 12,249 workers and
 the loss of 777,990 work days. These figures were less than during the same period
 of 1994. At year's end, 47 strikes were resolved and 49 were unresolved. During the
 period December 1994 to November 1995, 794 representation disputes between
 unions were filed, plus 18 economic disputes-these are generally company requests
 to lay off workers due to economic difficulties. There were no reports that federal
 or state labor authorities stretched legal requirements to rule strikes nonexistent
 or illicit or used delays to prevent damaging strikes and force settlements.
 The donstitution and the LFT protectlabor organizations from government inter-
 ference in their internal affairs, including strike decisions, which can also protect
 undemocratic or corrupt union leaders. The law permits closed shop and exclusion
 clauses, allowing union leaders to vet and veto new hires and force dismissal of any-
 one the union expels. Such clauses are common in collective bargaining agements.
 Employer organizations have pushed for labor law reform which would limit union
 leaders' powers, but unions have successfully resisted. However, the Government
 employers and unions have negotiated de facto reform through tripartite national
 pacts (see below) and collective bargaining at the enterprise level.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution and the
 LFT strongly uphold the right to organize and bargain collectively. Interest by a few
 employees, or a union strike notice, compels an employer to recognize a union and
 negotiate or ask the federal or state labor board to hold a union recognition elec-
 tion. LFT prounion provisions led some employers to seek out independent, "white"
 or company unions as an alternative to mainstream national or local unions. Rep-
 resentation elections are traditionally open, not secret. Management and union offi-
 cials are present with the presiding labor board official when workers openly declare
 their votes. Such open "recounts" are prevailing practice, but not required by law
 or regulation. Secret ballots are held when all parties agree.
 As the economic crisis deepened, the Government, at union insistence, agreed to
 end the system of annual national pacts negotiated by the Government and major
 trade union, employer, and rural organizations which voluntarily limited free collec-
 tive bargaining for the past decade.The pact follow up ommittee continues to meet
 to monitor prices, limit inflation, and support the Govenent's free market eco-
 nomic reforms, but wage restraints no longer exist, except for the de facto restraint
 caused by the economic recession and difficult situation of most employers. In the
 fall, the Government and major employer and union organizations concluded a new
 "Aiance for Economic lReovery," agreeing on tax breaks to industry to spur em-
 lont and increases in the minmum wage but reiterating the commitment to
 fre ollective bargaining with no guideines or government interference. Real wages
 
 
 in union contracts were estimated to have fallen an average of 20 to 25 percent, los-
 ing most of the ground regained over the previous 5 years.
 Mexico's record in internal union democracy and transparency is mixed. Some
 unions are democratic, but corruption or authoritarian and strong-arm tactics are
 common in others. There were few protests alleging such practices, though the CTM
 petroleum union dissident movement continued to accuse leaders of undemocratic
 and strong-arm tactics. The CTM helped protesting workers switch to a different
 section (local) of its transport union when the section leader signed a contract that
 favored an intercity bus company, supported their strike for a better contract in
 July and August, and took action against other bus companies to which the com-
 pany tried to divert buses and route, to evade the strike. At a U..-owned auto
 parts firm in Mexico state near Mexico City, some workers dissatisfied with an ar-
 rangement favorable to the company reached by a CTM union leader began trying
 to shift to the union of the small, left of center, independent Authentic Labor Fed-
 eration (FAT), and were threatened with dismissal under closed shop-exclusion
 clause provisions. Once the local American Federation of Labor-Congress of Indus-
 trial Organizations representative advised the CTM of this situation, it withdrew,
 renounced the contract, and called off the dismissal actions. The company sought
 out the CT-member Mexico state Worker and Peasant Confederation which took
 over the favorable contract and resumed the dismissal action. The FAT sought a
 representation election, but lost overwhelmingly.
 The public sector is almost totally organized. Industrial areas are heavily orga-
 nized, but states with little industry often have few unions. The law protects work-
 ers from antiunion discrimination, but enforcement is uneven, especially in states
 with low unionization.
 Unionization and wage levels in the in-bond export sector vary by area, especially
 between high and low technology facilities. Wages have been lower in this sector
 than in most of industry, especially in low technology facilities in the west, but the
 gap has narrowed. Some observers allege poor working conditions, inadequate
 wages, and employer and government efforts to discourage unionization in this sec-
 tor. There is no evidence that the Federal Government opposes unionization of the
 plants, which tend to be under state jurisdiction, but some state and local govern-
 ments are said to help some employers discourage unions.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor. There have been no credible reports of forced labor for many years, with the
 exception of abuses of refugees and illegal immigrants in Chiapas (see Section 2 d.).
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law bans child labor and sets
 the minimum legal work age at 14. The activities of those age 14 and 15 are so re-
 stricted as to be uneconomic (no night or hazardous work, and limited hours). The
 ILO reported that 18 percent of children aye 12 to 14 work, often for parents or rel-
 atives. Enforcement is reasonably good at arge and medium-sized companies, espe-
 ciallyin export industries and those under federal jurisdiction. Enforcement is inad-
 equate at the many small companies and in agriculture. It is nearly absent in the
 informal sector, despite government efforts. Most child labor is in the informal sec-
 tor (including myriad underage street vendors), agriculture, and in rural areas. The
 CTM agricultural union's success years back in obtaining free transport for migrant
 seasonal workers from southern states to fields in the north inadvertently led to a
 significant increase in child labor. The union and employers have been unable to
 convince most indigenous farm workers to leave their families at home even though
 bilingual education is not available near worksites.
 The Government increased the number of obligatory school years from 6 to 9 in
 1992 and made parents legally liable for their children's attendance, as part of a
 reform to upgrade labor force skills and long-term efforts to continue increasing edu-
 cational opportunities for and participation by youth.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Constitution and the LFT provide for a
 daily minimum wage. The Tripartite National Minimum Wage Commission (govern-
 ment, labor, employers), sets minimum wage rates each December, effective January
 1. The minimum daily wage is for the whole year, but any of the three parties can
 ask that the board reconvene during the year to consider a changed situation. It did
 so in April, boosting the minimum wage another 12 percent to compensate for rapid
 inflation. In the Alliance, (see Section 6.b.) labor, employers, and the Government
 agreed to ask their representatives on the Commission to increase the minimum
 wage 10 percent on December 1 and another 10 percent on April 1, instead of the
 usual January 1 increase.
 In Mexico City and nearby industrial areas, Acapulco, southeast Veracruz state's
 refining and petrochemical zone and most border areas, the minimum daily wage
 on December 4 was $2.70 (20.15 new pesos). Minimum wage earners were actually
 paid $3.06 (22.97 new pesos) by their employers due to a supplemental 14 percent
 
 
 fiscal subsidy (negative income tax or tax credit for employers). These income sup-
 plements to the minimum wage, agreed in annual tripartite pacts, are for all income
 less than four times the minimum wage, decreasing as wages and benefits rise. In
 Guadalajara, Monterrey, and other advanced industrialized areas, the 1995 mini-
 mum daily wage (before the fiscal subsidy) was $2.50 (18.70 new pesos). In other
 areas, it was $2.27 (17.00 new pesos). There are higher minimums Or some occupa-
 tions, such as building trades.
 Few workers (only 14 to 18 percent of the workers covered by social security) earn
 only the minimum wage. Industrial workers average three to four times the mini-
 mum wage, earning more at bigger, more advanced, and prosperous enterprises.
 The law and contract arrangements provide workers with extensive additional
 benefits. Legally required benefits include free social security medical treatment and
 pensions, individualworker housing and retirement accounts, substantial Christmas
 bonuses, paid vacations, and profit-sharing. Employer costs for these benefits run
 from about 27 percent of payroll at marginal enterprises to over 100 percent at
 aorfrs with  good union contracts.
 LFT sets 48 hours as the legal workweek, with pay for 56 hours. Workers
 asked to exceed 3 hours of overtime per day or to work overtime on 3 consecutive
 days must be paid triple the normal wage. For most industrial workers, especially
 under union contract, the true workweek is 42 hours, although they are paid for
 7 full days. This is why unions jealously defend the legal ban on hourly wages.
 The law requires employers to observe occupational safety and health regulations
 issued jointly by STPS and the social security institute (IMSS), and pay contribu-
 tions which vary according to their workplace safety and health experience ratings.
 LFT-mandated joint management and labor committees set standards and are re-
 sponsible for workplace enforcement in plants and offices. These meet at least
 monthly to consider workplace needs and file copies of their minutes with federal
 labor inspectors, who assumed jurisdiction for all such inspections in 1987, sup-
 planting state inspectors and strengthening inspection considerably. The inspectors
 schedule visits largely in response to these workplace committees.
 Individual employees or unions may also complain directly to inspectors or safety
 and health officials. Workers may remove themselves from hazardous situations
 without jeopardizing their employment. Plaintiffs may bring complaints before the
 Federal Labor Board at no cost to themselves.
 STPS and IMSS officials report that compliance is reasonably good at most large
 companies. Federal inspectors are stretched too thin for effective enforcement if
 companies do not comply voluntarily and fulfill their legal obligation to train work-
 ers in occupational health and safety matters, although the number of inspectors
 was increased in 1995. There are special problems in construction, where unskilled,
 untrained, poorly-educated, transient lalor is common, especially at many small
 sites and companies. Many unions, partikularly in construction, are not organized
 effectively to provide training and to encourage members to work safely and
 healthily, to participate in the joint committees, and to insist on their rights.
