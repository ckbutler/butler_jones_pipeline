 GRENADA
 The island state of Grenada (population about 106,000)
 received its independence from the United Kingdom
 in 1974, inheriting a Westminster system of parliamen-
 tary democracy. The first prime minister, Sir Eric
 Gairy, was accused by his opponents of personal
 corruption, rigging the 1976 elections and intimidating
 the opposition by violence through a *police auxiliary*
 force, the "Mongoose Gang,' accountable only to
 him. In March 1979 the leaders of a revolutionary
 opposition group, the New Jewel Movement, staged
 a nearly bloodless coup d'etat. The abuses of the
 Gairy regime at first caused the populace to excuse
 the extraconstitutional character of the coup, and
 the new government was greeted with widespread popular
 acceptance. Despite early promises to return quickly
 to the parliamentary system, to hold elections and
 to protect human rights, the People's Revolutionary
 Government, closely aligned with Cuba, has systemati-
 cally evaded these commitments.
 While many observers expected the human rights environ-
 ment in Grenada to improve with the advent of the
 new regime, there is now widespread agreement that
 there has been a marked deterioration in the human
 rights situation in Grenada, which calls into question
 the sincerity of the government's early commitments.
 Almost immediately upon taking power, the government
 suspended the 1974 constitution. It detained numbers
 of former government officials, leaders of rival
 opposition parties and other citizens, and has continued
 to do so. Very few of these persons have been charged.
 Some have been released without any explanation
 for their confinement. Most are still being held.
 The government closed the only pro-coup independent
 newspaper and closed two other journals (one indepen-
 dent, one church-sponsored) on the publication of
 their first issues. Opposition political activities
 and labor action have been discouraged and effectively
 curtailed by government intimidation.
 Initially, the government repeatedly promised democratic
 elections. However, with the passage of time, the
 government has become increasingly vague and defensive
 on this issue. It now talks of creating a "new
 democracy," which will replace the Westminster system
 with some form of consultation through 'mass' organiza-
 tions (all controlled by the ruling New Jewel Movement
 or by the government). Well over two years have
 passed since the government announced that a new
 constitution was in preparation and would be placed
 before the voters for approval in referendum. There
 has been no visible progress on this project.
 Official corruption appears to have been reduced. The
 government has taken steps to meet the basic'economic
 needs of its citizens, but these efforts increasingly
 have been undermined by economic uncertainty, flowing
 in part from the government's insistence on using
 scarce development resources to finance an expensive,
 economically dubious international airport. Grenada's
 poor political climate also has tended to discourage
 new investment and private initiative.

 In a December 1980 hearing on an application for
 a writ of habeas corpus by a political prisoner,
 the attorney general stated that Grenadians now have
 no fundamental rights and freedoms. This situation,
 brought about in a legal sense by the suspension
 of the constitution, has been confirmed by arbitrary
 government action against those who question or oppose
 the government. It has been underscored by hostile
 official reaction to internal and especially regional
 groups and individuals who question the government's
 poor human rights performance.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The suspended 1974 constitution guaranteed protection
 from inhuman treatment and expressly prohibited torture.
 There have been unconfirmed reports of torture of
 political prisoners under the present government.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There is some evidence for crediting reports that
 third-degree measures have been used on detainees
 held in People's Revolutionary Army locations and
 that some prisoners have been physically abused during
 detention. There is a mandatory death penalty for
 murder. The 1980 Terrorism (Prevention) Law also
 provides a discretionary death sentence for causing
 death by explosives or acts of terrorism. The prison
 system traditionally has provided adequate health,
 dietary and sanitary conditions, but there are indica-
 tions that the continuing increase in the prison
 population has resulted in overcrowding and a consequent
 deterioration of conditions. Visits by family members
 are only allowed sporadically, particularly for political
 detainees.
 c. Disappearances
 Although there have been reports of disappearances,
 none have been confirmed. Detentions are not always
 publicly announced, and no list of detainees has
 been released since August 1980. Nor is there any
 apparent effort to keep the process of detention
 a secret, and the fact that a person has been detained
 normally becomes known in the small Grenadian society.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 In suspending the constitution on its assumption
 of power in 1979, the government empowered itself
 to arrest persons without warrant for suspected counter-
 revolutionary activity. The government has utilized
 this power to conduct periodic roundups of persons
 it accuses of anti-government activity. Few detainees
 have ever been charged, and those who eventually
 are released are apparently not informed of the reasons
 for their arrest. Such detention is for an indefinite
 term at the pleasure of the state. On December 31,
 1981, the government released 24 political detainees,
 without explaining the reasons either for the detentions
 or for the releases. The government stated that these
 releases left less than 100 detainees, and that 40
 
 
 437
 of them recently had been charged with offenses.
 It is impossible exactly to estimate the number of
 political prisoners actually being held.
 A 1980 law provided for the establishment of a three-
 member detention tribunal appointed by the government.
 The law created a framework for the review of detentions
 by the tribunal as frequently as every two months.
 The tribunal announced that it would meet at six-month
 intervals, but has not kept that schedule, meeting
 only infrequently and sporadically. There are reliable
 reports that recommendations for release made in some
 cases have been rejected, and the tribunal has not
 convened in well over a year.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 As described above, political detainees are held indefi-
 nitely and are not normally charged (the relevant
 law does not oblige the government to press charges).
 The preventive detention tribunal system has the effect
 of removing political cases from the judicial system
 and denying affected citizens a fair public trial.
 The traditional legal system, based on British common
 law, continues to operate for ordinary criminal offenses,
 with the accused having the right to counsel and normal
 legal remedies. The independence of the judiciary
 still appears to be intact in civil and criminal cases.
 In its early days the government appointed a three-
 man appeals court, composed of leading West Indian
 (but not Grenadian) jurists. This court has not func-
 tioned well due to the unavailability of its judges,
 who are not resident in Grenada. Several appeals
 have been delayed, during which time the appellants
 have remained in prison. The government has taken
 steps to rectify the situation by recruiting new judges
 more readily available to hear cases.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Under its extra-constitutional powers, the government
 has given the police force and the People's Revolutionary
 Army the power to make warrantless searches and arrests.
 There are many indications that searches made under
 the umbrella of "national security" have been used
 to stifle and harass opponents. Warrantless searches
 are usually carried out in conjunction with the arrests
 of presumed political opponents of the regime. Opponents
 also have had their homes and places of business placed
 under open surveillance by the government, and have
 had personal property confiscated and utilities discon-
 nected.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 In 1981 the government continued to suppress these
 freedoms. An independent newspaper entitled the "Grenadian
 Voice," owned by 26 prominent Grenadians and published
 in conformity with the law, appeared in mid-June 1981.
 Shortly before its second issue was.to appear, the
 government confiscated the printer's equipment and
 supplies as well as personal property of some of the
 shareholders. A law was passed making it illegal
 to publish this newspaper as well as, for an indefinite
 period, any other new journal. In July, four persons
 
 
 438
 (three of them shareholders in the "Grenadian Voice,"
 the fourth person apparently involved in its distribu-
 tion) were detained for alleged "CIA links." They
 are still being held. All 26 shareholders suffered
 a wide range of government-inspired harassment. At
 about the same time, the government began strong attacks
 on and harassment of Grenadian correspondents of Western
 news agencies. In July the executive committee of
 the American Press Association condemned the People's
 Revolutionary Government for "its repeated attacks
 on freedom of the press."
 There have been reliable reports of individuals being
 intimidated after "talking" with Western visitors
 and correspondents. There were no known instances
 of a popular assembly in opposition to the government.
 The futility and dangers of such activity were demon-
 strated by the breakup by government supporters of
 the few such meetings held in 1979-80. Religious
 freedom has not been interfered with since early 1980,
 when the government closed a Catholic newspaper and
 accused the Catholic Church of being an instrument
 of "destabilization."
 Freedom of action for independent trade unions was
 further circumscribed during 1981. The government,
 in a radio statement, told the independent labor unions
 that strikes or other actions would not be permitted
 because they interfered with the functioning of the
 national economy. This policy, formulated after a
 civil service strike was settled in early 1981 following
 heavy government pressure on union leaders, has not
 been promulgated by a law. However, the independent
 trade unions, notably the seamen and waterfront workers
 union, have experienced sporadic detention and harassment
 of their leaders and allegations of their links with
 foreign agents. While the independent unions have
 been closely monitored and circumscribed by the govern-
 ment, certain pro-government unions, including two
 led by a senior government official, have been allowed
 full scope in organizing and in taking industrial
 action against private business and agriculture.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Generally speaking, there is no restriction on freedom
 of travel within the country, except for entry into
 zones restricted on national security grounds. However,
 a recently-promulgated law gives the government the
 power to restrict the movement of any individual to
 certain geographical areas, including restriction
 to the person's home (house arrest). In general,
 foreign travel is normally unrestricted, apart from
 a long-standing requirement that evidence of the payment
 of taxes be produced before tickets can be issued.
 Several shareholders in the suppressed "Grenadian
 Voice" newspaper were, however, prevented from leaving
 Grenada in mid-1981 on a variety of flimsy or unspecified
 grounds. Reliable reports indicated these persons
 were in some cases allowed to travel only after they
 disavowed to the government, sometimes publicly, any
 future involvement in such free press activities.
 Grenada's leading journalist was also denied permis-
 sion to travel outside the country in 1981.
 
 
 439
 There ,was one known case in 1981 of a person being
 ."exiled" from Grenada. This was a shareholder in
 the same suppressed newspaper, who was given the choice
 of. detention or leaving Grenada. He chose the latter,
 departed .on.short notice and left most of his posses-
 sions behind.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 As recently. as March 1981, Prime Minister Maurice
 Bishop reiterated the commitment of the People's Revolu-
 tionary Government to hold elections, but he emphasized
 that elections were not a government priority. Other
 government statements before and since have indicated
 anincreasing..preference for .establishing a form of
 "new democracy," based on consultation through "mass
 organizations." Individuals-and opposition groups
 which have attempted to participate in the political
 process.without government authorization have been
 detained, harassed or suppressed.
 Men and women have equal legal and political rights
 �in.the Grenadian political system. Women hold a number
 of high government positions (one was recently appointed
 a cabinet minister), although they remain underrepre-
 .sented in both public and private sector jobs in terms
 of the overall proportion of the population. The
 government has encouraged formation of officially-
 sponsored women's groups, and has through various
 means aided their participation in political, propaganda
 -and development efforts. Racial discrimination is
 not condoned-by the government.
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Interna-
 tional and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Government intransigence toward outside expressions
 of concern over the human.rights situation increased
 during 1981 as regional bodies became disillusioned
 and more .vocal about the government's repressive prac-
 tices. The government has not responded to an Inter-
 American.Human Rights Commission request, submitted
 to it in early 1981, for information concerning the
 ,1979 closure. of the "Torchlight" newspaper. Criticism
 by regional organizations of the closure of "The Grenadian
 -Voice" and harassment of its owners were met by accusa-
 tions that-these groups were carrying out a 'CIA destabi-
 lization plan." Calls by regional political leaders
 for early elections in accordance with government
 commitments have been met with personal insults from
 the.Grenadian government. Press and individual inquiries
 about specific political prisoners have not been answered.
 In January 1981 an Amnesty International mission went
 ,to. Grenada to discuss the continued detention of persons
 without charge or trial and the alleged ill-treatment
 .of detainees. Following the visit Amnesty International
 wrote Prime Minister Bishop, pointing out his government's
 obligations toward detainees under the American Convention
 on Human Rights.
 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 Grenada's economy has traditionally been based on
 agriculture.. The three main cash crops are cocoa,
 bananas and nutmegs. In recent years, tourism has
 
 89-510 0 - 82 - 29
 
 
 440
 also provided a very significant portion of national
 income and became an increasingly important source
 of employment. While the government increasingly
 relies on Cuba for economic assistance, Western sources
 provide a greater portion of aid.
 After a period of stagflation, the early 1970s were
 a period of slowly increasing prosperity for the Grenadian
 people. Cultivation of the three cash crops provided
 the foundation for economic development. Private
 investors, both domestic and foreign, built tourist
 facilities geared especially to North American visitors
 and retirees. A start was also made toward attracting
 private investment, although poor planning by the
 government and increasing official corruption limited
 advancement. Indicators show that basic human needs
 were met in this period at adequate if sometimes minimal
 levels. Infant mortality fell from 34 to 23.5 per
 thousand and life expectancy rose from 67 to 69 years.
 Nevertheless, in the 1970's, Grenadians increasingly
 believed that the Gairy government was more interested
 in enriching itself than in developing the country.
 This was a primary factor in the widespread support
 the present government initially received when it
 came to power.
 In its early days, the People's Revolutionary Government
 created several new social welfare programs, concen-
 trating on primary health care, education and adult
 literacy. These programs, carried out with technical
 and financial assistance from abroad, brought about
 some improvement. However, many factors combined
 to limit progress. Depressed markets for export crops
 and production problems reduced foreign exchange earnings,
 which in turn lowered national income and government
 revenue. Reduced revenues were also caused by a lack
 of private sector confidenceand investment, occasioned
 by ambivalent government attitudes toward private
 business activity, and by a fall in income from tourism,
 caused by a generally depressed Caribbean market and
 amplified by the negative reaction of American tourists
 to the government's anti-American propaganda.
 Social welfare programs received less attention from
 the government as 1981 progressed. Nonetheless, benefits
 from continuing programs are available to all Grenadians
 without apparent discrimination on racial, class or
 economic grounds. Limited new initiatives have been
 taken, such as abolition of the low secondary school
 fees and creation of subsidies for school uniforms.
 There has also been a slight rise in employment levels
 due to construction of the economically-dubious interna-
 tional airport. Significant further advances in the
 provision of social services will have to await an
 improvement in world markets for Grenada's cash crops
 and a moderation of the government's ideologically-
 motivated excesses and distortions which have adversely
 affected the economy and reduced funding available
 for social services.
