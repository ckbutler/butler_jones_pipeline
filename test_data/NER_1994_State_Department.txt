 NIGER
 Niger conducted its first multiparty elections in 1993, when a coalition of eight
 parties joined to elect Mahamane Ousmane President. International observers
 judged both the presidential and legislative elections to be free and fair. The Alli-
 ance of the Forces of Change (AFC), itself a coalition of six parties led by Prime
 Minister Mohamadou Issoufou, held 50 of the 83 seats in the National Assembly
 through September when Prime Minister Issufou resigned, withdrawing his party
 from the governing coalition. A new Constitution, which established the Third Re-
 public in 1992, provides for numerous freedoms as well as an independent judiciary.
  The Tuareg separatist insurgency in the North continued, as ethnic minority
 forces attacked both civilian and military targets, killing soldiers as well as non-
 combatants. Several rounds of negotiations mediated by France, Algeria, and
 Burkina Faso failed to resolve the differences between the Government and the in-
 surgents.
 Security forces consist of the army, the gendarmerie (paramilitary police), and the
 national police. Despite the experience of almost two decades of military rule up to
 the national conference in 1991, Niger's armed forces backed the transition to demo-
 cratic government and have accepted civilian political authority. On one occasion,
 troops intervened to quell violence inspired by religious differences. The military's
 security zone in the Tuareg area is reportedly established in part to obscure the
 army's activities from public scrutiny.
 The economy is made up largely of traditional subsistence farming, herding, petty
 trading, and informal markets. Uranium is the most important export. Persistent
 drought, low literacy, a declining uranium market, and burdensome debt further
 weakened the already troubled economy.
 Government troops continued to abuse human rights. Clashes between security
 and rebel forces caused civilian deaths. Police violated laws governing searches,
 treatment of prisoners, and length of detention. The overloaded judicial system and
 delays in trials resulted in long periods of pretrial confinement. Societal discrimina-
 tion and domestic violence against women continued to be serious problems; the de
 facto disfranchisement of many women limits their right to change their govern-
 ment. The private press and radio expanded during 1994. Labor unions actively bar-
 gained for wages and better working conditions, and civic organizations organized
 freely.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Prsn officials reportedly tortured
 and killed two Tuareg men in Agadz in May (see Section 1.c.).
 Government armed forces killed two Muslim fundamentalists during a melee in
 Bani Bangou. Fundamentalists had killed seven gendarmes who had be en sent to
 arrest their leader and later killed one militiaman in the vilence that led to the
 deaths of two fundamentalists. A large force of gendarmes sent to respond exercised
 restraint and negotiated the surrender of those suspected of involvement in criminal
 acts. Both government and insurgent forces killed civilians during clashes through-
 out the year (see Section 1.g.). The Government continued its investigation into the
 1990 and 1991 incidents in which security forces killed civilians during political
 demonstrations but did not arrest or prosecute anyone by year's end, despite its
 promises to do so.
 h. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degr     Treatment or Punishment.-
 During a rebel attack on an electric plant at Tchigozerine in August, eight rebels
 and several defending soldiers were reportedly     see    tion 1.g.). According
 to reports, gendarmes illegally took into custody the 25 Tuargs who worked at the
 plant, questioning, beating, and attempting to intimidate them. A company nurse
 suffered broken  inabs.
 Prisoners are segregated by sex. Family visits are allowed, and prisoners receive
 supplemental food and other necessities from their families. There are no reports
 of unduly harsh treatment.
 
 
 184
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Although the Constitution prohibits arbi-
 trary detention, and laws officially prohibit detention without charge in excess of 48
 hours, police violate these provisions in practice. If police fail to gather sufficient
 evidence within the detention period, the prosecutor gives the case to another offi-
 cer and a new 48-hour detention period begins.
 he judicial system is seriously overloaded. There are no statutory limits on pre-
 trial confinement of indicted persons; detention frequently lasts months or years. As
 many as 80 percent of prisoners in Niamey are awaiting trial. The government cre-
 ated new regional tribunals to handle civil cases on the local level.
 The Government held 4 Niger citizens accused of the October 1993 hijacking of
 a Nigeria Airways flight for nearly 6 months before submitting the case to judicial
 authorities. More than 1 year after the event, they remain in pretrial confinement
 despite the objections of local human rights groups. A fifth Nigerien, turned over
 to Niger by authorities, has also been detained for more than a year for investiga-
 tion of his alleged role in masterminding the air piracy.
 The law provides for a right to counsel, although there are no defense attorneys
 outside the capital. A defendant has the right to a lawyer immediately upon deten-
 tion. The State provides a defense attorney for indigents.
 Bail is available for crimes carrying a penalty of less than 10 years' imprison-
 ment. Widespread ignorance of the law and lack of financial means prevent full ex-
 ercise of these rights.
 The Constitution prohibits exile, and there were no reports of its use.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary. Defendants and prosecutors may appeal a verdict, first to the Court of Ap-
 then to the Supreme Court. The Court of Appeals reviews questions of fact
 and law, while the Supreme Court reviews only the application of law and constitu-
 tional questions.
 Although the Supreme Court has on occasion asserted its independence (see Sec-
 tion 2.b.), human rights groups assert that family and business ties influence the
 lower courts and undermine their integrity. Judges sometimes fear reassignment or
 having their financial benefits reduced if they render a decision unfavorable to the
 Government, though such practices are reportedly reduced.
 A traditional chief or a customary court try cases involving divorce or inheritance.
 Customary courts, located only in large towns and cities, are headed by a legal prac-
 titioner with basic legal education who is advised by an assessor knowledgeable in
 the society's traditions. The judicial actions of chiefs and customary courts are not
 regulated by code, and defendants may appeal a verdict to the formal court system.
 Women do not have equal legal status with men and do not enjoy the same access
 to legal redress (section 5).
 The law provides that the Government constitute a State Security Court to try
 high crimes against the State in secret, although due process provisions still apply.
 Civil and criminal trials are public except in security-related cases. Defendants have
 the right to counsel, to be present at trial, to confront witnesses, to examine the
 evidence against them, and to appeal verdicts. The Constitution affirms the pre-
 sumption of innocence.
 The law provides for counsel at public expense for minors and indigent defendants
 charged with crimes carrying a sentence of 10 years or more. Although lawyers com-
 ply with government requests to provide counsel, there are generally not remuner-
 ated by the Government.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 requires that police have a search warrant, normally issued by a judge. Police may
 search without warrants when they have strong suspicion that a house shelters
 criminals or stolen property. However, human rights organizations report that police
 often conduct routine searches without warrants.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Vwlations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Government security forces and rebel Tuareg groups engaged in bloody en-
 counters until October when a truce was signed. Therewere numerous reports that
 government forces used excessive violence against both rebels and noncombatants.
 For example, the army killed eight rebels during an attack in August on the electric
 power plant at Tchighozerine in which several soldiers were wounded. Government
 lorces used excessive force in questioning civilians, particularly those of Tuareg
 background (see Section 1.c.). Human rights groups maintain that the military es-
 tablished a security zone in the north to restrict the access of ournalists and to ob-
 scum its activities from public scrutiny. Judicial authorities deny mistreatment of
 rebels detained by the courts but admit that soldiers may have mistreated prisoners
 in transit from the battlefield. Although the Government did not expressly forbid
 journalists to enter the security zone, m practice reporters seldom ventured there.
 
 
 185
 Although some of the attacks were simple banditry, rebels continued a pattern of
 attacking civilian targets to obtain vehicles and other supplies. In August the rebels
 began to attack economic targets and government facilities in the north. To dem-
 onstrate the Government's inability to protect civilians and key facilities, rebels at-
 tacked an electric power plant, a communications ground station, and two large ura-
 nium mines. During these raids, rebels killed a number of civilians as well as gov-
 enent troops. ebel raids resulted in the death of at least 6 civilians as well as
 29 government troops and 37 rebels. Since the Government established a security
 zone in the north and restricted the access of journalists and others, the number
 of casualties on all sides remains unconfirmed.
 Tuaregs raided sedentary camps of relatively prosperous Nigerien Arabs in the
 North until early 1994. Arabs, in turn, formed militias that actively battled Tuaregs.
 Human rights groups charged that the military tolerated, and may have been an
 accomplice in, the formation of these Arab militias. Tuaregs killed a senior Arab mi-
 litia leader in February. Fearing an escalation of violence the armed forces exer-
 cised tighter controls over the Arab militias but continued to use them as guides.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and press. While the Government did not routinely bring suits for the apparent pur-
 pose of intimidating the press, the Government sued a major newspaper-and later
 imprisoned its publisher-for fomenting ethnic division by _publishing a provocative
 letter from one of its readers. The Secretary of State of Government (Prime Min-
 ister's Office) charged the independent paper with fomenting ethnic division, a civil
 crime under Nigeren law. Authorities detained the publisher for 35 days. The same
 publisher was sued for libel on other occasions by various government officials, but
 none of the several suits has been resolved. In another prominent lawsuit brought
 by a high ranking officer accused of plotting a coup two newspapers were found
 guilty of libel and fined. The finances and existence of small newspapers are threat-
 ened by such suits, although to date no newspaper has ceased publication.
 Foreign journals circulate and report freel.  owever, one foreign journalist, who
 entered the country without passing through border controls, then spent 3 weeks
 with Tuareg rebels, had her passport seized and was held under house arrest for
 1 week. She was questioned abut rebel activity and her intentions in Niger before
 having the passport returned and being allowed to leave the country. She was not
 mistreated.
 The permanent Superior Council of Communication (CSC) provided for in the
 Constitution is charged with guaranteeing free and fair access to the media. CSC
 members were finally elected and installed, but the organization is hobbled by a
 limited budget and lack of political direction. The CSC's activities were limitedto
 granting broadcast licenses.It granted the first broadcasting license in February to
 the local affiliate of Radio France International followed in April by a local music
 and call-in station.
 The most important public medium is the government-operated multilanguage
 National Radio Service, which reported on opposition activities. The Government
 publishes the daily Le Sahel and its weekend French edition. There are 12 private
 French and Hausa language and additional political party weeklies or monthlies.
 Newspapers openly criticizc. the Government and gave access to publication by
 Tuareg and labor leaders.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association. Although the Government routinely grants
 permits for demonstrations, it retains the authority to prohibit gatherings either
 under tense social conditions or if sufficient advance notice (48 hours) is not pro-
 vided.
 In April a court found 13 opposition party members guilty of illegally carrying
 arms and damaging public property after their demonstration protesting the cele-
 bration of the first anniversary of the President's investiture.
 Under the Constitution, Nigeriens may form political parties of any kind, except
 those that are based on ethnicity, religion, or region.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Government respects freedom of religion. Most
 Nigeriens practice Islam. Christians (including Jehovah's Witnesses) and Baha'i
 practice freely. Foreign missionaries work freely but must be members of an inter-
 nationally recognizedorganization and registered as a Nigerien association.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for freedom of movement. Among the Hausa and
 Fulani peoples in eastern Niger, some women are cloistered, and can leave their
 homes only if escorted by a male and usually only after dark. Security forces at
 
 
 186
 checkpoints monitor travel of persons and the circulation of goodsparticularly near
 major population centers and sometimes demand extra payments. Attacks by rebels
 or bandits on major routes to the north severely restricted movement. Neither emi-
 gration nor repatriation are restricted.
 There are 3,600 Chadian refugees in Eastern Niger. In addition, several thousand
 Tuaregs from Mali reside in Niger but are not officially registered as refugees. The
 Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and other
 humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees; there were no reports of forced re-
 patriation of refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercised this right in early 1993 in three rounds of elections judged free
 and fair by international observers, after adopting a new Constitution establishing
 the Third Republic in 1992. Citizens aged 18 years and over can vote and balloting
 is by secret ballot. The Constitution provides or a poitical system with checks and
 balances, a strong Presidency, an ethficaly representative 83-seat National Assem-
 bly, and an independent judiciary. Despite a worsening economic situation, a coali-
 tion Government functioned weI until a rift developed in mid-1994 between the
 Prime Minister and his p arty and the remainder of the coalition. The Prime Min-
 ister took his p arty out of the Government in September, leaving a new Prime Min-
 ister from the President's party to lead a minority Government.
 Women do not traditionally play a role in plitics. The societal practice of hus-
 bands' voting their wives' proxy ballots effectively disfranchises many women. This
 practice was widely used in the presidential and National Assembly elections in
 1993. In the National Assembly, 5 of the 83 members are women, and the Govern-
 ment appointed 5 women to ministerial positions. Special electoral districts are de-
 signed to ensure that minority ethnic groups (Toubou, Fulani, Tuareg, and Arabs)
 are represented.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several independent human rights groups and associations operate without gov-
 ernmental hindrance dominant among which are the Nigerien Association for the
 Defense of Human Rights, Democracy, Libe       and Development; the National
 League for Defense of Human Rights; Adalci ("dignity in Hanus); and the Network
 for the Integration and Diffusion of Rights in the rural milieu (known as "RIDD-
 FITLA"). There are several active women's rights groups which, with the with-
 drawal of the draft family code and increased intimidation, lost membership and be-
 came increasingly beleaguered during the year (see Section 5). The International
 Committee of the Red Cross is active in Niger and Amnesty International also vis-
 ited.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on sex, social origin, race, eth-
 nicity, or religion. In practice however, there is discrimination against women, chil-
 dren, ethnic minorities, and disabled persons, including limited economic and politi-
 cal opportunities.
 Women.-Despite the Constitution's provisions for women's rights, the deep-seated
 traditional belief in the submission of women to men results in discrimination in
 the political process (see Section 3), in education (see below), and in employment
 and property rights. Discrimination is worse in rural areas, where women do much
 of the subsistence farming as well as child rearing. Women have made modest in-
 roads in civil service and professional employment but remain under represented.
 Women's inferior legal status, for example, is evident in that while a male head
 of household has certain legal rights divorced or widowed women, even with chil-
 dren, are not considered the head of their household. The Government considered
 a draft family code modeled on codes in other African Muslim countries which in-
 tended to eliminate gender bias in inheritance rights, land tenure, and child cus-
 tody, as well as end the practice of repudiation, which permits a husband to obtain
 an immediate divorce with no further responsibility for his wife or children. In June,
 when Islamic associations condemned it, the Government suspended discussions of
 the proposed code. Islamic militants reportedly threatened women who supported
 the code with physical harm.
 Domestic violence against women is widespread, although firm statistics are lack-
 ing. Wife beating is reportedly common, even in upper social strata. Families often
 intervene to prevent the worst abuses, and women may (and do) divorce because of
 physical abuse. While women have the right to seek redress in the customary or
 
 
 187
 modern courts, few do so out of ignorance of the legal system, fear of social stigma,
 and fear of repudiation. Women s rights organizations report that prostitution is
 often the only economic alternative for a woman who wants to leave her husband.
 There continued to be isolated incidents of violence against women attributed to
 religious motivation. In one widely reported incident in Maradi in April, religious
 extremists physically abused AfricAn women wearing Western    ingecause a re-
 ligious leader blamed the failure of the rains on immoral women.
 Children.-Although the Constitution provides that the State promote children's
 welfare, financial resources are limited. Only about 25 percent of children of pri-
 mary school age actually attend school and about 60 percent of those finishing pri-
 mary school are boys. The ma ori   of young girls are kept at home to work and
 rarely attend school for more than a few years, resulting in a female literacy rate
 of 7 percent, versus 18 percent for males. Tradition among some ethnic groups al-
 lows young girls from rural families to enter marriage agreements on the basis of
 which girls are sent at the age of 10 or 12 to join their husband's family under the
 tutelage of their mother-in-law. There are credible reports of underage girls being
 drawn into prostitution, sometimes with the complicity of the famil.
 According to international experts, female genital mutilation (FGM) is practiced
 by several ethnic groups in the extreme western parts of Niger and in the far east-
 ern areas. While clitoridectomy is sometimes practiced in these two groups, the most
 extreme form, infibulation, is not practiced.
 National/RaciallEthnic Minorities.-Ethnic minorities-Tuareg, Fulani, Toubou,
 Kounouri and Arab--continue to assert that the far more numerous Hausa and
 Djerma ethnic groups discriminate against them. The Hausa and Djerma dominate
 government and business. The Government has supported greater minority rep-
 resentation in the National Assembly and increased education and health care.
 However, nomadic peoples, such as Tuaregs and many Fulani, continue to have less
 access to government services.
 In July, the criminal court in Maradi condemned to life imprisonment 42 Hausa
 farmers found guilty of the 1991 murder of 103 Fulani herders. The Hausa farmers
 bent on vengeance for the presumed murder of one of their kinsmen, slaughtered
 and burned to death the Fulanis in a punitive expedition. The court ordered prison
 sentences ranging from 2 to 20 years for an additional 14 people.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution mandates that the State provide for
 people with disabilities. However, the Government has yet to implement regulations
 which call for accessibility and education for those with special needs.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides formal recognition to
 workers' longstanding right to establish and join trade unions. However, more than
 95 percent of Niger's work force is employed in the nonunionized subsistence agri-
 cultural and petty trading sectors.
 The National Union of Nigerien Workers (USTN), a federation made up of 42
 unions, represents the majority of salary and wage earners; most are government
 employees, such as civil servants, teachers, and employees in state-owned corpora-
 tions. The USTN and the Affiliated Teachers' Union SNEN, profess political auton-
 omy, but like most unions, have informal ties to political parties. During the year,
 labor challenged the Government on the its budget and a new law regulating
 strikes.
 The International Labor Organization (ILO) criticized the law requiring that all
 union management officials be citizens, asserting that this provision serves to re-
 strict the full exercise of the right to elect representatives in full freedom. The Con-
 stitution provides for the right to strike, except for security forces and police. How-
 ever, the police did stage a brief strike in March.
 Also in March, the National Assembly passed a new strike law specifying that
 labor must give notice and begin negotiations before work is stopped; that public
 workers must maintain a minimum level of service during a strike; that the Govern-
 ment can requisition workers to guarantee minimum service; and that striking pub-
 lic sector workers will not be paid for the time they are on strike. The latter condi-
 tion already prevails in the private sector.
 USTN staged general strikes over pay throughout the first half of the year, and
 a 2-month general strike which crippled public administration and reportedly de-
 creased government revenue. Critics alleged USTN corruption led it to terminate
 this strike unsuccessfully, compromising future collective bargaining power. Infor-
 mation workers and researchers, customs workers, and the transport sector each
 struck over unpaid wages or working conditions. All these strikes were legal.
 The USTN is a member of the Organization of African Trade Union Unity and
 abides by that organization's policy of having no formal affiliations outside the Afri-
 
 
 can continent. However, it enjoys assistance from some international unions, and in-
 dividual unions such as the Teacher's Union are affiliated with international trade
 secretariats.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-In addition to the Constitu-
 tion and the Labor Code, there is a Basic Framework Agreement, negotiated by the
 USTN's predecessor, employers, and the Government which defines all classes and
 categories of work, establishes basic conditions of worl, and defines union activities.
 In private and state-owned enterprises, unions widely use their right to bargain col-
 lectively with management without government interference for wages over and
 above the statutory minimum as well as for more favorable work conditions. Collec-
 tive baaining also exists in the public sector. However, since most organized work-
 ers, including teachers, are government employees, the Government is actually in-
 volved in most bargaining agreements. The MSTN represents civil servants in bar-
 gaining with the Government, and labor/management agreements apply uniformly
 to a11 employees.
 The Labor Code is based on ILO principles; it protects the right to organize and
 prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers. Labor unions reported no such dis-
 crimination.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor-The Labor Code prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, except for legally prosecuted prisoners. There were no reports
 of violations.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Child labor in nonindustrial enter-
 prises is permitted by law under certain conditions. Children under 14 must obtain
 special authorization to work, and those aged 14 to 18 years are subject to limita-
 tion on hours (a maximum of 4.5 hours per day) and types of employment (no indus-
 trial work) so that schooling may continue. Minimum compulsory education is 6
 years, but fewer than half of school-age children complete 6 years of education.
 The law requires employers to ensure minimum sanitary working conditions for
 children. Law and practice prohibit child labor in industrial work. Ministry of Labor
 inspectors enforce child labor laws. Child labor is practically nonexistent in the for-
 meal (wage) sector, although children work in the unregulated agricultural, commer-
 cial, and artisan sectors.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Won.-The Labor Code estabishes a minimum wage
 for salaried workers of each class and category within the formal sector. After the
 January devaluation of the CFA franc and April wage scale increases, the lowest
 minimum is approximately $38 (20,500 CFA francs) per month. Additional salary
 is granted for each family member and for such working conditions as night shifts
 and required travel. Minimum wages are not sufficient to provide a decent living
 for workers and their families. Most households have multiple earners (largely infor-
 mal commerce) and rely on the extended family for support.
 The legal workweek is 40 hours with a minimum of one 24-hour rest period. How-
 ever, for certain occupations the Ministry of Labor authorizes longer workweeks--
 up to 72 hours. There were no reports of violations.
 The Labor Code also establishes occupational safety and health standards; Min-
 istry of Labor inspectors enforce these standards. Due to staff shortages, however,
 inspectors focus on safety violations only in the most dangerous industries: mining,
 building, and manufacturing. Although generally satisfied with the safety equip-
 ment provided by employers, citing in particular adequate protection from radiation
 in the uranium mines, unions say workers should be better informed of the risks
 posed by their jobs.
