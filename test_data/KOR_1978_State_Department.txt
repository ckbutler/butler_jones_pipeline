 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 The division of the Korean Peninsula and the continuing
 threat of North Korean aggression remain the pervasive
 factors in South Korea's national life.
 The present Government had its origins in 1961 when
 then General Park Chung Hee led a bloodless coup
 against the government which had followed the overthrow
 of President Syngman Rhee by the student revolution of
 1960. General Park then retired from the military and
 as a civilian was elected President by direct elections
 in 1963, 1967, and 1971.
 In 1972 a new Yushin (meaning "reform") Constitution
 was adopted through national referendum, a referendum
 which was criticized by some because it took place
 under martial law restrictions. The new Constitution
 expanded presidential powers greatly and provided for
 selection of the President by indirect election.
 The 1972 Constitution withdrew certain rights pre-
 viously respected, including the right to habeas
 corpus, and gave the President the power to take
 7necessary emergency measures" in time of "natural
 calamity or a grave financial or economic crisis, and
 in case the national security or the public safety and
 order is seriously threatened or anticipated to be
 threatened."
 The Government has used the power granted under its
 authority to take emergency measures to restrict
 freedom of expression and political activity.   Emergency
 Measure No. 9 (EM-9) prohibits the dissemination of
 false rumors, criticism of the Constitution or advocacy
 of its reform, media reporting of such activities, and
 unauthorized student political activity.
 The Korean Government contends that restrictions on
 civil and political liberty are needed to present a
 solid front in the face of a continuing and dangerous
 
 (374)
 
 
 375
 threat of North Korean aggression. Most Koreans share
 the Government's assessment of the danger from the
 North, but a significant number question whether this
 threat justifies the serious restriction which has been
 imposed. Some Christian church groups and students
 have taken active roles in opposing present controls.
 The Department continues to view the restrictions on
 the peaceful expression of dissent and other controls
 in Korea, including those under the Emergency Measures,
 as excessive in relation to the threat under which the
 nation lives; and as contrary to international human
 rights standards.
 In a positive year-end development, on December 27, 1978,
 the Government released former Presidential candidate
 and opposition leader Kim Tae-chung and about thirty
 other violators of EM-9. Mr. Kim resumed many of his
 former activities, including sharp criticism of the
 Government.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The Government of the Republic of Korea states that it
 does not employ torture or abuse prisoners. There is
 a difference of opinion among dissidents on the
 question whether the Government has recently resorted
 to torture.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There were some unconfirmed but credible allegations
 of police brutality during arrests and of isolated
 instances of prisoner abuse during 1978. For example,
 there were reports that some participants arrested in
 September after an attempted street demonstration were
 mistreated. All allegations were brought to the
 attention of the Government of the Republic of Korea,
 which denied having abused or tortured any prisoners.
 
 
 376
 Within prison, the physical conditions for political
 prisoners are no worse than those for common criminals,
 and may sometimes be better. Even so, there have been
 allegations of political prisoners being held in tiny
 cells for long periods. Other allegations of abusive
 treatment reaching the Department in 1978 involved
 harsh suppression of a prison riot and beatings for
 infractions of prison rules. In response to these
 allegations, the Government stated that prison authorities
 had used only force sufficient to restore order in
 the prison, and that prisoners were punished in connection
 with the incident only in accordance with existing law
 and regulations. Lawyers find that EM-9 prisoners are
 less accessible than non-political offenders and that
 their conversations with such clients are more frequently
 monitored.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Under EM-9, the Korean Government has the authority for
 arrest, detention, search, or seizure without a warrant.
 In addition, EM-9 authorizes indefinite detention
 without charge, although such detentions are seldom for
 long periods. Temporary house arrest and brief detention
 for questioning are frequently used to prevent political
 activists from carrying out demonstrations or in the
 hope of halting other anti-Government political activities.
 Although large numbers of individuals have been apprehended
 in the past following demonstrations or other incidents,
 they have not been imprisoned for long terms without a
 trial on charges of violating specific laws or Emergency
 Measures. Upon the inauguration of President Park for
 a new term on December 27, 1978, the Government released
 opposition leader Kim Tae-chung and about thirty other
 political prisoners along with over 2,200 common
 criminals. Mr. Kim Chi-ha, a dissident poet, also had
 his life sentence for violation of the Anti-Communist
 Law reduced to twenty years. As of the end of December,
 the Department of State estimated that between 180 and
 220 persons were probably still serving terms for
 politically motivated charges, and church groups
 estimated that there were about 280 such persons.
 
 
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials under both Emergency Measures and regular law
 are now public. As far as is known, all persons
 detained in 1978 on charges under the Emergency Measures
 were tried in due course. In 1978, the Government made
 increased use of misdemeanor charges for quick dis-
 position with light sentences (up to one month) of
 cases involving demonstrators, rather than using more
 serious Emergency Measure charges (comparable to our
 felony laws), which could result in long prison terms.
 The Department of State has no information of harass-
 ment by government of legal counsel or witnesses for
 the defense in politically sensitive trials in 1978.
 In the past, there had been credible charges against
 the Government on this score.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 Police and security officials may enter and search the
 homes of suspects without warrant under the provisions
 of EM-9. There are sporadic reports of the use of this
 authority in connection with cases of political dis-
 senters.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 South Korea is emerging as an economic power following
 more than a decade of impressive growth. The corner-
 stone of the Korean Government's popular support has
 been its economic performance, both in stimulating
 growth and in managing that growth in a way that most
 elements of the society were able to share in it.
 Per capita Gross National Product in South Korea has
 grown from less than $200 in 1968 to more than $1,000
 in 1978, and the Government's policies to promote
 economic growth have produced high levels of employment
 and steadily higher real income. In 1977, the economy
 created 373,000 new jobs, unemployment was four percent,
 and real wages increased 19.8 percent except in
 
 
 378
 agriculture. In 1978, labor unions estimated the
 increase in wages in contracts negotiated through
 August to be about thirty percent in nominal terms,
 without adjusting for substantial inflation. Overall,
 labor income as a percentage of national income has
 steadily increased from 30.9 percent in 1965 to 41.7
 percent in 1976.
 The World Bank has praised the success of the Koreans
 in maintaining a relatively egalitarian pattern of
 income distribution, including reducing the disparity
 between urban and rural family income, in providing
 widespread and useful educational opportunities, and in
 making available productive employment for a growing
 labor force (while at the same time reducing the rate
 of population growth). Much remains to be done, and
 public health care, vocational education, labor relations,
 and industrial safety are priority areas for the
 current Five-Year Economic Development Plan (1977-
 1981). The income tax system is progressive.
 Despite rapid progress in diversifying Korea's industrial
 base, the production of labor-intensive goods, particulari
 textiles, remains important. The workers in these
 industries, usually women, often labor in cramped and
 unhealthy quarters for long hours at low wages, violating
 Korea's own minimum labor standards. Government
 enforcement of these standards is inhibited by fears of
 driving smaller, marginally viable companies out of
 business and throwing the employees out of work.
 In the field of education, the Government announced in
 August 1978 a major expansion of higher education which
 is expected to increase first-year enrollment in Korea's
 colleges and universities by 38 percent. In the years
 ahead, this will increase substantially total enrollment
 in Korean higher education, access to which is allocated
 by a merit system.
 In the field of social welfare, the Korean Government
 inaugurated a Medical Protection System in January 1977
 to provide free health care for certain destitute
 persons and partial medical assistance to needy persons.
 There is also a Medical Insurance System for workers in
 firms employing 500 employees or more. The Government
 investigates and prosecutes corruption on a regular
 basis.
 
 
 379
 Korea is one of the most racially and linguistically
 homogeneous countries in the world. The largest
 minority is the Chinese, who number no more than
 30,000. The mixed-blood offspring of United States
 servicemen (Amerasians), who are estimated to number
 several thousand, suffer considerable social, educa-
 tional, and economic discrimination and are not allowed
 to serve in the military.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a.   Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Political liberties and freedom of expression are
 significantly circumscribed by EM-9, as described
 above. The measure prescribes prison terms of one to
 fifteen years for prohibited acts and gives the Govern-
 ment authority to close down universities, broadcasting
 stations, and newspapers and dismiss any member of
 their staff or administration. Although calling for
 trial by civil rather than iilitary court, it permits
 arrest, detention, search, and seizure without warrant.
 The Department of State estimates that, since its
 promulgation, about 600 to 700 persons have been
 charged with violations of EM-9, although many more
 have been arrested and held for short periods of
 interrogation before being released.
 The Anti-Communist Law of 1961 is a further restraint
 on civil liberties, particularly in the way it is
 applied. This law provides for imprisonment for not
 more than seven years for any person involved in the
 activities of "anti-state" organizations, including
 Communist organizations. In 1978, the trial and
 conviction under the Anti-Communist Law of a professor
 who had edited an anthology of articles on China by
 foreign writers, including prominent Americans, drew
 considerable domestic and foreign attention and criti-
 cism. In addition, the Korean National Assembly passed
 laws in 1975 making it a criminal offense to criticize
 the Government to foreigners and providing for political
 
 
 380
 surveillance, limitations on residence, and preventive
 detention for former "anti-state" prisoners. The
 preventive detention measure was applied for the first
 time in May of 1978, when a prisoner convicted of
 espionage was not released upon the expiration of his
 prison term.
 In 1978 the Government sought to avoid formal arrest,
 trial, and long-term detention of political dissidents,
 who for their part stepped up their political challenge.
 Instead, the Government used preventive tactics. In
 anticipation of challenges--especially from college
 students--security forces stepped up surveillance to
 frustrate efforts to mount demonstrations off campus or
 to undertake other political activities. Similarly,
 dissident activity which as recently as 1977 would have
 provoked court trials and stiff sentences was dealt
 with through questioning at police stations and tempo-
 rary detention or house arrest lasting from a few hours
 to a week or two. Although these tactics spared many
 dissidents (despite their increased political activity)
 from the full weight of EM-9; the new policy gave them
 only limited opportunity to publicize their viewpoints.
 However, arrests, trials, and expulsions from uni-
 versities, particularly of students who had organized
 and led demonstrations, continued to take place. Some
 faculty members also lost their positions, and a few
 were arrested when they protested these government
 actions against students.
 Continuing a practice begun in 1977, political prisoners
 were released on significant occasions in 1978: eight
 on Buddha's Birthday (May 14), 22 on Independence Day
 (August 15), and about thirty on the occasion of
 President Park's inauguration (December 27). The
 latter release included former Presidential candidate
 Kim Tae-chung, as well as a large number of common
 criminals.
 The press, although still under significant'restraints,
 continued the expansion begun in 1977 of its coverage
 and discussion of controversial issues, including the
 influence-buying scandal in Washington, fuller reporting
 
 
 of National Assembly debates, and aggressive coverage
 of three domestic Korean scandals in the late summer of
 1978. Although direct criticism of the Yushin Constitu-
 tion or President Park is still forbidden, many of the
 press-control aspects of EM-9 were relaxed in practice.
 Nevertheless, the press remains wary of what it prints,
 and periodicals were occasionally seized, as in the
 confiscation in September of a prominent intellectual
 monthly and suspension of its publication for three
 months. One foreign reporter was barred from entering
 the country in early 1978 as a result of writing
 articles which the Government considered consistently
 biased.
 Religious activities are given wide latitude and no re-
 strictions exist on proselytizing by any sect. Many
 foreign missionaries are active in Korea and most
 pursue their religious work freely. Missionaries of
 the Jehovah's Witnesses, however, found that, while
 they could work freely in Korea, new missionaries could
 not obtain entry permits, nor could resident missionaries
 be assured of re-entry permits if they left Korea. In
 1978, one foreign missionary associated with Christian
 labor activists did not receive a renewal of his
 residence visa and therefore had to leave the country.
 Some clergymen and Christian laymen are critics of
 Government political, economic, and social policies,
 and consequently there is tension between the state and
 certain segments of the Christian community.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 There is freedom of movement within the country. There
 are some restrictions on foreign travel for political,
 security, and balance of payments reasons. By the
 early 1980s the Korean Government expects that its
 foreign exchange position will permit unrestricted
 tourism abroad. The Government has a liberal emigra-
 tion policy; more than 27,000 Koreans emigrate to the
 United States each year.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There is universal suffrage for adults over twenty.
 Aside from the large body of Presidential electors, the
 
 
 382
 
 only directly elected officials in Korea are 154
 National Assembly representatives (two-thirds of the
 whole). Most effective power is centralized in the
 Office of the President. He appoints the Prime Minister,
 the Cabinet, one-third (77 members) of the National
 Assembly, and all local government officials, and may
 suspend individual rights by emergency decree.
 In 1978, South Korea held its first nation-wide elections
 since 1973. Korea's electoral college, the National
 Council for Unification (NCU), is chosen by direct
 popular vote, although candidates may not campaign on
 political party tickets and campaigning is subject to
 strict legal constaints. Voting for the NCU took place
 without incident in May, with the participation of over
 78 percent of the eligible voters and with more than
 5,400 candidates vying for the 2,583 seats in 1,665
 separate constituencies. In July, the NCU in turn re-
 elected the President all but unanimously to another
 six-year term.
 In subsequent National Assembly elections in December,
 473 candidates competed for 154 seats. Since one-third
 of its membership is appointed, control of the Assembly
 was never at issue. However, the chief opposition
 party scored a psychological coup by out-polling the
 government party by one percentage point in the popular
 vote. By most accounts the election was free from
 government manipulation.
 The government party nevertheless won 68 seats, re-
 taining its plurality among elected members, but the
 chief opposition party won 61 seats, significantly
 reducing the margin between the two major parties.
 Independents (candidates not nominated by a political
 party) took most of the remaining seats. The 77
 percent rate of voter participation compared favorably
 with the 73 percent turnout in 1973.
 
 
 383
 Since World War II, Assemblymen have generally enjoyed
 very high prestige in Korea. Following the introduction
 of the present Yushin Constitution in 1972, however,
 the public has correctly perceived the reduced influence
 and independence of the National Assembly, and the
 prestige of Assemblymen has declined correspondingly.
 The 1977 Assembly session witnessed a marked revival
 of active debate and criticism of the Government's
 policies, largely in anticipation of the elections in
 December 1978 for the next six-year term, but the 1978
 session was remarkably tranquil, perhaps because the
 legislators were preoccupied with party nominations.
 Grass roots exchanges between the people and the
 bureaucracy take place through a nation-wide system of
 village councils and self-help projects. In addition,
 the Government maintains extensive domestic intelli-
 gence nets, which at once inhibit freedom of expression
 and supply reports of discontent and criticism.
 Trade union organization is permitted but unions may
 not strike. Collective bargaining contracts, covering
 960,000 workers, result in better wages and working
 conditions for unionized workers than for their
 unorganized fellows. Low wages and long working hours
 remain continuing problems, particularly in smaller,
 marginal companies. Labor conditions in such companies
 have drawn sharp attacks from foreign and Korean
 social critics, although even these workers are
 experiencing steady gains in real income. As part of
 their social ministry, a few Methodist ministers have
 attempted, through their Urban Industrial Mission, to
 organize textile workers. Their efforts have pre-
 cipitated complex conflicts among management, government,
 and rival unions, involving counter demonstrations,
 occasional confrontations, firings, and some arrests.
 In a small but nevertheless significant gesture toward
 improving the legal status of women, the National
 Assembly modified the Inheritance Law in December 1977
 to provide equal shares for the wife and first son in
 inheritance of the husband's estate. Despite the
 deeply-ingrained Confucian tradition of male superiority,
 
 
 384
 
 there is an extensive system of women's organizations
 throughout Korea, and these organizations can be
 expected to continue to press for further improvements
 in the legal status of women. Moreover, women in
 Korea have long had a stronger voice in society than
 their legal status would suggest.
 4.   Government Attitudes and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Korean Government has generally allowed outside
 human rights groups to visit and interview opposition
 figures, with few formal restrictions, although in
 1975 an Amnesty International Mission encountered some
 official obstacles. Newsmen also have freedom of
 movement within South Korea. A July 1978 study by the
 Congressional Research Service of the Library of
 Congress noted that several United States Congressmen
 visited Korea in 1977 and discussed the issue of human
 rights with the government, the most conspicuous visit
 being that by Members of the House International
 Relations Committee in April 1977. The Government has
 not allowed interviews with prisoners.
