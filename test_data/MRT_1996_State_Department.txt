 MAURITANIA
 Mauritania is an Islamic republic. The 1991 Constitution provides for a civilian
 government composed of a dominant executive branch, a Senate and National As-
 sembly, and an independent judiciary. President Maaouya oud Sid'Ahmed T aya
 has governed since 194, first as head of a military junta, and since the 1992 elec-
 tion as head of a civilian government. President Taya won 62 percent of the vote
 in the four-way presidential contest, which was widely regarded as fraudulent. Most
 opposition parties boycotted subsequent parliamentary elections. Opposition parties
 participated in Senate elections in 1994 and 1996 but gained only one seat. In the
 country's first multiparty legislative elections held in October, only 1 opposition and
 6 independent candidates were elected to the 79-member National Assembly. The
 outcome of the election was marred by fraud on all sides and pervasive government
 intervention, representing a backward step in the countys efforts to establish a
 pluralist democracy.
 The Government maintains order with regular armed forces, the National Guard,
 the Gendarmerie (a specialized corps of paramilitary police), and the police. The
 Ministry of Defense directs the armed forces and Gendarmerie; the Ministry of Inte-
 rior directs the National Guard and police. The armed forces are responsible for na-
 tional defense. The National Guard performs police functions throughout the coun-
 try in areas in which city police are not present. The Gendarmerie is a paramilitary
 group responsible for maintenance of civil order in and outside metropolitan areas.
 Security forces are under the full control of the Government and responsible to it.
 Some members of the security forces committed human rights abuses.
 Mauritania, with a population of 2.28 million, has a generally market-oriented
 economy based on subsistence farming, herding, and a small commercial sector.
 Drought desertification, insect infestation, rapid7urbanization, extensive unemploy-
 ment, pervasive poverty, and a burdensome foreign debt handicap the economy. In-
 adequate recent rain fall h as also contributed to urbanization, further straining gov-
 ernment finances. Annu ial  capits naionl income has declined in recent years
 and is estimated at $480 (1995 figure). Mauritania receives foreign assistance from
 various bilateral and multilateral sources.
 The Government's human rights record was poor, and problems remain in certain
 areas. Democratic institutions are still rudimentary, and the Government cir-
 cumscribes citizens right to change their governmuent. Poice often used brutal meth-
 ods, including excessive force and torture, as well as arbitrary arrest, illegal
 searches, and incommunicado prearraignment detention. Pretrial detention is often
 very lengthy. The Government has failed to bring to justice officials who commit
 abuses, Pon conditions are harsh and unhealthy. Although the Government has
 instituted some judicial reforms, the executive continues to exercise significant pres-
 sure on the judiciary, and in practice the right to a fair trial frequently is restricted.
 The Government broadened the scope for opposition activity and improved its access
 to government-owned media, but continuedto seize and suspend publications, and
 limit freedom of religion. Societal discrimination against women continues and fe-
 male genital mutilation remains a serious concern. Ethnic tensions are gradually
 easing, but many members of the Halpulaar, Soninke, and Wolof ethnic groups are
 underrepresented and feel excluded from effective political representation.
 The Governent took further steps to resolve a serious ause from the 1989-91
 period, in which approximately 70,000 Mauritanians were expelled or fled, by facili-
 tating cooperation between the Mauritanian Red Crescent Association and the Unit-
 ed Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, to assist returnees from the refugee
 camps in Senegal. The UNHCR estimates that 30,000-35,000 have returned;
 10,000-15,000 during the year. The Government has yet to address fully another
 major abuse from the 1989-91 period, when 503 members of the military were
 killed, tortured, and maimed, almost entirely from the Halpulaar ethnic group. In
 1993 the Parliament passed an amnesty billto preclude legal pursuit of those re-
 sponsible. The Government has given pensions to the widows of some of those killed
 and in 1996 extended that benefit to some of those who survived the purge. How-
 
 
 ever, the Government has not acknowledged responsibility or wrongdoing nor has
 it provided honorable discharge papers to survivors or other compensation to fami-
 lies of those killed to enable their reintegration into society.
 Slavery, in the form of unofficial forced or involuntary servitude, exists. Many per-
 sons continue to live in conditions of unofficial paid or unpaid servitude and many
 persons still consider themselves to be slaves.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings, but one person is known to have died while in police custody. A Burkinabe
 arrested in Nouadhibou in June died in police custody; police stated that the cause
 of death was suicide, although credible observers believe that police mistreatment
 was the cause of death.
 Extrajudicial killings from past years, primarily of Afro-Mauritanians (members
 of one of the three sub-Saharan ethnic groups, Halpulaar, Soninke, or Wolof), re-
 mained unresolved. The principal example of such killing involves the 1990-91
 deaths while in military custody of 503 largely Halpulaar and Soninke military per-
 sonnel and civilians detained in the investigation of an alleged coup attempt. The
 military has not released the results of its 1991 internal investigation, and in 1993
 the National Assembly passed an amnesty law that prevents any charges from being
 brought against members of the armed forces, security forces, or other citizens in-
 volved in the abuses committed between January 1990 and April 1992. In July
 1993, the Government began to provide pension benefits to some of the widows and
 families of those killed, and in 1996 the Government recognized the prior Govern-
 ment service of some of the civilian survivors and began to pay them pensions. How-
 ever, the Government has not given military survivors the discharge papers that are
 necessary for alternative employment.
 The Government's failure to bring to justice officials who commit abuses and fail
 to observe legal procedures has contributed to widespread popular dissatisfaction
 with the judicial system and the belief that security officials are a force apart from
 government authority and not subject to legal restraints.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture and other forms of cruel or inhuman punishment, but the
 police continue on occasion to beat criminal suspects while in custody. Police in
 some instances used excessive force to break up peaceful demonstrations or disperse
 crowds. There were credible reports that some of those arrested in June in a crack-
 down on local drug traffickers were tortured by police during pretrial detention.
 Methods of torture include beatings, around the clock questioning, and, in one in-
 stance, a detainee was subjected to the "jaguar" (in which an individual's hands and
 feet are bound, the individual is suspended from a pole from his hands and feet,
 and he is beaten). Authorities have not tried or punished persons suspected of com-
 mitting such abuses.
 Prison conditions are harsh and do not meet minimum international standards.
 There is severe overcrowding, unsanitary conditions, and inadequate food and medi-
 cal treatment. The independent press and human rights activists regularly report
 the deaths of prison inmates; authorities cite natural causes, although witnesses
 claimed to have evidence of mistreatment. There was also a report of a detainee's
 death (see Section L.a.). The central prison in Nouakchott, which was built for a
 prison population of 200 men, now houses more than 700. Observers report better
 conditions at the women's prison and children's detention center in Nouakchott. A
 French nongovernmental organization (NGO), Pharmaciens sans Frontieres, which
 was asked in 1994 by the Government to coordinate international assistance for a
 large-scale project to improve overall prison conditions, completed its plans in 1995
 and is soliciting international assistance. In conjunction with its recommendations,
 the Government is enlarging the central prison in Nouakchott, and is building a
 new prison in Akjoujt.
 The Government permits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides for due process
 and the presumption of innocence until proven guilty by an established tribunal. It
 stipulates that authorities cannot arrest, detain, prosecute, or punish anyone except
 as provided for under the law. Actual application of these safeguards continued to
 vary widely from case to case.
 The law requires that courts review the legality of a person's detention within 48
 hours of arrest. The police may extend the perio for another 48 hours, and a pros-
 ecutor or court may detain persons for up to 30 days in national security cases. Only
 
 
 after the prosecutor submits charges does a suspect have the right to contact an at-
 torney.
 During the June crackdown against drug traffickers, authorities held suspects in
 prearraignment detention in excess of the legally established limit, but did grant de-
 tainees access to counsel and family. There were credible reports that police de-
 tained other persons incommunicado and without access to counsel for extended pe-
 riods prior to arraignment, although human rights activists report that police are
 showing greater respect for legally mandated procedures. Pretrial detention after ar-
 raignment is extensive, and approximately 50 percent of the prison population has
 not been tried.
 Some indicted prisoners are released before trial without explanation; familial,
 tribal, or political connections may explain some of these cases. There is a provision
 for granting bail, but it is rarely used.
 Occasional reports of arbitrary arrests and intimidation committed by security
 forces continued, particularly among returned refugees in communities along the
 Senegal River, but the extent of abuses declined, as the Government, in conjunction
 with the UNHCR and Mauritanian Red Crescent Society, made efforts to resettle
 returnees (see Section 2.d.).
 The Government does not employ forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Although the Constitution provides for the inde-
 pendence of the judiciary, in practice the executive branch exercises significant pres-
 sure on the judiciary through its ability to appoint and influence judges. In addition,
 the judicial system's fairness is limited by poorly educated and poorly trained judges
 who are susceptible to social, financial, tribal, and personal pressures.
 The judicial system includes lower, middle, and upper level courts, each with spe-
 cific jurisdictions. A dual system of courts, one based on modern law and one based
 on Shari'a, has been replaced by a single system as the country moves to a modern-
 ized legal system that is in conformity with the principles of Shari'a. Departmental,
 regional, and labor tribunals are the principal instances at the lower level. The 53
 departmental tribunals, composed of a president and magistrates with traditional
 Islamic legal training, hear civil cases involving sums less than $72 (10,000 UM)
 and family issues (e.g., domestic, divorce, and inheritance cases). Thirteen regional
 tribunals accept appeals in commercial and civil matters from the departmental tri-
 bunals and hear misdemeanors. Three labor tribunals, composed of a president and
 two assessors (one who represents labor and one who represents employers), serve
 as final arbiters for labor disputes. At the middle level, three courts of appeal, each
 with two chambers (a civil and commercial chamber, and a mixed chamber) hear
 appeala from the regional courts and have original jurisdiction for felonies. Nomi-
 nlyindependent, the Supreme Court is headed by a magistrate appointed to a 5-
 year term by the President. The Supreme Court reviews decisions and rulings made
 by the courts of appeal to determine their compliance with the law and procedure.
 Constitutional review is the purview of a six-member Constitutional Council, com-
 posed of three members named by the President, two by the National Assembly
 President, and one by the Senate President. Annual review of judicial decisions is
 undertaken by the Supreme Council of the Magistrature, over which the President
 presides; the President and Senior Vice President of the Supreme Court, the M-
 ister of Justice, three magistrates, and representatives from the Senate and Na-
 tional Assembly are members of this Council. The annual review is intended to de-
 termine whether courts applied the law correctly and followed proper procedures.
 All defendants, regardless of the court or their ability to pay, have the legal right
 to representation by counsel during the proceedings, which are open to the public.
 If defendants lack the ability to pay for counsel, the court appoints an attorney,
 from a list prepared by the national order of lawyers, who provides defense free of
 charge. The law provides that defendants may confront witnesses, present evidence,
 and appeal their sentences, and these rights are generally observed in practice.
 Because Shari'a provides the legal principles upon which the law and legal proce-
 dure are based, courts do not in all cases treat women as equals of men, or exam-
 ple, the testimony of two women is necessary to equal that of one man. In addition,
 in awarding an indemnity to the family of a woman who has been killed, the courts
 grant oniyhalf the amount they would award for a man's death. There re no fe-
 male magstrates. However, for commercial and other modern issues not specifically
 addressedtby Shari'a, the law and courts treat women and men equally.
 In January the Government, with international assistance,began a far-reaching
 effort to reprove judicial performance and independence. A training program to im-
 prove the skills of magistrates was begn, an  in  ay the Government increased
 the salaries of magistrates and police officials in an attempt to combat corruption
 and improve independence.
 
 
 In January, in an important display of judicial independence, the December 1995
 convictions of Baathists for membership in an illegal political organization were
 overturned by the appellate judge, whose decision was based largely on his finding
 that security forces and the prosecution had failed to follow legally required proce-
 dures for interrogation and finding evidence.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 requires judicial warrants in order to execute home searches, but the authorities
 often ignore this requirement. During the detention of drug traffickers, authorities
 conducted searches of their residences without warrants and also failed to submit
 the required reports on the results of these searches to the prosecutor.
 Government surveillance of dissidents and the political opposition is believed to
 continue, although the extent to which the Government used informants is un-
 known.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, but the Government continues to restrict these rights through
 prepublication press censorship by the Interior Ministry. NGO's and the privately
 owned press openly criticized the Government and its leaders. Antigovernment
 tracts, newsletters, and etitions circulate widely in Nouakchott and other towns.
 All newspapers and political parties must register with the Ministry of the Inte-
 rior. Although the Government did not refuse to register any journal, it suspended
 for 3 months the right to publish of two independent weeklies, Mauritanie Nouvelles
 in April and Le Calame in October, in both their French and Arabic editions. Some
 37 independent, privately owned newspapers were published during the year, many
 on an irregular basis. For the most part, these journals are weeklies, published in
 Arabic or French, and reach limited audiences. Mauritanie Nouvelles experimented
 for several months with daily publication, but for financial reasons reverted to
 weekly publication. Several journals increased the frequency of their publication
 prior to the National Assembly elections. Readership of the independent press in-
 creased, in particular during the electoral period. Independent journals reported
 openly and critically on the opposition and government alike, and published party
 declarations and tracts without government censure or restraint.
 The Ministry of the Interior reviews all newspaper copy prior to publication. The
 Press Law provides that the Minister of the Interior can stop publication of material
 discrediting Islam or threatening national security. Although the Ministry did not
 excise material from journals or otherwise censor individual articles, the authorities
 seized 23 individual issues of various journals; by corparison, in 1995 14 individual
 issues were seized. The Government provided no specific reason for the seizures.
 The electronic media (radio and television) and two daily newspapers, Horizon
 and Chaab, are government owned and operated. Radio is the most important me-
 dium in reaching the public, and the official media strongly support government
 policies. The law requires both radio and television to provide equa broadcast time
 to all political parties during electoral campaigns, which they did during the Senate
 and National Assembly elections. Although government-owned Horizon and Chaab
 offered to publish free of charge a limited number of communiques by political par-
 ties, they refused during the electoral campaign to publish some opposition party
 declarations because they viewed them as inflammatory. Opposition parties' access
 to radio broadcast facilities is sharply limited at other times. However, in a signifi-
 cant departure from past practice, government-owned media provided limited but
 factual coverage of the activities of opposition political parties prior to the National
 Assembly elections. The Government granted permission to a French radio network
 to transmit locally, but denied private applications to establish radio stations.
 The one university is government funded and operated. Academic freedom is gen-
 erally respected, and there were no cases in which the Government prevented re-
 search or publication, or censored lectures.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, and for the most part the Government respects
 these rights, although there were occasions when it restricted public gatherings. The
 law requires that all recognized political parties and NGO's apply to the local pre-
 fect for permission for large meetings or assemblies. Permission is generally freely
 granted, and although there were no known instances in which a prefect denied per-
 mission for gatherings of o pposition political parties, authorities impeded access to
 some meetings. Although the two recognized labor confederations held Labor Day
 rallies, authorities in Nouakchott denied permission to the Free Confederation of
 Mauritanian Workers (CLTM) to march, on the grounds that it was not recognized
 by the Government (see Section 6.a).
 
 
 177
 The number of political parties, labor unions and NGO's continued to increase.
 Some 21 political parties and a wide array of NGO's, many of them highly critical
 of the Government, met openly, issued public statements, and chose their own lead-
 ership. The Government in January issued new regulations to facilitate the estab-
 lishnent of NGO's engaged in economic and social development, environmental pro-
 tection, and humanitarian assistance. These streamlined procedures facilitated the
 recognition of several existing NGO's and led to the establishment and recognition
 of a large number of new NGO's. The Government has not yet granted some NGO's
 official standing but allowed them to operate. Among these is the Mauritanian Asso-
 ciation for Human Rights; the Government claims that it appeals to specific ethnic
 groups, namely the Afro-Mauritanian community, and is a potentially divisive force.
 The Government also has not recognized two antislavery NGO's, the independent
 "SOS-Esclaves" and the progovernment "National Committee for the Eradication of
 the Vestiges of Slavery in Mauritania." However, the Government allows these asso-
 ciations to function, issue reports and statements, and, in the case of SOS-Esclaves,
 assist individuals in their dealings with the Government to resolve problems.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The 1991 Constitution established Mauritania as an Is-
 lamic republic and decrees that Islam is the religion of its people and the State. All
 but a small number of Mauritanians are Sunni Muslims and are prohibited by their
 religion from converting to another religion. The Government prohibits proselytizing
 by non-Muslims. Christian churches have been established in Nouakchott, Atar,
 Zouerate, Nouadhibou, and Rosso. The expatriate community of Christians and the
 few Mauritanian citizens who are considered Christians from birth practice their re-
 ligion openly and freely in these churches. Mauritanian Muslims freely attend
 Christian weddings and funerals when invited and on occasion have performed the
 formal witness role at Catholic weddings. The possession of Bibles and other Chris-
 tian religious materials in private homes is not illegal, although there are confirmed
 cases in which authorities have detained and harassed individuals who have shared
 such materials with others.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement and residence with-
 in all parts of the territory, and guarantees the freedom to enter and leave. Histori-
 cally there were few restrictions on travel in Mauritania's nomadic society. With ur-
 banization and automobile travel, the Government set up regular road checkpoints
 where the Gendarmerie checks papers of travelers. The Government imposed no
 nighttime curfews. There were no reported cases of persons being denied passports
 for political reasons.
 The Government cooperates with the Office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting ref-
 ugees. The UNHCR operates a camp for Malians in eastern Mauritania. Refugees
 from other countries reside in the country as well. The Government has provided
 first asylum to Malians and others in the recent past. While many Malians have
 returned to their country, some 25,000 continue to receive first asylum.
 Of the approximately 70,000 Afro-Mauritanians who were expelled by Mauritania
 or fled to Senegal during the 1989-91 crisis, the UNHCR estimates that 30,000 to
 35,000 have returned; 10,000 to 15,000 of these in 1996. An estimated 50,000 to
 55,000 refugees remain in refugee settlements in Senegal, including 15,000 children
 born there since 1989. Many of the 15,000 Mauritanian Halpulaar who took refuge
 in Mali during the crisis have integrated into the population and 5,000 are esti-
 mated to have returned to Mauritania. The UNHCR discontinued at the end of 1994
 the limited assistance it had been providing to them. According to the UNHCR, the
 return of refugees is accelerating and the Government is making satisfactory efforts
 to assist those who return from Senegal. In June the UNHCR and the Ministry of
 Interior signed an agreement under which the UNHCR will provide assistance for
 government efforts to issue identity and other documents to returnees in the
 riverine area. Authorities actively identified projects that were undertaken by the
 UNHCR, the Mauritanian Red Crescent Society (CRM), and NGO's under the
 UNHCR-financed "special plan for rapid insertion to assist returnees. The Govern-
 ment began to issue identification cards to some, and returned land, houses, and
 even personalproperty when it could be located and identified. Many whole villages
 and almost all Peulh (nomadic herders of the Halpulaar ethnic group) have re-
 turned.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government, but
 the Government circumscribes it in practice. The 1992 multiparty election of a civil-
 ian president ended 14 years of military rule, but both the opposition and inter-
 
 
 178
 national observers concluded that the elections were fraudulent. The military con-
 tinued to provide strong support to the regime. Although all ministerial-level posi-
 tions were filled by civilians, some members of the former Military Council, in addi-
 tion to President Taya, remained in positions of power within the executive branch,
 the National Assembly, the armed forces, and government-owned enterprises.
 In the country's first multiparty legislative elections held in October, only 1 oppo-
 sition and 6 independent candidates were elected to the 79-member National Assem-
 bly. The outcome of the elections was marred by fraud on all sides, pervasive inter-
 vention by government and election officials, and use of government resources to
 support candidates from the ruling PRDS party. Although the Government made
 procedural improvements that resulted in orderly voting, the elections represent a
 backward step in the country's efforts to establish a pluralist democracy.
 Women have the right to vote, and are active in election campaigns, although few
 are in positions of political leadership. There are seven women in senior government
 positions, including one Cabinet member, one mayor, and several in the office of the
 Presidency. There are three female members of the National Assembly (including
 one Haratine and one Soninke from the Forgeron caste), but no female members in
 the Senate. Halpulaars, Soninkes, and Wolofs are underrepresented in senior Gov-
 ernment positions. Of the Government's 23 ministerial posts, 1 incumbent is
 Haratine, 3 Halpulaar, 1 Soninke, and 1 Wolof; the remainder are of either White
 Moor or of mixed White Moor/Haratine ethnicity (see Section 5).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are an increasing number of human rights organizations. The oldest is the
 Mauritanian League for Human Rights, an independent but government-recognized
 body. A second and still unrecognized organization, the Mauritanian Human Rights
 Association (AMDH), while not affiliated with the opposition, has many opposition
 members. It has been more critical of the Government than the League, particularly
 on the unresolved abuses of the 1989-91 period.
 Various other organizations address human rights issues. The pan-African organi-
 zation Gerddes-Africa, or International Study and Research Group on Democracy
 and Economic and Social Development in Africa, established a branch in Mauritania
 in 1994. Two other groups, SOS-Esclaves and the National Committee for the
 Struggle Against the Vestiges of Slavery in Mauritania, focus their efforts on over-
 coming the country's vestiges of slavery (see Section 6.c.). SOS-Esclaves was par-
 ticularly active in drawing public attention to this issue, issuing in March a report
 detailing its activities and a petition appealing to national and international audi-
 ences to support measures to eradicate slavery. SOS-Esclaves also intervened effec-
 tively with government authorities to push resolution of some of the cases, in par-
 ticular child custody cases, brought to the organization by former slaves.
 The Committee of Solidarity with the Victims of Repression in Mauritania is con-
 cerned with the plight of the 1989 expellees. The Consultative Group for the Return
 of the Refugees was founded to promote the return of the remaining Mauritanian
 refugees in Senegal. The Collective of Workers Victims of the 1989 Events seeks re-
 dress for government employees who lost their jobs in the events of 1989. The Com-
 mittee of the Widows and the Collective of Survivors focus on the sufferings of the
 victims of the 1990-91 military purge and their families. The Collective of Survivors
 of Political Detention and Torture (CRAPOCIT) was established this year to seek
 redress for abuses committed during the 1986-87 period. These, and other groups
 of individuals with common concerns, function openly and actively, but their efforts
 are somewhat circumscribed because they are not officially recognized (see Section
 2.b.).
 Representatives from a variety of European, African, American, and Arab human
 rights organizations visited Mauritania. The International Federation of Human
 Rights dispatched a legal expert to observe the trial of Baathists at the behest of
 the AMDH. The African Commission on Human and Peoples Rights, which visited
 for 10 days in June, met with government officials and activists and subsequently
 presented its report to President Taya. The Senegalese human rights group RADO
 visited, as did the Arab Institute for Human Rights (Tunis), the Union of Arab Ju-
 rists, and the Arab League for Human Rights. Representatives of the American
 NGO, Africare, visited in August. Local human rights activists report that these
 groups were allowed free access and that there were no reports of harassment or
 reprisal against Mauritanian interlocutors during or following the visits.
 
 
 179
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equality before the law for all citizens, regardless
 of race, national origin, sex, or social status, and prohibits racially or ethnically
 based propaganda. In practice, the Government often favors individuals on the basis
 of ethnic and tribal affiliation, social status, and political ties. Discrimination
 against women, strongly rooted in traditional society, is endemic, although the situ-
 ation is improving.
 Women.-Human rights monitors and women lawyers report that physical mis-
 treatment of women by their husbands is limited. The police and judiciary occasion-
 ally intervene in domestic abuses, but women in traditional society usually do not
 seek legal redress, relying instead upon family and ethnic group members to resolve
 domestic disputes. The incidence of rape is low. It occurs, but newspaper accounts
 of attacks are rare.
 Traditional forms of mistreatment of women continue, mostly in isolated rural
 communities, but these practices appear to be on the decline. Such mistreatment
 consists of forced feeding of adolescent girls (gavage) and female genital mutilation.
 Women have legal rights to property and child custody, and, among the more
 modern and urbanized population, these rights are recognized. In accordance with
 Shari'a, marriage and divorce do not require the woman's consent, polygyny is al-
 lowed, and a woman does not have the right to refuse her husband's wish to many
 additional wives. In practice, polygyny is very rare among Moors although common
 among Afro-Mauritanians. Arranged marriages are also increasingly rare, particu-
 larly among the Moor population. Women frequently initiate the termination of a
 marriage, which most often is done by husband or wife by repudiation rather than
 divorce. It is also common in Moor society for a woman to obtain, at the time of
 marriage, a contractual agreement that stipulates that her husband must agree to
 end their marriage if he chooses an additional wife. The rate of divorce among
 Moors is estimated to be 37 percent and the remarriage ra after divorce 72.5 per-
 cent.
 Women still face some legal discrimination. For example, the testimony of two
 women is necessary to equal that of one man, and the value placed on women's lives
 in court-awarded i ndemnities is only half the amount awarded for a man's death
 (see Section i.e.). Women do not face legal discrimination, however, in other areas
 not specifically addressed by Shari'a.
 There are no legal restrictions on the education of girls and women. Some 75 per-
 cent of school age girls attended school in 1995, up fm 44.8 percent in 1990 (com-
 pared with 85.9 percent for boys, up from 58.3 percent). Increasing numbers of
 women attend the university, women made up 14.9 percent of the university's 1992-
 93 enrollment.
 The Government seeks to open new employment opportunities for women in areas
 that are traditionally fell by men, such as health care, communications, police,
 and customs services.
 The law provides that men and women receive equal pay for equal work. While
 not universally applied in practice, the two largest employers, the civil service and
 state mining company, respect this law. In the modern wage sector, women also re-
 ceivegenerus family benefits, including 3 months of maternity leave.
 Children.-The Government does not require attendance at school and a lack of
 financial resources limits available educational opportunities. However, almost all
 children, regardless of sex or ethnic group, attendoranic school from the ages of
 five to seven and gain at least rudimentary skills in reading and writing Arabic in
 addition to memorizing Koranic verses.
 The law makes special provisions for the protection of children's welfare, and the
 Government has programs to care for abandoned children. These programs are,
 however, hamperedi by inadequate funding. The Government relies on foreign donors
 in such areas as child immunization. Moreover, it does not enforce existing child
 labor laws, and children perform a significant amount of labor in support of family
 activities. There are isolated but credible press reports of parents agreeing, in ex-
 change for money, to send their young children to work in forein countries. The
 most common cases are of boys aged 8 to 10 years sent to work as jockeys or herd-
 ers in the United Arab Emirates or Qatar (see Section 6.d.).
 Female genital mutilation (FGM) is widely condemned by international health ex-
 perts as damaging to both physical and psychological health. It is performed most
 often on young girls, often on the seventh day after birth and almost always before
 the age of 6 months, and it is practiced among all ethnic groups except the Wolof.
 Reportedly, 95 percent of Soninke and Halpulaar women undergo FGM, as do 30
 percent of Moor women. Local experts agree that the least severe form of excision
 is practiced, and not infibulation, the most severe form of FGM. Evidence indicates
 
 
 that the practice of FGM is decreasing in the modern urban sector. The Government
 does not attempt to interfere with these practices, but does not allow them in hos-
 pitals. It is the clear public policy of the Government, through the Secretariat of
 Women's Affairs, that the practice should be stpped. Public health workers and
 NGO's educate women to the dangers of FGM and to the fact that FGM is not a
 requirement of Islam. A recent, oficially produced Guide to the Rights of Women
 in Mauritania (with religious endorsement) stresses that Islam does not require
 FGM and that if medical experts warn against it for medical reasons, it should not
 be done.
 People With Disabiities.-The law does not specifically provide for pople with
 disabilities, and the Government does not man date preference in employment or
 education or public accessibility for disabled persons. It does, however, provide some
 rehabilitation and other assistance for the disabled.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Ethnic and cultural tension and discrimina-
 tion arise from the geographic and cultural line between traditionally nomadic Ara-
 bic-speaking (Hassaniya) Moor herders and Afro-Mauritanian sedentary cultivators
 of the Halpulaar, Soninke, and Wolof ethnic groups in the south. Although cul-
 turally homogeneous, the Moors are divided among numerous ethno-linguistic clan
 groups and are racially distinguished as White Moors and Black Moors. The major-
 ity of what are known as Black Moors are Haratine, literally "one who has been
 freed," although some Black Moor families were never enslaved. The Halpulaar (the
 largest Afro-Mauritanian group), the Wolof, and the Soninke ethnic groups are con-
 centrated in the south. "White" Moors, large numbers of whom are dark-skinned
 after centuries of intermarriage with members of Sub-Saharan African groups,
 dominate positions in government, business, and the clergy. The Halpulaar,
 Soninke, and Wolof ethnic groups are underrepresented in the military and security
 sectors.
 Ethnic tensions surfaced   dramatically in the mass expulsions of Afro-
 Mauritanians in 1989-90 and the purge of Afro-Mauritanians from the military in
 1991. Few regained their positions.
 The Constitution designates Arabic along with Pulaar, Soninke, and Wolof as
 Mauritania's national languages. Successive governments-both civil and military-
 have pursued various policies of "Arabization" in the schools and in the workplace.
 Non-Arabic-speaking ethnic groups have protested this policy, as have Arabic-speak-
 ing groups that want their children to obtain a bilingual Arabic-French education.
 As a consequence, the availability of bilingual Arabic-French programs is increasing.
 Elementary school classes are also available in the other national languages in some
 localities.
 Overt tensions between ethnic groups have lessened since the explosive ethnic vio-
 lence of 1989-91, when the Government conducted extrajudicial expulsions and
 purges of the security forces clearly based on ethnicity. Nevertheless, some hostility
 and bitterness 15ersist between ethnic groups although political coalitions among the
 groups are increasingly important.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for freedom of association
 and the right of citizens to join any political or labor organization. All workers ex-
 cept members of the military and police are free to associate in and establish unions
 at the local and national levels.
 Prior to the 1993 amendment of the Labor Code, which repealed provisions re-
 stricting trade union pluralism, the government-controlled labor central, the Union
 of Mauritanian Workers (UTM), was the only labor confederation allowed by law.
 Since 1993 two new labor confederations have formed and the UTM, which many
 workers still view as closely allied with the Government and the PRDS, has lost
 ground to these organizations. The Government recognized a new confederation in
 1994, the General Confederation of Mauritanian Workers (CGTM). The CGTM is
 not affiliated with any political party, although most of its members favor the oppo-
 sition; it continued to gain considerably in strength during the year, in part because
 of the UTM's internaldiscord. The Government, which previously subsidized only
 the UTM, began in the spring to provide funds also to the CGTM, proportional to
 its membership. Both confederations provided representatives to the country's three
 labor tribunals, and the CGTM was included in most government deliberative or
 consultative bodies in which the UTM alone has participated in the past. A third
 labor confederation, the Free Confederation of Mauritanian Workers (CLTM),
 formed in 1995, has not been recognized by the Government but is nevertheless al-
 lowed to function. Several independent trade unions, in particular three for teachers
 at the elementary, secondary, and university levels, were also active.

 The bulk of the labor force is in the informal sector, with most workers engaged
 in subsistence agrculture and animal husbandry; on  25 percent are employed in
 the wage sector. However, nearly 90 percent of the industrial and commercial work-
 ers are organized. The law provides workers with the right to strike, and there were
 several strikes and partial work stoppages. Most strikes were settled quickly due
 to limited worker and union resources. Moreover, the law provides for tripartite ar-
 bitration committees composed of union, business, and government representatives.
 Once all parties agree to arbitration, the committee may impose binding arbitration
 that automatically terminates any strike.
 International trade union activity increased. The Government included both
 CGTM and UTM representatives in its delegation to the International Labor Orga-
 nization in June, and the ILO conducted an extensive series of training workshops
 in which both confederations participated. The CGTM and UTM have applied for
 membership in the ICFTU, the   TM participated in regional labor organizations,
 and the CGTh{ was accepted as a member of the Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity (OATUU).
 The Government did not petition the United States for reconsideration of General-
 ized System of Preferences (GSP) trade privileges. The United States revoked GSP
 benefits in July 1993 for failure to respect freedom of association or to take steps
 to eliminate forced labor, including vestiges of slavery (see Section 6.c.).
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides that unions
 may freely organize workers without government or employer interference. General
 or sectoral agreements on wages, working conditions, and social and medical bene-
 fits are negotiated in tripartite discussions and formalized by government decree.
 Wages and other benefits can also be negotiated bilaterally between employer and
 union and the results of such negotiations are filed with the Directorate of Labor.
 Laws provide workers with protection against antiunion discrimination and em-
 ployees or employers may bring labor disputes to three-person labor tribunals ad-
 ministered jointly by the Ministries of Justice and Labor with the participation of
 union and employer representatives.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Mauritanians continue to suffer
 the effects of generations of the practice of slavery in Moor society, and of caste dis-
 tinctions that include slaves in country's Afro-Mauritanian ethnic communities.
 Slavery was officially abolished three times in Mauritania, most recently by the
 post-independence government in 1980. Nevertheless, there are many individuals
 who continue to live in conditions of paid or unpaid ervitude, and many persons
 still consider themselves to be slaves.
 Slavery in the form of officially sanctioned forced or involuntary servitude, is ex-
 tremely rare, and a system of slavery in which government and society join to force
 individuals to serve masters no longer exists. Adult males can no longer be obliged
 by law to remain with their masters nor can they be returned if they leave. Adult
 females with children, however, may have greater difficulties and may be compelled
 by pressures other than physical force to remain in a condition of servitude. For ex-
 ample, in some cases masters refuse to allow children to accompany their mothers;
 in other cases the greater economic responsibility of a family may be the principal
 impediment to seeking a new life. Children's legal status is more tenuous than that
 of adults.
 There are occasional confirmed cases of "transfers" of individuals-often chil-
 dren-from one employer or master to another, usually of the same family. Reports
 of sales are rare, cannot be confirmed, and are confined to past years.
 The Government's record in cases in which an individual's civil rights are affected
 because of his or her status as a former slave is extremely weak. Punishment is ex-
 tremely rare for individuals who in such cases break laws (e.g., those that prohibit
 detention of an individual against his or her will by another individual, or kidnap-
 ing) and there were no known instances this year in which the Government pun-
 ished individuals for such infractions. Nevertheless, when complaints are filed with
 the Government to remedy such cases, it generally intervenes in accordance with
 the law, although sometimes only after considerable prodding and passage of time.
 When called upon to assist or adjudicate, administrative officials or courts on occa-
 sion rule in favor of former masters (e.g., in child custody cases in which a former
 master claims parentage, or in inheritance cases) if it finds this justified because
 of the facts of the case. A mother appealed the February ruling by a magistrate in
 Brakna giving custody of her two children to a former master who claimed to be
 their father. The appeals court had not ruled on the case by year's end. According
 to the Minister of Justice, the appeals court is still establishing the facts in the case,
 in particular whether the former master was married to the mother. Determination
 could be problematic in a country where there is polygyny, "secret" marriages, no
 
 
 182
 written records, and divorce by repudiation. The court is willing to pursue the con-
 cept of genetic testing to determine paternity.
 Countless numbers of citizens, whether Moor or Afro-Mauritanian, continue to call
 themselves "slave" even though they are legally free to live and work where they
 choose. This is exacerbated by the government's extremely weak record of enforcing
 the ban on slavery. However, many still live with masters or former masters. Ex-
 tremely difficult economic conditions provide few economic alternatives for many
 and leave some former slaves open to exploitation by former masters. Significant
 numbers, especially in the cities work for former masters for a pittance or in ex-
 change for room and board, clotbing, and medical benefits. Invisible but crippling
 psychological bonds make it difficult for many individuals who have generations of
 forbearers who were slaves to think of themselves as free from former masters. Be-
 cause of religious instruction in the past, some individuals continue to link them-
 selves to former masters and fear religious sanction if that bond is broken by any-
 one else.
 "Slave" as a caste designation is common to all ethnic groups-sub-Saharan Afro-
 Mauritanian groups as well as Moor. The legacy of these caste distinctions continues
 to affect the status and opportunities available to members of these non-Moor com-
 munities. In some groups, for example, individuals of a higher caste who seek to
 marry someone of a lower caste may be barred by the community and in Soninkie
 communities members of the slave caste cannot be buried in the same cemetery as
 other castes.
 Three NGO's, SOS-Esclaves, the National Committee for the Struggle Against the
 Vestiges of Slavery in Mauritania, and the Initiative for the Support of the Activi-
 ties of the President, had as their focus issues related to the history of Slavery in
 Mauritania. Of these, SOS-Esclaves was particularly active in bringing to public at-
 tention cases in which it found the rights of former slaves to have been abridged,
 and in assisting former slaves in their difficulties with former masters. Other
 human rights and civic action NGO's also follow this issue closely. The independent
 press which includes journals that are published by Haratines and Afro-
 Mauritanians who emphasize issues of importance to these ethnic groups, is also
 quick to report any incident that comes to its attention in which the rights of former
 slaves have not been respected.
 Inheritance disputes between Haratines and the descendants of their former mas-
 ters arose several times and were adjudicated in court. While most such disputes
 are decided in accordance with the law and rule that the descendants of the former
 slaves should inherit their property, the independent press reported one case in
 which a magistrate (Qadi) in Nema in 1994 ruled in favor of the former master, the
 implementation of this ruling was blocked in 1995 while the former slave's descend-
 ants appealed. The case was decided against the children by the Supreme Court in
 1995. The Minister of Justice has ordered the courts to consult with each other and
 review their decisions. He said that contrary to allegations, although the case is be-
 tween Haratines and White Moors, it does not involve the descendants of slaves and
 the descendants of masters. Rather, it is a land tenure dispute, which is "very com-
 mon" in Mauritania, and one that in which the disputants had no past relationship
 of master and slave.
 Inheritance disputes between Haratines and the descendants of their former mas-
 ters are now ajudicated in court. A 1994 land inheritance case which ruled against
 Haratines who wanted title to a master's property is under review. The results of
 this review remain outstanding.
 In a 1995 case, the Supreme Council of the Magistrature removed a magistrate
 from the bench because he ruled, contrary to the law, that a former master, rather
 than the former slave's descendants, should inherit the possessions of an ex-slave.
 On December 28, the Supreme Council of the Magistrature removed the magistrate
 in Kankossa from the bench because he refused to accept the provisions of the 1980
 law abolishing slavery. The removal of this magistrate reinforces to other judges
 that the provisions of the 1980 law apply.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Education is not compulsory, and
 for financial and other reasons, 20 percent of school-age children do not regularly
 attend government schools. Labor law specifies that no child under the age of 13
 years may be employed in the agricultural sector without the permission of the Min-
 ister of Labor, nor under the age of 15 years in the nonagricultural sector. The law
 provides that employed children of age 14 to 16 years should receive 70 percent of
 the minimum wage, and those from age 17 to 18 years should receive 90 percent
 of the minimum wage. The Labor Ministry's few inspectors provide only limited en-
 forcement of child labor laws (see Section 5).
 Young children in the countryside commonly pursue herding, cultivation, fishing,
 and other significant labor in support of their families' activities. In keeping with
 
 
 longstanding tradition, many children serve apprenticeships in small industries and
 in the informal sector.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage for adults is approxi-
 mately $67 (8,300 ouguiya) per month and has not been raised since October 1992.
 It is difficult for the average family to meet its minimum needs and maintain a de-
 cent standard of living at this salary. The standard, legal, nonagricultural workweek
 may not exceed either 40 hours or 6 days without overtime compensation, which is
 paid at rates that are graduated according to the number of supplemental hours
 worked. The Labor Directorate of the Ministry of Labor is responsible for enforce-
 ment of the labor laws, but in practice inadequate funding limits the effectiveness
 of the Directorate's enforcement.
 The Ministry of Labor is also responsible for enforcing safety standards but does
 so inconsistently, due to inadequate funding. In principle workers can remove them-
 selves from hazardous conditions without risking loss of employment; in practice,
 they cannot.
