 KUWAIT
 Amirs, or princes, from the A1-Sabah family have ruled Kuwait in consultation
 with prominent community figures for over 200 years. The Constitution, adopted in
 1962, provides for an elected National Assembly and enumerates the powers of the
 Government and the rights of citizens. It also permits the Amir to suspend its arti-
 cles during periods of martial law. The Amir twice suspended constitutional prvi-
 sions, from 1976 to 1981 and from 1986 to 1992, and ruled extraconstitutionally
 during those periods. The Assembly resumed functioning after the 1992 election.
 The Minister of Interior supervises Kuwait's security apparatus, including the
 Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and Kuwait State Security (KSS), two
 agencies that, in addition to the regular police, investigate internal security-related
 offenses. Allegations of human rights abuses by the security forces against nationals
 of countries that supported Iraq in the Gulf War subsided in 1994, though there
 continued to be credible reports that security officials physically abused detainees.
 Endowed with oil, the Government has made significant progress in recovering
 from the destruction caused by the Iraqi occupation. The costly reconstruction is
 mostly complete. In the last three fiscal years, Kuwait has incurred a cumulative
 fiscal deficit of $68 billion which the Government has financed by selling its foreign
 assets and increasing the public debt. Despite the emphasis the Government places
 on an open market economy, foreign nationals (with the exception of citizens of the
 Gulf Cooperation Council) may not own property or majority shares in significant
 local businesses and are subject to restrictive labor laws. The Government owns in-
 terests in most of the major banks and in the oil industry.
 The Government continues to abridge or restrict a number of significant rights.
 Limitations on the freedoms of assembly and association and women s- rights remain
 in place. The Government bans political parties, and citizens do not have the ability
 to change their form of government. Associations that are not registered with the
 Government are banned by law, and the Government enforced that ban: in several
 
 
 1123
 instances in 1994, it prevented unregistered human rights groups from holding pub-
 lic meetings. The Government continued its policy of preventing the return of state-
 less, Iraqi and Palestinian people who have strong family ties to Kuwait. The labor
 law excludes foreign-born domestic servants from its protective provisions.
 Nonetheless, the Government made some progress in human rights, and it has
 emerged from the troubled human rights environment of the postlieration period.
 The Government improved conditions n prisons and detention centers, extended the
 franchise to the sons of naturalized citizens, and invited the International Labor Or-
 g anization (ILO) to Kuwait for consultations. The Human Rights Committee of the
 National Assembly continued to investigate important human rights abuses, and
 recommended improvements in prison conditions.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings. The Government did not make public the results of its
 investigations into the extrajudicial killings that occurred in the period following
 Kuwait s liberation in 1991, nor did it signal that it intends to take further action.
 The Government had announced in 1993 that it would reactivate the investigations
 into the killings. Most of the cases remain unresolved.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 Of the numerous disappearances that occurred in 1991, about 100 cases remain
 unresolved. The Ministry of Interior claims that, in cooperation with the Inter-
 national Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), it has renewed its efforts to resolve
 the cases, but has not yet done so. The Government has failed to issue death certifi-
 cates in cases where those who disappeared are known to be dead. The Govern-
 ment's failure to resolve these cases stems from an unwillingness to open and pur-
 sue criminal investigations into the causes of the deaths.
 According to the ICRC, Iraqi authorities took prisoner 609 Kuwaitis and residents
 of Kuwait, including 9 women, during Iraqs occupation. These people are still miss-
 ing or detained in Iraq. The Government of Iraq has refused to comply with U.N.
 Security Council Resolution 687, which stipulates that the detainees be released.
 Iraq denies that it holds Kuwaiti detainees and refuses to account for missing Ku-
 waitis taken into Iraqi custody during the occupation.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Constitution prohibits torture, credible reports indicate that physical
 abuse during interrogation did occur. The number of reports of abuse, however, de-
 clined in 1994 compared to the aftermath of the Gulf War. No pattern of systematic
 or widespread abuse appeared. The reported types of abuse consisted of blindfolding,
 verbal threats, slaps, and blows.
 The Government claims that it investigates all torture allegations and that it has
 punished at least some of the offenders. However, the Government refuses to make
 public its findings in torture investigations or what, if any, punishments are im-
 posed. This creates a climate of implied impunity which diminishes the deterrence
 against torture and abuse.
 Defendants have the legal right to present evidence in court that they had been
 mistreated during interrogation, and judges routinely review such allegations. Since
 defendants are often unable to substantiate their complaints with physical evidence,
 however, these allegations are often dismissed. In 1991 judges in martial-law courts
 handed down several death sentences based on confessions apparently obtained
 under torture. Courts later refused to reopen these trials, although the sentences
 were commuted to imprisonment varying from 10 to 20 years. In 1994 a State Secu-
 rity Court ruled against excluding the confession of 14 persons accused of attempt-
 ing to assassinate former U.S. President George Bush--despite allegations raised by
 the defense that the confessions were obtained by torture (see Section 1.d.).
 Prison conditions do not meet internationally recognized minimum standards.
 Many prisoners live in severely overcrowded cells where unsanitary conditions are
 conducive to the quick spread of contagious illnesses. Nonetheless, the Government
 moved in 1994 to improve some conditions. After a prison tour by several members
 of the National Assembly in February, prison authorities installed air conditioning
 at some facilities and gave prisoners permission to take outdoor exercise and receive
 visits from their families. The Government allows the ICRC access to all detention
 facilities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides for the free-
 dom from arbitrary arrest and detention, but security forces do not always respect
 these rights. In 1994 there were no reports of arbitrary arrest. Security forces in
 Kuwait City sometimes set up checkpoints where they may briefly detain individ-
 
 
 1124
 uals. The Government has stopped the practice of rounding up and deporting Pal-
 estinian residents.
 Police officers must obtain arrest warrants from state prosecutors before making
 arrests, though in misdemeanor cases the arresting officer may issue them. Under
 the Penal Code, a suspect may not be held for more than 4 days without charge.
 Security officers sometimes prevent families from visiting detainees during this con-
 finement. After 4 days, prosecutors must either release the suspect or file charges.
 If charges are filed, prosecutors may remand a suspect to an additional 21 days in
 detention. Prosecutors may also obtain court orders for further detention pending
 trial.
 Detention rules are different for cases involving state security. In such cases,
 prosecutors may hold a suspect in detention for 6 months, and a judge may author-
 ize a longer confinement pending trial. After 21 days in detention, a defendant has
 the right to petition for his release in the State Security Court. If the judge denies
 the motion, the defendant may submit another appeal 30 days after the rejection.
 In general, cases go to trial between 20 and 30 days after arrest. There is no evi-
 dence of long-term incommunicado detention, though there are about 30 detainees
 facing deportation, especially Iraqi citizens and the "bidoon" or stateless residents,
 who have been in detention for more than a year (see Section 1.d.).
 Approximately 1,850 people are in prison, of whom 400 are in pretrial detention.
 About 75 percent of the detainees face administrative deportation orders which the
 Ministry of Interior may issue arbitrarily. There are no trials for deportations; thus
 deportees do not have 'due process." The Government may expel noncitizens, even
 those who have been long-term residents, if it considers them security risks.
 The Government may also expel foreigners if they are unable to obtain or renew
 work or residency permits. In 1994 the Government deported 122 Iraqis and nation-
 als of countries that supported Iraq in the Gulf War (primarily Yemen and Jordan),
 well below the 1993 level. Although the ICRC monitors only the deportation of these
 cases, the Government also routinely deports Iranians and other foreign nationals
 who have violated residency requirements or committed other offenses.
 The law protects citizens from exile. However, before the Iraqi invasion there
 were credible reports that in some cases the Government evaded this law by revok-
 ing citizenship in order to deport citizens as noncitizens. There have been no reports
 of revocations of citizenship since the Gulf War.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tial.-The judicial system is composed of the regular
 courts, which try criminal and civil cases; the State Security Court, which tries
 cases of a security nature; and the Court of Cassation, which is the highest level
 of judicial appeal. During periods of martial law, the Amir may authorize military
 courts to try civilian defendants. There have been no martial-law trials since 1991.
 Sunni and Shi'a Muslims have recourse to courts of their respective denominations
 for family-law cases.
 The Constitution states that "judges shall not be subject to any authority." None-
 theless, the Ministry of Justice controls the judiciarys administrative and financial
 matters. The Amir appoints all judges on recommendations from the Minister of
 Justice. Judges who are citizens have lifetime appointments, but the Government
 also employs many noncitizens as judges. They work under 1-year, renewable con-
 tracts, which undermine their independence. The Ministry of Justice may remove
 judges for cause but rarely does so. Foreign residents involved in commercial dis-
 putes with citizens frequently complain that courts show a pro-Kuwaiti bias.
 Defendants have the rights to confront their accusers and of judicial appeal. The
 Amir has the constitutional power to pardon or commute all sentences. Defendants
 in felony cases are required by law to be represented in court by legal counsel. In
 misdemeanor cases, defendants have the right to waive the presence of legal coun-
 sel, and the court is not required to provide counsel to indigent defendants.
 Both defendants and prosecutors may appeal verdicts of the State Security Court
 to the Court of Cassation, but the appellate court may only determine whether the
 law was properly applied with respect to the sentence; it does not rule on guilt or
 innocence. In criminal cases not involving state security, appeal is to the High Court
 of Appeal, which may rule on all aspects of the lower courts decision.
 In the secular courts there are no groups, including women, who are barred from
 testifying or whose testimony is given lesser weight. The Islamic courts, which have
 jurisdiction over family law, follow Islamic law, which states that the testimony of
 one man equals that of two women.
 Most trials are public, as was the 1994 trial of 14 persons accused in the foiled
 assassination plot against former President Bush. In June the State Security Court
 convicted 13 defendants and acquitted 1. It sentenced six defendants to death and
 seven to prison terms ranging from 6 months to 12 years. Like other trials, this one
 
 
 1125
 did not meet internationally accepted standards regarding an independent judiciary
 and the evidence required for proving abuse.
 There are no reprted political prisoners, but the Government continues to hold
 persons accused of collaboration with Iraq during the occupation. By law such col-
 laboration is a felony. Most of the people convicted in martial-law courts (including
 the majority of collaborators) did not receive a fair trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for individual privacy and sanctity of the home. The police
 must obtain a warrant to search both public and private property, unless they are
 in hot pursuit or suspect the presence of alcohol or narcotics. The warrant can be
 obtained from the state prosecutor or, in the case of privatb property, from a judge.
 The security forces occasionally monitor the activities of individuals and their com-
 munications.
 By law males must obtain government approval to marry foreign-born women.
 However, the Government does not vigorously enforce the restriction, and Kuwaitis
 routinely obtain exemptions from the Ministry of Justice. The Government also ad-
 vises women against marrying foreign nationals.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Several laws empower the Government to im-
 pose restrictions on the freedom of speech and the press, but the Government did
 not apply these laws in 1994. In general, citizens are free to criticize the Govern-
 ment at public meetings and in the media. However, the Press Law prohibits the
 publication of any direct criticism of the Amir, official government communications
 with other states, and material that "might incite people to commit crimes, create
 hatred, or spread dissension among the people." The Government ended censorship
 in 1992, but journalists still censor themselves.
 Nonetheless, newspapers, which are privately owned, are free to publish on many
 social, economic, and political issues, and frequently criticize government policies
 and officials, including the Prime Minister. The Government does not censor foreign
 journalists and permits them open access to the country.
 Newspapers must obtain an operating license from the Ministry of Information.
 This licensing power allows the Government control over the establishment of new
 publications. The law also stipulates that publishers may lose their license if their
 publications do not appear for 6 months. This "6-month  rule prevents publishers
 from publishing sporadically-it is not used to suspend or shut down existing news-
 a  rs. Individuals must also obtain permission from the Ministry of Information
 eore publishing any printed material, including brochures and wall posters.
 The Government owns and controls the radio and television companies. The Mid-
 die East Broadcasting Company and Egyptian television transmit to Kuwait without
 censorship. The Government does not inhibit the purchase of satellite dishes. Citi-
 zens with such devices are free to watch a variety of programs, including those
 broadcast from Israel.
 The Ministry of Information has a Censorship Department that reviews all books,
 flms, videotapes, periodicals, and other imported publications. In practice, such cen-
 sorship is sporadic and aimed mostly at morally offensive material; however, politi-
 cal topics may be censored. The General Organization of Printing and Publishing
 controls the printing, publishing, and distribution of informational material.
 Academics conduct their activities with no apparent censorship of their teaching
 research, or writings, while subject to the same restraints as the media with regard
 to criticism of the Amr or Islam.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Although the Constitution af-
 firms the right to assembly, the Government bans political parties. However, several
 informal blocs, acting much like parties, coalesced during the 1992 elections and
 have been present in succeeding National Assembly sessions. The Government has
 made no effort to limit these groupings, which are organized on the basis of common
 ideological goals. Many of them may be categorized as "oposition" groups. Public
 gtherings, however, must receive prior government approva, as must private gath-
 erings o- more than five persons that result in the issuance of a public statement.
 Political activity finds its outlet in informal, family-based, almost exclusively
 male, social gatherings known as diwaniyas. Practically every male adult, including
 the Arnir, hosts and attends diwaniyas, at which every possible topic is discussed
 and which contribute to the development of political consensus and official decision-
 making.
 The (lovernment regards all nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) as illegal un-
 less they obtain a license from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor. The Govern-
 ment uses its power to license as a means of political control. The Ministry has reg-
 istered over 55 NGO's, including professional groups, bar associations, and scientiic
 
 
 1126
 bodies. These groups receive government subsidies for their operating expenses.
 They must obtain permission from the Ministry before attending international con-
 ferences.
 However, since 1985 the Ministry has issued only two licenses, includin one in
 1994 to the Union of Kuwaiti Womens' Groups, which is headed by the wie of the
 Crown Prince. The Ministry has disapproved other requests for licenses on the
 grounds that previously established NGO's already provide services similar to those
 pro posed by the petitioners.
 pDespite th Miistirs refusal to issue additional permits, private organizations
 flourish, and their illegal activities are largely overlooked by the Government. How-
 ever, in 1993 the Cabinet issued a decree ordering all unregistered NGO's to cease
 activities. No organization has challenged this decree in court.
 In September the Ministry of Interior ordered three unregistered NGO's to vacate
 the offices that they had established in unused government buildings. They com-
 plied with the order. By banning unregistered NGO's, the Government sought to
 dissolve groups whose efforts were not coordinated with a government committee
 working for the release of missing persons presumed held in raq. The Government
 views these groups as politically unacceptable (see Section 4). However, in issuing
 the ban, the Government did not cite why it objected to these groups' activities,
 aside from the fact that the groups were unregistered.
 The ban prevents unregistered NGO's from holding public meetings and or being
 cited in the press, though many groups continue activities under the patronaeof
 legal institutions, for example the National Assembly. The ban also discourages
 these groups from fundraising and recruitment. Some unregistered NGO's remain
 open and conduct their activities as well as possible in a hostile legal environment.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the state religion. The Constitution states that
 Islamic law Shari'a, is "a main source of legislation." The ruling family and many
 prominent families belong to the denomination of Sunni Islam. However, 40 percent
 of the population belong to the Shi'a denomination. They are free to conduct their
 liturgies and rites without government interference. There is a tiny Arab Christian
 minority which practices freely, and several legally recognized expatriate congrega-
 tions and churches, including a Catholic diocese and an American-sponsored Protes-
 tant church. Residents who are members of religions not sanctioned by the Koran
 (e.g., Hindus, Sikhs, and Buddhists) may not build places of worship, but may wor-
 ship in their homes. The Government prohibits missionaries to proselytize among
 Muslims, but they may serve expatriate ongrgations. The law prohibits religious
 education for religions other than Islam, althoug.h this law does not appear to be
 strictly enforced. The Government does not permit the establishment of non-Islamic
 publishing companies or training institutions for clergy.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--Citizens have the right to travel freely within the country and to
 change their workplace as desired. Women must obtain permission from their hus-
 bands or a close male relative to obtain a passport for travel abroad. Airport au-
 thorities sometimes, but not often, ask female travelers to present the required dc-
 umentation before departing the country. Representatives from NG0 s must obtain
 government permission be ore representing Kuwait at international conferences
 abroad. Citizens are free to emigrate and to return.
 A serious problem exists in the case of the bidoon," who are stateless persons,
 usually of Iraqi or Iranian descent, who resided in Kuwait prior to the Iraqi inva-
 sion. The Government argues that many of the bidoon (the term means "ithout)
 are actually the citizens of other countries, who claim they are stateless in order
 to remain in Kuwait, become citizens, and enjoy the generous government benefits
 prvided to citizens. Some bidoon have had residency ties to Kuwait for generations.
 Others immigrated to Kuwait during the oil boom years. At the end of 1994, there
 were about 117,000 stateless people in Kuwait, down from the prewar level of about
 220,000. The  overnim ent does not wish to see the return of the bidoon who de-
 parted Kuwait during the Gulf war. It frequently delays or denies issuing them
 entry visas. This policy imposes serious hardships and family separations.
 In 1994 the Government continued its postwar policy of reducing the number of
 Iraqis, bidoon, Palestinians, and other foreign residents. However, the Government
 permits the ICRo to verify if the deportees object to returning to their country of
 origin. The Government holds those deportees who have objections at the main de-
 prtation center.
 In 1993 the Government discontinued its postwar practice of arrestinlg and deport-
 ing Gazan Palestinians for violating residency laws. The Government issued 1-year
 renewable residency permits to 5,000 of the 8,000 Gazans remaining in Kuwait, but
 did not seek to deport those without residency permits. Nonetheless, the Govern-
 ment and social pressure prodded many Gazans to depart Kuwait.
 
 
 1127
 There is no legislation governing refugees. The Constitution prohibits the extra-
 dition of political refugees. The Ministry of Interior issues residency permits to per-
 sons granted political asylum. The Government does not deport anyone who claims
 a fear of persecution at home; but it will often maintain such persons in detention
 rather than grant them permission to live and work in Kuwait.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights; The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Kuwaiti citizens cannot change their system of government. Women and many
 others are disfranchised; only 30 percent of adult citizens are eligible to vote. Under
 the Constitution, the Amir holds executive power and shares legislative power with
 the National Assembly. The Prime Minister presides over a 16-member Cabinet. In
 accordance with the practice of the ruling family, the Prime Minister is always the
 Crown Prince.
 The Constitution empowers the Amir to suspend its provisions and to rule by de-
 cree. In 1986 the Amir effectively dissolved the National Assembly by suspending
 the constitutional provisions on the Assembly's election. The Assembly remained
 dissolved until 1992. The Amir had previously dissolved the Assembly from 1976 to
 1981.
 An election was held for the National Assembly in 1992 in which 303 candidates
 ran for the Assembly's 50 seats. Members serve 4-year terms. The Constitution em-
 powers the Assembly to overturn any Amiri decrees made during the dissolution.
 After the election, the Assembly used its power to revoke some decrees issued from
 1986 to 1992. Since the Government prohibits political parties, Assembly candidates
 must nominate themselves. Nonetheless, informal political groupings are active in
 the Assembly.
 Approximately 82,000 citizens, almost the entire franchised male population at
 the time, registered to vote in the 1992 election. In 1994 the Assembly passed legis-
 lation extendin the right to vote to the sons of naturalized Kuwaiti citizens about
 110,000 males. Previously, the law had restricted suffrage to adult males who had
 resided in Kuwait before 1920 and maintained a residence there until 1959, and
 their male descendants. According to the 1994 law, naturalized citizens who have
 been naturalized citizens for at least 30 years will also be eligible to vote in 1996.
 A majority of candidates elected in 1992 have stated that they favored extending
 the vote to women, butproposals to do so have been delayed in a legislative commit-
 tee. The Amir and the Prime Minister have publicly stated that they support politi-
 cal rights for women, but have made no apparent effort to persuade the National
 Assembly.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government prevents the establishment of human rights groups by not am
 proving their requests for licenses (see Section 2.b.). Until the ban on unregistered
 NGO's, the Kuwait Association for the Defense of War Victims (KADWV), a private
 group created in 1991, helped to repatriate citizens interned in Iraq, and aided
 ormer prisoners of war and persons tortured by Iraqi occupation forces. KADWV
 also sought to curb human rights abuses in Kuwait and took special interest in alle-
 viating the problems of the bidoon. In February the Government canceled a KADWV
 human rights seminar (which subsequently took place under the auspices of the Na-
 tional Assembly).
 The Government permits international human rights organizations to visit Ku-
 wait and to establish offices. Several organizations conduct field work and report ex-
 cellent communication with and reasonable cooperation from the Government.
 The National Assembly has established a Human Rights Committee which has
 taken testimony from individuals about abuses and has made nonbinding rec-
 ommendations for redress. In 1994 the Committee investigated prison conditions. As
 a result of the investigation, the Ministry of Interior has improved some conditions.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Women experience legal and social discrimination. They are denied the
 right to vote and require their husbands' or fathers' permission to obtain a passport
 or travel abroad (see Sections 2.d. and 3). By law only males are able to confer citi-
 zenship. In rare cases, this means that children born to Kuwaiti mothers and state-
 less fathers are themselves stateless. Inheritance is governed by Islamic law, which
 means that female heirs receive half the male heirs inheritance. Asole female heir
 receives half her parents' estate; the balance goes to designated male relatives un-
 less a woman's family has made other arrangements to transfer assets to her.
 
 
 1128
 Women are traditionally restrained from choosing certain roles in society and the
 law restricts women from working in "dangerous industries" and trades 'harmfl"
 to health. Educated Kuwaiti women maintain that a resurgent Islamic fundamental-
 ist trend limits career opportunities. Women wearing Western clothes and foreign
 women experience sexual harassment more frequently than women in Islamic garb.
 Nonetheless, an estimated 60 percent of women of working age are employed. The
 law promises "remuneration equal to that of a man provided she does the same
 work." This promise is respected in practice. Women work as doctors, engineers,
 lawyers, and professors. A few have reached senior government positions in the For-
 eign Ministry, Ministry of Education, and the state-owned Kuwait Petroleum Cor-
 poration. However, there are no female judges or prosecutors, only a few women in
 the diplomatic service, and none in the National Assembly.
 Domestic abuse of women is common. Each of the country's 50 police stations re-
 ceives one or two complaints of spousal abuse per week. Women in such cases usu-
 ally take refuge in the homes of relatives. The police generally seek to resolve family
 disputes and may ask the offendinjg spouse to sign a statement affirmin that he
 will discontinue the abuse. The police refer serious cases of abuse to authorities at
 the Ministry of Health. Kuwaiti courts have found husbands guilty of spousal abuse.
 Many employers have physically and sexually abused Asian women working as
 their domestic servants. Such abuse appears to have worsened in recent years. The
 press gives the problem considerable attention. Foreign-born servants have the right
 to sue their employers in court for abuse, but few do so owing to both fear of depor-
 tation and fear that the judicial system is biased against them. In 1993 the Govern-
 ment established an office under the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Social
 Affairs and Labor to investigate the complaints of domestic servants. The Govern-
 ment has also announced its intention to establish a shelter for runaway maids but
 has not yet done so. As an interim measure the authorities have designated a police
 station to investigate complaints and provide some shelter.
 Many domestic servants seek shelter at their country's embassy where they seek
 repatriation or a change in employers. On several occasions, the Philippine Embassy
 has sheltered over 250 women at one time, roughly half of whom complain of phys-
 ical or sexual abuse and half have contractual complaints against their employers.
 The Government discontinues family entitlements to divorced women, but contin-
 ues to make such payments to the divorced husbands who are expected by law and
 custom to provide for the children. The law discriminates against women married
 to foreign men. These women are not entitled to government housing subsidies
 which are available to other citizens. The law also requires Kuwaiti women to pay
 residency fees for their foreign-born husbands and does not recognize marriage as
 the basis for granting residency rights to foreign-born husbands. Instead, the law
 grants residency only if the husband is employed. By contrast, men married to for-
 eign women do not have to pay residency fees for their spouses and their spouses'
 right to residency derives from marriage.
 Children.-The Government is committed to providing for the welfare of children,
 providing free education and health care to all children and a variety of other serv-
 ices.
 There is no child prostitution, child labor problem, or any pattern of societal abuse
 of children. However, in 1993 the Minister of Interior ordered all public and private
 schools not to enroll the children of parents without valid residence permits. More-
 over, the Government orders the children of persons awaiting deportation to be held
 with their mothers at the women's detention facility, in conditions unsuitable for
 children.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Government's failure to improve the
 plight of the 117,000 bidoon, or persons of undetermined nationality with long resi-
 dency in Kuwait, remains a significant human rights abuse (see Section 1.d.). The
 bidoon have been the objects of hostile government policy since the late 1980's. Since
 that time, the Government has eliminated the bidoon from the census rolls, discon-
 tinued their access to government-provided social services, and has sought to deport
 many bidoon to other countries. In 1993 the Government decreed that bidoon males
 ma no longer serve in the military services.
 The bidoon exist in a legal limbo. Because their citizenship or residency status
 is undetermined, they do not have a legal right to work or enroll their children in
 public or private schools. If the bidoon travel abroad, they are uncertain if immigra-
 tion authorities will allow them to reenter Kuwait. Marriages pose special hardships
 because the offspring of male bidoon inherit the father's undetermined legal status.
 The Government has established a review process which would regularize the sta-
 tus of some of the bidoon and their families, especially for any bidoon who has
 served in the military or security forces, and for the children born to marriages be-
 tween bidoon males and Kuwaiti women. However, the process is improvised, slow,
 
 
 1129
 and ineffective. Government officials claim they recognize the hardships suffered by
 the bidoon, but so far they have not proposed any remedial legislation.
 Since the end of the Gulf War, the Government has been hostile to workers from
 those nationalities that supported Iraq, especially Palestinians, Jordanians, and
 Yemenis. The Government has delayed or denied the issuance of work and residency
 permits to persons in these groups, and in many cases has hindered such workers
 from sponsoring their families to join them in Kuwait. The Government imposes fur-
 ther hardships by prohibiting schools from enrolling the children of such persons
 without valid residency permits.
 Religious Minorities. -Although Christians are free to practice openly, the Gov-
 ernment prohibits Christians from proselytizing Muslims, and Muslims from con-
 verting from Islam. The law prohibits non-Muslims from becoming citizens. A non-
 Muslim male must convert to Islam when he marries a Kuwaiti woman, if the wed-
 dinF is to be legal in Kuwait.
 Government welfare programs generally do not discriminate against Shi'a Muslim
 citizens. Members of Kuwait's Shi a minority are generally underrepresented in high
 government positions, although in recent years two Shi'a Muslims were appointed
 to the Cabinet and one was named to a high-ranking military post.
 People With Disabilities.-No institutionalized discrimination exists against phys-
 ically disabled persons in housing, employment, education, or the provision of state
 services. The Government has not legislated or mandated accessibility for the dis-
 abled, but does provide extensive benefits for the disabled that cover job training,
 transportation, and social welfare.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right, but are not required, to join
 trade unions. Nonetheless, the Government restricts the right of association by pro-
 hibiting all workers from freely establishing trade unions. The law stipulates that
 workers may establish only one union in any occupational trade, and that the
 unions may establish only one federation. The International Labor Organization
 (ILO) has long criticized such restrictions.
 In 1994 over 28,400 people were organized in 14 unions, 12 of which are affiliated
 with the Kuwait Trade Union Federation (KTUF), the sole, legal trade union federa-
 tion. The Bank Workers Union and the Kuwait Airways Workers Union are inde-
 pendent. The Government has shown no sign that it would accept the establishment
 of more than one legal trade union federation. The law stipulates that any new
 union must include at least 100 workers, of whom at least 15 are citizens. Both the
 ILO and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions have criticized this
 requirement because it discourages unions in sectors employing few citizens, such
 as the construction industry and domestic servants.
 The Government's intrusive oversight powers further erode union independence.
 The Government subsidizes as much as 90 percent of most union budgets, may in-
 spect the financial records of any union, and prohibits any union from engaging in
 vaguely defined political or religious activities. The law empowers the courts to dis-
 solve any union for violating labor laws or for threatening "public order and morals"
 The Amir may also dissolve a union by decree. By law, the Ministry of Social Affairs
 and Labor is authorized to seize the assets of any dissolved union. The ILO has
 criticized this aspect of the law. Although no union has been dissolved, the law sub-
 ordinates the legal existence of the unions to the power of the State.
 Foreigners constitute most of Kuwait's total work force and about one-third of its
 unionized work force. Yet the law discriminates against foreign workers by permit-
 ting them to join unions only after 5 years of residency and only as nonvoting mem-
 bers. Unlike union members who are citizens, foreign workers do not have the right
 to elect their leadership. The law requires that union officials must be citizens. The
 ILO has criticized the 5-year residency requirement and the denial of voting rights
 for foreign workers.
 KTUF administers an Expatriate Labor Office which is authorized to investigate
 complaints of foreign laborers and provides them with free legal advice. Any foreign
 worker may submit a grievance to the Labor Office, regardless of union status.
 The law limits the right to strike. It requires that all labor disputes must be re-
 ferred to compulsory arbitration if labor and management cannot reach a solution
 (see Section 6.b.). The law does not have any provision guaranteeing strikers that
 they will be free from any legal or administrative action taken against them by the
 State.
 Two strikes occurred in 1994, by cleaning personnel in the school system for a
 pay raise, and by security guards at the Social Welfare Home to collect unpaid
 wages. The majority of the strikers were foreign workers.

 The KTUF belongs to the International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions and
 the formerly Soviet-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers have the right to or-
 ganize and bargain collectively, subject to the restrictions cited above. These rights
 have been incorporated in the Labor Law and have, according to all reports, been
 respected in practice.
 The Labor Law provides for direct negotiations between employers and "laborers
 or their representatives' in the private sector. Most agreements are resolved in such
 negotiations; if not, either party may petition the Ministry of Social Affairs and
 Labor for mediation. If mediation fails the dispute is referred to a labor arbitration
 board composed of officials from the High Court of Appeals, the Attorney General's
 office, and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor.
 The Civil Service Law has no provision for collective bargaining between govern-
 ment workers and their employers. Technically, wages and conditions of employ-
 ment for civil service workers are established by the Government, but in practice,
 the Government sets the benefit scales after conducting informal meetings with offi-
 cials from the civil service unions. Union officials resolve most issues at the working
 level and have regular access to senior officials.
 The Labor Law prohibits antiunion discrimination. Any worker who alleges
 antiunion discrimination has the right to appeal to the judiciary. There were no re-
 ports of discrimination against union or nonunion employees. Employers found
 guilty of antiunion discrimination must reinstate workers fired for union activities.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor "except in cases specified by law or national emergency and with just remu-
 neration." Nonetheless, there have been credible reports that foreign nationals em-
 ployed as domestic servants have been denied exit visas if they seek them without
 their employers' consent.
 Foreign workers may not change their employment without permission from their
 original sponsors. Domestic servants are particularly vulnerable to abuses because
 they are not protected by the Labor Law. In many cases employers exercise some
 control over their servants by holding their passports, although the Government
 prohibits this practice and has acted to retrieve passports of maids involved in dis-
 putes.
 By law domestic servants who run away from their employers may be treated as
 criminals. In some reported cases, employers illegally withheld wages from domestic
 servants to cover the costs involved in bringing them to Kuwait. The Government
 has done little, if anything, to protect domestics in such cases.
 d. Minimum Age or Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age is 18
 years for all forms of work both full- and part-time. Employers must obtain permits
 from the Ministry of Socia Affairs and Labor to employ juveniles between the ages
 of 14 and 18 in certain trades. Education compulsory for children between the ages
 of 6 and 15. These laws are not fully observed in the nonindustrial sector, although
 no instances involving children have been alleged. There are an undetermined num-
 ber of underage foreign maids who have given false information regarding their age
 in order to obtain work. Some small businessmen employ their children on a part-
 time basis, and there have been unconfirmed reports that some south Asian domes-
 tic servants under 18 falsified their age in order to enter Kuwait.
 Juveniles may work a maximum of 6 hours a day on the condition that they work
 no more than 4 consecutive hours followed by a 1-hour rest period.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor is re-
 sponsible for enforcing all labor laws. There is no legal minimum wage in the pri-
 vate sector. In 1994 the minimum wage in the public sector, administratively set
 by the Government, was approximately $630 a month (180 dinars) for citizens and
 $315 a month (90 dinars) for noncitizens.
 The Labor Law establishes general conditions of work for both the public and the
 private sectors, with the oil industry treated separately. The Civil Service Law also
 prescribes additional conditions for the public sector. Labor law limits the standard
 workweek to 48 hours with 1 full day of rest per week, provides for a minimum of
 14 workdays of leave each year, and establishes a compensation schedule for indus-
 trial accidents. Domestic servants, who are specifically excluded from the private
 sector labor law, frequently work hours greatly in excess of 48 hours.
 The ILO has urged the Government to guarantee the weekly 24-consecutive-hour
 rest period to temporary workers employed for a period of less than 6 months and
 workers in enterprises employing fewer than five persons. The law governing in the
 oil industry provides for a 40-hour workweek, 30 days of annual leave, and sick
 leave. Laws establishing work conditions are not always applied uniformly to foreign
 workers. The Labor Law also provides for employer-provided medical care and coin-
 
 
 1131
 
 ensation to workers disabled by injury or disease due to job-related causes. The
 walso requires that employers provide periodic medical examinations to workers
 exposed to environmental hazards on the job (chemicals, asbestos, etc.).
 The Government has issued occupational health and safety standards; however,
 compiance and enforcement are poor, especially regarding unskilled foreign labor-
 er. Employers often exploit workers' willingness to accept substandard conditions.
 Foreign workers, especially unskilled or semiskilled south Asian workers, frequently
 face contractual disputes, poor working conditions, and some physical abuse.
 Workers have the right to remove themselves from dangrous work situations
 without jeopardy to their continued employment, and legal protections exist for
 workers who file complaints about such conditions. Latest available figures for occu-
 pational injuries show 798 such occurrences in 1992, primarily in the sectors of con-
 struction and building, manufacturing, hotels, restaurants, and transportation. To
 cut accident rates, the Government periodically inspects installations to raise aware-
 ness among workers and employers and ensure that they abide by the safety ruler,
 control the pollution resulting frm certain dangerous industries, train workers who
 use new machines in specialized institutes, and report violations.
