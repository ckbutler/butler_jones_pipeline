 SRI LANKA
 Sri Lanka's constitutional, multiparty form of government
 features a strong executive presidency and a unicameral
 legislature elected by universal adult suffrage. In the
 1980's, a gradually escalating conflict broke out between Sri
 Lanka's majority Sinhalese and minority Tamil populations. By
 1986 government security forces were involved in major
 military operations against armed Tamil separatists. To end
 the conflict, the governments of Sri Lanka and India in July
 1987 concluded a peace accord, which included provision for
 the decentralization of authority to provincial councils.
 Radicals of both major ethnic groups refused to accept the
 accord. In the Tamil-majority northeast, the Liberation
 Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) waged guerrilla war against the
 Indian Peace-Keeping Force (IPKF), introduced under the
 .Indo-Sri Lankan Accord, and India's militant Tamil allies.
 Meanwhile, in the Sinhalese-majority south, government
 security forces were pitted against the Janatha Vimukthi
 Peramuna (JVP), which used terrorism in its attempt to
 overthrow the Government.
 By the end of 1989, security forces had captured or killed
 much of the JVP top leadership. JVP cadres were unable to
 regroup sufficiently in 1990 to resume their campaign of
 intimidation. In the northeast, the IPKF completed its
 withdrawal by March 31. While continuing negotiations with
 the Government begun the year before, the LTTE seized control
 of the Jaffna peninsula, routed India's Tamil allies in the
 northeast, and-assassinated rival Tamil politicians. The
 Government enforced a policy of nonconfrontation during
 negotiations, forbidding security forces to react to LTTE
 provocations, acceding to LTTE demands for withdrawal from
 some military and police positions in the northeast, and
 taking other measures which lowered its defensive posture.
 On June 11, the LTTE broke off negotiations and attacked
 police stations and a military convoy in the east, apparently
 killing hundreds of police officers who had surrendered. when
 early attempts to arrange a cease--fire failed, security
 forces spent the rest of the year trying to reestablish
 security and civil administration in the face of continued
 guerrilla attacks.
 In response to escalating terrorism and armed insurgency,
 since 1983 the Government has expanded its navy, air force,
 and army to some 60,0&0 members. About 25,000 people serve in
 the police force, including 2,000 police commandos in the
 Special Task Force (STF). The Government increased the Home
 Guards to about 25,000 by the end of 1990 to help provide
 security for Muslim and Sinhalese communities in the northeast
 against LTTE attacks. Although recently the police have
 increased Tamil recruitment and contingents of Muslim and
 Tamil Home Guards have been created, security force personnel
 are overwhelmingly Sinhalese.
 The Tamil and JVP insurgencies have seriously damaged the
 economy; per capita gross domestic product is less than $400.
 About 60 percent of Sri Lanka's productive capacity is still
 owned or controlled by the State. Remittances were
 dramatically reduced as a result of the Iraqi invasion of
 Kuwait, where nearly 100,000 Sri Lankans were working. At the
 same time the economy showed surprising resiliency in 1990,
 
 
 1680
 SRI LANKA
 growing by more than 5 percent, in part due to Sri Lanka's
 economic reform efforts.
 The human rights situation in the northeast seriously
 deteriorated again in the last half of 1990, after temporary
 improvement in the first half of the year during the truce
 between the Government and the LTTE. Extrajudicial killings
 redoubled after the LTTE broke off negotiations with the
 Government in June and went on the offensive, attacking not
 only police forces but Sinhalese and Muslim villagers. In
 response, regular security forces and newly armed home guards
 carried out a number of abductions and extrajudicial
 killings. In the south, the elimination of the JVP leadership
 resulted in a sharp decline in extrajudicial killings after
 January. However, vigilante groups, some believed to have
 links with security force personnel, continued to operate
 against JVP cadre.
 The total number of noncombatant deaths was estimated to be
 2,600. It was not known how many persons were under
 detention, but estimates range as high as 16,000 by the
 Government, mostly in the south, and several hundred to 2,000
 held by the LTTE. Although there were human rights abuses on
 a large scale, the Government brought only a limited number of
 offenders to trial, and no cases had been concluded by year's
 end. The Government increasingly responded to human rights
 critics, for example by establishing a human rights task force
 in November.
 In addition to the wave of political and extrajudicial
 killings carried out both by the LTTE and government forces,
 other areas of human rights concern included numerous
 disappearances (many carried out by government forces);
 torture and mistreatment of prisoners by both groups;
 widespread arbitrary detentions; restrictions on freedom of
 speech, assembly, and association; and some discrimination
 against Tamils and women.
 The Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and Emergency
 Regulations (ER>, both of which grant security forces
 wide-ranging powers, remained in effect in 1990. However,
 some provisions of the latter were rescinded, including the
 one of great concern to human rights workers--authorization
 for the security forces to dispose of bodies without inquest.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political ahd Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Political.killing--carried out by the Government's security
 forces, police, vigilante squads, and separatist
 groups--remains a leading human rights problem. According to
 government statistics and newspaper accounts, an estimate for
 island-wide noncombatant deaths caused by both government and
 antigovernment forces in 1990 was 2,600.
 In the south, over 800 civilians had been killed in political
 violence by the end of September. All but about 100 of these
 deaths occurred in the first 3 months of the year, and life
 for the vast majority of citizens in the south and west
 returned to normal. A few members of the ruling and
 opposition parties were among the civilians killed early in
 
 
 1631
 
 SRI LANKA
 the year. Many of these murders were probably committed by
 armed groups in the employ of rival politicians, but
 responsibility for individual killings generally could not be
 established with certainty. Few arrests were made.
 With the death or capture of most of the key JVP leaders by
 the end of 1989, the number of deaths in the south
 attributable to the JVP declined sharply. In contrast, over
 200 JVP members and suspected JVP cadre had been killed by "
 government security forces by the end of September 1990. The
 preponderance of evidence indicates that most of these were
 extrajudicial killings. Opposition party members alleged that
 some JVP detainees were summarily executed by the military
 when they redeployed from the south to the northeast to meet
 the new LTTE threat. There is no evidence.to substantiate the
 charge. In an earlier step to curb these types of security
 force abuses, the Government in February lifted the ER
 authorizing security forces to dispose of bodies without
 inquest and in April established independent committees to
 monitor the surrender of suspected JVP members.
 Over half of the civilian political killings in the south were
 vigilante-style deaths, characterized by mutilated or burned
 bodies left in public areas. Many of those killed were
 probably suspected JVP cadre. The Government denied knowledge
 of the vigilantes' identities and declared they would be
 treated as terrorists if captured. However, strong
 circumstantial evidence and a wide range of observers,
 including human rights groups, opposition politicians,
 individual government officials, and members of the security
 forces themselves, link individual security force members to
 some vigilante groups. It is likely that vigilantes at times
 operated with the knowledge and acquiescence of some
 government officials.
 The Government in 1989 announced that it would establish an
 independent commission to investigate vigilante groups, but no
 members were-ever appointed. Charges were brought against
 security force members in at least two vigilante cases, and
 legal proceedings were initiated in at least 20 other cases in
 which security force personnel allegedly murdered civilians
 between 1988 and 1990. However, none of these cases had been
 resolved by the end of the year, partly owing to a large
 backlog in the judicial system and partly to killings and
 intimidation of witnesses. In one case in which police
 officers were accused of shooting a teenager, a number of
 witnesses received death threats; three witnesses and an
 attorney for the deceased's family were killed, one witness
 disappeared after being abducted from his office by armed men,
 and two lawyers connected with the case went into hiding. No
 defendants appeared in court when the case came up for hearing
 before the chief magistrate in January and March, and the
 defendants requested dismissal for lack of evidence. No new
 hearing date has been set.
 In another important case, journalist and actor Richard de
 Zoysa was abducted from his home in the middle of the night in
 February; his body was found the next day. His mother claimed
 that the abductors included police officers, two of whom she
 identified. The Attorney General found insufficient evidence
 to warrant an indictment against the accused police officers
 and instructed the police to contihue their investigation.
 The'attorney for the deceased's mother, local human rights
 organizations, and the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL)
 alleged that the police conducted an inadequate investigation
 
 
 1632
 SRI LANKA
 because police officers were involved and called for an
 independent investigative commission. The principal accused
 officer retained his position in the police force during the
 inquiry. The deceased's mother and her attorney received
 death threats, as did the police guards assigned to the
 attorney after he was threatened. Although motives for the
 murder are not clear, speculation revolves around de Zoysa's
 reporting on human rights matters for an international press
 service, alleged ties to leftist organizations, including the
 JXP, and reputed authorship of a satirical play aimed at
 President Premadasa.
 In a February case, 13 people were abducted by masked gunmen
 who identified themselves as members of the security forces.
 One escaped; the others' naked bodies were found partly
 burned. Thirteen police officers were arrested in the case,
 and six were charged with murder. The magisterial hearing had
 not been completed at the end of 1990.
 In the northeast, during the first half of 1990, as the IPKF
 completed its withdrawal and the LTTE was establishing
 dominance over other Tamil militant groups, the LTTE was
 widely considered responsible for the deaths of many rival
 Tamil politicians. The preponderance of evidence indicates
 that the LTTE was also responsible for the deaths in May of a
 Tamil parliamentarian in Colombo and 13 members (including
 another parliamentarian) of a rival Tamil party who had taken
 refuge in Madras, India.
 In the second half of the year, more than 1,500 civilians were
 believed to have died in the northeast during clashes between
 the LTTE and the Government (see also Section l.g.).
 b. Disappearance
 Disappearances of both Tamils and Sinhalese, usually young
 men, continued in 1990. Such disappearances may have numbered
 in the thousands, but the exact number is unknown. In many
 cases, family members or other witnesses attested in sworn
 affidavits to seeing persons--who later "disappeared"--being
 arrested. Many affidavits described efforts to visit arrested
 persons at police stations, military camps, or detention
 centers; security officials claimed that the persons seen
 being arrested were not in custody. Other families have
 testified that detainees known to have been released never
 returned home, presumably because they were killed after
 release.
 There were also continuing instances in which fellow detainees
 claimed to have seen in custody persons whom the security
 forces denied arresting. In a few cases, detainees saw
 missing persons taken away by security forces and not
 returned. Such reports suggest that some missing persons were
 killed by the security forces, perhaps in reprisal for attacks
 on security force personnel and their families. While the
 Government in February lifted the ER authorization granted to
 the security forces to dispose of bodies without inquest,
 other Emergency Regulations (55b-f) still restrict full,
 public inquiries into the causes and circumstances of deaths.
 In September two police officers were convicted of illegally
 detaining and torturing a Muslim home guard in May 1989.
 Compensation of over $500 was awarded, although the guard and
 his parents had disappeared in December 1989. The guard and
 
 
 SRI LANKA
 his mother reportedly disappeared after they reported to a
 police station, as the guard was required to do regularly as a
 condition of his bail. The father disappeared after going to
 look for the his wife and son at the police station.
 Credible reports indicate that the security forces rounded up
 large groups of Tamils and that many suspects were summarily
 executed. In one case, credible sources reported that over
 100 Tamils disappeared after being taken from a refugee camp
 in the east in early September; the security forces maintain
 that only 35 people from the camp were taken in for
 questioning and that all were later released.
 Sri Lankan attorneys brought 61 lawsuits in 1990 asking the
 Government to produce missing persons. Many earlier cases
 were dropped when the Government released over 3,000 Tamil and
 Sinhalese militants. Government authorities are required to
 respond within days to such suits under normal circumstances,
 but the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) permits a 12-month
 delay. The Government has said that false names given to
 conceal identity or affiliation and the possible departure
 from the country of many detainees after a short detention
 period complicate the process of accounting for disappeared
 persons.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Although the Constitution forbids torture and cruel, inhuman,
 or degrading treatment or punishment, the ER allow the use in
 court of confessions made to police officers and place the
 burden of proof on defendants to show that a confession was
 exacted under duress. Some government security officials
 acknowledge that security forces have used torture to elicit
 information and cooperation from suspected members of the JVP
 and LTTE. Victims and family members have also alleged
 torture by Tamil militant groups. The trial of three police
 officers, charged with murder in the death of a lawyer and
 accused JVP activist while in police custody in September
 1988, was still in progress at the end of. 1990; there was
 medical evidence that he had been beaten to death.
 Police have also detained suspects on suspicion and used
 torture to elicit information in criminal investigations. The
 police officers convicted of illegally detaining and torturing
 a home guard (see Section l.b.) were investigating a robbery.
 The prisons ordinance defines two categories- of prisoners:
 remand prisoners or those awaiting trial have statutory rights
 to visits by family members and legal counsel among other
 privileges; convicted prisoners also have statutory rights but
 these are less liberal. Harsher conditions are endured by
 persons detained under the emergency regulations or the
 prevention of terrorism statutes; they are held in army
 stockades and prison camps not under the jurisdiction of the
 prisons department, but these facilities also permit some
 visits by relatives and lawyers. Beatings and torture do
 occur in such facilities, and the Red Cross and local human
 rights organizations are working to have them brought under
 control.

 SRI LANKA
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution provides that no person "shall be arrested
 except according to procedure established by law." An
 arrested person must be informed of the reason for his arrest
 and brought within 24 hours before a magistrate who may
 authorize bail or, for serious crimes, order continued
 detention. Detainees are generally brought before a
 magistrate within a few days of arrest, but there are reports
 of detainees who are never informed of the reason for their
 arrest. A suspect may also be detained up to 3 months without
 bail or longer if a court so rules. The PTA, adopted in 1979,.
 and the ER, renewed monthly with the extension of the state of
 emergency in effect since 1983, permit preventive and
 incommunicado detention.
 .Under the ER, security forces may detain a suspect for up to 3
 months before he must be presented to a magistrate.
 Magistrates are not empowered to investigate the circumstances
 leading to a person's arrest and continued detention but must
 remand him to a prison where he may be held indefinitely. A
 person held under the PTA may be detained without charge for
 up to 18 months. There have been cases in which persons have
 been held longer. Bail may be granted for persons held under
 .the ER but, once charged, PTA detainees are ineligible for
 bail. Visits by.family, access to lawyers, food, and other
 conditions of incarceration are normally restricted under
 these laws. In one case in 1990, persons acquitted in a
 bombing trial were rearrested under the ER.
 Persons may challenge the legality of their detention either
 by filing a writ of habeas corpus in the Courts of Appeal or
 by charging the Government before the Supreme Court with
 violating fundamental constitutional rights. However, there
 were cases in which these provisions did not provide effective
 means of redress to persons alleging arbitrary detention. The
 Courts of Appeal are located only in Colombo, necessitating
 costly travel to the capital for those seeking redress.
 Fundamental rights suits must be filed--complete with
 documentation--within 30 days of the alleged infringement.
 The 30-day limit makes it virtually impossible for persons
 detained incommunicado for prolonged periods, or relatives of
 those alleged to have disappeared, to bring such suits. The
 Government in November proposed a constitutional amendment
 that would extend this time limit to 4 months.
 In September 1989 the Government stated it would file lists of
 detainees with local officials and permit access to them by
 family members and other interested persons. The Government
 also said it would permit Members of Parliament to visit
 certain places of detention after prior notice to the Ministry
 of Defense. By the end of 1990, the Government had provided
 the names bf several thousand detainees to Members of
 Parliament but had not yet provided lists to local officials.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) visited
 over 600 places of detention, primarily in the south, where
 most of the detention sites are located (see Section 4).
 A three-person advisory board, first established in 1988,
 reviews PTA and ER cases and makes nonbinding recommendations
 for handling them. The Government concurred with many of the
 board's recommendations in 1990, but disagreed with or delayed
 implementing others. By mid-August, the board had reviewed
 the cases of over 13,000 suspected JVP members, including
 almost.3,000 who had surrendered to the independent "surrender
 
 
 1635
 
 SRI LANKA
 committees" established under the January 1990 Youth
 Commission report on youth unrest. The board recommended the
 release of over 2,000 detainees, the short-term rehabilitation
 and release of around 6,000, and the long-term rehabilitation
 or prosecution of over 4,000. According to government
 statistics in mid-October, over 2,000 detainees had been
 released and approximately 4,000 were in rehabilitation
 centers. There was a credible report in October that the
 Government had stopped releasing detainees in the south and
 that, with new arrests, the detainee population had grown to
 16,000. A government official also stated in August that the
 Government had temporarily halted the release of JVP
 suspects.
 Fearing LTTE attacks in Colombo after fighting broke out in
 June, the Government arrested up to a thousand Tamils in the
 capital area. Some were allegedly beaten while in custody.
 After intervention by Tamil leaders and others, all but a few
 reportedly were released. In October, apparently again
 fearing LTTE attacks in Colombo after the LTTE allowed freer
 travel from Jaffna and thousands made their way southward, the
 Government, resuming an earlier practice, raided hotels and
 arrested several hundred Tamil youths found there. It is not
 known how many LTTE members or others were detained in the
 northeast by the security forces during the second half of the
 year. There are reports that the LTTE is holding as many as
 4,000 political opponents in the northern peninsula but these
 reports cannot be verified (see also Section l.g.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Substantial due process rights are accorded in nonpolitical
 cases, but trials under the PTA and ER lack several
 significant procedural safeguards. Persons accused of
 criminal acts generally receive a fair public trial, are
 informed of the charges and the evidence against them, and are
 represented by counsel of their choice. Persons tried on
 criminal charges in the High Court and the Court of Appeals
 are provided an attorney at government expense if necessary.
 The Government does not provide attorneys in other cases,
 though private legal aid organizations provide assistance to
 some defendants. Public trial by jury is the custom. Juries
 are not provided in trials under the PTA on the grounds that
 jury members could be intimidated. Confessions are admissible
 in PTA and ER cases but not in cases tried outside the PTA and
 ER framework. Those convicted under the PTA or the ER have
 the same right of appeal to the Courts of Appeal and Supreme
 Court as those sentenced in other cases. In practice,
 however, most people held under these acts are never formally
 charged and therefore do not enter the appeals process.
 According to law, the Sri Lankan judiciary is independent.
 The President appoints all judges of the Sri Lankan Supreme
 Court, Courts of Appeal, and High Courts. The Chief Justice
 and two Supreme Court judges comprise a Judicial Service
 Commission which appoints, transfers, and dismisses lower
 court judges. Judges serve from time of appointment to
 mandatory retirement age (65 for Supreme Court judges and 62
 for others).
 In the northeastern province, hostilities and LTTE
 intimidation prevented the judiciary from functioning in
  1 90.
 
 
 1636
 -SRI LAKA
 It is impossible to determine how many of the approximately
 10,000 detainees the Government acknowledges holding might be
 termed political prisoners. By mid-October, the Government
 had brought indictments against more than 109 persons under
 the PTA and 39 under the ER.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government generally respects individual privacy and the
 sanctity of the family and the home, and the judiciary usually
 upholds privacy rights in cases that reach the High Court.
 Search and arrest warrants are normally required to enter
 private premises, but the PTA permits certain police officers
 to enter and search any premises without a warrant and seize
 "any document or thing" when there is a presumption or
 evidence of support for, or involvement with, unlawful
 activity. These powers were used extensively in 1990.
 Government monitoring of telephones or correspondence is
 believed to occur on a selective basis.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 During the second half of 1989 and the first half of 1990, a
 truce was in effect between the LTTE and Government while the
 two parties negotiated. During this time, the Government
 acceded to a number of LTTE requests for withdrawal from
 police and military positions. However, on June 11 the LTTE
 attacked seven police stations in the east without warning,
 reinitiating hostilities with the Government which continued
 through 1990 and resulting in indiscriminate killing on a wide
 scale. Over 600 police surrendered or were captured in the
 initial attacks, and although most of the bodies have not been
 found, it is widely believed that the LTTE killed at least 200
 and probably many more. Despite government efforts to limit
 the fighting to the Government and LTTE through frequent
 public calls for communal restraint by the President and other
 high officials, the stationing of extra security forces around
 Colombo, and the recruitment of home guards to protect
 villages, over 1,600 noncombatants were killed in the
 northeast and adjacent areas between June 11 and the end of
 the year. This figure, which is half the figure for combatant
 fatalities, is based primarily on government and newspaper
 accounts and is probably low since many reports of incidents
 never reach the media. It is unclear what percentage of
 civilian deaths is attributable to deliberate attacks by the
 LTTE or government security forces and what percentage is the
 result of civilians being caught in cross fire. The LTTE's
 wide use of antipersonnel mines caused indiscriminate harm to
 many in the northeast, and their tactic of hiding among the
 Tamil population also led to civilian casualties as a result
 of attacks against them. The predominantly Sinhalese security
 forces, not always able to distinguish between Tamil civilians
 and LTTE members out of uniform, caused an unknown number of
 deaths. The LTTE reportedly forced Tamils to leave refugee
 camps so that the guerrilla fighters would have better cover
 for their movements. Tamils deserted scores of villages in
 the east to avoid becoming victims of the fighting.
 Beginning in mid-July, the LTTE attacked numerous Muslim and
 Sinhalese villagers in the northeast and surrounding areas,
 often hacking victims to death. In the first major incident,
 the LTTE kidnaped, killed, and burned around 60 Muslims
 
 
 1681
 SRI LANKA
 returning from Colombo to their village in the east. In
 October the LTTE threatened more such attacks if the
 approximately 40,000 Muslims in a northwestern area did not
 leave within a few days. The LTTE claimed that the Government
 was responsible for the attacks, but there was no evidence of
 government involvement. In one town where over 100 Muslims
 were gunned down while praying in a mosque, relatives of
 victims identified individual LTTE cadres among the
 attackers.
 Under pressure to provide villagers in the northeast with
 protection, the Government reportedly armed as many as 30,000
 home guards, mostly Muslims, with shotguns and provided them
 minimal training rather than spread the regular forces too
 thinly. Although President Premadasa called for communal
 restraint, by September there were credible reports of a
 number of attacks on Tamil villagers in the east by Muslim
 villagers and the newly recruited Muslim home guards. Despite
 the President's appeals to the military for discipline, there
 were numerous credible reports of abuses committed by the
 military forces, including extrajudicial killings and
 looting. Large numbers of Tamil youths rounded up during
 cordon-and-search operations in the east have failed to return
 to their homes (see Section l.b.). Credible eyewitnesses
 report seeing piles of bodies-allegedly those of persons
 seized by security forces- burning on tires in an eastern
 town. An international organization source and some reputable
 local residents estimate that over a thousand Tamils may have
 been arrested and executed in an eastern district over the
 period from June to October; however, there is no firm
 evidence to corroborate this charge.
 Many Tamils in the northern peninsula, dominated by the LTTE
 since June, reported incidents of apparently indiscriminate
 bombing of civilian areas. Some Tamil leaders in Colombo
 claimed to have information from the peninsula that the Air
 Force was, in fact, aiming for LTTE positions but inaccuracy
 of fire and the location of LTTE military installations in
 populated areas led to civilian casualties. A government
 videotape revealed LTTE bunkers constructed in one school in
 the north. Before heavy bombing around the besieged Jaffna
 Fort, the Air Force repeatedly dropped leaflets warning
 civilians to depart. As a result, there was considerable
 damage to property around the fort but few civilians were
 .killed.
 There were also reports of civilian deaths when security
 forces returned LTTE mortar fire from civilian locations. In
 some cases, LTTE fighters initiated attacks on government
 forces from seized private houses, with the apparent intention
 of provoking counterattacks on civilians. The Government
 claims it often withheld return fire in such situations.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and
 expression, but permits these rights to be restricted by law
 in the interest of national security.
 Opposition groups alleged that the ER have been used directly
 and indirectly to restrict free speech. For example, persons
 wishing to post bills advertising meetings of any type are
 required under the ER to secure police approval of the text,
 
 
 1638
 SRI LANKA
 although, pursuant to a Supreme Court ruling in 1987, the
 police must specify a reason for denying permission. There
 were no known prosecutions for distribution of
 "antigovernment" literature in 1990. However, the Government
 considers possession of JVP literature prima facie evidence of
 involvement in the organization and reason for detention under
 the ER. Under the amended 1978 Parliamentary Powers and
 Privileges Act, Parliament may impose an unlimited fine or up
 to 2 years' imprisonment on anyone who criticizes a Member of
 Parliament, a clear deterrent to freedom of expression. The
 amendment was not applied in 1990.
 The Government controls the country's largest newspaper chain "
 and owns the radio and television services. Only government-
 cleared news is allowed to be broadcast on television. A
 variety of independent newspapers and journals provide a range
 of viewpoints on foreign policy and most domestic matters,
 including human rights issues. Many newspapers criticize the
 ruling party and the Government. Many small-circulation
 periodicals are also published by opposition political parties.
 In the wake of the murder of journalist Richard de Zoysa (see
 Section l.a.), four other journalists left the country. One,
 a correspondent for an international press agency, reportedly
 left after receiving a government warning not to publish
 stories concerning human rights. Journalists claim that they
 must balance journalistic integrity with security
 considerations vis-a-vis both the Government and
 antigovernment radicals. Journalists have made credible
 claims that various groups have required their newspapers to
 run articles the groups have provided, and threatened the
 journalists when their demands were not met. The media based
 in the northern peninsula, where the LTTE has been dominant,
 have exercised particular caution.
 There was no formal political censorship in 1990, but some Sri
 Lankans assert the Government can intimidate the press into
 self-censorship. By threatening to take over private media
 which it claims do not serve the public interest, for
 instance, the-Government allegedly prevented the media from
 accepting advertisements from certain organizations. Although
 the Government denies it, it is widely alleged by members of
 the media that the Government also exerts pressure on the
 press by controlling permits for the import of newsprint and
 through placement of paid government announcements and
 advertising.
 In 1990 the Government announced it would enforce the Press
 Council Law, which prohibits unauthorized publication of
 cabinet discussions and decisions. Charges have never been
 brought under the law, but fear of sanctions further
 encourages self-censorship. Early in 1990 an editor whose
 newspaper-had reported cabinet meeting conversations in detail
 was removed after statements by the President's office that
 media leaders should understand the intent of the Press
 Council Law and that abuses would not be tolerated.
 In February the Government lifted the section of the ER that
 authorized suppression of any article or program that might be
 prejudicial to national security, public order, or the
 maintenance of essential services.
 Although academic freedom is generally respected by the
 Government, a new regulation was imposed in January banning
 
 
 1639
 SRI LANKA
 political or "disruptive" activities at all schools (see
 Section 2.b.), and dozens of students were expelled from
 university residences for unruly behavior.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 association, but these rights can be restricted under
 provisions of the ER and PTA. Sri Lanka has numerous private
 associations, and they are free to maintain ties with
 international bodies.
 In January, shortly before the reopening of universities and
 schools after a hiatus of 3 years, the Government issued a new
 ER prohibiting political and disruptive activity in schools
 and workplaces (see also Section 6.b.). Permission for
 meetings must be obtained from the head of an institution.
 Under this ER, the President (or his designee) was also
 authorized to prohibit any public meetings "likely to cause a
 disturbance to public order and promote disaffection." This
 section of the ER was lifted in April. In practice, the
 police issue or deny permits for outdoor meetings or
 processions at the discretion of the superintendent'of police
 in each locality. In 1990 permits to hold public meetings
 were denied in volatile situations where the Government felt
 violence might erupt, such as public meetings called in August
 in response to the LTTE massacres of Muslim and Sinhala
 villagers. The Government retained in effect the order that
 it issued in 1988 to its security forces to shoot on sight
 illegal antigovernment demonstrators, but did not use it in
 1990.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution establishes Buddhism as the official
 religion, which the Government must "protect and foster." It
 also provides for the rights of members of other faiths,
 including Hindus, Muslims, and Christians, to practice their
 religion freely.
 Religious groups are free to maintain active ties with
 coreligionists in other countries, and many Sri Lankans
 perform religious travel each year. Religious publishing and
 proselytizing are freely allowed, and foreign clergy may work
 in Sri Lanka. For over 30 years, however, the Government has
 forbidden the entry of new foreign Jesuit clergy, while
 allowing those already in the country to remain.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution grants every citizen "freedom of movement and
 of choosing his residence within Sri Lanka" and "freedom to
 return to Sri Lanka." These constitutional provisions are
 generally honored. However, acting on evidence that Tamil
 militants and their military supplies were frequently crossing
 between southern India and northern Sri Lanka via the Palk
 Strait after fighting broke out in June, the Government
 attempted to interdict suspect boats, some of which carried
 refugees. Despite accusations from various Tamil sources,
 there is no evidence that the Navy deliberately fired on
 refugee boats. The Government did, however, follow a policy
 of turning back refugee boats bound for southern India after
 Indian authorities complained about a wave of new refugees.

 SRI LANKA
 The Government has generally allowed nongovernmental
 organizations (NGO's) and journalists free access to the
 northeast. Exceptions occurred when area commanders forbade
 travel because of short-term sectrity problems.
 Movement in the northeast was also restricted by local curfews
 imposed by the Government during specific operations in the
 second half of the year. According to credible reports,
 movement in the north during this period was hazardous,
 particularly by day, because the Air Force, working under the
 assumption that only the LTTE had access to vehicles and fuel,
 might fire at any vehicle moving on the roads. There were
 reports of civilians traveling by bicycle and foot being fired
 upon by aircraft.
 The LTTE required civilians who wanted to leave the northern
 peninsula to obtain written permission, submit to luggage
 searches, and in some cases pay a large fee. Concerned about
 potential LTTE threats in Colombo when the LTTE briefly
 allowed freer movement out of the peninsula in October, the
 Government required displaced persons coming to Colombo to.
 stay with friends or relatives, or in refugee camps, rather
 than in unlicensed places of accommodation.
 Sri Lanka generally denies entry to refugees or displaced
 persons from other countries. The Government does not help
 refugees who attempt to stay in the country while seeking
 permanent residence elsewhere. During 1990 the Government
 helped with the return of almost 90,000 Sri Lankan nationals
 displaced from jobs in Kuwait by the Iraqi invasion. There
 were over 850,000 internally displaced persons in Sri Lanka by
 the end of October. Most lived in refugee camps in the
 northeast or adjacent provinces. Over 200,000 Sri Lankan
 Tamil refugees left the island for southern India during 1990,
 most in the second half of the year. In addition, as many as
 40,000 Sri Lankan Tamils have sought refuge in Western Europe
 and North America.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens have the constitutional right to change their
 government through periodic multiparty elections on the basis
 of universal adult suffrage.
 In December 1988, the current President was elected with 50.4
 percent of the popular vote. In February 1989, the
 President's party won 50.7 percent of the popular vote and 125
 of 225 seats in the nation's first parliamentary elections in
 12 years. International observer teams found both elections
 generally free and fair, given JVP attempts to disrupt the
 voting, but the teams were very small and were able to monitor
 only a small number of polling places. The leading opposition
 presidential candidate challenged the results of the
 presidential election in a petition to the Supreme Court. She
 alleged that the prevailing violence, as well as government-
 sponsored coercion and vote fraud, unfairly influenced the
 outcome. Witnesses were still being called at the end of
 1990. The one election scheduled for 1990--election of
 members of the Northeast Provincial Council--had to be
 postponed indefinitely because of fighting in the area in the
 second half of the year.
 A total of 24 political parties are legally recognized; 8 hold
 seats in the Parliament.
 
 
 1641
 
 SRI LANKA
 Although members of each ethnic community can be found in many
 of the political parties, the most influential political
 parties generally draw their support from one ethnic
 community. Historically, the two parties dominant in the
 majority Sinhalese electorate have alternated rule.
 In 1988 and 1989, several formerly militant Tamil groups that
 had accepted the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord emerged as political
 parties in the northeast, representing the Ceylon Tamil
 population. One of these won 13 seats in Parliament to become
 the third largest party there and the largest parliamentary
 party in the northeast.
 There are no de jure impediments to women's participation in
 politics and government. Although underrepresented, there are
 women at senior levels in both these areas, including a
 cabinet minister and the leader of the principal opposition
 party, who was formerly prime minister.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Several local nongovernmental organizations monitor human
 rights, including the Civil Rights Movement and the Movement
 for Interracial Justice and Equality. They collect
 information from families of victims or members of citizens'
 committees near the site of alleged incidents. The Government
 generally does not address their periodic reports and
 appeals. In addition to the killing of journalist Richard de
 Zoysa (see Section 1.a7.), several human rights activists
 reported receiving threats in 1990 either clearly or
 presumably from members of the security forces.
 The Government showed increased responsiveness to criticism of
 human rights in Sri Lanka. As one example, the President
 established a high-level human rights task force in November
 which, if it fulfills its mandate, will inquire into human
 rights cases referred to it by domestic and international
 sources and promote the disciplining of members of the
 security forces who commit human rights abuses. It will also
 recommend to the President further steps to improve the
 Government's human rights performance. Senior government
 officials have made-themselves available to visitors looking
 into human rights issues and have responded to inquiries from
 the United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) and foreign
 governments. The Government in July invited the UNHRC
 Subcommission on Disappearances to visit Sri Lanka early in
 1991, but, because of the Subcommission's schedule, the trip
 is now set for September 1991. However, the Government has
 denied Amnesty International permission to visit. In October
 1989, 6 years after the ICRC had first offered its services,
 the Government invited an ICRC team to visit Sri Lanka to
 extend humanitarian assistance. In November 1989, the team
 began visiting places of detention to interview JVP suspects
 and by June 1990 had visited over 600 places of detention and
 registered more than 15,000 detainees. In the north, however,
 the Indian Peacekeeping Force denied the ICRC access to
 prisoners it held.
 Several times in 1990 the Government prevented human rights
 activists from removing human rights-related materials from
 the country. In one case the material was a newspaper article
 from a major Colombo English-language daily. In another
 
 
 1642
 SRI LANKA
 instance, a Member of Parliament was prevented from taking
 documents concerning human rights abuses to a session of the
 Subcommission on Disappearances of the UNHRC in Europe. The
 vast majority of the documents were returned to the
 parliamentarian several weeks later, after extensive publicity
 and the threat of legal action against the Government.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Tamils have long charged with some justification that they
 suffer systematic discrimination in competition for university
 entrance, employment opportunities, and other matters under
 government control. Government officials have denied these
 charges, pointing out that prominent Tamils occupy
 senior-level civil service positions.  Many of these Tamils
 are approaching retirement age, however, and there are few
 Tamils in the lower ranks of the civil service and military to
 take their places. The low proportions are due in part to
 Tamils declining many positions offered them in government and
 the security forces because of ethnic hostilities in the
 1980's. There was no evidence of systematic or official
 discrimination in university enrollment or government or
 private employment in 1990. Under the Constitution's 13th
 Amendment, enacted in November 1988 to implement the terms of
 the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, Tamil and Sinhalese were made
 coofficial languages and English the "link", language.
 However, one observer estimates that 98 percent of all schools
 still are segregated by language. During 1990 the Government
 continued its efforts to resuscitate the teaching of English
 as a lingua franca.
 Indian Tamils have suffered particular discrimination. No
 longer qualifying for citizenship under Indian law, they were
 also denied Sri Lankan citizenship by laws adopted after
 independence. Since then, the Sri Lankan and Indian
 Governments have reached-several agreements aimed at resolving
 the problem of these stateless Tamils. Under a 1986
 agreement, the Sri Lankan Government agreed to grant
 citizenship to all remaining stateless Tamils. In November
 1988, the Government eliminated processing delays by passing a
 law making extension of citizenship to these stateless persons
 automatic upon simple request. The new legislation did not
 cover some 94,000 Tamils who themselves or whose parents once
 applied for Indian citizenship but who now wish to stay in Sri
 Lanka. These will be compelled to leave Sri Lanka, presumably
 for India. None, however, had been forced to leave by the end
 of 1990.
 To help address Tamil concerns, the Government had been
 attempting to recruit Tamils to the largely Sinhalese military
 and to establish a predominantly Tamil police force for the
 northeast province. There were few Tamil volunteers for the
 military, but a number of candidates for the provincial police
 force were offered by the LTTE. Allegations by some Tamil
 leaders that the Government deliberately delayed hiring Tamil
 policemen are difficult to judge, and the plan for a
 provincial police force could not be implemented because of
 the LTTE attacks in June.
 Complaints in the past that Buddhists had an advantage over
 members of other religions in winning senior government
 positions are still heard, but less frequently. Members of
 
 
 1643
 SRI LANKA
 all religious groups hold influential positions in the
 Government and in major political parties.
 Sri Lankan women have equal rights under the law, including
 equal property and inheritance rights. However, various
 ethnic and religious groups have their own strictures which
 place limitatidns on women. Some Tamil families believe their
 women members should not be seen working in public. Some
 Muslim women are discouraged by members of their community
 from seeking higher education or employment. Women do fill
 important posts in the civil service, the professions, and
 business, but most are found either in manual and semiskilled
 jobs or in the home. The Government sets pay rates for most
 agricultural and nonagricultural work, and according to
 Ministry of Labor Statistics, women are paid equally for equal
 or similar work.
 Violence against women occurs in Sri Lanka, but little is
 published about its extent. There are no official statistics
 on the subject. Abuse within the family is seldom reported or
 discussed publicly owing to a strong sense of family privacy.
 Perpetrators of violence against women may be prosecuted under
 the criminal code, but many women are reluctant to pursue
 charges against family members. There are infrequent reports
 of rape, wife beating, and murder of wives by husbands.
 Several women's advocacy groups have begun documenting and
 treating cases of violence against women.
 The Government established a commission for the elimination of
 discrimination and the monitoring of fundamental rights late
 in 1986. Charged with investigating individual complaints on
 the basis of race, religion, language, caste, sex, political
 opinion, or place of birth, the commission resolved over 200
 complaints by year's end. Many of these complaints were
 related to the workplace.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 association and the right to form and join trade unions. Any
 seven workers may form a union, draw up their own procedures,
 elect their own representatives, and formulate programs.
 Worker rights, including the right to choose representatives,
 publicize views, and determine programs, are protected by
 law. Unions are free to affiliate internationally, and
 different Sri Lankan trade union federations are affiliates of
 all three major international trade union organizations.
 Public servants have no right to strike and are not provided
 arbitration machinery. Aggrieved public servants may appeal
 to the Public Service Commission for relief. However, union
 activists and labor lawyers claim that the Commission is
 biased against employees. Other workers are free to strike,
 and have done so frequently in the past. There were only a
 few strikes in 1990. These were small, isolated strikes in
 the plantation sector, mostly over administrative matters that
 were subsequently settled. Strikes in key industries require
 21 days' notice and are subject to. other limitations. Under
 the Essential Services Act, the President may declare any
 business to be an essential service, making a strike illegal.
 There were no JVP-enforced involuntary strikes during 1990, as
 there had been in the years 1987-89.
 
 
 1644
 
 SRI LANKA
 Together, about 1,000 labor unions and federations--there are
 no clearly dominant trade union centers--represent about
 one-third of the 5.5 million-strong labor force. Although
 there are a few independent unions, most large worker
 organizations are affiliated with political parties and play a
 significant role in the political process. Two unions are
 affiliated with, but are not directly controlled by, the
 ruling party.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Antiunion discrimination is prohibited by law, and workers are
 expressly granted the right to bargain collectively by
 formatiun of workers' councils to promote a voluntary
 worker-employer dialogue. Workers who believe that they have
 suffered discrimination as a result of their union affiliation
 or who believe that the right to bargain collectively has been
 abridged may lodge complaints with the Commissioner of Labor,
 the Labor Tribunal, or the Supreme Court. Department of Labor
 officers may arbitrate when workers and employers are not able
 to resolve a dispute. These officers are stationed throughout
 the country to assure that employers fulfill their legal and
 contractual obligations to workers and- to be available for
 mediation in minor local disputes.
 Workers in the nonplantation agricultural sector and most of
 those employed in small businesses, as well as workers in the
 free trade zones, are not represented by unions. Unionization
 in the zones is not prohibited by law but is discouraged in
 practice by employers and the Government. Union organizers do
 not have access to workers inside the zone. Zone employees
 participate in labor-management company associations. Workers
 in the zone have the same legal right to strike, but in
 practice strikes are rare. Workers in the unorganized
 agricultural sector are not covered by labor laws, although
 the Government may investigate individual complaints. In
 January a new regulation prohibiting political or disruptive
 activities at all workplaces and schools took effect (see
 Section 2.b.). At that time, there had been no JVP-enforced
 strikes for 6 months, and concern was expressed that the
 regulation, which requires obtaining permission from the head
 of an institution before holding a meeting, might be used to
 prohibit legitimate labor activity. To date the regulation
 has not been enforced in the workplace.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 While not prohibited by law, forced labor is not practiced by
 the Government or the private sector. The LTTE began forcibly
 conscripting labor for digging trenches and building bunkers
 beginning in September 1990.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Employment of children under age 12 is prohibited. Those
 between ages 12 and 14 are called child workers and may not be
 employed in industry or dangerous occupations. Employment of
 young persons between 15 and 18 is subject to certain
 restrictions. Employees under age 18 cannot be required to
 work outside specified hours. In addition, employers are
 required to provide young workers with annual leave, rest
 periods, and meal breaks similar to those provided to adult
 workers. There is no compulsory education law.
 
 
 1645
 
 SRI LANKA
 In practice there is a work force of children, probably
 numbering in the thousands, who work illegally, mostly at jobs
 in rice cultivation, as domestics, or as street peddlers.
 Public awareness of this problem is increasing, but efforts to
 redress it have been hampered by the fact that in many cases'
 child workers are an important source of family income.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no national minimum wage, but wage boards for 37
 different trades set minimum wages and working conditions.
 For example, the minimum wage rate for nurses, bus drivers,
 and garment workers is about $25 per month. Actual wages and
 working conditions generally exceed these minimums, which many
 union leaders consider insufficient for maintaining a decent
 standard of living. Most permanent full-time workers are
 covered by laws that provide that they shall work no more than
 45 hours per week and that they will receive a 14-day paid
 annual holiday.
 Minimum conditions for the protection of the safety and health
 of workers are set forth in legislation passed by Parliament
 and implemented by the Department of Labor, which employs a
 small staff of engineers and inspectors for this purpose.
 Fines up to $150 may be levied on employers who fail to meet
 the prescribed standards. The Department of Labor educates
 workers about minimum standards for different workplaces and
 encourages the use of safety equipment such as earplugs and
 safety guards. Government enforcement of health and safety
 standards is poor.
