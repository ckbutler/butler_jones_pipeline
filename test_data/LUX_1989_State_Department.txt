 LUXEMBOURG
 Luxembourg is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary
 democracy. The Grand Duke is the Chief of State, but his
 duties are mostly ceremonial. Real power rests with the
 12-member Government, headed by the Prime Minister and
 responsible to Parliament, which receives its authority
 through free and fair elections.
 The police and gendarmerie maintain internal order. Both
 organizations are under the control of the Government and
 respect human rights. The country is free from strife, and
 residents enjoy fair and efficient judicial and penal systems.
 The Grand Duchy is a highly developed, industrialized state
 with a free enterprise economic system and a high standard of
 living.
 Luxembourg continued its commitment to human rights in 1989.
 Individual human rights are ensured by the Constitution and
 protected in practice, and Luxembourg actively promotes human
 rights internationally. It continues efforts to treat its
 relatively large foreign population fairly and to engage labor
 unions in the industrial decisionmaking process.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Politically motivated killings did not occur.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known abductions or hostage-taking cases.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by law and does not occur.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Due process is provided by law and observed in practice.
 Luxembourg law is a composite of local practice, legal
 tradition, and foreign systems--French, Belgian, and German.
 Except in cases of hot pursuit, a warrant must be obtained
 from the judiciary before an arrest may be made. Any person
 detained by the authorities must be charged and appear before
 a judge no later than 24 hours after arrest. Immediate access
 to a lawyer of one's own choosing is accorded by law. No one
 is held incommunicado. Bail may be granted, depending on the
 circumstances. Preventive detention does not exist, but
 persons may be incarcerated pending trial, if so ordered by a
 judge. Exile is not imposed.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Luxembourg's judiciary is independent and free from executive
 or military interference. Due process is ensured. Military
 courts exist, but civilians are not. subject to their
 jurisdiction. The right of defendants to have legal counsel,
 at public expense if necessary, is assured. Charges are
 
 
 1187
 formally and clearly stated. Defendants have the right to be
 tried in public, to confront witnesses, and to present
 evidence. They are presumed innocent until proven guilty.
 Verdicts may be appealed by either the defendant or the
 State. An appeal results in a completely new judicial
 hearing,.and sentences may be increased as well as reduced.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Rome, or
 Correspondence
 Luxembourg law and customs are based on regard for personal
 freedom. The State, political organizations, and other
 entities do not arbitrarily intrude into the private lives of
 Luxembourg residents. Police must have a warrant, issued by
 the judiciary, to enter a private home. Statutes prohibit
 other violations of the home such as demolition, and the
 sealing of doors and windows. Wiretaps are not legal.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and the press,
 which is respected in practice. Except for restrictions on
 pornography, there is no censorship of the media. The
 broadcast industry is privately owned, except 4 percent which
 is indirectly controlled by the French Government. The
 industry operates independently from the Luxembourg
 Government. The print media are privately owned and
 controlled. Academic freedom is respected.
 While not limiting free speech, a rarely used law contains a
 provision which may reduce public debate on a given issue. It
 provides that a law may be promulgated by the Grand Duke after
 certain bodies (the Chamber of Commerce, the Council of
 State--a parliamentary consultative body made up of
 representatives of all elements of Luxembourg society--and the
 appropriate committee of the Chamber of Deputies) have given
 their opinions on a report which has been submitted by the
 relevant minister(s) and approved by the Cabinet. This
 procedure avoids a parliamentary debate and was used'in 1989
 to pass a law clarifying bank secrecy.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association is assured
 constitutionally and respected in practice. There are no
 limitations on orderly public meetings. All groups enjoy the
 right of free assembly, and permits are routinely issued when
 required.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. -Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion in Luxembourg, and one may freely
 practice the religion of one's choice; including: maintaining
 places of worship, training clergy, publishing religious
 material, providing religious education, and participating in
 charitable activities. Statistically, 90 percent of the
 residents are Roman Catholics.

 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within the country
 (including changing residence or workplace), foreign travel,
 or emigration and repatriation. Refugees are treated fairly,
 and they are not forced to return to countries in which they
 fear they would be persecuted.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The citizens of Luxembourg have the right and ability to
 change their government peacefully. All Luxembourg citizens
 18 years of age and older may participate in national
 elections, held every 5 years, and in local elections, held
 every 6 years. Voting is by secret ballot with multiple
 candidates for most positions. Luxembourg's large foreign
 population (26 percent) does not have the right to vote, but
 it may exert considerable influence on the political process
 indirectly by joining labor unions or other organizations.
 Representative bodies, including Parliament, are free to
 debate and vote against the Government. Opposition groups,
 including political parties, function openly and freely,
 without fear of government repression.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There were no requests for the investigation of human rights
 abuses.
 Luxembourg has consistently supported international and
 nongovernmental investigation of alleged human rights
 violations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination based on the above factors is prohibited by
 law. Adequate food, shelter, health care, and education are
 available to all inhabitants regardless of race, religion,
 sex, ethnic background, or political opinion.
 Equal pay for equal work is mandated by law. Women and men
 enjoy the same property rights. Property acquired during a
 marriage is divided equally upon dissolution of the marriage,
 unless a prenuptial agreement exists which stipulates how
 property is to be divided. Family members are protected by
 law.
 Violence against women is not widespread, and it is not
 tolerated by the Government. Wife beating is prohibited by
 law. Several women's rights groups are active in Luxembourg,
 including those which aid battered women.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right to associate freely, choose their own
 representatives, publicize views, and determine their
 programs. Slightly more than 50 percent of the labor force is
 unionized. Membership is not mandatory. The two largest
 
 
 1189
 LUXEMBOURG
 industrial unions are linked to, but organized independently
 of, Luxembourg's Socialist Party and Christian Social Party.
 With the exception of government workers who provide essential
 services, all workers have the right to strike. Government
 workers who may legally strike must observe certain
 conditions, such as a cooling off period, before implementing
 their action. Strikes are rare, however, and there were none
 in 1989.
 Unions are free from government interference and maintain
 unrestricted contact with international bodies in their
 fields. Luxembourg unions maintain affiliation with the
 European Trade Union Confederation and the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Constitution ensures freedom of union activity and
 protects union leaders and members from discrimination.
 Unions have the right to organize and bargain collectively on
 behalf of their members, and this right is applied uniformly
 throughout the country. Worker representatives are required
 in all businesses of 15 or more employees. In businesses with
 over 150 employees, 50 percent of the joint works councils are
 elected by the employees. In businesses with more than 1,000
 employees, one-third of the membership of the boards of
 directors must be employees or their elected representatives.
 An effective system exists to hear and adjudicate
 employment-related complaints.
 There are no export processing zones, and labor law and
 practice apply uniformly throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law and does not
 exist in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The employment of children under the age of 15 is prohibited.
 Children are required by law to remain in school until they
 are 16 years old. Child labor and education laws are strictly
 enforced. Adolescent workers (ages 15 to 17) are provided
 special protection by law, such as limiting overtime and
 specifying the number of hours which'may be worked
 continuously.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Luxembourg's health and safety standards are among the highest
 in the world. A safe working environment is mandated by law
 and enforced throughout the country by a stringent inspection
 system, which may impose severe penalties. Pregnant women who
 work receive special consideration in the workplace. The
 normal workweek is 40 hours, spread over 5 days. Premium pay
 is required for work outside the normal workweek. Work on
 Sunday is generally prohibited, except in certain
 circumstances, such as continuous process industries (steel
 and chemical), and for certain workers such as maintenance and
 security personnel. All workers receive a minimum of 5 weeks
 of paid vacation a year, in addition to paid holidays. The
 minimum wage is $4.50 per hour for all workers 18 years of age
 and older. Younger workers receive a lower minimum wage.
 This is $2.70 per hour for workers 15 years old. The minimum
 
 
 1190
 LUXEMBOURG
 wage increases annually until the worker is 18. A supplement
 is added for workers with dependents. It would be difficult
 to support a family on the minimum wage. However, few workers
 receive the minimum wage, and Luxembourg wages are among the
 highest in the world.
