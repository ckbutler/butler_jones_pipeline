 YUGOSLAVIA
 Yugoslavia is a multi-national state in which the League
 of Communists maintains a monopoly on political power.
 The country emerged from the collapse of the Ottoman and
 Hapsburg Empires. During World War II, ethnic and
 national tensions, aggravated by intervention by the Axis
 powers, burst into open, fratricidal conflict. Yugoslavs
 engaged in a fierce civil war on national, ethnic and
 political lines while simultaneously struggling against
 their Axis occupiers. Ethnic and national animosities
 persist, and underlie a number of long-term Yugoslav
 domestic issues with human rights implications.
 In part because of this historical experience, Yugoslav
 communism differs essentially from the highly centralized,
 Soviet-style Marxist-Leninism. There is considerable
 pluralism and decentralization within the party. Forces
 pressing for political change, particularly greater
 "pluralization' of the system, are becoming more active
 both within the party and among the population in
 general. Discussion over whether the party is to be a
 %guiding' or *leading' force is one current reflection of
 this internal debate.
 Yugoslavia continues its gradual progress toward a more
 open and pluralistic society, although Amnesty
 International reports more political trials than
 previously. Socialist self-management, as originated
 under Tito and Kardelj, in large measure allows workers
 to run their own enterprises. It also allows a small
 amount of private enterprise. There has been some
 significant change in the human rights situation in 1982.
 Almost three years after the death of Tito, the media are
 more open, public criticism of the leadership and official
 policies surfaces with more frequency, and there is
 greater decentralization of political decision-making.
 Restrictions on freedom of political expression remain but
 appear to be somewhat less rigidly enforced. Public
 criticism of former President Tito remains unacceptable to
 the authorities, but such criticism occasionally occurs,
 albeit in guarded fashion. While not a topic of open
 criticism, even the principles of socialist
 self-management are now subject to some cautious but
 critical discussion. The Government, however, does not
 tolerate public criticism of the 'brotherhood and the
 unity" of Yugoslavia's diverse peoples or of efforts to
 arouse nationalist feelings among them, and reacts
 severely to expressions of nationalism.
 Unrest in the Kosovo, resurrecting centuries-old
 Serbian-Albanian ethnic animosities, presents a
 geographically-limited but significant challenge to the
 Government. Anmesty International's reporting of an
 increased number of political trials in 1982 reflects the
 aftermath of the recent flare-up of the Kosovo issue.
 
 
 1061
 Elsewhere in Yugoslavia, there are fewer political
 prisoners than previously. Public discussion of instances
 of police abuses has increased, and the question of the
 observation of individual human rights seems to be gaining
 more attention from government officials. In April 1982,
 for instance, the Federal Chamber of the Yugoslav
 Parliament ordered the Government to submit proposals and
 initiatives for eliminating shortcomings in the protection
 of human rights. In October 1982, the Federal Chamber
 appointed a five-man committee to oversee the Yugoslav
 police, particularly with regard to their respect for the
 constitutional rights of Yugoslav citizens.
 The vast majority of Yugoslavs enjoy freedom of
 movement--including the right to travel abroad freely and
 to emigrate--and access to the foreign media. There are
 restrictions on some who are critical of the Government
 and the party. In the fall of 1982 some temporary
 measures were put into effect to discourage Yugoslavs from
 making such frequent shopping trips abroad, in an effort
 to conserve foreign exchange reserves during a period of
 national financial difficulty. The Government has
 stressed that these measures are of an emergency nature,
 and do not abrogate the right of Yugoslavs to travel.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There have been reports in the Western European press that
 the Yugoslav secret police have been responsible during
 the past few years for a series of murders in Western
 Europe of members of anti-Yugoslav emigre organizations.
 Some of the victims were allegedly engaged in terrorist
 acts against Yugoslav officials and establishments
 abroad. However, there is no conclusive proof that the
 Yugoslav Government was responsible.
 Within Yugoslavia, a small number of ethnically-inspired
 killings has occurred in the Kosovo. The press has
 publicized two murders--one of a young Serb, the other of
 a Montenegrin--by Kosovar Albanians in mid-1982. These
 killings took place against the background of
 historically-rooted powerful ethnic tensions between the
 Serbs and Albanians in the province.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no indication of the permanent or prolonged
 disappearance of persons in Yugoslavia. However, Amnesty
 International and the international press have reported in
 the past on alleged instances of kidnapping of Yugoslav
 emigres by the Yugoslav intelligence services in order to
 return-them to Yugoslavia for trial. Cases do occur in
 which no public notice is made of an arrest or trial until
 sentence is pronounced. This has happened in the Kosovo,
 where some 700 arrests for alleged Albanian nationalist or
 
 
 1062
 irredentist activities have occurred since the first
 disturbances in the province in March 1981.
 c. Torture
 The Yugoslav Constitution guarantees the "inviolability of
 the integrity of the human personality' and states that
 any extortion of a confession or statement shall be
 forbidden and punishable. Numerous passages in the
 Yugoslav code of criminal procedure have similar wording.
 Amnesty International reports the receipt of allegations
 that people have been beaten, ill-treated, or threatened
 during pre-trial detention. There have been reports, for
 instance, that some of the demonstrators arrested for
 carrying pro-Solidarity placards at a pro-Palestinian
 demonstration in June were roughed up by the police.
 There has been no specific charge of torture in connection
 with this event. The use of torture is not officially
 condoned and has become a legal issue in several court
 cases.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Conditions within Yugoslav prisons generally appear to be
 strict, but not inhumane. There have been credible
 reports, however, of particularly harsh conditions in some
 Yugoslav prisons, including allegations that some
 prisoners have been held in solitary confinement for
 extended periods. The Yugoslav press has also reported
 and editorialized against abuses of authority by the
 police and against excessive use of force. While medical
 care is generally available to prisoners, there are
 persistent reports alleging denial of proper medical
 treatment to prisoners with special medical problems.
 Prisoners may receive visits from family members, but
 sometimes visits are restricted--in pretrial cases--on the
 grounds that they would prejudice ongoing investigations.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Yugoslavs are generally free from arbitrary arrest.
 Yugoslav legal organizations and procedures derive from
 French (Napoleonic) law, which does not include such
 principles as habeas corpus and trial by jury. There is a
 requirement under the Yugoslav Constitution, however, to
 bring a defendant before a judge within 24 hours of arrest
 in order to bring about 'judicial awareness' of the reason
 for detention. The accused has the right to counsel from
 this time. Normally arraignment quickly follows arrest,
 and indictment must be brought within three months unless
 an extension is approved by the court.
 Some individuals have been imprisoned for what the
 Yugoslav Government itself calls "political crimes.*
 Yugoslav law treats as crimes those political acts which
 seek the overthrow of the constitutional order or attack
 the country's territorial integrity and basic
 constitutional values, including brotherhood, unity, and
 equality of the Yugoslav peoples. However, 'political
 
 
 1063
 crimes", as defined by the Federal Criminal Code, also
 include "crimes against the bases of the socialist
 self-management sqcial system and the security" of
 Yugoslavia and abuse of public property by members of the
 party or government officials.
 Such broad categories allow for arbitrary actions aginst
 the critics of the Government. Amnesty International, in
 its February 1982 Report, made public its 1976 appeal to
 the Yugoslav Government to delete five articles from the
 criminal code: "counter-revolutionary attacks" (Article
 114), "endangering the independence of the State" (Article
 119), "association for hostile activity" (Article 131),
 and especially "hostile propaganda" (Article 133). While
 Yugoslav officials have defended these articles on the
 grounds of the threat to society posed by historic
 animosities among some of the country's constituent
 peoples, reform of these and other articles, including the
 death penalty, has been the subject of public discussion
 by Yugoslav legal experts during the past year.
 According to Yugoslav Government statistics, from 1972
 until 1981 there was a decline in the number of persons
 indicted "for criminal activities with political
 implications, anti-self-management offenses and abuses of
 public and private property." In July 1982 the federal
 public prosecutor reported, however, that the number
 indicted for those offenses had increased from 555 in
 calendar year 1980 to 594 in 1981. He attributed the
 increase to the unrest in the Kosovo, which began in March
 of that year. According to official statistics, 62
 peccent of all these 1981 "political crimes" were
 committed in the Kosovo, and 300 of the 386 persons
 charged with "counter-revolutionary activity" were from
 the Kosovo. By nationality, the individuals charged with
 political crimes included 380 Albanians, 78 Croats, 72
 Serbs, 19 Moslems, 17 Slovenes, 11 Montenegrins, 2
 lacedonians, and 1 Hungarian. Over 40 percent were listed
 as intellectuals and students.
 The federal prosecutor noted that, over the three-year
 period 1979-82, 33 percent of the sentences for political
 crimes were probationary, and 52 percent involved terms up
 to one year. Another Yugoslav official also reported an
 increase in the number of serious political crimes in 1981
 up to almost half the total number of political crimes,
 whereas in previous years only "a very small number" had
 been charged with "the most serious political offenses."
 The Federal Secretary for Internal Affairs announced at
 the end of.September that, since the outbreak of troubles
 in the Kosovo in March 1981, the security forces had
 arrested 700 persons for what was considered
 anti-Yugoslav, Albanian nationalist- irredentist activity
 and that 320 had been put on trial. Those accused of
 "hostile activity" are generally convicted and imprisoned
 on the grounds that they "fomented national hatred" or
 sought the establishment of a separate Albanian republic,
 with the eventual aim of breaking up the Yugoslav state
 and merging with the Tirana regime. Kosovar Albanians
 charged and convicted of nationalist activities in 1982
 
 
 1064
 generally received less harsh sentences than in 1981.
 The increase in political offenses stemming from
 nationalist activities in the Kosovo has increased the
 number of political prisoners. In September 1982, the
 Government put the number of those detained in connection
 with disturbances in the Kosovo at 362, and official and
 unofficial reports suggest that another 400 persons are
 currently imprisoned in Yugoslavia on political charges,
 giving a total of approximately 800 political prisoners,
 as compared with 500-700 in previous years, according to
 government figures. Prisoners may receive visits from
 family members, but sometimes visits are restricted on the
 grounds that they would prejudice ongoing investigations.
 In February 1982, Amnesty International stated that it was
 working for 90 Yugoslav *prisoners of conscience' either
 as adoption or investigation cases, four more than in
 1978. Amnesties, while not routine, have been granted
 from time to time, usually on the occasion of the Yugoslav
 National Day, November 29, and a number uf prisoners were
 amnestied on this occasion in 1982.
 The Yugoslav Government continues to arrest and imprison
 persons for political offenses committed abroad, even if
 the acts in question are not crimes in the country in
 which they took place. This practice has occurred with
 less frequency in the last year, however.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are generally open to the public, except in cases
 involving military or 'national security" questions, when
 the judge has the authority to hold proceedings 'in
 camera'. The accused has the right to independent counsel
 from the time he or she is brought before a judge.
 However, until an indictment is handed down, consultations
 between the accused and his attorney must take place in
 the presence of a court official. Indictment must be
 brought within three months, except that the investigating
 judge can request from the presiding judge an extension of
 three months or even longer if justification is presented.
 In cases of crimes relating to national defense and
 security and to matters concerning service in the Yugoslav
 military, civilians may be tried in military courts. The
 court may also, in cases involving classified materials,
 appoint a military officer as counsel for the defense
 rather than civilian counsel. The trial record does not
 necessarily provide a full transcript and all testimony is
 recorded in the words of the presiding judge. Government
 controls on the media also affect the degree and nature of
 publicity accorded the proceedings.
 The accused has the right to counsel, and Yugoslav lawyers
 have often vigorously defended their clients. The
 Government, however, has not always remained impartial in
 judicial proceedings, particularly in cases of political
 interest. Human Rights organizations believe that the
 outcome in political cases is predetermined before the
 
 
 1065
 accused goes to trial. Amnesty International has reported
 the reluctance of some lawyers to take political cases for
 fear of reprisal. In ordinary criminal and civil
 proceedings, however, the courts act according to the law
 and Constitution, and the defendants' civil rights are
 generally respected. In June 1982 there was a discussion
 in the press about the need for judicial autonomy in cases
 involving artistic freedom where political pressure was
 allegedly put on the courts. The press and intellectuals
 strongly criticized the Government on this point, winning
 the release of a poet charged with slandering former
 President Tito.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The Yugoslav code of criminal procedure contains elaborate
 provisions for conducting searches, including the
 requirement for a court order, except under certain
 limited circumstances. However, the Yugoslav Constitution
 provides that entry may be made without warrant if this is
 indispensable for the immediate arrest of the perpetrator
 of a criminal offense, to protect the safety of life or
 property, or if it appears obvious that the evidence in
 criminal proceedings could not be obtained otherwise.
 There are no indications of widespread violations of these
 provisions. Many dissidents, however, believe that the
 authorities eavesdrop on their conversations and read
 their mail. Others, however, are less certain and believe
 such practices are being gradually eliminated.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Public expression of political dissent is frequently
 suppressed and freedom of speech and press are subject to
 some limitations. In particular, criticism of the League
 of Communists of Yugoslavia and its leadership, of basic
 domestic and foreign policies, of the theory of the
 self-management system, and of the unity of the country's
 diverse ethnic groups is in theory prohibited.
 Nevertheless, 1982 saw some instances of public criticism
 of individual government and party leaders, and of
 specific government policies, and even a few instances of
 public criticism of the late President Tito. For example,
 a highly critical biography of Tito which appeared late in
 1981 provoked a storm of protest from politicians and
 veterans throughout the country but nevertheless remained
 in the bookshops. Furthermore, the'next volume of the
 biography, by the same author, is to be published by a
 Belgrade printing house in 1983. Restraints on
 publications normally are exercised by the publishing
 house editorial boards, which tend to act fairly
 independently of the party or Government. A major
 political figure was the subject of press criticism midway
 through 1982 for his personal attacks on one of
 Yugoslavia's major religious faiths.
 When the Government does take action against the media, it
 resorts to warnings, fines, arrest, trial, imprisonment,
 
 
 1066
 or a mix of these. The Government uses selective
 repression of political dissidence in order to discourage
 it. In its issue of June 19, 1980, the Belgrade
 newsmagazine "Nin" quoted a Yugoslav official to the
 effect that nine-tenths of *political crimes' in
 Yugoslavia were verbal, reflecting the Yugoslav practice
 of regarding even the verbal expression of ethnic enmity
 as potentially incendiary.
 Yugoslav media are subject to party direction, although
 the scope of this direction varies from republic to
 republic. Well-informed Yugoslavs consider the press
 thorough and reliable in its treatment of external
 affairs--the only commonly agreed-upon weakness being a
 distinct pro-Palestinian bias. The press can often be
 outspokenly critical in its treatment of the authorities.
 The Belgrade press has, on occasion, ignored 'suggestions'
 to desist in criticizing aspects of policy on the Kosovo,
 and in criticizing the harsh treatment by the police of a
 pro-Solidarity demonstration in Belgrade.
 Publication and circulation of written materials are
 subject to regulations involving registration and
 post-publication censorship. Nonetheless, two books
 describing the treatment of pro-Soviet Yugoslavs on Goli
 Otok, a desolate Adriatic Island, from 1949 to 1958 were
 recently published and provoked open discussion in the
 press and party. There has also been a frank discussion
 in the local press of Amnesty International's February
 1982 report and its claim of an increase in political
 prisoners in Yugoslavia.
 Published material, films, and recorded material from
 other countries, including Western European countries and
 the United States, are readily available. There is
 censorship of individual items, for example of specific
 issues of magazines or newspapers which contain articles
 the Government considers offensive. Although the last
 recorded instance of such censorship occurred in November
 1981, it has been alleged that the Government has
 continued to stop distribution of Western news
 publications containing articles critical of Yugoslavia.
 Recently, a group of Slovene intellectuals, who petitioned
 to publish a new journal of literary and cultural
 criticism, came under attack, but permission to publish
 the journal was granted and several issues have appeared.
 Amnesty International reported several instances where
 Yugoslavs have been imprisoned for possessing or
 circulating certain 'emigre" journals critical of the
 Government.
 With respect to academic freedom, several professors at
 the University of Kosovo, accused of propagating
 anti-Yugoslav, Albanian nationalism, have been ousted from
 the party and are not premitted to teach. To date,
 however, they remain on full pay at the university with
 research responsibilities.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 
 
 1067
 Public political gatherings are permitted only on the
 authority of official bodies and organizations. In
 practice, the right to political assembly is exercised
 almost exclusively by groups supporting government policy,
 and others are usually suppressed. On July 9, 1982, eight
 Belgrade university students who raised placards with the
 name 'Solidarnosc' in Polish were arrested by the police
 at a pro-Palestinian demonstration organized by city
 authorities. On the next day the eight were charged with
 a misdemeanor and received sentences of 25 to 50 days for
 disturbing the peace and insulting the *socialist,
 patriotic, and national feelings of citizens and the
 social-political order of Yugoslavia* (maximum sentence:
 60 days). Police reportedly beat the students and this
 and the subsequent sentences evoked considerable
 indignation and protest in the press, and brought
 criticism as well as by some party and government
 officials.
 A protest in support of the students was permitted on July
 16, but a second group of eight pro-solidarity protesters
 was arrested on July 30 and sentenced to between 18 and 30
 days' imprisonment. A similar protest of 40 to 50 people
 was permitted on August 31. Republican authorities in
 Slovenia permitted a much larger youth rally in February
 in support of Solidarity, and an open symposium sponsored
 by the 'Praxism group which critically examined the
 political development of Yugoslavia under Tito was held
 freely and without interference in Belgrade in October
 1982.
 Trade Unions are organized not by industry but by province
 and, though state-sponsored, are playing a larger role in
 representing Workers' interests, particularly on wage
 issues, in the Federal Assembly. Strikes, called 'work
 stoppages', are not prohibited by law. According to
 available information, about 200 work stoppages, almost
 always of short duration and caused by local grievances,
 occur each year. Unless the perpetrators of the strike
 commit acts of violence against persons or property, they
 are not punished, although their political reputation with
 the local party organization may suffer.
 Yugoslavia is a member of the ILO. Professional groups,
 i.e., scientific bodies and lawyers' associations,
 maintain regular ties with their counterparts in
 recognized international bodies in their fields. The
 degree of application of political criteria for employment
 purposes, which was virtually absolute for many years
 after the war, has now diminished. Nevertheless, a 'moral
 and social fitness' criterion--measuring loyalty to the
 state and party--is still applied to those seeking
 white-collar employment, particularly with the
 Government. For such jobs, membership in the party
 remains practically a prerequisite.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Most Yugoslav believers belong to the Catholic and
 Orthodox Churches, and to the Islamic faith. Since the
 
 
 1068
 Second World War, the Jewish community has numbered only
 several thousand persons. Although the Government and
 party actively encourage atheism, freedom of religion is
 generally honored so long as religous organizations do not
 engage in activities that the authorities consider
 political. Persons who actively practice religion do not
 gain access to top party and government jobs. Constraints
 are imposed on proselytizing activities and religious
 education for children. Seminaries exist for training
 adults as clergymen, but they are taxed and seminary
 students do not get military deferments. There are no
 rabbinical seminaries. The number of religious
 publications Vastly outnumbers publications on Marxism and
 Leninism. Religious newspapers are now being printed and
 sold in churches and by subscription, but the Government
 does not allow them to be sold in street kiosks.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation.
 Freedom of movement within the country is guaranteed in
 the Constitution. Almost all Yugoslavs are able to travel
 abroad at will. Half of the country's population
 possesses valid passports, and in 1981 there were almost
 50 million border crossings by Yugoslavs. In 1979 the law
 on travel documents extended the validity of passports and
 exit visas from two to five years. In November 1979, the
 Federal Executive Council ruled that Yugoslavs would no
 longer need exit permits to travel to those countries with
 which Yugoslavia had diplomatic or consular relations. In
 September 1980, the Yugoslav constitutional court ruled
 that the authorities must inform citizens, except in what
 the Government terms *national security' cases, of the
 reasons for denial of a passport. A small number of
 dissidents has been denied passports on national security
 grounds. (The weekly Magazine *NINO in July 1982 said
 that 26,000 passports have been denied to date, mainly to
 people with a criminal record, representing about one
 tenth of one percent of passport applications.) In May
 1982 a new border zone agreement was signed with Italy
 granting 700,000 Italian and 300,000 Yugoslav local
 residents "special passage* status (i.e., they can cross
 without passports).
 The law on the entrance of foreigners to Yugoslavia notes
 the right of asylum and provides for government assistance
 to persons granted that right. In cooperation with the
 office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees, Yugoslavia has provided temporary assistance to
 political refugees, from Eastern Europe, who are seeking
 resettlement in a third country.
 Over 600,000 Yugoslav workers are currently employed in
 Western Europe. There are no restrictions on emigration.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Although the Constitution guarantees participation in the
 political process, and the "self-management' system
 encourages wide participation in the decision-making
 
 
 1069
 process on economic issues, the League of Communists has a
 monopoly on political power and participation in the
 political process is limited by the framework established
 and controlled by the party. Opposition parties are not
 allowed and opposition viewpoints cannot have significant
 effect outside the party framework. Within this
 framework, however, there is considerable involvement by a
 broad segment of the population in the political process,
 particularly at the local level, where multiple candidates
 are not uncommon.
 The 1974 Constitution guarantees the equality of citizens
 regardless of sex. The Government is committed to
 improving the status of women. The main problems of equal
 treatment of the sexes occur in those areas of the country
 where economic development has lagged or where traditional
 Balkan attitudes about female roles persist.
 Historic animosities and tensions continue to exert their
 influence, and relations among national groups remain one
 of the key problems facing Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav
 Government has made a concerted effort to insure the legal.
 and social rights of the many different nationalities and
 ethnic groups making up the Yugoslav state. The use of
 the major local language is required in official
 communication between Belgrade and the various republics,
 and local languages are also used in the schools, courts,
 and in the local media. Each citizen has the right to
 address the courts and government agencies in his own
 language. Some social discrimination continues,
 particularly against ethnic Albanians and gypsies, despite
 federal government policy .
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Yugoslav Government has shown a willingness to discuss
 and raise general questions of human rights in
 international fora, including meetings of the nonaligned
 countries and the Conference on Security and Cooperation
 in Europe review meetings. It remains sensitive, however,
 to charges of human rights violations within Yugoslavia.
 This sensitivity was reflected, for example, in an article
 in the Belgrade daily Politika in March, criticizing
 Amnesty International and its 1982 report on Yugoslavia.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 According to the 1981 census, the population of Yugoslavia
 in 1980 was 22,502,000, with an annual growth rate of 0.9
 percent. Personal income is fairly evenly distributed
 with 65 percent of the population falling into the middle
 income range. Per capita income, according to World Bank
 statistics for 1980, was $2,692.40. The significant
 variation in per capita income levels between the various
 republics stems from historic, regional and
 natural-resource differences. Life expectancy at birth in
 1980 was 70.5 years, and in 1981 the infant mortality rate
 was 32.8 per 1000. There is an extensive system of social
 
 
 1070
 security and other benefits for those who are old,
 disabled or without employment. The Government pays for
 children's allowances and provides a system of day-care
 nurseries for working mothers. The primary constraint in
 these programs is the limited amount of national income
 which Yugoslavia, as a developing country, can devote to
 them.
 In 1982 the Yugoslav economy was characterized by
 stagnation and a foreign liquidity crisis as the
 Government attempted to deal with the consequences of
 excessive foreign borrowing in previous years and with
 serious balance of payments and inflation problems carried
 over from 1981. A stabilization program which has been in
 effect since 1980 has gradually produced some improvement
 in the balance of payments. Inflation, due in part to
 costly energy imports as well as to widespread wage and
 salary hikes in excess of productivity increases, has not
 been brought under control. The average Yugoslav has
 experienced some decline in his living standard,
 particularly over the last year.
 The Yugoslav economy is decentralized with a high degree
 of autonomy at the republic and local level. Yugoslavia,
 as a socalist state, limits the individual's right to
 accumulate personal property for private use. Farmers may
 own up to ten hectares (approximately 25 acres) of
 tillable land plus ten hectares of mountainous terrain as
 pasturage.
 The 1974 Constitution spells out the complicated system of
 the organization of business enterprises. In theory the
 means of production are owned by the society as a whole
 and entrusted to the workers, organized in
 enterprise-level workers' councils. In practice, it
 appears that workers councils exert significant influence
 over the choice of management of enterprises, their broad
 policies, and distribution of enterprise income. There
 are no business enterprises owned and operated directly by
 the state, with the possible exception of some
 defense-related establishments and agricultural research
 stations.
 The right to education is guaranteed to all Yugoslav
 citizens, as is schooling in the languages of the various
 Yugoslav peoples. The adult literacy rate in 1976,
 according to World Bank/AID statistics, was 85 percent
 and the 1979 primary school enrollment ratio was 99
 percent. Educational reform is currently under way which
 is designed to adjust the traditional secondary
 education/university system to the needs of a modern
 technocratic society. There is little discrimination in
 the Yugoslav educational system based on family or
 political background.
 Women are represented in most walks of life, including
 government positions, and receive equal pay for equal
 work. Women are, however, underrepresented in high-level
 government and management positions. Yugoslavia generally
 remains a male-dominated and male-oriented country with
 women having limited access to top  positions'in party,
 government, or business. The present Prime Minister,
 Milka Planinc, a woman, is an important exception to this
 general rule.
