 MAURITIUS
 Mauritius, a parliamentary democracy and a member of the
 Commonwealth of Nations, is governed by an elected prime
 minister, a council of ministers, and a legislative assembly.
 In December the Legislative Assembly voted to change Mauritius'
 status within the Commonwealth, effective March 12, 1992.
 Under the amended Constitution, a Mauritian-born president
 nominated by the Prime Minister and confirmed by the Assembly
 will replace the British Monarch as Head of State. Like the
 Governor General under the previous system, the President's
 powers will be largely ceremonial. Fair and orderly elections,
 supervised by an independent commission, at national and local
 levels take place at regular intervals. There are four major
 political parties, which reflect a range of ideological views,
 and several smaller parties. Prime Minister Anerood Jugnauth's
 current coalition received a broad mandate in general elections
 in September.
 A paramilitary Special Mobile Force of some 1,200 men and a
 240-man Special Support Unit are responsible for internal
 security. These forces, under the command of the Commissioner
 of Police, are largely apolitical, well trained, and backed by
 a general duty police force of approximately 4,000 men.
 The economy is based on export-oriented manufacturing (mainly
 textiles), sugar, and tourism. The rapid economic growth of
 the mid-1980's has slowed as a result of labor shortages. The
 Government, with the help of international donors, is
 attempting to diversify the industrial base to favor high
 technology, capital-intensive production.
 The Government generally continued to demonstrate respect for
 basic human rights. Political and civil rights, including the
 freedoms of speech and press, are protected under the
 Constitution and respected in practice. The Prime Minister
 established the Garrioch Committee in 1990 to conduct an
 independent review of several controversial laws generally
 considered to be repressive, specifically the Public Order Act
 (POA), which permits detention without charge or trial, the
 Industrial Relations Act (IRA), which limits the right to
 strike, and the Newspapers and Periodicals Act, which makes it
 illegal to publish false news. By the end of 1991, the
 Committee had completed its report to the Government on all
 legislation but the IRA.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of government-inspired political or
 extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of the disappearance of persons for
 political causes.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture and inhuman punishment are prohibited by law, and there
 were no reports of degrading treatment or punishment. There
 
 
 MAURITIUS
 have been several allegations in the media of police
 mistreatment of suspects, but follow-up investigations failed
 to confirm any abuses.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under the Constitution, detained persons have the right to a
 judicial determination of the legality of-their detention.
 Although the time limit for making this determination is not
 specified in-law, in practice it is usually made within 24
 hours. .-Bail is commonly granted. The Public Gathering Act
 (PGA), which replaced the Public Order Act based on
 recommendations from the Garrioch Committee, no longer allows
 for indefinite detention without charge or trial.
 Exile is legally prohibited and not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Mauritius' judicial system, modeled on that of Great Britain,
 consists of the Supreme Court, which has appellate powers, and
 a series of lower courts. Final appeal may be made to the
 Queen's Privy Council in the United Kingdom and is routinely
 made in the cases of death sentences. About 50 percent of
 Supreme Court rulings referred to the Privy Council are
 reversed. There are no political or military courts.
 The Governor General (as of 1992 the President), in
 consultation with the Prime Minister, nominates the Chief
 Justice and, in consultation with the Chief Justice, nominates
 the senior puisne (associate) judges. The Governor General
 nominates other judges on the advice of the Judicial and Legal
 Service Commissions. The legal system has consistently
 provided fair, public trials for those charged with crimes.
 Defendants have the right to private or court-appointed
 counsel. 'The judiciary is also charged under the Constitution
 with ensuring that new laws are consistent with democratic-
 practice.
 Recently several prominent legal specialists have been critical
 of government interference in the judicial process and-have
 warned against undermining the independence of the judiciary.
 In particular, this criticism coincided.with the Government's
 handling of the Boodhoo and Ballah cases. (In the 1989 arrests
 of Harish Boodhoo, the well-known leader of the Mauritian
 Socialist Party (PSM), and Vedi Ballab, the editor of the PSM
 newspaper, The Socialist, the authorities held them for 3 weeks
 and 1 week respectively before bail was granted. They were
 charged under the now defunct Public Order Act with giving out
 false information that could cause a public disturbance.)
 There were no political prisoners in Mauritius at year's end.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 -Correspondence
 The sanctity of the home is guaranteed by law and generally
 respected in practice. The search of personal property or
 premises is allowed only under blearly specified conditions by
 court order or by police decision if an illegal act has been
 committed. There have been credible reports that the
 Goverment's intelligence apparatus occasionally opens mail and
 carries out surveillance of local opposition leaders and other
 major figures.

 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is protected by the Constitution
 and local tradition and is generally respected in practice.
 Debate in the Legislative Assembly is lively and open. Sixteen
 privately owned daily, weekly, and monthly newspapers present
 varying political viewpoints and freely express partisan
 views. However, newspapers are subject to the legal
 constraints of libel laws, which, under the 1984 Newspaper and
 Periodicals (Amendment) Act, can be used by the Government to
 limit press criticism, as was done in the Boodhoo and Ballah
 cases.
 The Government owns the two television and three radio stations
 (one strictly educational), which broadcast in 12 languages and
 dialects. Television and radio tend to reflect government
 editorial and programming policies. Opposition politicians
 have accused the Broadcasting Corporation of political bias in
 its local news coverage. The political opposition successfully
 challenged the television stations to permit its candidates
 programming time on the eve of general elections in September.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Mauritians enjoy the right to form associations, including
 political parties, trade unions, and religious organizations,
 although in practice all such organizations need government
 approval in order to operate officially. Mauritius has a
 multitude of such private organizations. Political, cultural,
 and religious assemblies are commonplace.
 Although police permission is required for holding
 demonstrations and mass meetings, such permission is rarely
 refused. Registered political parties and alliances held
 numerous public rallies in the leadup to general and municipal
 elections in September and October. All rallies were peaceful.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion in Mauritius.  Hindus are a
 majority, but Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, and others openly
 practice, teach, and proselytize their religions without
 prejudice. All religious institutions receive state subsidies
 in proportion to their memberships. There is no
 state-sponsored discrimination against any ethnic or religious
 community. The Government facilitates the travel of Mauritians
 who make the hajj. Foreign missionaries are not allowed to
 enter the country without a prior request from a local
 religious organization.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on freedom of movement within the
 country. Foreign travel and emigration are also unrestricted.
 However, there is no blanket guarantee of repatriation, and
 there are no general criteria for processing repatriation
 applications. Applications from Mauritians abroad who lost
 their citizenship after acquiring a second nationality
 (estimated to be several thousand) are handled on a
 case-by-case and sometimes arbitrary basis. This remains an
 issue of political debate as more Mauritians abroad seek to
 reclaim their Mauritian citizenship.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 -to Change Their Goverment
 Citizens have the right and ability to change their government
 through democratic means. Mauritius is governed by a freely
 elected, unicameral Legislative Assembly, with executive
 direction coming from a Council of Ministers, currently headed
 by Prime Minister Sir Anerood Jugnauth, whose Alliance
 coalitions won elections in 1983, 1987, and 1991. The Governor
 General has the right to designate the person charged with
 forming a new government following parliamentary elections or
 in a parliamentary crisis. Parliamentary, municipal, and
 village council elections are held at regular intervals. All
 citizens 18 years of age and over have the right to vote and
 run for office.
 In the Legislative Assembly, up to 8 members are appointed
 through a complex "best loser",system designed in part to
 ensure that all ethnic groups are adequately represented. The
 governing (three-party) Alliance coalition now controls 59 of
 the 66 seats. The four major political parties and the smaller
 parties often match the ethnicity or religion of their
 candidates to the composition of particular electoral
 constituencies,.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Several local human rights groups monitor developments without
 governmental restriction. There have been no known requests by
 international organizations to investigate human rights
 violations in Mauritius.
 Section 5 iscrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Although Mauritius has a Hindu majorityj the country's active
 press and strongly egalitarian traditions mitigate against
 discrimination in all forms.- However, tensions based on
 ethnicity and caste do exist.
 Traditionally, women in Mauritius have occupied a subordinate
 role in society, but the Government has tried to promote
 equality by eliminating various legal restrictions, e.g., in
 laws dealing with emigration and inheritance and, in 1990,
 removing a legal bar to women serving on juries. Also, in 1989
 the Government appointed "equal employment opportunity
 officers" in the major ministries to oversee women's activities
 and to ensure the promotion Qf women's interests. Nonetheless,
 women still cannot transmit citizenship to their foreign-born
 children, and foreign husbands of Mauritian women cannot .
 automatically obtain-residency and work permits (as can foreign
 wives of.Mauritian men), Women'still face de facto
 discrimination,'including in education. For example, women are
 discouragbd from studying traditionally male-dominated fields
 such as engineering, medic-ine, and law.
 According to the Ministry of Women's Rights and Family Welfare,
 physicians, attorneys, and religious and charitable
 organizations, violence against women is prevalent, although no
 reliable statistics have been gathered. There are no special
 provisions in Mauritian law concerning family violence. Police
 
 
 254
 MAURITIUS
 authorities are generally reluctant to became involved in cases
 of wife beating. In June 1989, the Ministry of Women's Rights
 and Family Welfare established a family counseling service,
 managed by the National Council of Women, one of whose
 principal tasks is to provide counseling and legal advice in
 cases of spousal abuse. Also, a Mauritian nongovernmental
 organization, S.O.S. Women, has recently been launched. (See
 Section 6.e. concerning wage inequalities.)
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Mauritius has an active trade union movement. Almost 300
 unions represent about 110,000 workers, more than one-fourth of
 the work force. Of the 300 unions, 110 have less than 50
 members. Unions are free to organize workers in all sectors,
 including the export processing zone (EPZ) which employs about
 90,000 workers, but in practice there are a variety of
 constraints under the 1973 Industrial Relations Act (IRA), such
 as the need to get government approval to register new unions.
 Unions have also been deregistered in the EPZ in recent years.
 Less than 10 percent of EPZ workers are believed to be
 unionized. Unions can press wage demands, establish ties to
 domestic political parties and international organizations, and
 address political issues. Three of the five trade union
 activists who ran in the August 30, 1987, general elections
 were elected to the Legislative Assembly on the government
 slate.
 In theory, unions have the right to strike. However, in labor
 disputes, the IRA requires a prestrike 21-day cooling-off
 period followed by binding arbitration, which has the effect of
 making most strikes illegal. Participation in a strike not
 approved by a court is sufficient grounds for dismissal.
 Refusal to follow IRA procedures during a mid-1988 textile
 plant strike led to the imprisonment of three union leaders for
 several days and in 1990 to the firing of 14 strike leaders of
 the Central Electricity Board Staff Association and the calling
 in of the Special Mobile Force to operate the power stations.
 There were no significant strikes in 1991.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 While the right of association is guaranteed by law, the
 collective bargaining process has been distorted in Mauritius.
 The IRA addresses collective bargaining and allows it in
 theory, but in practice its provisions for establishing wages
 bear little resemblance to the traditional collective
 bargaining process, and the Government's restraints on that
 process render it ineffective.
 The Government has established a National Remuneration Board
 (NRB) whose chairman is appointed by the Minister of Labor.
 The NRB establishes minimum wages for 26 categories of private
 sector workers (sugar, tea, transport, etc.) which apply
 equally to workers in the EPZ. Although originally established
 to set minimum wages for nonunion workers, the NRB has
 broadened its powers and now issues remuneration orders that
 establish minimum wages, bonuses, housing and transportation
 allowances-, and other benefits for almost all private sector
 workers. About 85 percent of all private sector workers
 (including unionized workers) are covered by NRB orders.
 Employers and unions are free to negotiate wages and benefits
 above the minimums established by the NRB, but this is rare.
 
 
 MAURITIUS
 NRB remuneration orders set minimum wages by sector but also
 establish a wage structure based on length of service and job
 classification. NRB orders thus set wages for skilled and
 *experienced workers whose earnings are well above the minimum
 wage. Wages and benefits for civil servants are established by
 the Pay Research Bureaf (PRB) which Prepares a wage scale for
 the civil service each year on the basis of the annual
 Chesworth Report recommendations.
 The Government has also established a tripartite committee,
 including employer and trade union representatives, which meets
 once a year and is chaired by the Minister of Finance. It can
 recommend only wage increases based on inflation. Its
 recommendations are not always unanimous, however, and the
 Government makes the final decision based on all the
 information it receives.
 The International Labor Organization (ILO) Committee of Experts
 (COE) noted again in 1991 that the IRA does not give workers'
 organizations sufficient protection against acts of
 interference as provided for by ILO Convention 98 on the right
 to organize and collective bargaining. The Garrioch Committee
 continued to review throughout 1991 the IRA, but it had not
 reported its recommendations by the end of 1991.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law and not
 practiced. However, under the IRA, the Minister of Labor can
 refer industrial disputes to compulsory arbitration,
 enforceable by penalties involving compulsory labor
 provisions. The COE has criticized this as being in conflict
 with ILO Convention 105 on forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age-for Employment of Children
 The minimum work age for employment of children is 15. The
 Ministry of Labor is responsible for enforcing child labor
 laws. In practice, there is minimal enforcement of these
 laws. While there are cases of children below 15 working
 illegally in the EPZ, the large, established EPZ factories do
 not hire children under 15. In fact, it is unusual to see
 employees much younger than 18. Education is compulsory and
 strictly enforced through age 12.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum wages are legislated, differing along employment sector
 and gender lines. Women are paid less in the agricultural
 sector on the assumption that their productivity is lower in
 this physical, labor-intensive work. In the EPZ, the minimum
 wage is equal for men and women. Conditions of employment,
 including wage and leave conditions, are generally sufficient
 to afford an acceptable standard of living for workers in the
 agricultural, service, and manufacturing sectors. However, the
 current statutory rate paid for unskilled labor is barely
 sufficient to provide a worker with a minimum standard of
 living, and much depends on the additional benefits offered.
 The Government mandates minimum wage increases each year based
 on inflation.
 A maximum workweek of 45 hours is allowed, but excessive
 overtime continues to be a problem in the EPZ. Following
 complaints that EPZ employers imposed long hours of overtime on
 
 
 256
 MAURITIUS
 employees-about 10 to 20 hours per week, making for a 55- to
 65-hour workweek--the Government established a committee to
 address these issues, but by the end of 1991 it still had
 issued no report. In addition, some EPZ employers still
 require women to work at night.
 The Government sets health and safety standards, and conditions
 are inspected by Ministry of Labor officials. Enforcement is
 minimal and ineffective due to the small number of inspectors.
