 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 The United Kingdom plays a leading role in the development
 of democratic institutions and human rights practices. Its
 legal tradition and respect for individual rights are
 widely and justifiably admired. Both the British people
 and their government continually seek to maintain and
 improve the high quality of human rights practices
 domestically and to promote higher levels internationally.
 These long established traditions are daily put to the test
 in Northern Ireland where the British government strives to
 combat terrorist violence and maintain public safety
 against the background of a sharply'divided society.
 The United Kingdom provides a large and comprehensive
 social welfare program for the population. Public policy,
 supported by legislation, opposes discrimination on the
 basis of religion, race or sex.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 It is forbidden by law (Article 3 of the European
 Convention on Human Rights, to which the United Kingdom is
 a signatory) that any prisoner should be subject to any use
 or threat of violence whatsoever as a means of eliciting
 information. The normal criminal law applies to any proven
 breach.
 In 1971, Ireland brought a case against the United Kingdom
 of Great Britain and Northern Ireland before the European
 Commission on Human Rights, alleging that British security
 forces in Northern Ireland were responsible for ill
 treatment of persons held in cases of suspected terrorism,
 especially through use of five sensory deprivation
 interrogation techniques. In this case, Ireland cited
 Article 3 of the European Convention for the Protection of
 Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms which prohibits
 torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
 After four years of investigation, the European Commission
 on Human Rights concluded that some of the allegations set
 forth in the Irish suit concerning torture and inhuman or
 degrading treatment had merit. The Irish government,
 because it believed it had not received full satisfaction
 on all points of its case, then referred the case to the
 European Court of Human Rights which, in a January 1978
 decision, rejected the specific charges of torture.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 During the deliberations of the European Court of Human
 Rights, the British Attorney General announced that the
 United Kingdom would not contest the Commission's adverse
 findings, but said that the interrogation techniques under
 contention had been voluntarily and publicly abandoned in
 March, 1972, with substantial compensation awarded to those
 involved. He stated that these techniques would no longer
 be used by the British government. The Attorney General
 also pointed out that the British government was
 strengthening military and civilian directives against the
 use of police measures which might be considered
 maltreatment or torture.
 
 
 910
 Ireland did not accept a British request that the suit be
 dropped before final judgment. The court rejected charges
 of torture, but found that the sensory deprivation
 interrogation techniques had constituted a breach of
 Article 3 of the Convention in that they amounted to
 inhuman and degrading treatment.
 In June 1978, Amnesty International issued a report of its
 mission which visited Northern Ireland from November 28 to
 December 6, 1977. The mission was primarily concerned with
 allegations of mental and physical maltreatment by the
 Royal Ulster Constabulary of persons under interrogation as
 suspected terrorists. On the basis of surveying 78 cases
 out of 3,444 involving suspected terrorists processed by
 the police in 1977, Amnesty International concluded that
 maltreatment had taken place "with sufficient frequency to
 warrant the establishment of a public inquiry to
 investigate it." Amnesty International recommended that,
 "for reasons relating to protection of suspects and police
 officers alike, a public and impartial inquiry be
 established to investigate the allegations of
 maltreatment," including consideration of "the rules
 relating to interrogation and detention, admissibility of
 statements, and the effectiveness of machinery for
 investigating complaints against the police of assault
 during interview."
 After publication of the Amnesty International report, the
 Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Roy Mason,
 stated that the British government did not authorize and
 would not condone the ill treatment of persons held in
 custody. He noted that the Chief Constable of Northern
 Ireland had pledged that such ill treatment would be dealt
 with the Director of Public Prosecutions to determine
 whether criminal prosecution was warranted. Amnesty
 International subsequently declined to submit its evidence
 on the ground that it had pledged confidentiality to its
 sources.
 On June 16, 1978, the British government established an
 independent committee of inquiry to consider police
 practice and procedures in Northern Ireland relating to
 interrogation. The committee, chaired by Judge H.G.
 Bennett, reviewed extensive evidence, including the records
 of civil complaints against police practices, the record of
 court cases (convictions and dismissals) considered on the
 basis of confessions obtained from prisoners, and reports
 of medical experts. Its report, issued on March 16, 1979,
 noted, as did Amnesty International, that complaints have
 not been made against the Royal Ulster Constabulary's
 uniformed officers and that less than 500 of the
 Constabulary's total force of more than 6,000 actually
 engage in interrogation.
 The committee examined extensive medical evidence from both
 official and independent sources. In July 1979, it
 concluded that there were fifteen cases where evidence
 indicated "injuries sustained during the period of
 detention in the police office" and "inflicted by someone
 other than the prisoner himself." The Director of Public
 Prosecutions confirmed an earlier decision not to proceed
 in thirteen of these cases, since there was not enough
 evidence to warrant a prosecution of any member of the
 Royal Ulster Constabulary (IJC). Tocases axe still under
 consideration.
 
 
 911
 The Bennett committee report listed 66 separate "major
 conclusions and recbmmendations'odesigned to improve the
 police interrogation system and protect prisoners against
 ill-treatment and policemen against false allegations. The
 British government has accepted all of the committee's
 recommendations on police practices and procedures, and
 these have been implemented in virtually every aspect.
 These included closed-circuit TV in interviewing rooms,
 greater access to counsel, and closer supervision of
 interrogators by their superiors. However, public
 controversy was stirred over the RUC's insistence that a
 constable may be authorized, by a senior officer, to be
 present when counsel/client consultations are taking place
 to ensure that no information useful to terrorists may'be
 transmitted either deliberately or inadvertently by
 counsel. It is understood that this is the subject of
 negotiations between the Law Society and the RUC.
 On March 10, 1979, Dr. Robert Irwin, an official of the
 Association of Police Surgeons of Great Britain, alleged
 that 150 to 160 suspected terrorists he had examined in
 police custody during the past three years had sustained
 ill-treatment during interrogation by the Royal Ulster
 Constabulary. Speaking in Parliament on March 12, the then
 Minister of State for Northern Ireland acknowledged that
 Dr. Irwin had reported through established channels on some
 cases of suspected ill-treatment, and stated that all these
 cases had been investigated. On March 13, the Chief
 Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary announced that
 an exhaustive analysis of the records kept by the
 Constabulary's complaints and discipline branch showed
 that, during the past three years, Dr. Irwin had examined
 65 persons who had made complaints about their treatment
 during police custody. The Chief Constable stated that in
 only 10 cases did Dr. Irwin either agree with the complaint
 or find injuries which he believed were consistent with the
 allegations. The Chief Constable noted that, in three of
 these cases, the Director of Public Prosecutions had
 directed no prosecution against the accused police officers
 and that, in the remaining seven cases, a decision on
 prosecution was awaiting the trial of the complainants.
 Official statistics reveal a general downward trend in
 complaints of mistreatment in recent years. The figures in
 the first row below refer to persons held for questioning
 under either the Emergency Provisions Act (Northern
 Ireland), the Prevention of Tergorism Act, or Section 2 of
 the Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967:
 1976      1977   1978    1979
 Number held for questioning  3,576    3,7   3,056  2,191
 Complaints of mistreatment      384     671     327     159
 Percent who complain           10.7    18.8    10.7     7.2
 The drop both in numbers and in percentage of complainants
 from 1977 to 1979 (the most recent year for which
 statistics are available) reflects several factors: The
 reforms implemented as a result of the European
 proceedings, and Bennett committee findings, the cessation
 of exploratory mass arrests, and the generally lower level
 of violence.
 The problem of confinement conditions in Northern Ireland,
 particularly at the Maze prison, continued to receive
 public attention during 1980. The basic issue is whether
 prisoners convicted of terrorist offenses should be
 
 
 912
 entitled to special category status within the prison.
 Beginning in 1972, the British government granted special
 category status to those serving sentences for terrorist
 offenses. Immediately prior to this decision, prisoners
 who were members of the Irish Republican Army had engaged
 in a hunger strike for such status. All prisoners
 convicted of terrorist crimes--Republican and
 Loyalist--were thereafter put into segregated compounds
 where they wore their own clothes, did no prison work, and
 were responsible for their own internal discipline. In
 March 1976, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland
 announced that persons convicted of terrorist crimes
 committed thereafter would be treated as common criminals
 but that those who already had "special category status"
 would be allowed to serve out their sentences accordingly.
 Loyalist and Official Irish Republican Army prisoners
 convicted after the cutoff date at first would not
 acknowledge the new rule, but then dropped their
 opposition. However, the majority of prisoners who were
 members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army or of the
 Irish Republican Socialist Party refused to acknowledge
 their criminal status or to abide by prison regulations
 regarding such matters as clothing, work routines, and
 personal hygiene. Prison authorities responded by
 restricting routine privileges, e.g., mixing with other
 prisoners, additional family visits and mail beyond the
 statutory one visit and one letter per month. Food
 parcels, and allocation of tobacco and reading materials
 also were restricted. Striking prisoners were denied any
 .remission" of sentences, normally one day off for each day
 of good behavior. Prison regulation specify that exercise
 is not forfeited as punishment and can be taken without
 clothes (or in underclothes) if the weather permits, but
 cannot be taken wearing only the prison issue blanket. In
 practice, protesting prisoners have refused to take
 exercise unless clothed with the blanket. Some Loyalist
 prisoners have joined this "dirty protest".
 Despite the protests and the publicity generated by the
 protesting prisoners, the British government has declined
 to reinstitute "special category status". This position is
 supported by Parliament and the Conservative and Labor
 parties. Prison authorities routinely rotate prisoners to
 clean cells to reduce the risks from unhygienic conditions,
 which, as they point out, are created solely by the actions
 of the prisoners themselves.
 In early February 1980, the protest movement of male
 prisoners at Maze Prison spread to a number of women
 Republican prisoners at Armagh Prison. The women prisoners
 there had in general reacted much less severely during past
 years than their male counterparts. Until early 1980, the
 only permanent infraction of prison rules had been a
 refusal to work. The prison authorities had responded by
 allowing normal exercise and association with fellow
 prioners but cancelled some minor privileges and remission
 for good behavior. Their prison life, however, was close
 to normal. A protest in early February led to a surprise
 search for smuggled illegal articles during which some of
 the protesting women were bruised resisting authorities.
 About 30 of the women have since escalated their protest to
 emulate actions of the male prisoners at Maze Prison in
 their refusal of some hygienic measures and other
 privileges still allowed them.
 On March 26, 1980, the Secretary of State for Northern
 Ireland announced new measures relating to the protest by
 Republican prisoners at Maze Prison. Noting that from
 
 
 913
 March 1976 to March 1980, the number of special category
 prisoners had decreased from 1,500 to 443, including 4
 women, he went on to state that as of 1 April 1980, no
 person charged with terrorist related crimes would be
 granted special category status, regardless of the date of
 the offense. At the same time, the government made
 concessions on a number of points. The protesting
 prisoners are now allowed one privilege visit a month in
 addition to the one statutory visit and are allowed a
 weekly exchange of letters rather than once a month. The
 protesting prisoners had refused to take exercise in prison
 uniforms; they are now allowed to exercise in gym clothes.
 Initially, the prisoners rejected the concessions and
 repeated their demands for special category status, a point
 the authorities refuse to consider further.
 In August 1978, four Republican prisoners in Maze Prison
 made application to the European Commission of Human
 Rights, alleging that as a result of their participation
 in the prison protests, they were subjected to treatment
 and prison conditions which violated their human rights.
 The applicants submitted their claims under eight separate
 articles of the Convention for the Protection of Human
 Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. In June 1980, the
 commission declared most of the complaints inadmissible,
 finding that the conditions in the H-blocks were
 self-inflicted, that the complaints lodged did not disclose
 the appearance of inhuman or degrading treatment, and that
 the government is not in breach of Article 3 of the
 European Convention. The commission adjourned for further
 deliberation on complaints under Article 8, relating to
 alleged restrictions on the right to respect for
 correspondence, and complaint under Article 13, relating to
 the claim that there is no effective remedy under Northern
 Ireland law for consideration of complaints on prison
 treatment. The commission ruled that: "the applicants are
 seeking to achieve a status of political prisoner which
 they are not entitled to under national law or under the
 convention. Furthermore, although this point has not been
 argued by the parties in their observations, the commission
 does not consider that such an entitlement in the present
 context can be derived from the existing norms of
 international law*. The commission continued, however,
 that: "in such a situation the State is not absolved from
 its obligation under the convention, because prisoners are
 engaged in what is regarded as an unlawful challenge to the
 authority of the prison administration. Such a requirement
 makes it necessary for the prison authorities to keep under
 constant review their reaction to recalcitrant prisoners
 engaged in a developing and protracted protest." Since
 release of the commission's findings, the prison
 authorities offered additional privileges to protesting
 prisoners, to include compassionate leave in cases of death
 or serious illness in the family and changes in visiting
 arrangements which eliminates searches of prisoners after
 visits.
 In October 1980, seven protesting prisoners began a hunger
 strike to achieve political status. They were eventually
 joined by 23 other Maze inmates, three women at the Armagh
 jail and by a few loyalist prisoners. This hunger strike
 was opposed by all of Northern Ireland's political parties
 and was condemned by the Catholic and Protestant churches.
 Political parties in the Irish Republic also opposed it.
 There were however, large public demonstrations in support
 of the hunger strikers in Belfast and Dublin, and sectarian
 
 
 914
 
 tension increased throughout the province. The British
 government refused to negotiate political status while
 publicly emphasizing that the prisoners could expect
 restoration of their privileges already liberalized
 throughout the Northern Ireland prison system if they
 abandoned both the hunger strike and the dirty protest.
 In mid-December the hunger strikers abandoned their action
 without loss of life.
 c. Disappearances
 The British authorities do not abduct, secretly arrest or
 hold persons in clandestine confinement.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The Criminal Law Act 1967 (and the Criminal Justice Act
 Northern Ireland 1977 which applies similar provisions to
 Northern Ireland) empowers a constable to arrest any person
 who he, with reasonable cause suspects has committed, is
 committing or is about to commit what is, or what he
 reasonably suspects to be, an arrestable offense. Broadly
 speaking, an arrestable offense is one where on first
 conviction a sentence of five or more years imprisonment
 may be imposed. Procedures for bail, habeas corpus and
 suits for false imprisonment are routinely available in the
 United Kingdom.
 British common law allows for the abrogation of individual
 liberties by the executive in an emergency situation,
 subject to review by Parliament. Continuing violence in
 Northern Ireland presented the government with a serious
 problem of protecting the rights and safety of the
 province's population as a whole. Acting on the premise
 that the fundamental "right to life" was in serious
 jeopardy in Northern Ireland, the British government
 adopted two Acts to deal with the threat: the Northern
 Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act of 1973, now amended and
 consolidated as the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions)
 Act 1978, which is applicable only to Northern Ireland, and
 the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act of
 1976, which is applicable to the entire United Kingdom.
 Although both these acts empower the restriction of
 personal liberties, they are subject to parliamentary
 review and to mandatory renewal at frequent intervals--in
 the case of the 1978 Act at six monthly intervals (most
 recently from 25 July 1980) and in the case of the 1976 act
 at annual intervals.
 The practice of detention without trial under the 1973 act
 known as internment was discontinued in December 1975,
 although that provision of the act remained in force until
 24 July 1980 when it was not renewed by the Secretary of
 State. In its September 1976 report, the European
 Commission on Human Rights found that such detention had
 been justified as "strictly required by the exigencies of
 the situation" under Article 15(i) of the European
 Convention on Human Rights. The European Court of Human
 Rights upheld this view in its January 1978 decision.
 The 1978 act permits other exceptions to normal British
 legal practice, including non-jury trials in cases of
 terrorist offenses, because of the likelihood of
 intimidation of jurors, and search without warrant in cases
 of suspected terrorism. The act also empowers police to
 arrest without warrant a person suspected of involvement in
 
 
 915
 terrorism and to detain him up to 72 hours on their own
 authority. The 1976 act allows such detention for 48 hours
 but also provides that suspected terrorists can be held for
 up to seven days on specific authorization by the Secretary
 of State for Northern Ireland. Under the 1978 act, members
 of the armed forces on duty may arrest suspected terrorists
 without warrant and hold them for up.to four hours, after
 which they must be transferred to police custody. The
 Department of State knows of no allegations that these
 limits have been exceeded by the police or the armed forces.
 The Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act of 1976 (enacted by both
 the Republic of Ireland and British Governments) was
 applied for the first time on July 7, 1980, when three men
 were charged in the Dublin Special Criminal Court with a
 murder committed in Northern Ireland. The law permits
 trial in any part of Ireland or Britain of those accused of
 terrorist offenses, regardless of where the alleged offense
 was committed.
 In February 1979, the Northern Ireland Standing Advisory
 Commission on Human Rights announced, in its fourth
 (1977-1978) annual report to the Secretary of State for
 Northern Ireland, that during the next two years it
 intended to examine as its first priority the content and
 operation of emergency anti-terrorist legislation. The
 commission, which was established under the Northern
 Ireland Constitution Act of 1973, noted that, although a
 principal objective of this emergency legislation is to
 protect the right to life in a context of continuing
 violence, it inevitably detracts from the free enjoyment of
 other rights. The commission set itself the task of
 considering the continuing need for each provision of this
 legislation, judging how the security forces exercise their
 emergency powers, and assessing the effectiveness of
 safeguards against abuse. Although the commission's
 recommendations are not binding on the British government,
 the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is required by
 law to lay the Commission's annual report before Parliament
 where he can be questioned about it. As recently as June
 this year, the commission recommended that the power to
 detain without trial be allowed to lapse--a demand to which
 the government acceded. Other recommendations were not
 accepted.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair trial is guaranteed by lawand observed in practice.
 All criminal proceedings are conducted in public, with the
 exception of cases involving public security (under the
 Official Secrets Acts), cases heard in the juvenile courts,
 from which the public, but not the press, is excluded
 (Children and Young Persons Act of 1933), and cases in
 which, on the ground of public decency, the judge has
 discretion to close the court while evidence of a
 particularly intimate character is being given by a child
 or young person. In the trial of charges under the
 Official Secrets Acts, the court is only closed (if at all)
 during the hearing of such parts of the trial as the judge,
 in his discretion, deems desirable; and the sentence must
 always be passed in public.
 As a result of recommendations made by the report of the
 commission to consider legal procedures to deal with
 terrorist activities in Northern Ireland (the Diplock
 Report) of December 1972, a modified form of trial was
 
 
 916
 introduced for cases involving terrorist suspects. The
 trial of a scheduled offense is conducted by a judge sitting
 alone. This absence of a jury has been the subject of
 criticism. The British government states it was introduced
 because of fear of intimidation of juries or acts of
 physical violence against jury members. The defendant
 convicted in such a court has a right of appeal to the
 Court of Criminal Appeal on any ground against conviction
 and/or sentence.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Searches and seizures are regulated by law, and judicial
 remedies are available for abuse of these regulations. In
 well-defined cases related to suspected terrorism, police
 officers or members of the armed forces on duty are
 permitted to enter homes without warrants, but only where
 there is strong suspicion of wrong-doing.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 The United Kingdom has been a pioneer in the development of
 the welfare state and the British national health scheme is
 very comprehensive. British governments have given high
 priority to education and housing, and to care for needy
 persons.
 The Northern Ireland economy in recent years has suffered
 from lack of growth because of its dependence on declining
 industries. There have been strong allegations over the
 years of substantial variances between the economic status
 and privileges of the Protestant and Catholic communities
 in Northern Ireland. Despite British government efforts in
 recent years to redress this imbalance, the Protestant part
 of the Northern Ireland community continues to be more
 prosperous, to be on the average more highly skilled, and
 to control most of the economy. In spite of British
 efforts to attract investment, the unemployment rate in
 Northern Ireland is about double that of the United Kingdom
 as a whole, and this burden falls disproportionately on the
 Catholic population. The British government has made
 special efforts to subsidize the Northern Ireland economy
 through public sector spending, though this has been
 affected by budget cuts. The government's expectation is
 that an improved economic situation would have a favorable
 impact on the political problem.
 British law bars discrimination on the basis of sex, race,
 religion, or ethnic origin. Equal status for women is
 provided in the Sex Discrimination Act of 1975 and the Sex
 Discrimination (Northern Ireland) Order of 1976. There is
 equal opportunity for women in the professional fields;
 and, under the Equal Pay Act of 1970 (and corresponding
 legislation for Northern Ireland), women are entitled to
 equal pay with men when doing work that is the same or
 broadly similar. The Equal Opportunities Commission
 assists in the enforcement of these acts. There is a
 separate commission for Northern Ireland.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Personal liberty and freedom of speech are accepted parts
 of the British way of life. In the absence of a formal
 bill of rights, these freedoms are well established by
 
 
 917
 history, custom and tradition. The safeguards for this
 system lie in representative government, in the power and
 the will of individual citizens to make their wishes known
 through that government, and in an independent judiciary.
 Some radio and television stations are state-run.
 Newspapers and periodicals represent widely differing views
 and do not hesitate to criticize the government.
 There have been occasional and well-publicized disturbances
 arising from racial frictions which involve immigrants from
 former British colonies. However, racial discrimination in
 employment, education, training, housing, advertising, and
 provision of goods, facilities, and services is prohibited
 by the Race Relations Act of 1976 (this does not apply to
 Northern Ireland). The Northern Ireland Constitution Act
 of 1973 prohibits discrimination on the basis of religious
 belief or political opinion. The Commission for Racial
 Equality was established under the 1976 act to work toward
 the elimination of discrimination and to promote equality
 of opportunity and good relations between different racial
 groups. There is no major distinction between legal norms
 and practice in Britain regarding minority rights.
 Effective administrative and judicial remedies are
 available to those with grievances.
 Because of the large number of immigrants from the
 Commonwealth countries, immigration policy is among the
 subjects most actively discussed in the political arena.
 British immigration law is governed by successive
 immigration acts which explicitly preclude discrimination
 on the basis of race.
 In Northern Ireland, the Protestant-dominated provincial
 government structure, which existed from 1921 to 1972,
 engaged in systematic discrimination against Catholics in
 politcs, housing, and employment. However, during the
 period 1969-72, when violence was increasing, this
 government made great strides in passing legislation
 designed to end discrimination in all these areas. Further
 corrective legislation has been passed by the British
 Parliament since direct rule was imposed in 1972. The main
 advances in legal protection since 1969 include:
 institution of universal suffrage, along with proportional
 representation in place of single-member districts, and
 abolition of voting limitations based on wealth or property
 ownership; prohibition of religious or political
 discrimination by any level of.government; establishment of
 a Commissioner for Complaints to deal with grievances
 against local councils and public bodies; establishment of
 a central housing authority to meet the problem of
 sectarian discrimination in housing allocation and
 launching of new housing projects; prohibition of
 discrimination in employment, and establishment of a Fair
 Employment Agency to promote equality of opportunity; and a
 special effort to recruit more Catholics into the civil
 service and the police.
 In response to the prevailing terrorist violence in
 Northern Ireland, the British Parliament included in the
 Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act of 1978 a
 section prohibiting membership in support of organizations
 (Protestant and Catholic) which are involved in terrorism.
 These organizations are specifically listed in the
 statute. This list does not include political parties,
 even those with close links to terrorist organizations.
 
 
 918
 Persons prosecuted under this statute are brought to trial
 in accordance with the trial procedures laid down by the
 1978 Act.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There is freedom of movement, foreign travel and
 emigration. As an exception to these general principles, a
 person involved with terrorism may be prevented from
 travelling from Northern Ireland to Great Britain or vice
 versa. However, no one may be excluded from an area in
 which he ordinarily resides.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 This freedom is well-developed. The franchise is given to
 all persons 18 years of age or over for parliamentary and
 local elections. Participation in the political
 process--discussion, debate, publication of dissenting
 views--is open to all persons and political parties.
 Revision and improvement of the electoral system constitute
 a subject of continuing formal and informal debate. Women
 are represented at all levels of British political life.
 Efforts are made by political parties to increase the
 proportion of women participants in the political process.
 The British trade union movement is one of the most active
 and influential in the world. The right to strike is
 virtually unrestricted.
 The United Kingdom is a party to the International Covenant
 on Civil and Political Rights and the International
 Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 The British government has maintained a fully open attitude
 toward international inquiries into alleged violations of
 human rights. Britain is the host country of international
 non-governmental organizations in the human rights field,
 such as Amnesty International. There are numierous  active
 national organizations in this field as well, located in
 London and throughout the United Kingdom. The British
 government is an advocate of measures to improve the human
 rights machinery of the United Nations.
