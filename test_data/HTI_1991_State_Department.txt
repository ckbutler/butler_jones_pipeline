 HAITI
 Following Haiti's first free and democratic elections in
 December 1990 and January 1991, Jean-Bertrand Aristide took the
 oath of office as President on February 7. However, on
 September 29, enlisted elements of the army revolted and forced
 President Aristide to leave Haiti. With armed soldiers
 occupying the interior of the Legislative Palace, a majority of
 both houses of the legislature on October 7 declared the
 presidency vacant and the next day confirmed Supreme Court
 Justice Joseph Nerette as provisional President. In the days
 after the soldiers' rebellion, both the Organization of
 American States (OAS) and the United Nations General Assembly
 passed resolutions urging member states not to recognize the
 Nerette presidency and to adopt economic sanctions and
 political measures against Haiti in order to restore
 constitutional order and President Aristide to his
 constitutional office. OAS-sponsored negotiations for
 President Aristide's return were continuing at year's end.
 The army is responsible for state security and enjoys
 considerable legal and institutional autonomy, particularly in
 military and security matters. The military's human rights
 record improved under the Aristide Government, but that trend
 was reversed following the September coup, .when the army
 committed numerous and serious human rights violations. In
 both rural and urban areas, army units serve as police,
 although the Constitution calls for a separation of the police
 and army. Many rural section chiefs, responsible for many
 human rights abuses in past years, were dismissed during the
 first months of Aristide's presidency. However, in their
 stead, Aristide attempted to install "rural police agents,"
 many of whom were suspected of being local activists of the
 President's political movement, Lavalas. Following the
 September coup, the military began to reinstall the rural
 section chiefs.
 Haiti is a densely populated and extremely poor country in
 which the vast majority of the population suffers from
 unemployment and economic inequalities. Economic opportunities
 remain severely restricted for all but the wealthiest classes
 of society. Notwithstanding significant fiscal and
 administrative reforms during Aristide's first 8 months in
 office, Haiti's fragile economy made little progress prior to
 the rebellion on September 29.
 Haitians suffered frequent human rights abuses throughout 1991,
 including extrajudicial killings by security forces and
 partisan mobs, disappearances, torture and other mistreatment
 of detainees and prisoners, arbitrary arrest and detention, and
 executive interference with the judicial process.  The Haitian
 people's right to choose their own government was ultimately
 denied them when the military overthrew the freely elected
 Government of President Aristide in September.. Although there
 were few institutional advances made to improve respect for
 human rights during the Aristide Government, there were fewer
 instances of abuse by soldiers, which resulted in a greater
 sense of personal security. However, the Government proved to
 be unwilling or unable to restrain popular justice through mob
 violence and ensure the rule of law for all citizens
 irrespective of partisan interests. Following the coup,
 particularly in certain quarters, the army resorted to
 brutality and massacre to control the population; credible
 estimates placed the dead nationwide at between 300. and 500.
 In the remaining weeks of 1991, the army employed violence on
 
 
 634
 HAITI
 several occasions to intimidate opposition political
 supporters, popular organizations, the urban poor, and the
 media, and otherwise to discourage antiregime activity. The
 army arbitrarily arrested numerdus active supporters of the
 President, raided and looted the homes of many of his ministers
 after issuing arrest orders for them, and violently closed
 almost all of the country's media for several weeks.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 .a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Hundreds were killed in political violence during 1991. At
 least 75 persons were killed in incidents of "popular justice"
 by mobs as well as shootings by Tonton Macoutes (henchmen of
 the Duvalier dictatorship that ended in 1986) following the
 failed coup attempt of Duvalierist strongman Roger Lafontant in
 early January. Political killings included those of Sylvio
 Claude, twice a presidential candidate and a prominent party
 leader, who was murdered the evening of the September coup
 after speaking out against Aristide; well-known Port-au-Prince
 radio personality Jackie Gary Simeon, the host of a popular
 radio call-in show and a strong supporter of President
 Aristide; and Roger Lafontant, murdered on September 29 at the
 National Prison where he was serving a life sentence for his
 January 7 coup attempt.
 The Aristide Administration, in its first months in office,
 attempted to hold military personnel and law enforcement
 officers accountable for some human rights excesses, especially
 extrajudicial killings of civilians. Numerous abusive
 personnel were transferred or removed from office, and a few
 specific disciplinary actions were instituted. As a result of
 a disturbance on March 9 in the town of Montroius which cost
 the lives of a 14-year-old boy. two soldiers, and another
 civilian, six members of the armed forces were arrested.
 President Aristide, however, appeared less concerned about
 prosecuting members of the military accused of human rights
 abuses if they were supporters or appointees of his
 Government. The police on July 26 tortured and murdered five
 young men who were in police custody; following an
 investigation, the Army recommended to President Aristide that
 a lieutenant and the enlisted men under his command at the time
 be brought to trial for the killings. The President attempted
 publicly to exonerate the officer, believed to be a militant
 Aristide supporter. President Aristide also failed to condemn
 categorically all recourse to popular justice through mob
 violence. The Aristide Government made no effort to identify
 and bring to justice those responsible for the wholesale
 killing, looting, and burning that occurred after the failed
 Lafontanr coup in January. The only response to three official
 requests to the Aristide Government for information on the
 status of the investigation into the death of an American
 citizen, Richard Andre Emmanuel, who was killed by mob violence
 in late February, was that the investigation "was still in-
 progress.-
 Human rights abuses increased significantly immediately
 following the September coup. At least 300 civilians were
 killed during and after the military rebellion on September 29
 
 
 635
 
 HAITI
 against President Aristide. Immediately after the coup,
 Haitian troops engaged in random shootings and selected
 killings of residents in poor neighborhoods who were suspected
 pro-Aristide organization leaders. In
 Lamentin, troops avenged the murder of one or two soldiers by
 indiscriminately shooting 30 to 40 people, and, on October 2,
 soldiers killed several civilians in Cite Soleil, a poor
 neighborhood in Port-au-Prince. In the months following the
 coup, the army resorted to violence on several occasions to
 intimidate perceived opponents of the regime. On December 15,
 a rural section chief shot and killed Astrel Charles, a Member
 of Parliament, in his home in Pignon in what is believed to
 have been a personal dispute. A clandestine radio station
 threatened 98 known Aristide supporters with death on December
 15.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported disappearances while the Aristide
 Government was in power. There were, many reports of persons,
 including active Aristide supporters and other perceived
 opponents, being out of contact with friends and family. At
 year's end it was not possible to determine whether these
 people went into hiding, fled the country, or had'been
 clandestinely abducted. There were two confirmed cases of
 abduction. Felix Lamy, a journalist for Radio Galaxie, was
 abducted on December 10 by armed soldiers; his whereabouts
 remained unknown as of year's end. Dr. Dieudonne
 Jean-Baptiste, a brother of the president of the Papaye Pessant
 Movement, was reportedly abducted by members, of the police in
 Port-au-Prince; his whereabouts also remained unknown.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Beatings and other cruel treatment of detainees were
 substantially less common under the Aristide presidency than in
 previous years. However, there were several"credible reports
 of toiture and other abuse of detainees and prisoners (see
 Section l.a.) both during the initial Aristide tenure and since
 the coup.
 Following the September coup, the army resorted to torture and
 violence on several occasions to intimidate and discourage
 perceived opponents and antiregime activity. Scores'of armed
 soldiers arrested and badly beat the mayor of Port-au-Prince,
 Evans Paul, on October 7. Other Aristide supporters, such as
 popular musician Manno Charlemagne and prominent businessman
 Antoine Izmery (both released), were arbitrarily arrested and
 sometimes beaten. On October 12, the army arrested and in many
 cases beat between 100 and 150 students who were holding a
 pro-Aristide press conference at the State University of
 Haiti. There was widespread intimidation of journalists: on
 November 9, for example, Paul-Jean Mario, a radio reporter, was
 arrested and remained imprisoned at year's end.
 Prison conditions remained abysmal. Prisoners continued to
 suffer from a lack of the most basic hygienic facilities, as
 well as inadequate food and health care. Guards routinely
 extorted money from prisoners for basic services and favors.
 Health care in the National Prison was further complicated by
 internal partisan quarrels within the Ministry of Health that
 led to widescale dismissals in the summer, including doctors
 assigned to periodic prison visits. The National Prison
 
 
 636
 HAITI
 remained overcrowded throughout Aristide's tenure. Mass
 escapes and the payment of bribes for release immediately after
 the coup, as well as a general pardon of political prisoners
 and the dismissal of several cases resulted by year's end in a
 dramatic reduction in the prison population. The de facto
 regime was less inclined to leave uncharged prisoners in
 prison; the police under the de facto Government tended to
 arrest and sometimes beat prisoners, then release them if a
 judge so ordered.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arbitrary arrest and detention remain among the most persistent
 human rights abuses in Haiti. By law, a person may be arrested
 only if apprehended during the commission of a crime or if a
 judicial warrant has been issued for the arrest. While some
 effort was made in 1991 to ensure that persons were not
 arrested without a warrant, frequently persons were detained
 for weeks, sometimes months, without access to family, friends
 or legal counsel, and with no judicial action being taken on
 their cases. In at least one political case, persons continued
 to be held in detention despite a court order fof their
 release. Persons detained were routinely interrogated without
 the presence of legal counsel, in violation of the Constitution.
 On June 29, Roland Alcindor and Wilfred Alexis, two members of
 a political party headed by former presidential candidate
 Hubert Deronceray, were arrested by members of the President's
 security detail in the southern provincial city of Petit Goave
 for demonstrating against Aristide. Ignoring a court order for
 their release, agents of Aristide's personal security service
 went to Petit Goave and transferred Alcindor and Alexis to the
 National Prison where they were held incommunicado and denied
 access to legal counsel. Despite repeated promises by the most
 senior officers of the Government to review the case
 personally, the prisoners were still in detention at the time
 of the September coup. The Aristide Administration detained
 former president Ertha Pascal Trouillot on April 4 on charges
 of complicity with the Lafontant coup attempt. The former
 president spent a night in the National Prison and was released
 under house arrest the following day. The charges against
 Trouillot subsequently were investigated and dropped in late
 July. Prime Minister Rene Preval personally interrogated
 prisoners at the National Prison in politically sensitive
 cases; the detainees did not have access to legal counsel
 during these interrogations. Local authorities in the coastal
 city of Jacmel arbitrarily arrested several American seamen in
 May and held them without charges for several days despite
 repeated consular protests.
 Following the September 'coup, there were numerous arbitrary
 arrests of prominent supporters of President Aristide. In
 October populist singer Manno Charlemagne and Aristiae campaign
 financier Antoine Izmery, both of whom had been arrested by the
 current de facto authorities of the Nerette/Honorat regime,
 were released from illegal detention, as was the wife of Prime
 Minister Preval.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for an independent judiciary and the
 right to a fair public trial, and expressly denies police or
 judicial authorities the right to interrogate persons charged
 with a crime unless the suspect has legal counsel present or
 
 
 637
 HAITI
 waives this right. This right was, nonetheless, routinely
 denied throughout 1991, especially in cases involving state
 security (see Section l.d.).
 The Aristide Government repeatedly attempted to interfere with
 the judicial process or usurp it through "mob justice."
 Shortly after assuming office, and without consultation with
 the Senate, the Aristide Government attempted to appoint five
 new justices to the Supreme Court. The executive maintained
 that a constitutional provision and a law passed by both houses
 of the legislature granting the executive special authority for
 6 months to reform the judiciary and public administration
 provided sufficient authority to name the disputed justices.
 Legislators, however, insisted that the law in question-could
 not supersede specific constitutional requirements and that the
 Constitution expressly grants only the legislature the right to
 interpret the intent of legislation.
 On July 29, Roger Lafontant was tried after he was charged with
 attempting to overthrow the Government by force in January." In
 public comments prior to the trial, President Aristide said
 that he believed Lafontant should be condemned to life in
 prison for his crime, although Haitian law calls for a maximum
 sentence of 15 years. On the day of the trial, hundreds of
 people demonstrated in front of the courthouse, carrying tires
 and gasoline cans and threatening to kill the judge in the case
 if Lafontant were not condemned to life in prison. After a
 22-hour trial, the judge condemned Lafontant to life at hard
 labor. Serge Beaulieu, a radio personality closely identified
 with extreme Duvalierist views, was bound over for trial on
 charges of inciting a riot. He had spent 6 months in prison
 with only belated and limited access to his attorney and family
 while awaiting completion of a judicial investigation in his
 case. The only evidence cited by an appeals judge in September
 to confirm the propriety of sending Beaulieu's case to trial
 was the presumption of his guilt based on the fact that a mob
 had ransacked Beaulieu's house following the failed Lafontant.
 coup attempt.
 Persons with controversial political reputations charged with
 various crimes against state security experienced significant
 difficulty engaging competent counsel. Lawyers and human
 rights groups were afraid to take on such cases because of
 Aristide's continued ambiguity about mob violence. Some
 attorneys who initially had agreed to accept politically
 controversial cases later dropped them because they received
 threats against themselves and their families. In the weeks
 immediately preceding the September coup, there were at least
 three known instances of lawyers who were either arrested or
 narrowly escaped popular justice through mob violence because
 of their association with politically suspect defendants.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 During and following the September coup, there were many
 credible reports of soldiers and other armed persons entering
 private homes for illegal purposes. The homes of a number of
 Ministers of the Aristide Government were looted by uniformed
 personnel, and family members were threatened.
 
 
 638
 HAITI
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech is provided for by the Constitution but was
 often abridged by violence and intimidation, particularly
 following the September coup. In addition to one
 government-owned and -operated television and radio station and
 a daily newspaper, there also are many private radio stations,
 one private television station, and several private daily
 newspapers.
 During and after the rebellion against Aristide, several
 pro-Aristide reporters and radio stations were attacked by
 military personnel and forced off the air by soldiers (see
 Section l.c.). Popular pro-Aristide radio commentator Jackie
 Caraibe was murdered (see Section l.a.). Many journalists from
 the state-owned radio, television, and newspaper went into
 hiding or sought refuge in embassies. Pro-Aristide journalists
 from private media operations also fled or took refuge. In
 response to threats from both Aristide supporters and
 opponents, most broadcast stations suspended news broadcasts.
 There were credible reports of foreign journalists having their
 materials confiscated by soldiers and being forced to leave
 certain areas of Port-au-Prince at gunpoint. Some private
 radio stations and newspapers resumed their activities in late
 October; most exercised considerable self-censorship in their
 reporting of events.
 Following the failed Lafontant coup attempt in January, angry
 pro-Aristide mobs attacked Duvalierist radio stations and
 newspaper offices that had been strongly critical of President
 Aristide. Throughout the subsequent months, many Haitian
 journalists were fearful of mob action if they openly
 criticized the Aristide presidency too harshly. These fears
 were compounded by Aristide's own public criticism and thinly
 veiled threat in early February (for which he subsequently
 apologized) against a reporter from Haiti Observateur, an
 expatriate newspaper widely distributed in Haiti. In the weeks
 just prior to the September rebellion, however, most
 journalists were beginning to abandon their earlier caution and
 had begun openly to criticize government personalities,
 actions, and programs with much less reserve.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 association, but these rights were severely restricted
 following the September coup. There were credible reports from
 all parts of Haiti indicating that the de facto Government was
 engaged in a systematic effort to inhibit any type of
 association. Soldiers would fire into the air to disperse
 gatherings. Community organizers, even of nonpolitical
 organizations, were arrested and sometimes beaten, harassed, or
 intimidated into fleeing their own communities. Only
 anti-Ari~tide organizations were allowed to demonstrate. When
 some students attempted to organize a press conference, police
 units raided the university building in which they were
 meeting. There were credible reports from several towns that
 Haitians were inhibited from gathering to listen to radio
 broadcasts from the Voice of America and other foreign
 stations, and that church groups perceived to be pro-Aristide
 were discouraged from meeting.
 
 
 639
 HAITI
 On August 13, the Parliament, as well as the offices of a
 number of the Aristide Government's critics--the labor union
 Autonomous Central of Haitian Workers (CATH), and the political
 organizations National Front for Change and Democracy (FNCD)
 and United Democratic Committee (KID)--were attacked by mobs
 who many observers believe were inspired by those close to the
 Administration. This move coincided with an attempt by the
 Chamber of Deputies to debate a motion of no confidence in the
 Government.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Religion is an integral part of Haitian life and culture and is
 practiced widely. Roman Catholicism is embraced in varying
 degrees by about 75 percent of the population. Voodoo, a
 mixture of African animism and Christianity, is also practiced
 by a majority of Haitians. Various Protestant denominations
 and foreign missionary groups openly proselytize in Haiti.
 There are no government restrictions on missionary a~tivities,
 affiliations with overseas coreligionists, or religious
 instruction or publishing.
 However, there were serious incidents of politically motivated
 violence directed against religious groups in 1991, especially
 after the September coup and duringthe period following the
 failed Lafontant coup attempt. In January the Archbishop of
 Port-au-Prince--closely associated with the Duvalierist
 regime--was forced to flee for his life because of his
 denunciation of Aristide. The sacking of the Nunciature, the
 mob attack on the Papal Nuncio, and the serious wounding of his
 assistant, shocked many in'Haiti. There were credible reports,
 some from Lavalas supporters who were themselves horrified by
 the attack, that radical partisans of the President both
 organized and participated in the event: In addition to the
 violence directed against the leadership of the Catholic Church
 (with whom the President had longstanding differences), there
 were reports in January and sporadically thereafter that
 populist groups had threatened various Protestant missions in
 certain areas of the~country and caused several pastors to flee
 their congregations.
 After the September coup, there were credible reports of
 arrests and threats of arrest of pro-Aristide clergy, of
 military forces entering places of worship during services, and
 that church groups perceived to be pro-Aristide were prevented
 from congregating.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The most serious 1991 violations of freedom of travel occurred
 shortly after President Aristide took office when hundreds of
 former officials of previous governments were subjected to a
 constitutionally questionable ban on foreign travel. Former
 president Ertha Pascal Trouillot was subject to an official ban
 on foreign travel from Aristide's inauguration on February 7
 until August 16 when the restriction was lifted'after a
 magistrate's finding that there were no grounds to prosecute
 her on state security charges. The de facto Government which
 took power after the September coup followed a similar pattern
 of restricting travel within and without the country,
 especially in cases involving Aristide's ministers and closest
 advisers, most of whom sought refuge in various foreign
 embassies.
 
 
 640
 HAITI
 Throughout 1991, Haitians continued to lave Haiti bound for
 destinations throughout the Americas.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 This right was exercised early in 1991 when President
 Jean-Bertrand Aristide took office in February following free
 and fair elections. However, he was forced by rebellious
 soldiers to flee the country in September after a military coup
 that left hundreds dead. Most senior members of his
 Administration either went into hiding, fled the country, or
 took refuge in foreign embassies. At soldiers' gunpoint.on
 October 7. the legislature declared the presidency vacant and
 the next day installed Supreme Court Justice Joseph Nerette as
 provisional President. After nearly a week of maneuvering
 among the country's various political party leaders, human
 rights activist Jean-Jacques Honorat, who was appointed Prime
 Minister in the Nerette regime, was finally able to form a
 cabinet of mostly technocrats and little-known political
 figures.
 After his election victory, President Aristide and his
 supporters often excluded or intimidated their political
 opponents or those perceived as such. Partisan mobs attacked
 political party headquarters, the media, and the Church
 following the failed Lafontant coup attempt in January. In
 early August, after the Chamber of Deputies began an
 interpellation of Prime Minister Rene Preval, a mob of
 thousands of angry demonstrators appeared at the Legislative
 Palace to threaten legislators with death should they vote to
 censure Preval. Several legislators were physically abused
 trying to enter the legislative chambers, and police at the
 scene made only limited efforts to keep the mob at a distance
 from the parliament building. At the same time, another
 violent mob attacked the headquarters of Aristide's former
 political party sponsor and the labor union offices of populist
 labor organizer Jean-Auguste Mesyeux, who had been agitating
 for weeks for Preval's resignation. After the September coup,
 pro-Aristide human rights groups were forced underground.
 Although many of these groups attempted to report on
 conditions, limitations on their ability to travel freely and
 communicate openly inhibited their ability to monitor fully the
 situation.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Several local human rights groups operated in Haiti in 1991.
 They monitored human rights violations, and at least one such
 organization, Chadel, published a monthly bulletin of human
 rights violations. Other human rights organizations, such as
 the Justice and Peace Commission of the Catholic Church, also
 published periodic reports. There were no reports of any
 effort by the Aristide Government to interfere overtly with the
 activities of domestic human rights organizations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Some 95 percent of Haitians are descendants of African slaves
 who gained independence from France in 1804. Most others are
 mulatto or of European, Middle Eastern, North American, or
 
 
 641
 HAITI
 Latin American origin. Haitian law makes no distinctions based
 on race. However, there are longstanding social and political
 animosities among these various groups, many of which date back
 before Haiti's revolutionary period. There are two official
 languages in Haiti: Creole, which is spoken by virtually all,
 and French, which is spoken by no morethan 20 percent of the
 population. Those unable to read, write, and speak French are
 limited in their social and economic activities. Many argue
 that the country's French-speaking elite have used language
 requirements as a barrier to the advancement of the country's
 disadvantaged.
 Officially, there is no discrimination against women. Women
 have occupied prominent positions in both the public and
 private sectors in recent years. In some social strata,
 however, women's r6les have been limited by tradition. Peasant
 women remain largely in the traditional occupations of farming,
 marketing, and domestic-tasks. Violence against women is known
 to occur with some frequency, but there are no statistics to
 document its extent. Because of societal traditions, domestic
 violence often is not reported to'police authorities.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution and the Labor Code guarantee the right of
 association. Workers, including three in the public sector,
 are specifically granted the right to form and join unions
 without prior government authorization. However, a union,
 which must have a minimum of 10 members, is required to
 register with the Ministry of Social Affairs within 60 days of
 its establishment.
 There are five principal labor federations in Haiti: the
 Autonomous Central of Haitian Workers; the National
 Confederation of Haitian Teachers; the Federation of Unionized
 Workers; the Confederation of Haitian Workers; and the
 Independent General Organization of Haitian Workers. -Each of
 these organizations maintains some affiliation with various
 international labor organizations.
 Tripartite negotiations (labor, management, and government),
 which began in 1986 to revise the Labor Code, made little
 progress during 1991. The existing Code recognizes the right
 to strike but restricts the duration of certain types of
 strikes. There were repeated public and private sector strikes
 in 1991. Most of the public sector strikes concerned political
 demands by workers over government appointments to management
 positions within various government ministries and public
 enterprise-firms. Private sector strikes also frequently
 targeted employers with demands for dismissal of various middle
 or senior level management officers.
 During President Aristide's 8 months in office, there were
 credible reports of efforts by Lavalas activists to encourage,
 entice, or compel the formation of an umbrella organization of
 the country's labor organizations. Labor activists expressed
 their concerns that the Lavalas movement was seeking either to
 compel their adhesion to a Lavalas organization or neutralize
 the existing labor organizations by wooing away their rank and
 file members through offers of access to government favors,
 patronage, or resources controlled by Lavalas.
 
 
 642
 HAITI
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Trade union organizing activities are protected by the Labor
 Code, and those who interfere with this right may be fined.
 Employers, however, still routinely attempt to prevent workers
 from organizing labor unions, and government enforcement
 remains mostly ineffective. Constant reorganization of the
 Social Affairs Ministry under the Aristide Government rendered
 government activity in this area even less effective than it
 had been in recent years. Collective bargaining has never been
 widespread in Haiti and was even less common in 1991. Most
 wages are unilaterally determined by the employer.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Labor Code prohibits forced or compulsory labor, but
 enforcement of these pLovisions is practically nonexistent.
 The common practice of forced domestic labor by children in
 Haiti, commonly called "restavek," continued unabated during
 1991. Thousands of young children from rural families are
 "adopted" and "educated" by more affluent city dwellers to
 serve as mostly unpaid domestic labor. The children are
 compelled to work long hours, receive poor nourishment and
 little or no education, and are frequently beaten and sexually
 abused.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.
 The minimum age for factory employment is 12 years. Fierce
 adult competition for jobs ensures that child labor is not a
 factor in the industrial sector. Children do work at odd jobs
 in both rural and urban settings in Haiti to supplement family
 income. Enforcement of the law, which is the responsibility of
 the Ministry of Social Affairs, has been criticized by the
 International Labor Organization as inadequate.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The minimum wage is set by law. Last set in 1984, Parliament
 and President Aristide were close to agreement on a substantial
 minimum wage increase when the President was deposed. The
 current minimum wage, insofar as it is observed, would not
 provide a worker and family with a decent living. Moreover,
 the majority of Haitians, who work in the agricultural sector,
 must survive on considerably less than the minimum wage.
 The Labor Code governs individual employment contracts. The
 Code sets the normal workday at 8 hours, and the workweek at 48
 hours, with 24 hours of rest on Sunday; it establishes minimum
 health and safety standards, particularly for hazardous
 occupations. The Government has not systematically enforced
 labor laws regarding wages and minimum health and safety
 regulations. These laws and regulations are somewhat better
 observed in the industrial sector, which is concentrated in the
 Port-au-Prince area and is more accessible to outside scrutiny.
