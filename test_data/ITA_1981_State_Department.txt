 ITALY
 Italy is a modern democratic state with a population of 57
 million. The Italian people have played a central role in the
 history of western civilization, including developments in
 legal theory and practice and the protection of human rights
 and dignity.
 The Italian constitution, a document drafted after World War II
 and influenced by Catholic social thought and social democratic
 theory, recognizes political and civil liberties. Despite high
 levels of terrorist violence from both left and right and aimed
 at bringing about political and social disruption, political
 and civil liberties are fully respected by the state. Civil
 and political liberties are, however, violated frequently by
 the political terrorist organizations, primarily the Red
 Brigades and Prima Linea on the left and the Nucleus of the
 Armed Revolution on the right.
 The Italian government has an excellent record of fostering
 economic and social justice, a complex and difficult problem in
 a country of markedly unequal patterns of economic development
 and social change.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person,
 Including Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by the constitution and is
 respected in practice. Occasionally, people arrested on
 terrorist charges have accused the government of torture; such
 charges have not been substantiated by disinterested parties.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment.
 Cruel, inhuman or degrading, treatment or punishment is
 fprbidden by the constitution and is not practiced. No
 invidious distinctions are made among prisoners on the basis of
 social class, race, sex, or religion. Summary executions are
 unknown. Political terrorists and ordinary criminal groups
 frequently cruelly mistreat and sometimes kill their prisoners.
 c.   Disappearances
 There have been no cases of disappearance in Italy linked to or
 condoned by the state or its agents. There is, however,
 frequent seizure of people in Italy by gangsters or by
 political terrorist groups.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Police procedures in Italy are carefully circumscribed by law
 and judicial oversight, and arbitrary arrest is not an Italian
 practice. Further, while habeas corpus in the American sense
 is not a provision of Italian law, the rights of prisoners are
 protected by law and procedural safeguards. In order to deal
 with the continuing terrorist onslaught, a law of February 1980
 modified arrest and pretrial procedures for suspected
 terrorists in several respects. pretrial detention without
 charge was lengthened from 24 to 48 hours, the legal limit on
 pretrial detention for persons charged with terrorist crimes
 was lengthened to a maximum of 10 years and 8 months (in
 narrowly defined circumstances), and plea bargaining was
 
 (814)
 
 
 815
 introduced. These and otber innovations have resulted in the
 apprehension of an increased number of identified terrorists.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A fair public trial is required by the code of penal
 proceedings. This right is respected in practice. Defendants
 have the right to effective counsel, which is provided gratis
 if necessary. The independence of the judiciary is protected
 by various articles of the constitution. With the exception of
 court martial in time of war, the constitution provides that
 all cases can be appealed to the Court of Cassazione (the
 highest court of appeal).
 f.   Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from arbitrary invasion of the home is guaranteed by
 the constitution and respected in practice. No reports of
 illegal searches or other violations of the home are known to
 have occurred during the past year, nor doesthe government
 appear to practice demolition or unjustified sealing of doors
 and windows.
 2. Respect for Civil'and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 The Italian press exercises its constitutional guarantees of
 freedom and gives play to the full spectrum of political
 views. The constitution forbids prior censorship or review-of
 the press. Publications may be seized for violations of the
 laws against obscenity or defamation of state institutions or
 political or ecclesiastical leaders, but this provision is
 interpreted narrowly and does not constrict to any meaningful
 degree the exchange of political views or criticism.
 There is no governmental interference with academic inquiry.
 The Italian constitution protects the citizen's right to
 assemble publicly, a right which may not be denied except for
 reasons of security or public safety. The right of unions to
 organize, negotiate, and strike is protected as is the right of
 free association of Italian citizenry in general. Labor unions
 freely and frequently exercise their rights of assembly.
 The constitution specifically provides that the state and the
 Catholic church will each, in its proper sphere, be considered
 independent and sovereign and that the relationship between
 them be governed by the Lateran Treaties of 1929; at the same
 time, all religious groups are held to be equally free and all
 religious groups have the right to organize according to their
 own requirements so long as these do not offend public order.
 Individuals have the right to profess any religious faith, to
 proselytize for that faith, and to exercise their religion in
 public or in private.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 The constitution guarantees to every Italian citizen the right
 to travel freely within the country, and to go abroad and to
 return. Since Italy remains a country of emigration, the
 Italian government does not encourage settlement of a large
 number of refugees. Nonetheless, Italian policy concerning
 refugees is a relatively generous one. In 1980, Italy acted as
 
 
 816
 a way-station for approximately 30,000 refugees in transit from
 the Soviet Union and elsewhere. These programs continue.
 Italy resettled some 2,175 Indochinese in 1979-80. Italy is
 also host to an estimated 600-700,000 illegal aliens, many from
 North Africa.
 C.   Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 All Italians are encouraged to participate in the political
 process. Political parties represent the entire spectrum from
 left to right. In a typical parliamentary election, over 90
 percent of eligible voters cast ballots. No major problems of
 nationality, citizenship, or statelessness exist.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental Investigation
 of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Italian government has an excellent record in support of
 human rights throughout the world. Within Italy, there are
 several organizations concerned with human rights questions.
 In addition to political parties and religious groups concerned
 with human rights, there are active branches of Amnesty
 International. The Italian government welcomes the interest of
 and cooperates with international and regional human rights
 bodies of a wide variety.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Italy is committed to the fostering of economic and social
 development on a non-discriminatory basis by constitutional
 mandate. The government, major political parties, unions, and
 church organizations all are concerned in varying ways with the
 effort to provide economic growth. A special attention is paid
 to the south, where economic and social development has
 historically been slower than in northern Italy. While there
 are ethnic and language groups which the government recognizes
 require specialattention, food, shelter, health care, and
 education are available to all regardless of race, religion,
 sex, ethnic background, or political opinion.
 Per capita GNP was $6,914 in 1980. Life expectancy at birth
 was 73 years, and the infant mortality rate per thousand live
 births was 18, each according to 1979 statistics. The adult
 literacy rate was 98 percent in 1976. Population grew at an
 average annual rate of 0.6 percent over the period 1970 to
 1979. The total fertility rate was 2.0 percent in 1979.
 Primary school enrollment is virtually universal.
