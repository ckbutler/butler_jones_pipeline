 BAHRAIN
 The extended family of the Al Khalifa has ruled the State of
 Bahrain since the late 18th century and dominates Bahrain's
 society and government. The Constitution confirms the Amir as
 hereditary ruler. The Amir has suspended some provisions of
 Bahrain's 1973 Constitution, including those articles related
 to the National Assembly which the Government disbanded in
 1975. In practice, there are few judicial checks on the
 authorities.
 Bahrain's leadership seeks to foster the open social and
 Commercial environment needed to attract international
 business, while protecting the ruling family's preeminence,
 preventing sectarian violence, and thwarting externally
 inspired subversion. Bahrainis are divided between Shi'a and
 Sunni Muslim communities. Unofficial estimates indicate that
 over two-thirds of the population are Shi'a. The ruling family
 is Sunni, and the Sunni community tends to be wealthier and
 more influential than the Shi'a, although there are conspicuous
 exceptions. While extreme poverty is rare, and the Government
 makes great efforts to assure full employment, the Shi'a as a
 group are disadvantaged, a situation which adds to the
 potential for externally inspired subversion. Two clandestine
 political groups with links to Iran have drawn support from
 some Shi'a, and two underground, secular leftist groups
 advocate violent political change.
 The human rights situation was essentially unchanged in 1986.
 Political activity remained strictly controlled, as in the
 past, and arrests for antiregime political activities occurred.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no known political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known disappearances.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Although government policy prohibits torture, and there were no
 reports of torture, there is evidence that persons suspected of
 security offenses sometimes suffer physical abuse during arrest
 and interrogation. It is not known what happens during
 detention in security prisons (where questioning may continue
 after sentencing) since visits by nongovernment persons are
 prohibited. Medical examinations by nonprison doctors have
 also been denied. There is no evidence of a policy of
 systematic physical mistreatment of criminal offenders.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Political activity is severely controlled by the security
 forces, and individuals are sometimes detained arbitrarily on
 suspicion of antiregime political activity. Activities that
 could lead to arrest or questioning include membership in
 subversive, illegal organizations, painting antiregime slogans
 on walls, joining antiregime demonstrations, possessing or
 
 
 1111
 BAHRAIN
 circulating antiregime writings, preaching sermons with an
 antiregime tone, or harboring persons committing such acts.
 Reliable estimates indicate that 50 to 100 persons are now
 being held for antiregime political activity. Detainees are
 sometimes held incommunicado for lengthy periods, although
 family members can usually learn of a detainee's whereabouts.
 The Government prohibits the use of forced or compulsory labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A person arrested may be tried in either a civil court or the
 Security Court. Civil trials provide procedural guarantees,
 including open trial, the right to counsel (including legal aid
 for indigents), and the right of appeal. Security cases,
 however, are tried directly by the Supreme Court of Appeal
 sitting as the Security Court. Trials are held in secret,
 there is no right to judicial review of the legality of
 arrests, and the Court is exempted from adhering to the
 procedural guarantees of the penal code. Sentences imposed by
 the Security Court can, at the discretion of the Court, be
 referred to the Amir for clemency, a procedure not customarily
 allowed in civil court cases.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Interior Ministry can authorize entry into private premises
 without judicial authorization. Telephone calls are subject to
 monitoring and the police sometimes open mail. Police informer
 networks exist.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees the right "to express and propagate
 opinions", but in practice Bahrainis cannot freely challenge
 the legitimacy of the regime in speech or writing. Criticism
 of government policies and programs in such areas as municipal
 services and education is tolerated and commonly seen in the
 press.
 The Information Ministry exercises wide powers over the local
 media and the press generally follows official policy closely.
 In the past, minor deviations have brought closure of the
 offending newspapers. There have been no closures since 1980,
 primarily because editors fully understand the limits of
 government tolerance. In 1986 the Government expelled the
 Reuters bureau chief as a result of an article that displeased
 it. The State owns all radio and television stations. All
 newspapers are privately owned but subject to government
 censorship. A former Information Ministry official serves as
 the editor of the only Arabic daily paper, which is regarded as
 semiofficial.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public political demonstrations are prohibited in Bahrain.
 Bahrain's Constitution affirms the right of free assembly. A
 number of professional organizations exist, including groups of
 lawyers, physicians, engineers, and businessmen. The large
 number of social and sports clubs have traditionally served as
 
 
 1112
 BAHRAIN
 forums for discreet political discussion. The Government
 monitors the activities of these organizations, which are
 generally small and limited in scope.
 The Constitution recognizes a limited right of workers to
 organize. While trade unions are illegal, the Government has
 encouraged the formation of elected workers' committees in
 major companies. Worker representatives are empowered to
 discuss wages and working conditions with management, but not
 to engage in collective bargaining, and there is no right to
 strike. These committees now represent some 10 percent of the
 work force. The workers' committees choose members of a
 national committee. This body represents Bahrain in
 international labor organizations. Expatriate workers, about
 60 percent of the work force, are denied these limited trade
 union rights.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The native population is overwhelmingly Muslim and Islam is the
 state religion, but expatriate Christians maintain places of
 worship and enjoy considerable freedom to practice their
 religion. Christian publications are readily available in
 bookstores, but proselytizing is not permitted.
 Although there are notable exceptions, Sunni Muslims tend to
 enjoy a more favored status than Shi'a among Bahrainis. Sunnis
 are given preference for employment in the Government. Shi'a
 religious assemblies are subject to government control and
 monitoring, but there is no interference with routine Shi'a
 worship or religious activities. Public religious events, most
 notably marches by members of the Shi'a community, are
 permitted but are watched closely by the police.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Bahrainis are free to move within the country and change their
 place of residence or work. There are restrictions on the
 number of Bahrainis permitted to make pilgrimages to Shi'a holy
 sites in Iran. Refugees are not repatriated to countries they
 have fled, but are obliged to depart Bahrain immediately.
 Passports can be denied on political grounds. Some persons
 living abroad and suspected of political offenses may face
 imprisonment without public trial upon return to Bahrain.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Bahrain is ruled by the Al Khalifa family, headed by the Amir.
 Government positions are not elective. The average Bahraini
 influences government decisions only through the submission of
 written petitions, informal contact with senior officials, and
 attendance at the Amir's public audiences. No political
 parties are permitted.
 There are four clandestine political groups that advocate
 violent revolution. The Islamic Front for the Liberation of
 Bahrain, the group responsible for the 1981 coup attempt, and
 the Islamic Call Party have ties to Iran and attract Shi'a
 support. Both advocate the establishment of an Islamic
 republic. Two underground leftist groups, the Popular Front
 for the Liberation of Bahrain and the National Front for the
 Liberation of Bahrain, have ties with radical Arab regimes and
 the Soviet Union.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No private human rights group is known to have visited Bahrain
 in 1986. The last indication of the Government's attitude
 toward such investigations was in 1982, when Amnesty
 International sent a team to observe the trial of those accused
 of plotting the violent overthrow of the regime. The team met
 with government officials and defense counsel, but was not
 allowed to attend the closed trial. There are no
 nongovernmental organizations established in Bahrain to protect
 individual liberties.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Bahrain's Shi'a, as a group, suffer from economic
 discrimination. Statistics are unavailable, but Shi'a tend to
 be employed in lower-paid, lesser-skilled jobs than Sunni
 workers. Social and municipal services in Shi'a neighborhoods,
 particularly the villages, are markedly inferior to those found
 in Sunni communities.
 Many legal rights of concern to women are subject to Islamic
 law. Women have rights to their own property, but daughters
 receive less inheritance than sons, and a widow must share her
 husband's estate with her own children. Although a wife may
 divorce, she must specify grounds. Women must obtain the
 permission of the male head of the household to obtain a
 passport. With the development of the Bahraini economy, women
 have increasingly taken on jobs previously reserved for men.
 They constitute about 18 percent of the Bahraini work force.
 The Government has encouraged the trend toward equality, has
 enacted special laws to promote female entry into the work
 force, and is itself a leading employer of women. Most of
 these positions are clerical, but women hold some senior
 positions. The labor law grants women 60 days of paid
 maternity leave, and nursing periods during the working day.
 The status of women is a continuing subject of debate. Many
 women subscribe to traditional interpretations of Islam and
 voluntarily adopt socially conservative roles.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Bahrain's labor law provides for acceptable conditions of work
 for all adult workers, including adequate standards regarding
 minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational safety and
 health. In practice, however, expatriate workers, who account
 for about 60 percent of the work force, are seriously
 disadvantaged by the requirement that all foreign workers must
 be sponsored in order to work. Under this system, sponsors can
 cancel the residence permit of any person under their
 sponsorship and blacklist individuals so that they cannot
 obtain entry or residence visas from another sponsor. Such
 power contains the inherent potential for exploitation and
 foreign workers are often unwilling to report abuses for fear
 of forced repatriation. Bahrain's labor law does not recognize
 the concept of equal pay for equal work. Asian workers are
 often paid less than Bahrainis or Westerners with the same
 qualifications, and women are generally paid less than men.
 The minimum age for employment in Bahrain is 14 years.
 Juveniles betweeen the ages of 14 and 16 receive special
 protection under the labor laws. They may not be employed in
 hazardous conditions or at night, and may not work over 6 hours
 a day or on a piecework basis.
