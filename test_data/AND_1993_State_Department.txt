 ANDORRA
 The Principality ol Andorra became a parliamentary democracy in March 1993
 when its Constitution was approved by popular referendum. Andorra had been gov-
 erned by two co-princes representing secular and religious authority since 1278.
 Under the new Constitution, the two Co-Princes, the President of France and the
 Spanish Bishop of Seu dtUrgell, serve coequally as Heads of State. Elections were
 held in December to choose members of the Consell General, the Parliament, which
 selects the Head of Government. Members of the judiciary are appointed for 6-year
 terms. Andorra has no defense forces and only a small internal police force.
 For centuries Andorra's economy was based on agriculture mainly sheep raising
 and tobacco growing. In recent years Andorra thrived on its duty-free status within
 the European Community (EC). Tourism boomed and dozens of luxury stores, hotels,
 and restaurants were built. With creation of the EC Unified Market however, An-
 dorra lost its privileged status and suffers from economic recession. Tourism is still
 an important source of income, especially during the skiing season, but has fallen
 dramatically. Due to banking secrecy laws, the financial service sector is growing
 in importance. Many immigrant workers live in poor conditions.
 In 1989 the European Parliament (EP) concluded that human rights, as they are
 defined in the European Convention on Human Rights, were generally respected in
 Andorra. However, the EP expressed uncertainty regarding the exercise of the right
 of association, noting that although not strictly forbidden, there were no political
 parties. It expresse concern also about the lack of labor unions and the absence
 of many social benefits common to other countries in the European Community.
 With the approval of a new Constitution in 1993, a process of potentially significant
 political change commenced. The Constitution proclaims as basic principles respect
 for the promotion of liberty, equality, justice, tolerance, defense of human rigts,
 and dignity of the person. The rights of free association and assembly are guaran-
 teed, but the Constitution is unclear regarding the right to strike.
 Only Andorran citizens, who represent 18 percent of the total population, are eli-
 gible to vote. Until 1992 only those born in Andorra of at least one Andorran parent
 could become citizens. That was broadened in October 1992 to include long-term
 residents and spouses of Andorran citizens.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There was no evidence of any form
 of political or other extrajudicial killing. There have been no reports of deaths due
 to excessive police brutality.
 b. Disappearance.-There are no known instances of politically motivated dis-
 appearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution guarantees all persons the "right to physical and moral integrity"
 and states that no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman, or degrad-
 ing treatment or punishment. These rights are honored in practice. There have been
 no cases of torture, cruel and inhuman punishment, or grievous injury by police or
 prison personnel. Penal conditions are exemplary.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-There are constitutional guarantees
 against arbitrary arrest or detention. Charges must be brought within 48 hours of
 arrest. The Constitution protects citizens' rights to due process of law. It provides
 for the accused's right to legal counsel, and free legal counsel is provided to
 indigents. It also provides for the presumption of innocence, the right to trial within
 a reasonable time (prisoners awaiting trial may be held only up to 3 months), to
 be informed of charges and not to testify against oneself, and the right to appeal.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution calls for an independent judici-
 ary, and in practice it is free of executive branch interference. Justice is organized
 and administered by the five-member Superior Council of Justice. One member each
 is appointed by the two Co-Princes, the Head of Government, the President of the
 Parliament (known as the Syndic) and collectively by members of the lower courts
 (magistrates and bailiffs). Constitutional issues and appeals are decided by a sepa-
 rate Supreme Court. A public prosecution system enforces the law and supervises
 the police.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution protects Andorrans from unlawful interference with their "privacy,
 honor, and reputation." Private dwellings are considered inviolable. No searches of
 any private premises may be conducted without a juridically issued warrant. Private
 communications also are protected by law.

 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of expression, of communication, and
 of information is constitutionally protected and respected in practice. Preliminary
 censorship or any other means of ideological control on the part of the public au-
 thorities is prohibited. One radio station operates in Andorra, and two newspapers
 and three weekly magazines are published there.
 b. Freedom of Peacefud Assembly and Association.-The Constitution respects the
 right to meet and assemble for any lawful purpose. Under the new Constitution
 adopted in March, political parties are permitted for the first time. Political parties
 and workers' organizations tend to be centered on political personalities rather than
 formal party groupings.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution guarantees freedom of religion, and it
 is respected in practice. The Constitution also acknowledges a special relationship
 between the Roman Catholic Church and the State "in accordance with Andorran
 tradition." The Catholic Church receives no subsidies from the Government.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on domestic or foreign travel or on emigration
 or repatriation. Andorra has no formal asylum policy, and at year's end had no polit-
 ical refugess in residence. However, Andorra has a long tradition of providing asy-
 lum to refugees. Asylum requests are evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Andorra has made sweeping political changes in the last decade or so, progressing
 from a basically feudal system to a parliamentary democracy. It had been governed
 by two Co-Princes since 1278 when the Principality was formed by agreement be-
 tween the Spanish Bishop of Seu d'Urgell and the French Count de Foix. The
 French title passed to the kings of Navarre and then to the kings of France (1607).
 Andorra's feudal status caused the French to break their ties following the French
 Revolution, but in 1806 Napoleon reestablished the link at Andorra's request. The
 title of co-prince devolved onto the President of France. The Co-Princes are rep-
 resented in Andorra by delegates (delegados); in addition, the French and Spanish
 Governments now have ambassadors in Andorra's capital, Andorra ]a Vella.
 Andorra's Parliament dates from 1419. The Consell de la Terra was created to
 deal with abuses by the Co-Princes. The Consell General, which replaced it in 1868,
 broadened the participation of Andorrans in their own affairs. Elections have been
 held every 4 years to select four representatives from each of Andorra's seven par-
 ishes. The Consel is presided over by the Syndic and, since 1981, elects the head
 of government.
 The establishment of the Executive Council in 1981 was a major step toward de-
 mocracy. The Council, composed of the Head of Government and four counselors,
 took over the day-to-day governing of the country. However, the Co-Princes, Consell
 General, and Head of Government deadlocked more than once over proposed
 changes. A draft Constitution clearly separating executive, legislative, and judicial
 powers was finally completed 12 years later. More than 70 percent of eligible voters
 participated in the referendum which approved the new Constitution in March.
 lections were held in December for new members of the Consell General. The
 Consell General selected a new Head of Government, Oscar Ribas, in January 1994.
 Women have played a relatively minor role in Andorran politics. They have en-
 joyed full suffrage only since 1970. Few women have run for office in the years
 since, and only two have held cabinet-level posts in the Government. Only 1 of the
 28 Deputies in the new Consell General is a woman. There are no formal barriers
 to the participation of women in Andorran politics; however, it is a conservative so-
 ciety, resistant to social change, and access to its closed world of politics is very dif-
 ficult.
 A most important change brought about by the new Constitution was the partial
 democratization of the Consell General. Previously, representatives were elected by
 parish, which gave more weight to the less populous parishes. In some cases the
 differences were quite substantial. Under the new arrangement half will be elected
 by parish and half according to population.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While there are no government restrictions to prevent it, no group to monitor
 human rights in the country has been formed.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution declares that "all persons are considered equal before the law
 and prohibits discrimination on grounds of birth, race, sex, origin, religion, opinions,
 or any other personal or social condition,* although Andorran law grants many
 rights and privileges exclusively to citizens.
 Until 1992 only those born in Andorran territory to at least one Andorran parent
 were considered citizens. Under new legislation, citizenship may be granted to those
 born to foreign parents and living in Andorra since 1975, to those living continu-
 ously in Andorra sinceprior to January 1960, and to those married to Andorrans,
 provided they have lived in Andorra continuously for 3 years. The law does not per-
 mit dual nationality. The new Constitution grants noncitizens the right to own busi-
 nesses, previously not allowed.
 The largest group of foreign residents are Spanish nationals, who make up 47 per-
 cent of the population. Other considerable foreign groups are the French Por-
 tuguese, British, and Italian. A relatively small number of North African and Afri-
 can immigrant workers are employed mostly in agriculture and construction.
 Immigrant workers do not enjoy equal rights with Andorran citizens. They lack
 many social benefits paid to residents and in many cases live in deplorable condi-
 tions. The cost of living in Adorra is quite high, and workers employed in low-wage
 industries often cannot a.  d the normal housing costs. Many of them live in trail-
 ers or crowded apartments, with as many as 8 or 10 people sharing quarters de-
 signed for 4. Many such workers are in Andorra on temporary work permits. These
 permits are valid only as long as the job exists for which the permit was obtained.
 A worker hired on a temporary contract loses his work permit when the contract
 expires; if unable to find new employment, the worker quickly becomes an undocu-
 mented alien with no visible means of support and is therefore deportable.
 Women.-There is no legal discrimination against women, either privately or pro-
 fessionally. There are no available data on the incidence and handling of domestic
 violence cases. (See also Section 3.)
 Children.-There is no evidence of any special commitment to children's rights
 and welfare, although therekisn indication of any problems in this area.
 People with Disabilities.--Some, but not all, public buildings and public places
 prvide facilities for handicapped access. Government spokesmen affirm that there
 is no discrimination against people with disabilities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Article 18 of the Constitution recognizes the right
 of all persons "to form and maintain managerial, prfessional, and trade union asso-
 ciations without prejudice." The Constitution provides that a Registry of Associa-
 tions is to be established (through future legislation) and maintained. At year's end,
 there were no labor unions in Andorra. Though government officials said this was
 because no organizations had applied for recognition, the nonofficial Sindicato
 Andorrano de Trabajadores (Andorran Workers' Unionc- AT) reported that it did
 apply for official recognition last spring, but there was no response to the applica-
 tion. The SAT plans to reapply after the new government is in place. Strikes were
 illegal under the old system, and the new Constitution does not state explicitly that
 strikes are pe ted. This issue is to be addressed by a law on worker rights which
 was under preparation at year's end.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiely.-Article 19 of the Constitution
 states both "workers and employers have the right to defend their own economic
 and social interests." There is an official minimum wage, set by government regula-
 tions. Other, higher wages are established by contract. The Parliaent is charged
 with adopting legislation to regulate conditions governing the exercise of this right
 so as to guarantee the functioning of essential services to the community. Unbiased
 observers note tht tejthreat of immediate dismissal is a powerful deterrent to any
 complaints from workers, especially as there is no unemployment insurance. This
 strongly inhibits workers from organizing effectively to press their case. Antiunion
 discrimination is not prohibited under current law; this issue, too, is to be addressed
 in the draft legislation on workers' rights.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is not specifically
 probibited by law, but it has never been an issue. There is no forced labor in An-
 dorra.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children..-.Children under the age of 18 are
 normally prohibited from working aithough in exceptional circumstances children
 who are only 16 may be allowed to work. Child labor regulations are enforced by
 the Labor Inspection Office within the Ministry of Social Welfare, Public Health,
 
 
 780
 and Labor. That office does not routinely inspect workplaces but responds to com-
 plaints.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The workweek is limited to 40 hours, although
 longer hours may be required. The legal maximums for overtime hours are 66 hours
 per month and 426 hours per year. The minimum wage is approximately $4.50 per
 hour, which is nationally mandated. In principle, it is enforcedby the Labor Inspec-
 tion Office, but self-enforcement by custom is the norm. The current minimum wage
 is inadequate for a worker and family in Andorra, where living costs are quite high.
 Complaints center on the lack of job security-workers may be dismissed without
 notice and receive social security and health benefits for only 25 days; thereafter
 there is no unemployment insurance. Foreign workers who contribute to the social
 security system are ineligible to receive retirement benefits if they do not remain
 in Andorra after retirement; however, they may apply for a lump-sum reimburse-
 ment of social security contributions when they leave the country. Retirement bene-
 fits are controlled by a board composed of Andorran nationals, although they rep-
 resent only a small portion of the work force. There is no special court or board to
 hear labor complaints.
 The Government sets occupational health and safety standards, but enforcement
 is very loose, as there are no routine inspections. There is no legislation giving
 workers the right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations without
 jeopardy to their continued employment.
