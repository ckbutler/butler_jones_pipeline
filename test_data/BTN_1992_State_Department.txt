 BRUTAN *
 The Wangchuck dynasty of hereditary monarchs has ruled Bhutan since 1907. Lo-
 cated in the Himalayas between India and Tibet, the small Kingdom has been able
 to escape domination by any external power since the 10th century. King Jigme
 Dorji Wangchuck (1952-72), while retaining strong executive powers, took several
 steps to move the Kingdom toward a more rpresentative political system, including

 ther infrequently. Since few scholars have published studies on the Bhutanese polity or society,
 information on chutaneae practices which bear on human rights is often incomplete.

 creation of a National Assembly, a Royal Advisory Council, and a Council of Min-
 isters. There is no written constitution or bill of rights. The present monarch, King
 Jigme Singye Wangchuck, on the throne since 1974, has continued Bhutan's social
 and political evolution, although progress has been seriously disrupted by civil strife
 involving ethnic Nepalese. Buddhists constitute approximately half of the popu-
 lation; another third of the population, mostly from the southern districts, is of Ne-
 pali Hindu ethnic origin.
 Internal security is maintained by the Royal Bhutan Police, a force of about 5,000,
 assisted by the Royal Bhutan Army, with approximately 7,000 lightly armed men.
 A large majority of the population is illiterate and rural and lives on subsistence
 agriculture in a largely barter economy. India is Bhutan's principal source of foreign
 assistance and main trading partner. Tourism is a potential source of foreign ex-
 change; however, the Government restricts access by the outside world in an effort
 to minimize the spread of foreign influence and limits the number of tourists to
 about 3,000 a year.
 The human rights situation deteriorated further in 1992 as the Government con-
 tinued to implement a 1985 citizenship law and related legislation designed to
 "Bhutanize" the country. The target of the policy is the ethnic Nepalese minority,
 whose growing percentage of the population was perceived by the ruling Drupka
 Buddhists as a threat to their culture. The citizenship law retroactively stripped
 citizenship from Nepalese immigrants who could not document their presence in
 Bhutan prior to 1958 and ethnic Nepalese born in Bhutan who could not prove that
 both their parents satisfied the requirements for citizenship under the 1985 law.
 These are nearly impossible requirements in a country with widespread illiteracy,
 which only recently adopted administrative procedures. Tens of thousands were de-
 clared to be illegal immigrants and were forcibly evicted from the country. Still
 more fled the country voluntarily in the face of officially sanctioned pressure, report-
 edly including arbitrary arrests, beatings, rape robberies, and other forms of intimi-
 dation by police and the army. By the end of tha year, some 72,000 ethnic Nepalese
 had arrived at refugee camps in southern Nepal. Up to 20,000 are believed to have
 taken refuge with relatives in India. Exiled ethnic Nepalese leaders organized the
 Bhutan People's Party (BPP) and the Bhutan National Democratic Party (BNDP)
 to resist Bhutanization, which they see as an attempt to suppress their ethnic and
 cultural identity and drive many of them out of the country. The Government, which
 outlawed the BPP in 1990 as antinational, accused it in 1992 of kidnaping and kill-
 ing government officials, as well as intimidation and extortion of southerners who
 did not support its cause. Other human rights abuses included: denial of the right
 of citizens to change their government; limitations on the right to a fair trial; re-
 strictions on peaceful association and assembly, and worker rights; and traditional
 cultural practices which result in some gender discrimination.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no independent con-
 firmations of such killings. The Human Rights Organization of Bhutan (HUROB),
 an organization of ethnic Nepalese Bhutanese operating primarily in Nepal, accused
 government forces of targeting dissidents for execution; the Government denied such
 accusations and pointed to an order by the King for police and army forces not to
 use lethal force when dealing with dissidents or demonstrators as evidence of its de-
 sire to avoid bloodshed. In a report issued in August, the Government charged the
 dissidents with responsibility for 46 murders and acknowledged that 4 dissidents
 had been killed since the outbreak of hostilities in late 1989.
 b. Disappearance.-The HUROB, as well as Nepalese and Indian human rights
 groups interviewed hundreds of ethnic Nepalese in southern Bhutan, Nepal, and
 India. They reported numerous instances since September 1990 of police and army
 forces rounding up men suspected of supporting the resistance movement. The
 HUROB claimed hundreds of these men were never seen again after being taken
 away; it presumed they were either being held by the Government without charge
 or had been killed. These claims could not be confirmed; however, the consistency
 of the stories among so many people lent them credence. The Government denied
 such disappearances took place; it claimed that a total of 4 dissidents were killed
 in military action and 28 arrested. It accused the HUROB and other organizations
 (BPP, Student's Union of Bhutan, BNDP) of carrying out "antinational" propaganda
 campaigns.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Ethnic Nepalese refugees in India and Nepal recounted to human rights groups
 hundreds of cases in which police and army forces had allegedly beaten, raped, and
 
 
 1130
 robbed suspected supporters of the resistance and their families. The HUROB
 claimed government authorities re larly tortured detainees and prisoners; there
 was no independent confirmation of hese charges, but their credibility is enhanced
 by the number of similar accounts. The Government denied these allegations. How-
 ever, the recent conviction of three government officials in southern Bhutan on
 charges related to intimidation of ethnic Nepaese lends credence to these claims.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Bhutanese law contains no specific guar-
 antees against arbitrary arrest, and until recently there has been little discussion
 of reforming the country's highly traditional criminal justice system. The November
 session of Bhutan's National Assembly witnessed an unprecedented public debate
 about criminalprcedures and produced a new national security law which elimi-
 nates the manda ry death penalty for treason. The Government previously cited
 the death penalty requirement, and their desire to avoid executions, as an excuse
 for delay in trying those held on charges related to the unrest in the south.
 On February 4, the Government released under an amnesty decree 313 prisoners
 detained, but never tried, for "antinational activities." It released another 45 mili-
 tants under a similar amnesty on September 11. According to the Government, a
 total of 1,528 people accused of "antinational activities" have been released under
 amnesties since the outbreak of hostilities in late 1990. As of late 1992, about 200
 people were being held in hutanese jails on charges related to political unrest in
 southern Bhutan. Charges against 41 of these detainees were forwarded to the High
 Court for a tnl trihat began on May 18. In judgments handed down late in the year,
 32 of the defendants were found guilty and given sentences ranging from 9 months
 to life in prison. Five defendants were acquitted. Exile is not formally used as a
 form of punishment. However, political opponents of the Government have been
 driven from bhutan along with ethnic Nepalese (see Section 2.d.).
 e. Denial f Fair Public TriaL.-The judicial system consists of local, district, and
 national courts. Criminal cases and a variety of civil matters are adjudicated under
 an 18th-century legal code, revised in 1957, which applies to all Bhutanese regard.
 less of ethnic origin. Judges appointed by and accountable to the King are respon-
 sible for all aspects of a case, including investigation, filing of charges, prosecution,
 and judgment. Appeals to higher courts are permitted, and final appeals may be
 made to the King. The legal system does not provide for jury trials or the right to
 a court-appointed defense attorney. The Bhutanese legal system has no provision for
 lawyers or solicitors, although it does allow for the appointment of a "jambi" (a per-
 son well versed in the law) if the defendant so desires. Questions of family law, such
 as marriage, divorce, and adoption are resolved separately according to traditional
 Buddhist law for the majority of Bhutanese and Hindu law in areas where persons
 of Nepalese origin predominate.
 The Government reportedly holds one political prisoner, Tek Nath Rizal, an ethnic
 Nepalese. Rizal, a former member of the Bhutan National Assembly and founder of
 HUROB, was abducted in 1989 from eastern Nepal where he had fled after clashing
 with the Bhutanese Government over ethnic Nepalese rights. Rizal is being held on
 charges of conspiracy and treason. Two other prisoners of conscience, Josen
 Gasmere and Sushil Pouhrel, were released in 1992.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-There
 are no written guarantees of privacy, but cultural tradition is highly respectful of
 personal privacy. At the same time, the Government places great emphasis on
 promotingnational integration. For example, in 1989. by royal decree, the wearing
 of Bhutanese national dress was made compulsory for allcitizens. Anyone found vio-
 lating the decree may be fined or sentenced to jail for a week. In the north the de-
 cree is not widely enforced, except in government offices, while in the south officials
 appear to enforce the decree rigorously. According to human rights groups, police
 regularly conduct house-to-house searches for suspected dissidents without offering
 explanations or justifications.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Bhutan's population, whose adult literacy rate
 is around 12 percent, is relatively unaffected by the print media. The Government's
 weekly newspaper Kuensel is the country's only regular publication, but Indian and
 other foreign newspapers are distributed without government interference. Bhutan
 has no television. In 1989 the Government ordered the dismantling of all television
 antennas to prevent people from watching programs originating outside Bhutan.
 The government radio station broadcasts for 3 hours daily in the our maor national
 languages (Dzongkha-the language of the western highlands, Nepali, English, and
 Sharcho p). Criticism of the King is permitted in the National Assembly but not in
 the public media. The use of Nepalese language in schools was banned at the end
 
 
 1131
 of 1990. Public schools in the south, closed throughout 1991, began to reopen during
 1992.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-No written guarantees of these
 freedoms exist. Bhutanese may engage in peaceful assembly and association only for
 pursee approved by the Government. Political parties are discouraged. The  hu-
 tan1 Peoples Party and the Bhutan National Democratic Party, organized by ethnic
 Nepalese Bhutanese in exile, have been labeled "terrorist and antinationalr and, ac-
 cording to the Government, 'have no standing inside the country." Both parties ad-
 vocate a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy and claim wide
 support in southern Bhutan.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Buddhism is the state religion. The Government sub-
 sidizes monasteries and shrines and provides aid to about half the Kingdom's 12,000
 monks. The monastic establishment enjoys statutory representation in the National
 Assembly and Royal Advisory Council and is an influential voice on public policy.
 Citizens of other faiths, largely Hindus, enjoy freedom of worship but may not pros.
 elytize. Under Bhutanese law bonversions are illegal. The King has declared major
 Hindu festivals to be nationai holidays, and the royal family participates in them.
 Foreign missionaries are not permitted to proselytize in the Kingdom, but inter-
 national Christian relief organizations are active.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There is freedom of movement within Bhutan for all Bhutanese citi-
 zens, and there is no bar on emigration or foreign travel. For many years, Bhuta-
 nese seldom traveled inside or outside the Kingdom, but the construction of roads
 and the establishment of air links with New Delhi, Calcutta, Dhaka, and
 Kathmandu encouraged travel. Bhutan's southern border with India is open, and
 people residing in the immediate areas freely cross this border. Indians from other
 regions who enter Bhutan by airplane or stay in hotels must have visas and fall
 under the overall limitation of about 3,000 tourists per year. By treaty, Bhutanese
 are free to reside and work in India.
 For several years, Bhutan has sought to reduce the ethnic Nepalese population
 by implementing a 1985 nationality law that significantly tightened the require-
 ments for transmitting citizenship. Until 1985, citizenship was transmitted as long
 as at least the father was a Bhutanese citizen under the 1958 nationality law
 (which granted citizenship to all ethnic Nepalese then residing in Bhutan). The 1985
 nationality law tightened this standard by requiring that both parents be Bhutanese
 citizens in order to transmit citizenship. Residents of Bhutan who could not satisfy
 this new requirement were retroactively declared illegal immigrants. People losing
 their citizenship under the 1985 law may apply for naturalization, but only after
 satisfying a rigorous set of standards including proficiency in the Dzongkha lan-
 guage and proof of residence in Bhutan during the previous 15 years. Exile political
 groups complain that the law makes unfair demands for documentation on largely
 illiterate people in a country that has only recently adopted basic administrative
 procedures. They claim many ethnic Nepalese who have been in Bhutan for genera-
 tions were expelled because they were unable to document their claims to residence.
 The Government denies this and asserts, for example, that the word of village lead-
 ers is an acceptable substitute for written documentation.
 Beginning in early 1992, increasing numbers of ethnic Nepalese from Bhutan
 began arriving in refugee camps in eastern Nepal. By year's end, 72,000 Bhutanese
 had arrived in five camps run by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refu-
 gees (UNHCR) and its cooperating agencies. Up to 20,000 more are believed to have
 left Bhutan and settled with family members in India. In a Bhutan population of
 less than 700,000, the departure of over 100,000 people constitutes a major demo-
 graphic change.
 The Government claims those who have been expelled are Nepalese citizens who
 came to Bhutan to work after the 1958 citizenship decree was issued. It also claims
 that the majority of those arriving in Nepal have left voluntarily after selling their
 land and property. Many refugees, however, claim they were pressured to leave by
 local authorities. These pressures are said to include the threat to confiscate prop-
 erty, denial of public services, and physical intimidation.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens of Bhutan do not have the right to change their Government. Bhutan is
 a traditional monarchy, with sovereign power vested in the King. The Government
 has resisted democratic changes. It is a highly elitist system, with decisionmaking
 centered in the palace and involving only a small number of officials in the civil and
 religious establishment. Although the present King and his father have made some
 attempts to integrate women and southerners (ethnic Nepalese) into the body poli-
 
 
 1132
 tic, the system is still dominated by the male members of an aristocracy of Tibetan
 Buddhist ancestry. Political parties do not exist, and their formation is discouraged
 by the Government. The Bhutan People's Party (BPP), founded in 1989, was out-
 lawed in 1990 as antinational. The BPP operates primarily out of Nepal and India
 but claims support in the predominately Nepali southern regions. The Bhutan Na-
 tional Democratic Party (BNDP), founded by ethnic Nepalese exiles in February
 1992, also was outlawed.
 The 150-member National Assembly is composed of 105 members elected by lim-
 ited franchise (heads of family in Hindu areas, village headmen in Buddhist re-
 gions), 12 elected by the monastic establishment, and 33 high-level officials of the
 government administration appointed by the King. Its principal functions are to
 enact laws, approve senior appointments in the Government, and advise the King
 on matters of national importance. It also provides a forum for presenting griev-
 ances and rectifying cases of maladministration. Voting is by secret ballot, with a
 simple majority needed to pass a measure. The Kingcannot formally veto legislation
 pAssembly, but he may refer bills bk to it for furth          onsideration.
 I    ssembly          y                     recommendations or delayed their
 implementation, but the King has always had enough influence to persuade the As-
 sembly to approve legislation he considers essential or to withdraw proposals he op-
 poses. Government offcials may be questioned by the Assembly, and ministers can
 beforced to resign by a two-thirds vote of no conidence.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no local human rights groups active in Bhutan. International Commit-
 tee of Red Cross representatives held discussions with government officials in
 Thimpu in December and reached agreement to begin prison visits in January. The
 HUROB, representing ethnic Nepalese dissident opposition, claims to be based in
 Bhutan but operates primarily from Nepal. The Government allowed a high-level
 Amnesty International delegation to visit Bhutan for 6 days in January. The delega-
 tion met with senior government officials and traveled to the southern district of
 Samchi, but their request to visit the district of Chirang, where there have been
 hostilities, was turned down on security grounds. Several other international groups
 and individual investigators have been denied access to Bhutan.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The origins of the 1985 nationality law and the Government's subsequent
 "Bhutanization" drive lie primarily in the ethnic composition of Bhutan. The coun-
 try's ruling Buddhist majority feared that their culture would be overwhelmed in
 the long run by the Hindi ethnic Nepalese, whose percentage of the population had
 risen to a third by 1991. The Indian annexation of neighboring Sikkim in 1974,
 where just such a development occurred, was seen as an object lesson. Early efforts
 at halting the unfavorable demographic trends focused on tightly limiting immigra-
 tion, restricting employment and residence of the Nepalese to the southern portion
 of the country, and attempting to assimilate the existing ethnic Nepalese. Attempts
 at assimilation included liberalizing policies onintermarriage, educating some stu-
 dents in regions other than their own, and giving priority to economic development
 in the south.
 Over the last decade, the King has allocated 2 500 acres of land to landless house-
 holds in southern Bhutan, and several hundred farmers and orange growers have
 been given special loans, according to Bhutanese government sources. By law,
 southerners may own land and establish business in the north, and northerners
 have the same right in the south. Nonetheless, it is reportedly still difficult for non-
 Buddhist Bhutanese (except government officials) to buy property in Buddhist areas.
 In recent years assimilation has given way to Bhutanization. Measures aimed at
 preserving a national identity require the wearing of Bhutanese dress, make the
 teaching of Dzongkha compulsory, and ban the teaching of Nepalese. The national-
 ity law retroactively stripped citizenship from ethnic Nepalese who could not docu-
 ment their presence in the country prior to 1958, a near impossibility in a country
 with widespread illiteracy, which only recently adopted administrative procedures.
 Tens of thousands were declared to be illegal immigrants and forcibly evicted from
 the country. The 1985 reform also stripped citizenship from ethnic Nepalese born
 in Bhutan who could not prove that both their parents satisfied the requirements
 for citizenship under the new law. Still more fled the country voluntarily in the face
 of officially sanctioned pressure, reportedly including arbitrary arrests, beatings,
 rape, robberies, and other forms of intimidation by police and the army.
 Exile student groups accuse the Government of revoking the foreign scholarships
 of students from Nepalese families and discriminating against ethnic Nepalese in
 
 
 1133
 
 government hiring. Families with ties to the palace and senior levels of the Govern-
 ment are strongly favored in their access to state scholarships for foreign education.
 Nevertheles the King has also made a serious effort to send other qualified can-
 didates for education overseas as well, drawing particularly from Rhutan's pres-
 tigious civil bureaua
 Bhutan has not developed either a rigid caste system or customs which sequester
 or disenfranchise women. Family land is divided equally between sons and daugh-
 ters. Rhutanese traditionally place girls in a lower status than boys, however, and
 girls receive poorer nutrition and less medical attention than boys. Boys outnumber
 grls b about two to one in primary school and seven to one at secondary level. The
 isparty between the higher mortality rates of female versus male infants has re-
 sulted in an overall ratio of 97.2 females per 100 males, one of the lowest in the
 world.
 The sexes mix relatively freely, marriages may be arranged by partners them-
 selves as well as by their parnts, and divorce is common. Polygamy is still per-
 mitted, a man is allowed by law to have three wives, but polyandry is no longer
 sanctioned. Marriage registration is compulsory, and legislation favoring women in
 matters of alimonylhas been enacted. About 10 percent of the persons employed by
 the various government ministries and departments are women. There is no evi-
 dence that violence against women is a problem in Bhutan.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Riht of Association.-Trade unionism is not permitted, and Bhutan has
 no labor unions. Bhutan is not a member of the International Labor Organization.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There is no collective bargain-
 ing or legislation addressing labor-related issues pertaining to the small industrial
 work force, which makes up less than I percent of the population. There are no ex-
 port processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-As far as is known, there is no
 law prohibiting forced or compulsory labor, but it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Emplyment of Children.-There are no laws governing the
 employment of children. hldren are not employed in the industrial sector, but
 many assist their families in the traditional economy.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-As noted above, there is no legislation address-
 ing labor issues. There is no legislated minimum wage, standard workweek, or
 health and safety standards. Labor markets are highly segmented by region, and
 monitoring wage developments is inhibited by the preponderance of subsistence ag-
 riculture and the practice of barter. The largest salaried labor market is the govern-
 ment service, which has an administered wage structure last revised in 1988. Only
 about 18 industrial plants employs more than 50 workers. Apart from a few of these
 larger plants, the entire industrial sector consists of home-based handicrafts and
 some 60 privately owned small or medium-scale factories producing consumer goods.
