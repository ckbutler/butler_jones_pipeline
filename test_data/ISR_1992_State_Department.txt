 ISRAEL AND TILE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES *
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy with a multiparty political system and free
 elections. There is no constitution, but a series of basic laws defines the responsibil-
 ities of government institutions. The legislature (the Knesset) can limit the Govern-
 ment and force its dissolution. Israel has an independent judiciary. Public debate
 on issues of concern to Israelis is open and lively. A vigorous free press scrutinizes
 all aspects of Israeli life and politics.
 Since Israel's founding in 1948, it has been in a formal state of war with most
 of its Arab neighbors, except Egypt, with which it concluded a peace treaty in 1979.
 As a result of the 1967 war, Israel has occupied the areas of the West Bank, the
 Gaza Strip, the eastern sector of Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights. Throughout its
 existence as a state, Israel has experienced numerous terrorist incidents, within and
 outside its borders. In this atmosphere of hostility and threat, Israel has relied
 heavily on its military and security services and has retained many security-related
 emergency regulations from the preindependence British Mandate period.
 Internal security is the responsibility of the General Security Service (Shin Bet),
 which is under the authority of the Prime Minister's office. The police are under the
 authority of a separate minister. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF), which include a
 significant portion of the Israeli adult population in either active duty or reserve
 status, also play a role in maintaining internal security. The IDF is under the au-
 thority of a civilian Minister of Defense. The Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense
 Committee reviews the activities of the IDF and the Shin Bet. According to the US.
 Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, total military expenditures for 1989 were
 $5,745 million. Defense spending has sown a decreasing trend and is a perennial
 topic for debate during budget negotiations.
 srael has a developed market economy. While there is substantial government
 regulation, intervention, and ownership in the economy, the Government recently
 adopted an economic reform package aimed at reducing government involvement in
 the economy. Israel enjoys a relatively high standard of living.
 There was no significant change in the human rights situation in Israel in 1992.
 Israeli citizens enjoy a range of civil and other rights. While the Government's de-
 clared intention is to strive for greater equality between the Arab and Jewish sec-
 tors of the population, Israel's Arab citizens do not share fully in the rights granted
 to, and the levies imposed on, Jewish citizens. As in the past, Israel's main human
 rights problems arise from its policies and practices in the occupied territories.
 *Because the legal status and the political and human rights conditions of the West Bank,
 Gaza, and East Jerusalem differ sharply from those in Israel, the situation in those territories
 is dealt with in a separate report following the report for Israel.

 RESPECr FOR HUMAN RICRS
 Section I. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrojudicial Kiling.-Political killings in Israel are nei-
 ther practiced nor sanctioned by Israeli autorities. In the context of the extreme
 political tension between Israeland the Palestinians, intercommunal killings are
 often assumed to have political motivation. In 1992 Israeli authorities ascribed the
 murders of at least 13 Israelis to Arab nationalist motivations. Among the most se-
 rious incidents were the kidnaping, near his home in Lcd, and murder 2 days later
 of an Israeli border policeman by Hamas militants, the February slaying of three
 IDF recruits in Gilad by three Israeli Arabs, alleged to be members of the Islamic
 Jihad Organization, and the murder in May of Helena Rapp, aged 15 in Bat Yam
 by a Gazan. The latter incident sparked anti-Arab rioting and resulted in a 2-week
 closure of the Gaza Strip along with restrictions on Gazan workers' entry into Is-
 rael. There were no reported killings of Arabs in Israel by Israelis.
 ,b. Disappearance-There were no reports of government-condoned disappear-
 ances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruelt, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Israeli laws and administrative regulations prohibit such practices. (See the occu-
 pied territories report for a discussion of allegations of mistreatment of prisoners
 from the occupied territories incarcerated in detention facilities located in Israel.)
 In June the Ministry of Justice established a division to investigate accusations
 of official misbehavior and ill treatment of prisoners. These investigations had pre-
 viously been done by the internal offices of the involved government agencies.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Israeli law and practice provide guaran-
 tees against arbitrary arrest or imprisonment. Writs of habeas corpus and other pro-
 cedural and substantive safeguards are available. Defendants are considered inno-
 cent until proven guilty.
 Administrative detention with no formal charge or trial, is permitted under a
 1979 law. The Minister of befense may issue a detention order for a maximum of
 6 months. Within 48 hours of issuance of such an order, a detainee must be brought
 before a district judge. The process of review to confirm, shorten, or overturn a de-
 tention order must be carried out as quickly as possible, and, if the order is con-
 firmed, an automatic review must take place after 3 months. Administrative deten-
 tion orders are renewable. The detainee may be represented by counsel and may ap-
 peal to the Supreme Court. The Government may withhold evidence from the de-
 tainee and counsel on security grounds. The Ministry of Justice reports that no Is-
 raeli citizens were held in administrative detention in 1992. Israel continued to hold
 most Palestinian administrative detainees from the occupied territories in detention
 centers inside Israel. (For a full discussion of administrative detention and deporta-
 tions of Palestinians, see the separate report on the occupied territories.)
 The Government acknowledges that 90 prisoners detained for terrorist activities
 in southern Lebanon are being held in Israel. According to human rights sources,
 42 of these are Lebanese citizens, 10 of whom, after being imprisoned and convicted,
 continue to be held even though they have served their sentences. An Israeli court
 dismissed an October 1992 appeal by some of these detainees that they be expelled
 from Israel and confirmed administrative detention orders against them.
 A judge of a district court may, in cases involving a felony, permit the postpone-
 ment of notification to an attorney of the arrested person. This period normally can-
 not exceed 48 hours. It may, however, be extended for a total of 7 days when the
 Minister of Defense has certified in writing that national security requires the ar-
 rest to be kept secret or if the Inspector General of Police certifies in writing that
 secrecy is required in the interest of the investigation. Human rights groups say this
 may be extended to 15 days in cases of espionage.
 Israel does not exile its citizens.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-There are both civil and military courts in the ju-
 diciary system. There are also religious courts, labor relations courts, and other ad-
 ministrative tribunals. The judiciary is independent and effectively insulated from
 political interference. The right to a hearing by an impartial tribunal with represen-
 tation by counsel is guaranteed by law and observed in practice. All nonsecurity
 trials are open except for those instances where the interests of parties are deemed
 best served by rivacy. Security cases may be tried before a military court or a civil
 court and may be partly or wholly closed to the public. The Attorney General deter-
 mines whether a security case is tried before a military or civil court.
 The prosecution must justify nonpublic proceedings. Defense counsel is present,
 even during closed proceedings, but may be denied access to some evidence on secu-
 rity grounds. In security cases in which access to some evidence is denied, that evi-
 dence may not be used to convict a defendant.
 
 
 1015
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home or Correspondence.-Al-
 though jprivacy of the individual and the hoe are generally protected by law within
 Israel, interference with mail and the tapping of telephones are practiced in some
 cases. Israeli law permits wiretapping by court order in criminal cases; in security
 cases the order has to be issued by the Ministry of Defense. Emergency regulations
 permit mail to be stopped, opened, and even destroyed on security grounds.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-(See the separate report on the occupied territories.)
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Pess.-Individuals organizations, the press, and the
 electronic media freely debate a wide range of public issues and criticize government
 officials and policies. Nonetheless, emergency regulations authorize censorship or
 outlaw statements or written materials that express or encourage support for illegal
 organizations. Publications and domestic or foreign press articles dealing with secu-
 rity-related matters must be submitted to the military censor.
 Arabic- langu age publications and press are censored more strictly than Hebrew-
 language equivalents. In August Israel's Interior Ministry ordered the closure of the
 quarterly Arabic languag magazine A-Siyassah on security grounds. Press creden-
 tials of two Western journalists were lifted after they reported on an IDF training
 accident in which several soldiers died, but their credentials were later reinstated
 The lifting of credentials only affects journalists' ability to attend official briefings;
 they can still work in Israel.
 The Government occasionally initiates prosecution for statements or writings on
 behalf of terrorist organizations; such action is almost always directed against Is.
 raeli Arabs. The Government asserts that at various times it has initiated prosecu-
 tion against Jewish individuals and grups for imflammatory statements and
 writings. No cases were filed against Jews in 1992, but investigations into state-
 ments made by Kach and Kahane Chai members are currently under way. In 1992
 the poet Shafiq Habib received an 8-month conditional sentence and a 3-year proba-
 tionary period and a fime for violating the 1949 Antiterror Act which bans the publi-
 cation of statements praising, supporting, or encouraging any acts of violence which
 could lead to personal injury or death. Habib had published poems in 1990 which,
 according to Government officials, praised the revolutionary aspect of the intifada.
 Provisions against maintaining contact with, or accepting support from, terrorist or-
 ganizations apply to the media as well as to individuals.No media organization was
 prosecuted on these grounds in 1992. It is government policy to withhold licenses
 for publishing Israeli Arab magazines in the West Bank and Gaza. In September,
 however security authorities lifted a 25-year ban on the distribution of Al-Ittihad,
 an Israeli Arabic-language daily published by the Communist Party.
 All newspapers are privately owned and managed. The quasi-independent Israel
 Broadcast Authority, whose director is appointed by the Government, retains signifi-
 cant control over electronic media. There are now six cable companies operating in
 Israel under franchises granted by cable councils whose members are appointed by
 the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law and court rulings pro-
 tect the rights of Israelis to assemble and associate. Emergency regulations prohibit,
 however, membership in, or contact with, outlawed organizations, primarily the Pal-
 estine Liberation Organization (PLO), its subdivisions, or its individual members. A
 prominent Israeli peace activist, convicted and sentenced in 1991 to a jail term of
 18 months, was released in 1992 after serving 6 months of that term. Another Is-
 raeli peace activist began serving a 7-month term in April but was freed in Septem-
 ber after serving 5 months of his sentence. A bill repealing the provision of the Pre-
 vention of Terrorism Ordinance of 1948 which forbids contact with terrorist organi-
 zations passed a first reading in the Knesset in December. Following review by the
 Knesset s Law, Constitution, and Justice Committee, this bill will be brought to the
 Knesset plenum for a second and third reading. If approved, Israelis will no longer
 be subject to prosecution for meting with PLO members.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Israeli law provides strong guarantees of freedom for all
 faiths. Approximately 82 percent of Israeli citizens are Jewish. Muslims, Christians,
 and Druze, and members of other minority religions make up the remaining 18 per-
 cent.
 Each recognized religious community in Israel has legal authority over its mem-
 bers in matters of marriage and divorce. Secular courts have primacy over questions
 of inheritance, but parties, by mutual agreement, may bring the case to religious
 courts. Orthodox religious authorities have exclusive control over marriage and di-
 vorce in all sectors of the Jewish community, whether or not they are Orthodox.
 Missionaries are allowed to work in Israel. A 1977 antiproselytizing law, prohibiting
 
 
 1016
 
 the offering and receipt of material benefits as an inducement to conversion, was
 not applied against any individuals or organizations in 1992, according to the Min-
 istr of Justice.          ,
 Travel to visit religious sites or perform religious obligations in and outside Israel
 is widely permitted. In 1992 Israel approved the pilgrimage to Mecca (for both the
 little and regular haj) of over 4,400 Israeli Muslims. However, for security reasons,
 the Government forbids participation in the haji by males under 30 years of age.
 The Government asserts that travel to Saudi Arabia, a country formally still in a
 state of war with Israel, is a privilege and not a right for Israeli Muslims. The Gov-
 ernment doubts many Muslims under 30 would apply if the restriction were lifted.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Israeli citizens may move freely within Israel except in military or secu-
 rity zones, or in cases where they may be confined to their neighborhood or village
 by administrative order under emerncy reglations. Israeli citizens are free to
 travel abroad and to emigrate, provided theyh ave no outstanding military obliga-
 tions or are not restricted by administrative order.
 Israel welcomes Jewish immigrants, including Jewish refugees, to whom it gives
 automatic citizenship and residence rights under the Law of Return. It accepts the
 return of Jewish Israeli citizens who have emigrated. The Law of Return does not
 apply to Israeli Arabs. Under the principle of family reunification, Israel has al-
 lowed the return of a very few Arab refugees who fled Israel in 1948-49 but has
 rejected the great majority of requests by such refugees to return.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Israeli citizens have the right and ability to change their gvernment peacefully.
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy, with a multitude of parties representing a wide
 range of political views. Relatively small parties, including those whose primary
 support is among Israeli Arabs, regularly win seats in the Inesset. All adult Israeli
 citizens have the right to participate in the political process and to vote by secret
 ballot. According to official figures, 77.4 percent of Israeli citizens over the age of
 18 voted in the 1992 parliamentary elections.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Private Israeli organizations are active in publicizing and litigating human rights
 issues and cases. Israel is responsive to international and nongovernmental interest
 in its human rights situation and treats seriously responsible challenges to its
 human rights practices.
 Israel permits regular visits by a wide range of private and international organi-
 zations concerned with human rights such as Amnesty International (Al), Middle
 East Watch, the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights the International Labor Or-
 ganization (ILO), and others. It hosts and works with a delegation of the Inter-
 national Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC).
 The Ministry of Justice has a human rights office which responds to human rights
 inquiries, and the Government has designated specific points of contact within the
 Ministries of Defense and Foreign Affairs to give timely responses to human rights
 inquiries fromforeign governments, international bodies, and human rights organi-
 zations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Israel does not have a constitution. However, the Equal Opportunity Employment
 Law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex or marital status. The Labor Ex-
 change Law prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, religion, political beliefs,
 and age. A general law prohibits government bodies from practicing discrimination
 on any of these grounds.
 The Equal Opportunity Employment Law requires employers to pay male and fe-
 male workers equal wages for equal work. However, domination of personal status
 law by religious courts means that women are suject to restrictive interpretations
 of their rights in such crucial areas as marriage and divorce.
 The Government has a senior advisor on the status of women, and the Civil Serv-
 ice Commission and several government ministries have officers responsible for
 women's rights. Nongovernmental women's organizations work actively in promoting
 women's rights and welfare. Women are drafted into the IDF but do not ill combat
 positions.
 In 1992 the Government expanded rights regarding maternity leave pay, provided
 more equal rights in tax procedures, improved benefits for single parent families,
 and passed legislation to protect women against spouses who have fled the country
 during divorce proceedings.
 
 
 1017
 The courts in Israel deal with persons convicted of violence, including violence
 against women. The Government asserts it condemns violence against women and
 the subiect is being dealt with on an ongoing basis. Human rights groups, especially
 women a groups, are increasingly active in dealing with the issue of domestic vio-
 lence against women, and the Government provides some funding for intervention
 activities.
 In general, Israeli Arabs have not attained the same quality of education, hous-
 ing, employment, and social services as Israeli Jews. A 1992 report by the Comptrol-
 ler criticized government policies which have resulted in a wide disparity between
 educational performance among Jewish and Arab schoolchildren. Arab Israeli mu-
 nicipal officials assert the Government continues to underfund Arab municipalities
 and have consistently protested government policies on budget allocations through
 actions including strikes. Responding to this pressure, the Goverment agreed in
 1992 to increase development funds for the Arab sector. Government officials assert
 policies are being implemented to close this gap, including more funding for teach-
 ing time and an increase in funds for infrastructure in the Arab sector. It also abol-
 ished the post of the Prime Minister's Advisor on Arab affairs, a move welcomed
 by the Israeli-Arab community since they saw that office as institutionalizing their
 separate status as a special minority without providing any benefits. The post has
 been replaced by a committee composed of the directors general of various min-
 istries under the supervision of the Director General of the Prime Minister's Office.
 Relative to their numbers, Israeli Arabs are underrepresented in the student bod-
 ies of most universities and in higher level professional, academic, and business
 ranks. A relatively small number of Israei Arabs, who omprise approximately 18
 percent of Israels population, have risen to responsible positions in the civil service,
 generally in the Arab departments of government ministries. Two Arab Israelis
 serve as deputy ministers in the current Cabinet. There are 6 Arab members of the
 120 member Knesset and 12 Arab judges in the magistrate and district courts out
 of a total of 287. The Arabic-speaking community has access to local and foreign Ar-
 abic press, publications, and media.
 The Israeli Druze and Circassian communities, at their initiative, are subject to
 Israel's military draft, and some Bedouin and other Arabs serve voluntarily. Other
 than Druze and Circassians, Israeli Arabs are not subject to the draft. Con-
 sequently, they have less access than do other Israelis to a variety of social and eco-
 nomic benefits for which military service is a prerequisite or an advantage, includ-
 ing housing and new-household subsidies and government or security-related indus-
 trial employment. The Government asserts that it maintains an open-door policy
 with respect to Israeli Arabs who volunteer for military service and that hundreds
 of Muslim and Christian Arabs are voluntarily inducted into the IDF and serve in
 various unts including the infantry, armored corps, and paratroopers. The Israeli
 Arab community has objected to the idea of alternative national service.
 While the Government accorded legal status to a number of unrecognized Arab
 villages in 1992, the residents of the village of Ramyah (see the 1991 Country Re-
 port) remain subject to eviction orders absent a resolution of their status with gov-
 ernment authorities. The Government asserts that the issue is not one of govern-
 ment recognition of the village but of the Government's authority to acquire land
 for public purposes. Residents of Ramyah counter that they have been singled out
 for iscriimnation since the land will be used for housing Jews, that they are ex-
 cluded from the new housing, and that they have not been offered fair compensa-
 tion. By the end of 1992, the Government had agreed to a postponement of an evic-
 tion notice against Ramyah residents while representatives of the village negotiate
 a resolution of the problem with Israeli officials.
 The Fundamental Human Rights bill, intended to enshrine the principle of equal-
 ity before the law and prohibit discrimination on the basis of religion, nationality,
 race, or place of nationa origin, is currently being discussed by the Ministerial Com-
 mittee on Legislation and the Knesset Committee of Constitution, Law, and Justice.
 Religious parties and women's groups oppose certain provisions of this bill, but the
 Freedom of Occupation law' and the Privacy and Freedom from Arbitrary Arrest
 laws, less controversial components of the general legislation, were passed sepa-
 rately.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Israeli workers may join freely established organiza-
 tions of their own choosing. Israeli Arabs are free to form their own unions but have
 not done so. Most unions belong to the General Federation of Labor in Israel
 (Histadrut) or to a much smaller rival federation, and are independent of the Gov-
 ernment, even though a majority of the elected leadership is identified with the
 Labor Party and a significant Likud Party minority. About 75 percent of the work
 
 
 1018
 
 force, includng Israeli Arabs, are members of Histadrut trade unions and still more
 are covered by Histadrut's social and insurance programs and collective bargaining
 agremets. Histadrut members democratically elect national and local officers and
 officials of its affiliated women's organization, Na'amat, from political party lists.
 Plant or enterprise committee member are elected individually.
 The right to strike is exercised regularly. A 15-day notice prior to a strike or a
 lockout is legally mandated, unless otherwise specified in the collective bargaining
 agreement, but unauthorized strikes also occur. If essential public services are af-
 fected, the Government may appeal to labor cour  which include employee and em-
 ployee representatives, for back-to-work orders while negotiations continue. Strike
 activity in 1992 was concentrated in the public and health sectors. No general
 strikes occurred.
 Unions freely exercise their right to form federations and affiliate internationally.
 Nonresident workers, including the approximately 90,000 nonresident Palestin-
 ians from the West Bank and Gaza working in Israel, may not be members of
 Histadrut and thus may not belong to Histadrut's health system, participate in
 Histadrut elections or other activities.
 Palestinian workers may not organize their own trade unions within Israel. Pal-
 estinian trade unions in the occupied territories are not permitted to operate in Is-
 rael. However, nonresident workers in the organized sector, including Palestinians
 from the occupied territories, are entitled to Histadrut contract and grievance pro-
 tection and may join, vote for, and be elected to shop-level workers" committees if
 their numbers in individual establishments exceed a minimum threshold. Palestin-
 ian participation in such committees is minimal.
 Labor laws applicable in Israel also apply to Palestinians in East Jerusalem and
 Syrian Arabs and Druze on the Golan Heights. (See the occupied territories report
 for discussion of worker rights in East Jerusalem and the West Bank and Gaza.)
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Israelis fully exercise their
 legal right to organize and bargain collectively. The majority union (Histadrut) is
 the exclusive bargaining agent. Nonresident workers may not organize on their own
 or bargain collectively, but are entitled to representation by the bargaining agent
 and the protection of collective bargaining agreements. They do not pay membership
 fees but pay a 1-perent organization fee which entitles them to union protection
 by Histadrut's collective bargaining agreements.
 While there is no law specifically prohibiting antiunion discrimination, the basic
 law against discrimination could be cited to contest discrimination based on union
 membership. No antiunion discrimination has been reported.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, and neither Israeli citizens nor nonresident Palestinians working in
 Israel are subject to such practices.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-By law, children under age 15
 may not be employed. School children aged 15 may not be employed without special
 permission except as apprentices or during school vacations. Employment of those
 aged 16 to 18 is restricted to ensure time for rest and education. Israeli labor ex-
 changes do not process work applications for West Bank or Gaza Palestinians under
 age 17. A labor inspection service enforces these provisions, although enforcement
 is difficult in smaller, unorganized enterprises.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Legislation in 1986 established a minimum
 wage at 45 percent of the average salary, calculated periodically. In 1992 the Gov-
 ernment came under criticism from Knesset members and other political figures for
 lax enforcement of minimum wage laws. The minimum wage is often supplemented
 by special allowances, and is generally sufficient to provide workers and their fami-
 lies an acceptable standard of living. Most wages and salaries are established in col-
 lective bargaining agreements. Along with union representation, the labor inspec-
 tion service enforces labor, health, and safety standards in the workplace.
 By law, maximum hours of work at regular pay are 47 hours per week, 8 per day
 and 7 the day before the weekly rest, which must be at least 36 consecutive hours
 and include the Sabbath. By national collective agreements, the private sector es-
 tablished a maximum 45-hour workweek in 1988 while the public sector moved to
 a 5-day 42V2-hour workweek in 1989.
 The 6overnment continued to enforce restrictions on West Bank and Gazan work-
 ers imposed in the aftermath of the Gulf war. Gazan workers were also subject to
 special restrictions in May and June following the murder of an Israeli teenager by
 a Gazan worker. By November, most of the restrictions had been lifted except a pro-
 vision excluding Gazans between the ages of 16 and 20 from entering Israel, unless
 they are married or the sole support of a household. The number of workers from
 the occupied territories employed through the Israeli employment service labor ex-
 
 
 1019
 change was 70,100 in August 1992 compared with 60 000 in 1991. Government offi-
 cials estimate that 20,000 illegal workers enter Israel on a daily basis. All workers
 from the occupied territories are employed on a daily basis and, unless they are em-
 ployed on shilwork, are not authorized to spend the night in Israel. Police carry
 out identity checks of Palestinians found outside the worplace and arrest and fme
 those without valid work permits.
 Palestinians working in Israel are technically covered by the laws and collective
 bargaining agreements that cover Israeli workers, including minimum wage, sick
 leave, severance pay, paid vacations, and pensions administered by the Mimstry of
 Labor and Social Affairs. However, it is widely believed that many Palestinian
 workers do not receive the full benefits to which they are entitled under these laws
 and agreements. Workers' rights organizations and Histadrut continued to defend
 the rights of Palestinian workers, including those who, having lost their jobs be-
 cause of government-imposed curfews, were denied severance pay.
 Palestinians working in Israel are paid through the employment service, which
 receives their wages and benefits from employers and pays the recipient after de-
 ducting taxes, a 1-percent union fee, and contributions to the National Insurance
 Institute (NII). The same percentage (5.35 percent) for NII contributions is deducted
 from the pay of legally hired Palestinians and from Israeli workers. In return for
 their Nil contributions Palestinian workers receive some, but not all, of the benefits
 Israeli workers receive. Because of these restrictions, only 1.2 percent of Palestinian
 workers' pay goes to the Nil. The remaining 4.15 percent is nonetheless deducted
 from their pay in order to equalize the labor costs of Palestinians and Israelis.
 These funds are deposited with the Ministry of Finance, which applies them to pro-
 grams administered by the Government in the West Bank and Gaza. Palestinians
 have criticized the lack of public accounting for the Government's use of these funds.
 The Government insists that all money collected is used exclusively in the West
 Bank and Gaza for the benefit of Palestinian workers.
 In 1991 an employer brought a suit to the Supreme Court, arguing that Palestin-
 ian workers and their employers should have to contribute only that part of the sal-
 ary which applied to benefits directly received by the employee. In response to the
 Supreme Court's recommendation, the Government formed an interagency commis-
 sion to study the issue. The commission presented its fimdings to the Government
 in 1991 but by year's end the Government had not acted on the report.
 Israefi settlers living in the occupied territories but working inside Israel have the
 same benefits as all other Israeli workers.
 OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 This report deals with territories under military occupation, whereas most others
 in this volume describe practices within sovereign states and deal with the relation-
 ship between governments and their own citizens. Israel occupied the lands known
 as the 'occupied territories' (the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Golan Heights, and East
 Jerusalem) as a result of the 1967 war.
 Israel is not recognized internationally to have sovereignty over any of the occu-
 ied territories, but has asserted sovereignty over and annexed East Jerusalem. The
 egal regime in the West Bank and Gaza derives from Ottoman, Jordanian, Egyp-
 tian, and British law, as modified by more than 1,300 Israeli military orders in the
 West Bank and a similar number in Gaza. Israel has extended its law and adminis-
 tration to the Golan Heights.
 The United States considers Israel's occupation to be governed by The Hague Reg-
 ulations of 1907 and the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection
 of Civilians in Time of War. Israel claims to observe their humanitarian provisions
 as a matter of policy.
 Israel governs the West Bank and Gaza through a military-backed Civilian Ad-
 ministration (CIVAD) ultimately responsible to the Minister of Defense. Some Arab
 municipalities have efected mayors while in others they are Israeli appointed. How-
 ever municipal and local elections have not been held since 1976. Palestinians do
 not have the opportunity to participate in significant political or economic decisions
 regarding the occupied tertories, except for East Jerusalem, where Palestinians
 have largely boycotted the political process. Israeli settlers in the territories (about
 5 percent of the Palestinian and Jewish population of the territories, exclusive of
 East Jerusalem) are subject to Israeli law and receive better treatment than Pal-
 estinians under military occupation law. Israeli economic policies discriminate in
 favor of Israeli interests and Israeli settlers in the territories. Negotiations, includ-
 ing the subject of elections, between Israelis and Palestinians are ongoing to estab-
 
 
 1020
 lish an interim self-governing authority which would give Palestinians greater con-
 trol over the economic and political decisions affecting their lives.
 The security forces in the occupied territories consist of the Army (Israel Defense
 Forces-IDF), the Shin Bet (General Security Service), the police, and the para-
 military border police. Crimes by Palestinians related to security, as defined by the
 authorities, are tried in military courts staffed by IDF officers. Since 1967, Palestin-
 ians have protested against Israel's occupation. The civilian unrest known as the
 intifada erupted in December 1987. The massive Palestinian protests and dem-
 onstrations and certain punitive Israeli countermeasures associated with the
 intifada continued to subside in early 1992. However, killings by both sides in-
 creased during the year, and violence escalated toward the end of the year.
 The economies of the West Bank and Gaza Strip are small, poorly developed, and
 highly dependent on Israel. The West Bank produces many agricultural items and
 some light manufactured goods. Gaza's economy is more focused on agriculture and
 depends heavily on earnings from day-laborers working in Israel. Both economies
 have suffered from the effects of the occupation, the 5-year-old Palestinian uprising
 against Israeli rule, and the Gulf war.
 Despite the overall reduction in intifada violence, IDF killings of Palestinians
 were 62 percent higher in 1992 than in 1991 (158 killed in 1992 compared to 98
 in 1991). The longstanding U.S. position is that several Israeli practices, such as
 transfer of prisoners outside the occupied territories and demolition or sealing of
 houses as a form of collective punishment, contravene specific provisions of the
 Fourth Geneva Convention. During the year there continued to be instances of Is-
 raeli mistreatment of Palestinians during arrest and interrogation, bans on travel
 and movement, restrictions on family reunifications, administrative detention, house
 demolitions, and discriminatory policies in land and resources use and trade. Israel
 continued to require that all Palestinian residents of the West Bank and Gaza ob-
 tain special permits to enter Jerusalem or Israel. Several times during 1992 Israeli
 forces sealed off the West Bank and Gaza, sometimes as a preemptive measure and
 sometimes in response to the killing of Israeli civilians. Palestinian killing of Pal-
 estinians for alleged collaboration with Israeli authorities and other reasons also
 continued; such killings decreased in the West Bank as compared to 1991, but in-
 creased overall due to a high level of internecine violence in Gaza. (In 1992, 182
 Palestinians were killed by other Palestinians, compared to 140 in 1991.)
 On December 17, Israel deported 415 Palestinians associated with the Hamas and
 Palestinian Islamic Jihad fundamentalist organizations to Lebanon. The Govern-
 ment stated this was a temporary measure to deal with an upsurge in attacks
 against security forces, including the abduction and killing of an Israeli policeman.
 A thou h the Supreme Court rejected a last-minute appealof the deportation order,
 thus aIlo    the deportations to proceed, further appeals regarding the legality of
 the deportations were pending at the end of the year.
 At the same time, there were some improvements in the human rights picture in
 the occupied territories in 1992. In August the Government announced plans to re-
 lease 800 Palestinian prisoners and removed seals and barricades on some houses
 and streets. House demolition as a punishment for security offenders and adminis-
 trative detention continued but was used less frequently than in 1991. The Govern-
 ment used curfews less extensively in most of 1992 than in 1991 though use of cur-
 fews rose toward the end of the year. The new Government elected in June canceled
 January expulsion orders pending against 12 Palestinians, replacing them with or-
 ders for administrative detention. Sine a  n          strike, Israeli authorities
 and representatives of prisoners have been negotiating improvements in prison con-
 ditions. Bir Zeit University, the last Palestinian university to remain closed under
 military order during the intifada, was reopened in late April.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGilTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-Israeli security forces killed 158 Pal-
 estinians in 1992; of these, at least 45 were killed by undercover units operating
 disguised as Palestinians. Most of the victims had been either wanted for alleged
 crimes, wearing masks, eluding arrest, or engaged in writing graffiti; eyewitness ac-
 counts report that approximately two-thirds were unarmed at the time of death, al-
 though Israeli authorities say that half of those killed by the squads were armed.
 Some human rights groups have charged that the undercover units targeted cer-
 tain activists for execution. Although the Government states there is no official pol-
 icy permitting such behavior, numerous reports suggest that the units frequently
 killed suspects under circumstances in which it may have been possible to appre-
 
 
 1021
 hend them without killing. In a number of cases, these squads also killed or wound-
 ed bystanders or individuals mistakenly identified as wanted persons.
 The Government of Israel acknowledges the operation of the, special undercover
 units and that some abuses occurred. It asserts, however, that the units operate
 under the same rules of engagement as all other IDF units in the occupied terri-
 tories (see Section 1.g. for a description of these rules) and that all deaths caused
 by undercover or other IDF units, as well as allegations of abuse, are investigated.
 In November a Nazarene district court awarded damages to a Palestinian who
 was injured and to the family of a Palestinian who was killed as a result of a 1988
 undercover operation in the West Bank. The judge ruled that the undercover squad
 had used excessive force under the circumstances.
 In 1992 one IDF lieutenant colonel in an undercover unit was convicted of neg-
 ligent conduct (giving an inappropriate order to open fire) and given a 1-month sus-
 pended sentence. The officer also was dismissed from his post. In a separate case,
 a lieutenant was brought to trial on charges of causing the death of one Palestinian
 and the wounding of another in 1991; proceedings were still in progress as of late
 1992. According to the Government, there were 34 investigations of actions of border
 police undercover units between January and October 1992. In 24 cases, the State
 Attorney's office decided that opening fire was justified under the circumstances; the
 remaining 10 cases are under investigation.
 Palestinian attacks against Israeli soldiers and civilians in 1992 resulted in 23
 deaths, while estimates of Israelis wounded range from 322 to 700, an increase over
 the number of such attacks in 1991. Most deaths were by knifing or gunfire, while
 most injuries were by stone throwing.
 During 1992, 182 Palestinians were killed by other Palestinians (compared to 140
 in 1991), most often because of alleged collaboration with Israeli security services,
 disputes between political factions or street an , or personal feuds. Of these
 killings. 149 took place in Gaza; in the West  an, on the other hand, this phe-
 nomenon diminished sign ificantly. As in previous years, some Palestinian leaders
 appealed for an end to such killings.
 Israeli authorities prosecute Palestinians accused of killing other Palestinians as
 well as those accused of killing Israelis, and although there is no capital punish-
 ment, sentences are severe. Paestinans suspected of killing alleged collaborators
 have been a principal target of undercover unit operations
 The Government also prosecutes Israeli civilians accused of killing Palestinians,
 though sentences given to Israelis are generally much lighter than sentences hand-
 ed down to Palestinians convicted of kiIling either Israli or Palestinians. In March
 an amendment to Israel's penal law provided gater discretion in sentencing for
 cases of self-defense or necessity where a defendant has used excessive force.Pal-
 estinians raised concerns that this might result in unjustifiably lenient sentences
 for Israeli settlers who use force. No actual caes were reported by year's end.
 (For further discussion of killings, see Section 1.g.)
 b. Disappearance.-There were no confirmed reports of disappearances in 1992.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 In 1992 international, Israeli, and Palestinian human rights groups offered detailed
 accounts of widespread abuse, which they claim in some cases amounted to torture,
 of Palestinian detainees. According to numerous reports, hooding, forced standing or
 tyin  up in contorted positions, blows and beatings, confinement in a small space,
 deprivation of sleep and food, n threats against the detainee's family were com-
 mon practice in interrogation facilities. The Israeli human rights organization
 B'rselem charged that death threats were also made by interrogators in about a
 third of the cases the , surveyed in 1991. In 1992 there were no reports of electric
 shock torture during interrogation, of which there were credible accounts in 1991.
 The Government has not made public the results of an Israeli police investigation
 of this practice.
 Israeli law forbids torture. Israeli authorities say that torture is not authorized
 or condoned in the occupied territories but acknowledge that abuses occur and are
 investigated. In 1987 the Landau Commission specifically condemned tortur h but
 allowed for moderate physicnal a pologl pressure to be used to secure con-
 fessions and to obtain eformation; a classified annex to the report defining permis-
 sible pressure still has not been made public.
 The Ministry of Justice established a division in 1992 to investigate allegations
 of abuse by police and Shin Bet officers, including ill-treatment of detainees during
 interrgation. The Ministry of Police investigated 12 complaints against policemen
 in 1992; 1 case was dismissed, 2 resulted in either criminal charges or court martial,
 and the remaining 9 cases are still under investigation or legal examination.
 Charges of beatings and physical abuse by Israeli security forces continued. The
 IDF says that it investigates automatically every fatality but does not routinely in-
 
 
 1022
 
 vestigate nonlethal violent incidents unless a complaint is made. According to the
 IDF, mdictments have been handed down against 35 soldiers for acts of wrongdoing
 carried out in the territories. Of these it says 23 resulted in convictions, 1 case was
 dismissed, 1 soldier was acquitted, ana 10 trials have not yet been concluded.
 In May the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) took the unusual
 step of releasing a public statement on the treatment of Palestinian detainees under
 interrogation, concluding that "means of physical and psychological pressure are
 being used that constitute a violation of the Geneva Convention" and that numerous
 representations to the Israeli Government on this subject over a period of years had
 brought about "no substantial or lasting improvement." In response, the Govern-
 ment said the ICRC's public statement was "inconsistent with the tradition of co-
 opration and understanding between the ICRC and Israel." It further stated that
 the Israeli Supreme Court is reviewing interrogation procedures and that high-level
 government authorities are also examining them. The Government stated that be-
 tween January 1 and November 12, 59 complaints were made against Shin Bet in-
 terrogators for alleged mistreatment of detainees during detention. Of these 47
 have been investigated to date, and 12 are currently under investigation. The Gov-
 ernment did not make public the results of these investigations.
 As of December 15, five Palestinians-had died in custody either during the period
 of interrogation or shortly thereafter. In three of these cases, autopsies showed that
 an aggravation of preexisting conditions (such as asthma or heart trouble) brought
 on by mistreatment during interrogation caused death. The other two cases appar-
 ently were suicides.
 Most convictions in security cases are based on confessions. Although Israeli mili-
 tary regulations provide for the right to counsel as soon as possible, an attorney is
 normally not allowed to see a client until after interrogation is complete and a con-
 fession if obtained, has been made. The ICRC is not allowed access to detainees
 until the 15th day after arrest. Detainees frequently tell judges that confessions
 were coerced. In such cases, a trial-within-a-trial may be held and interrogators
 summoned to testify. Israeli and Palestinian attorneys and human rights gups
 were unaware of any case in 1992, however, in which a confession was disallowed
 as evidence because this procedure was followed.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile-Any soldier may arrest without warrant
 a person who has committed, or is suspected of having committed, a criminal or se-
 curity offense. Persons arrested for common crimes in the occupied territories are
 by regulation provided the opportunity for bail, access to an attorney, and a state-
 ment of charges- these provisions are usually honored in practice, although they are
 often delayed. Bail is rarely available tothose arrested for security offenses. The
 vast majority of arrests are for security offenses.
 Persons may be held in custody without a warrant for 96 hours, and then must
 be released unless a warrant is issued. A police officer may issue a warrant for two
 periods of 7 days each. For extensions beyond 18 days from the date of arrest the
 detainee mUst be brought before a military judge, where he is entitled to deense
 counsel. In 1992 Israei authorities shortened this period to 8 days for minors and
 those accused of less serious offenses (such as stone throwing). A military judge may
 extend detention for 30-day periods up to a total of 90 days from the date of arrest.
 Further renewal of detention may be made by the military appeals court.
 While Israeli military regulations hold that a detainee has the right to see a law-
 yer as soon as possible, in the cases of security detainees an officer ma issue a
 written order to delay access to counsel for up to 15 days for reasons of security
 or the efficiency of investiation. Higher ranking officials or judges may extend this
 period by up to 75 more dsays for the same reasons. In practie, security detainees
 are usually denied access to a lawyer during the initial investigation for periods of
 7 to 15 days. Israeli regulations also permit prisoners to be held in isolation from
 family and ..from other detainees during interrog~ation.
 Israeli procedures provide for immediate notification of arrest to family members,
 with some exceptions for security reasons. Notification may be delayed by up to 12
 days in scurityr cases by order of a senior officer. Governme~t officials assert that
 postcards are given to detainees immediately upon arrest and in addition the names
 of those arrested and the place of detention are listed at CIVAD district had-
 quarters throughout the West Bank and Gaza. The ICRC, by agreement, is notified
 within 12 days. Israeli authorities state  they attempt to post notification of ar-
 rest within 48 hours; Palestinians assert that families and lawyers are normally no-
 tiffed much later and generally locate the detainee throughtheir own efforts. The
 ICRC attempts to help by passing on to families (by telephone) the information it
 receives from Israeli pisn officials.       o       o
 District military commanders may also order administrative detention without
 formal charges. Detainees may appeal detention orders or renewal of detention be-
 
 
 1023
 fore a military judge. In appealing detention orders, detainees or their attorneys,
 while not having access to secret evidence, may question security service witnesses
 concerning the general nature of that evidence. The High Court may review rulings
 by military judges and may examine secret evidence.
 As of the end of the year, Israeli officials reported 520 Palestinians held in admin-
 istrative detention. This figure represents a substantial increase in the number of
 administrative detentions in the wake of the December 14 abduction and murder
 by Hamas activists of border policeman Nissim Toledano. After that incident, Israeli
 security arrested over 1,500 Palestinians, some of whom were placed in administra-
 tive detention. Before the kidnaping and murder of Toledano, administrative deten-
 tion for security reasons without formal charges was used somewhat less frequently
 than in 1991. The number of administrative detainees ranged from the high of 520
 in December to a low of 203 in October, as compared to 350 at the end of 1991.
 Detention periods are for a maximum of 6 months and are renewable.
 Administrative detention involves no formal charge or trial, and evidence used at
 hearings frequently is declared" secret and not releasable to either the detainee or
 his attorney. Israeli officials state that administrative detention is used only when
 IDF legal advisors have determined that there is sufficient evidence to detain a per-
 son and that the evidence has been corroborated by two sources. They assert, how-
 ever, that the evidence cannot be presented in open court because to do so would
 compromise the method of acquiring the evidence, which is often provided by in-
 formers whose lives would be jeopardized if their identities were known. Human
 rights monitors respond that administrative detention is often used when evidence
 against a suspect would not stand up in court.
 As of October, approximately 10 150 Palestinians were incarcerated in Israeli
 prisons and detention centers. Of tbose, approximately 60 percent had been tried
 and were serving sentences, 38 percent were awaiting charges or completion of trial
 and 2 percent were detained administratively, i.e., incarcerated for a specific period
 of detention without formal charge or trial.
 The authorities continued to transfer detainees and prisoners out of the occupied
 territories to detention facilities in Israel, especially to the Ketziot camp in the
 Negev desert and Megiddo prison near Afula. Palestinians sentenced to "less seri-
 ous offenses are usually detained at IDF-run facilities in Ketziot and Megiddo
 while those charged with "more serious offenses" are consigned to prison service fa-
 cilities. Family visits to Megiddo and Ketziot prisons, begun in autumn 1991, contin-
 ued in 1992. Palestinian prisoners staged an 18-day hunger strike in September-Oc-
 tober to protest prison conditions. In response, the Government accepted a number
 of the strikers' demands regarding improvements.
 In January, following the killing of several Israeli civilians by Palestinians, the
 Government issued orders to deport 12 Palestinians, none of whom was suspected
 of the killings but who were alleged to have incited violence. All 12 orders were sub-
 sequently canceled, and the Palestinians in question were sentenced to administra-
 tive detention instead.
 On December 17, Israel deported 415 Palestinians associated with the Hamas and
 Palestinian Islamic Jihad fundamentalist organizations to Lebanon. The Govern-
 ment declared this a temporary measure intended to deal with a series of Hamas
 attacks on Israeli soldiers and the kidnaping and murder of an Israeli border police-
 man, and stated that the deportees will be allowed to return after 2 years. Although
 the Supreme Court rejected a last-minute appeal of the deportation order, further
 appeals regarding the legality of the deportations were pending at the end of the
 year. The IDF has established a military appeals commission to review appeals of
 the deportation orders; as of the end of the year, no individual appeals had been
 filed. The IDF announced that 10 of the deportees had been deported by mistake
 and preparations were under way to allow them to return, possibly to face trial.
 e. Denial of Fair Public 7ria/.--Palestinians accused of nonsecurity offenses are
 tried publicly in local courts by Palestinian judges appointed by Israeli officials, ex-
 ept where jurisdiction has been transferred by military order. Since the beginning
 of the uprising, regular locallaw enforcement has deteriorated seriously. Many Arab
 policemen and judges have resigned, and Palestinian courts have functioned spo-
 radically.
 Palestinians accused of security offenses are tried in Israeli military courts. Israel
 broadly defines security offenses which may include charges of nonviolent political
 activity, such as membership in outlawed organizations.
 Serious charges are tried before three-judge panels, and defendants are entitled
 to appeal the court's judgments. Charges are brought by military prosecutors, and
 suspects are entitled to counsel. Lesser offenses are tried before single-judge courts.
 The Court of Military Appeals may accept appeals of decisions by the military courts
 based on the law applied in the case, the sentence imposed, or both. The right of
 
 
 1024
 appeal does not apply in all cases, and appeals sometimes require court permission.
 In practice, it is extremely rare for Palestinians tried for security offenses to be ac-
 quitted, though their sentences sometimes are reduced through the a ppeal process.
 Trials are routinely delayed for a variety of reasons: witnesses (including Israeli
 military or police officers) do not appear, the defendant is not brought to court; files
 are lost; or attorneys fail to appear. These delays create an additional source of
 pressure on the defendant to plead guilty to avoid serving a period of pretrial deten-
 tion which would exceed the sentence likely to apply as the result of a plea bargain.
 In cases involving minor offenses, such as stone throwing, a "quick trial" may be
 held, in which a charge sheet is drawn up within 48 hours and a court hearing
 scheduled within days. In October the IDF reported that approximately 60 percent
 of detainees had finished their trials and were serving sentences, the same percent-
 age as in 1991.
 By law, military trials are public, although access is limited. According to Israeli
 officials, exceptions are rare. Consular officers are allowed to attend military court
 proceedings involving foreign citizens, but there have been delays in gaining admis-
 sion.
 Most convictions in military courts are based solely on confessions, though Israeli
 authorities say that some additional corroborating evidence (such as having the ac-
 cused reenact the offense) is required. Physical and psychological pressures (see Sec-
 tion 1.c.) and the probability of reduced sentences for those who confess contribute
 to the likelihood that security detainees will sign confessions. Confessions are usu-
 ally recorded in Hebrew, the court language of record, which many defendants can-
 not read. Israeli authorities say that confessions are taken and repeated to the de-
 fendant in Arabic, and defendants are encouraged to write confessions in Arabic,
 even though they usually are recorded in Hebrew; they note that Israeli court per-
 sonnel often speak Arabic but cannot write it.
 Crowded facilities and poor arrangements for attorney-client consultations in pris-
 ons hinder effective legal defense efforts. Palestinian attorneys report that appoint-
 ments to see clients are difficult to arrange, and that prison authorities often fail
 to produce clients as arranged, resulting in delayed consultations. In addition, pris-
 on authorities often limit the time available to meet with clients.
 Israeli authorities in 1992 passed military order 1369, allowing them to sentence
 to 7 years' imprisonment any person who does not respond to a special summons
 which is delivered to him or to a family member or is posted in the Civil Adminis-
 tration office nearest his home address. The special summonses are typically issued
 to Palestinians wanted by the authorities for serious security offenses.
 Israeli settlers in the occupied territories accused of security and ordinary crimi-
 nal offenses are tried in the nearest Israeli district court under Israeli law. Civilian
 judges preside over these courts, and standards of due process and admissibility of
 evidence are not governed by military occupation law. Settlers convicted in Israeli
 courts of crimes against Palestinians regularly receive lighter punishment than Pal-
 estinians convicted of comparable crimes against either Israelis or other Palestin-
 ians.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Military
 authorities in the occupied territories have the authority to enter private Palestin-
 ian homes and institutions, including hospitals, without a warrant on security
 grounds. However, authorization by an officer of the rank of lieutenant colonel is
 required before entry. Forced entries are used in IDF operations and are sometimes
 accompanied by beatings and destruction of property, including foodstuffs. Under-
 cover units (see Section 2.a.) have occasionally engaged in destructive and violent
 behavior during searches, as well as harassment of families of wanted Palestinians.
 Israeli authorities state that forced entry may lawfully occur only incident to arrest
 when entry is resisted and that beatings and arbitrary destruction of property dur-
 ing searches are punishable violations of military regulations. Government officials
 acknowledge that damage may result at times from the units' activities; 15 allega-
 tions about such behavior were reportedly filed in 1992 with the Judge Advocate
 General's office and are in various stages of investigation. Government officials say
 that, in cases in which there is evidence that damage was done illegally or was "un-
 reasonable," Palestinians are entitled to file claims for compensation.
 As of December 15, the security authorities had demolished 12 and sealed 33
 houses for security reasons, a decline from the 55 homes demolished and 62 sealed
 in 1991. Security forces may demolish or seal the home of a suspect, whether he
 is the owner or only a tenant, before any trial is held. The fmal decision to seal
 or demolish a house is made by a number of high-level Israeli military officials, in-
 cluding the coordinator of the Civil Administration. The Minister of Defense must
 review the decision, although his signature need not appear on the final notice. Is-
 raeli authorities assert that they demolish or seal only rooms or houses occupied by
 
 
 1025
 
 Palestinians known to have actively participated in a murder or caused serious
 hymical in*ury, though the accused generally does not own the property. Owners of
 ouses orered to be demolished have 48 hours to appeal to the regional IDF com-
 mander and final appeals may be made to the Supreme Court. A successful appeal
 generally results in convertin~ a demolition order to sealing. When a house is de-
 molished, the Israeli authorities confiscate the land on which it sits and the house
 owner is not allowed to rebuild or even remove the rubble.
 Israeli authorities say there is a formal procedure whereby owners may apply to
 regional military commanders for permits to rebuild or unseal, but this is rarely
 done. In September the Government permitted several dozen buildings in the West
 Bank to be unsealed, all of which had been sealed for at least 6 years.
 The security services sometimes monitor mail and televone conversations. The
 authorities sometimes interrupt telephone service to specific areas.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarion Law in Internal Con-
 flict.-Even though throughout most of the year the number of large-sal dem-
 onstrations declined and the Government relaxed some restrictions, casualties at-
 tributed to the IDF's use of force rose in 1992. IDF regulations permit using live
 ammunition only when soldiers' lives are in real and immediate danger, to halt flee-
 i.n suspects, or to disperse a violent demonstration. According to  DF plicy after
 ring a warning shot, soldiers are to direct fire at the legs only and at a fleeing
 suspect only if they suspect a serious felony and have exhausted other means of ap-
 prehending the suspect. In practice, however, uniformed soldiers, police, and under-
 cover units used live fire in cases other than those described above (see Section L.a.)
 and often shot suspects in the upper body and head. Uniformed soldiers, police, and
 undercover units also injured many bystanders, including children, by live fire, rub-
 ber bullets, or beatings, while pursuing suspects.
 Estimates vary of the number of casuarties from violence in the occupied terri-
 tories. Figures compiled from press, Palestinian, international organization, and Is-
 raeli government sources indicate that, as of December 31, security forces had killed
 a total of 158 Palestinians, compared to 98 in 1991. Estimates of the numbers of
 Palestinians wounded during the same period vary from 1,914 to several thousand.
 Palestinians had killed 23 Israeli soldiers and civilians in 1992, and estimates of
 the number of Israelis wounded ranged from 322 to 700.
 On a number of occasions Israeli security forces forcibly removed from hospitals
 Palestinian suspects undergoing medical treatment or prohibited Palestinians need-
 ing medical care from crossing roadblocks or going out during curfews in order to
 obtain medical attention.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The authorities impose some restrictions on
 freedom of speech. The display of Palestinian political symbols, such as flags, na-
 tional colors, and graffiti, for example, is punishable by stiff fines (usually $150-
 300 for graffiti), or imprisonment. Security forces often force Palestinians to erase
 graffiti lound on their property, regardless of whether they are responsible for it.
 Israeli authorities prohibit public expressions of support for the Palestinian Libera-
 tion Organization (PLO), its component factions, Muslim extremist groups (such as
 Haas), and other banned organizations.
 East Jerusalem is an active center of Arabic publication, including newspapers.
 There is only one weekly paper published elsewhere in the West Bank or Gaza, al-
 though Jerusalem papers are distributed there.
 The Israeli authorities impose restrictions on the Arabic press, citing security rea-
 sons. Publications in East Jerusalem must submit to the military authorities for
 prior censorship all copy relating to the security, public order, and safety of Israel
 and the occupied territories. Many reports and editorials related to the uprising and
 Palestinian political goals were permitted, but articles and editorials were routinely
 expurgated. Arabic translations of news stories related to the uprising, which had
 previously appeared in the Hebrew-language press, were routinely censored from
 the Arabic press.         -,
 Israeli authorities permitted the Palestinian press service to resume its daily fac-
 simile report in September but closed one press office, Asee, in Jerusalem in Octo-
 ber. In Ma Israeli authorities took away the license of the East Jerusalem periodi-
 cal Al-Till AI-Arabi due to alleged ties with the PLO. As of October 1, Israeli au-
 thorities had arrested or detained at least 22 Palestinian journalists on security
 charges, such as filming in a closed military area.
 A permit is required for publications imported intothe occupied territories. Im-
 ported materials may be censored or banned for anti-Semitic or anti-Israei, content
 or support for Palestinian nationalism. Possession of banned materials, such as up-
 rising leaflets, is punishable by fine and imprisonment. The IDF periodically de-
 
 
 1026
 clared all or parts of the West Bank and Gaza closed military areas, one primary
 effect of which was to exclude journalists, except under military escort. Foreign jour-
 nalists' reports are subject to censorship under a system of self-regulation.
 No broadcast media originate from the occupied territories. The authorities have
 jammed radio broadcasts considered inflammatory from neighboring countries, but
 Jordanian radio and television is broadcast throughout Israe[and the occupied terri-
 tories.
 In April Israeli authorities permitted the reopening of Bir Zeit University, the last
 Palestinian university to remain closed by military order as of the beginning of
 1992. The Arab Studies Society reopened in late July after a 4-year closure. Second-
 ary and elementary school closings in the 1991-1992 academic year varied greatly
 fromregion to region but on the average were less frequent in the West Bank and
 about the same in Gaza compared to the previous year. Israeli authorities continued
 to close individual schools for short periods, citing security problems emanating
 from the schools. In addition, strike days called by Palestinian activists caused stu-
 dents to lose an average of 2 or 3 days per month.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembi and Assoeiation.-Militarv orders ban public
 gatherings of 10 or more people without a permit. Political parties and other groups,
 including some labor unions viewed as political, are banned. Private organizations
 must be registered, though some operate without licenses. Israeli authorities per-
 mitted Palestinian charitable, community, professional, and self-help organizations
 to operate unless their activities were viewed as overtly political or supporting the
 uprising. In the second half of 1992 the Israeli authorities were more lenient in en-
 forcing some of the restrictions on Plestinian contacts with the PLO and permitted
 many public gatherings to discuss the peace process.
 c. Freedom of ReLiion.-Freedom of religion is respected in the occupied teri-
 tries, and no grup or sect is banned on religious grounds. Muslim and-Christian
 holy days are observed, as are Jewish holy days in Jerusalem and the settlements.
 All faiths operate schools and institutions. Religious publications circulate subject
 to the laws on publications desribed in Section 2.a. Authorities periodically re-
 stricted access to the Haram AI-Sharif in Jerusalem (which houses the Dome of the
 Rock and the AI-Aqsa mosques) by male worshipers under a certain age for security
 reasons.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Occupied Territories, Foreign Travel, Emigra-
 tion, and Repatriation.-Security measures ado pted in 1991 continued to hinder se-
 riously Palestinians' freedom of movement inside the occupied territories. Any Pal-
 estinian wishing to enter Jerusalem or Israel is required to obtain a special permit
 the Civil Administration issues. Gazans must have a permit to travel to Jerusalem
 and the West Bank. Any Arab resident of the territories found without such a per-
 mit is subject to a fine (usually about $160) or arrest. Because most main roads pass
 through Jerusalem, the permit system effectively divided the West Bank into two
 parts, with the result that Paestinians from the north could not travel to the south
 without special permission. and vice versa. Permits to enter Jerusalem were valid
 for periods varying from a few hours to 3 months, and were denied for a variety
 of reasons including security concerns and nonpayment of taxes. Similar restrictions
 were not applied to Jewish settlers in the occupied territories. The permit system,
 by inhibiting the free movement of goods and people, contributed to deteriorating
 economic conditions in the occupied territories and disrupted patterns of religious,
 educational (some students experienced problems in traveling to universities), cul-
 tural, and family life.
 Israeli authorities also continued to issue "green" identity cards, identifying the
 bearer as a security risk and precluding travel in or through Jerusalem, as well as
 travel abrad. Green cards generally were valid for 6 months, renewable indefi-
 nitely. Israeli authorities issued over 1,800 green cards between January and Sp
 tembr, some 11,000 were in circulation as of October. The issuance of such cars
 like administrative detention, is a form of punishment without formal charge or
 trial. The Israeli authorities have stated that they consider the issuance of green
 cards a necessary security tool to deter acts of violence by certain persons who have
 spent time in jail or who are considered risks by security officials. Officials assert
 that. there is an appeals prcess once a Palestinian has received a green card. Ac-
 cording to Israeli authorities, 309 appeala against issuance of green cards were
 lodged between June 1 and December 1. Of these, 124 a ppeals were upheld, leading
 to the revocation of the cards and the reissuance of standard identity cards.
 The Israeli authorities continued to impose curfews and military closures as secu-
 rity controls. Curfews were more frequent in villages and refugee camps than in
 urban areas and were imposed less frequently in the West Bank during the second
 half of the year. The nighttime curfew in Gaza, imposed in the early days of the
 intifada, continued to be n effect. In addition, various parts of Gaza were put under
 
 
 1027
 curfew for periods of from 5 to 9 days during the prisoners' strike in October and
 agin during periods of increased violence later in the year. In the first 6 weeks of
 1992, the Ramllah area was under nighttime curfew (following a 24-hour curfew
 during the latter half of December 1991) after the shooting of a settler.
 Such prolonged curfews had a burdensome effect on the population and were criti-
 cized by some human rights groups as a form of collective punishment. These cur-
 fews do not apply to Israeli settlers. Thousands of Palestinians in the occupied terri-
 tories travel abroad each year though Israeli authorities imposed travel restrictions
 on certain political activists. 1n addition, Palestinian men between the ages of 16
 and 35 who cross the bridge to Jordan must remain out of the occupied territories
 for at least 9 months. All Palestinians need permits, which require several clear-
 ances, to travel outside the occupied territories.
 Palestinians with valid permits frequently were turned away from crossing the Al-
 lenby Bridge to Jordan, however, often with the explanation that they did not have
 the required clearances from security or other authorities.
 Obstacles to emigration include difficulties in obtaining a travel permit and the
 fear of losing residency. Israeli authorities sometimes refuse to renew laissez-pass-
 ers of Palestinians from the occupied territories who live or work abroad on the
 grounds that they have abandoned their residence, even though they may not have
 acquired foreign citizenship. Palestinians who obtain foreign citizenship ordinarily
 are not allowed to resume residence in the occupied territories  those who acquire
 the right to reside elsewhere or who remain outside the occupied territories for over
 3 years are often not permitted to resume residence. They are permitted to return
 only as tourists and sometimes are denied entry entirely.
 Most Palestinians who were abroad during the 1967 war (estimated to be one-
 fourth of the Palestinian population at that time) or who have lost their residence
 permits for other reasons are not permitted to return to reside permanently with
 their families. Permanent residency permission is usually denied to foreign-brn
 spouses and children brn in the occupied territories of nonresident mothers, al-
 thoug, they are generally allowed to reside as temporary residents with renewable
 permits.
 Israeli authorities limit family reunification for demographic, political, security
 and economic reasons. Restrictions on residence, tourist visas, reentry, and family
 reunification apply only to Palestinians resident in the occupied territories.
 Israeli authorities say they dealt with 867 family reunification applications be-
 tween January and September, of which they approved 514. According to human
 rights groups, thousands of applications submitted over the years received no re-
 spone. Adjudication of applications is at the discretion of the Civil Administration
 and the Ministry of Interior. Residents may not apply for family reunification while
 their family members are in the occupied territories on visitors' permits. According
 to human rights groups, visitors' permits were extremely difficult to obtain between
 January and June, when the summer visiting season beg an. In November the Is-
 raeli Government confirmed that the Ministry of Defenseh~as approved requests to
 remain in the territories by approximately 1 000 immediate family members
 (spouses and minor children) of Paestinian residents. The family memers will be
 granted temporary residence permits renewable every 6 months. The agreement
 now applies to immediate relatives present in the occupied territories as of August
 31; the agreement does not resolve requests for permanent residency, however, and
 it does not apply to immediate relatives arriving in the territories after August 31.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The people of the occupied territories d not enjoy this right. Israel's Ministry of
 Defense roles the West Bank and Gaza, under occupation, through a military gov-
 ernment and civil administration. The Government of Israel does not recognize the
 right of Palestinians to participate in policy decisions concerning land and resource
 use and planning, taxation, trade, and industry. Negotiations, including the subject
 of elections, between Israelis, and Palestinians are on going for the establishment of
 an interim self-governing authority which would enable Palestinians to have greater
 control over policy decisions. Israeli authorities permit some Palestinian municipali-
 ties, whose town plans they have approved, to issue building permits within their
 boundaries. Municipal elections were last held in 1976 in the eat Bank and under
 British Mandate authority in 1946 in Gaza; Israeli authorities later dismissed most
 of the mayors elected in the 1976 elections and exiled some on security grounds.
 Palestinians appointed by Israel have filled most vacancies.
 Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem are permitted to vote in municipal elec-
 tions but have largely boycotted them. In the at municipal election in 1989, less
 than 5 percent of Jerusalem's Palestinian population votec. No Palestinian resident
 
 
 1028
 of East Jerusalem sits on the city council. East Jerusalem is governed M part Ar
 Israel.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Many local groups--Israeli, Palestinian, and mixed-are concerned with human
 rights. Israeli authorities permit these groups' publications and statements to cir-
 culate in the occupied territories, and they are allowed to hold press conferences.
 Some human rights workers encountered administrative obstacles in 1992, such as
 being denied permits to enter Jerusalem, where their offices are located, or being
 issued green identity cards (see Section 2.d.). One of the authors of a 1991 report
 on electric shock torture, for example, was given a green identity card shortly after
 the report's release and has not been allowed to return to his Jerusalem office since.
 Israel normally permits international human rights groups to visit the occupied
 territories. Israel cooperates with a number of organizations, and officials are gen-
 erally available for meetings on human rights issues. Some of these organizations,
 however, have had their requests for meetings with officials or access to detention
 facilities denied.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Israel has extended Israeli law to govern most activities of Israeli settlers who
 live in the occupied territories; Palestinians live under military occupation law.
 Under the dual system of governance applied to Palestinians and Israelis, Palestin-
 ians are treated less favorably than Israeli settlers on a broad range of issues, in-
 cluding applicability of the right to due process; residency rights; freedom of move-
 ment; sale of crops and goods- water use; land tenure, ownership, and seizure is-
 sues; and access to health nA social services. Offenses against Israelis are inves-
 tigated and prosecuted more vigorously than offenses against Palestinians.
 9me Israeli agriculture and manufacturing are protected against Palestinian
 competition from the territories, whereas all markets in the territories are open to
 Israelis. Any export of goods from the territories requires a permit. A general permit
 was issued for the export of goods into Israel, but an individual permit is required
 for fresh fruit, vegetables, pickled olives, olive oil, almonds, raisins, fruit tree sap-
 lings, gas canisters, and animals.
 Significant disparities exist between the personal income taxes levied on Palestin-
 ians as compared to the taxes levied on Israeli settlers. Despite tax reforms that
 took effect in the occupied territories in January, the minimum taxable income ap-
 plied to Israelis and Palestinians differs markedly: while an Israeli pays no tax if
 his monthly income is below about $1,000, Palestinians pay taxes on any monthly
 income in excess of about $250. Corporate tax breaks avai able to Israelis in the set-
 tlements are not available to Palestinians.
 Palestinian women living under military occupation face similar human rights
 problems as do Palestinian men in their contact with Israeli authorities. Women
 tend to be less frequently involved in clashes with Israeli soldiers than are men,
 and so fewer of them are incarcerated (approximately 70 at the end of 1992). Within
 Palestinian society, there is some discrimination and domestic violence against
 women. Women often work outside the home and are prominent in many profes-
 sions, including medicine, law, and teaching. In 1992 Islamic fundamentalists used
 violence, including torture and killing, against Palestinian women accused of pros-
 titution or collaboration with Israeli authorities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 The applicable sections for West Bank and Gaza Palestinians working in Israel
 are contained in the report for Israel.
 a. The Right of Association.-The labor law in the West Bank is Jordanian Law
 21 of 1960, as amended by military orders. It permits workers to oin unions without
 government authorization. It also permits formation of unions by any group of 20
 or more from the same trade or workplace, with prior government authorization.
 While trade unions are not required under existing labor law in the West Bank to
 be registered, a union that is not registered cannot legally be a party in litigation
 or labor contracts. During 1992, no new unions were registered by the authorities.
 Israeli authorities have registered 32 unions out of approximately 90 unions func-
 tioning in the West Bank.
 The labor law in Gaza is Egyptian Military Order 331, which supplements the
 prior British Mandate labor law and which has been amended by Israeli military
 orders. It allows the organization of unions on a workplace or craft basis; however,
 the Israeli authorities barred unions from operating in Gaza until 1979. Since 1979,
 unions have been permitted to operate under strictly enforced restrictions that,
 among other things, prevent election of new union leaders and opening of branch
 
 
 1029
 offices. Some unions held elections illegally in 1991 and 1992. As a result, only the
 six unions that existed in 1967 function in Gaza; all operate out of one office in
 Gaza city.
 Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem are governed by the same law as workers
 in Israel and are free to establish their own labor unions. The Israeli authorities
 officially bar East Jerusalem unions from joining the West Bank trade union federa-
 tions, though this restriction has not been enforced. Individual Palestinian workers
 in East Jerusalem may belong to both local unions, some of which are affiliated with
 a West Bank federation, and to the Israeli Histadrut labor federation.
 The Israeli authorities occasionally inhibit union activities in the West Bank and
 Gaza, citing poitical and security concerns. The International Labor Organization's
 (IO) Director General's 1992 report notes that "there is considerable and convinc-
 ing evidence of continuing harassment and obstruction of trade unions and their of-
 fic als by the military occupation forces, ranging from arrests and administrative de-
 tention to other more petty forms of harassment such as interrogation, refusal of
 permission to travel abroad, aid the refusal of telephone and fax facilities." How-
 ever, the ILO report noted that raids on trade unions, accompanied by the
 confiscation of files and other assets, were virtually nonexistent.
 An estimated 100,000 West Bank Palestinians, representing a full range of blue-
 collar and white-collar professionals, were members of approximately 90 trade
 unions and professional associations in 1992. The great majority of West Bank
 unions belong to either the General Federation of Trade Unions in the West Bank
 (GFTU) or the General Federation of Trade Unions in the West Bank-Workers'
 Unity Bloc (WUB). The GFTU participates in meetings of the International Confed-
 eration of Arab Trade Unions (ICATU), although it is not formally affiliated. Both
 the GFTU and the WUB have applied for membership in the International Confed-
 eration of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). The West Bank unions are independent of
 the Government of Israel and are not affiliated with the Israeli Histadrut labor fed-
 eration.
 Military Order 826 of 1980, officially applied in the West Bank and unofficially
 in Gaza requires that Palestinian unions present lists of candidates for union office
 to the divil Administration (CIVAD) for approval 30 days before elections. The order
 authorizes the CIVAD to remove from the lists any candidates who have been con-
 victed of a felony, including those sentenced for security-related offenses. Despite
 this restriction, nearly half a dozen West Bank trade unions held elections in 1992
 without reported interference from the Israeli authorities. Preparations for general
 elections of the GFTU got under way during the year, likewise without Israeli inter-
 ference.
 Like all organizations in the occupied territories, Palestinian labor unions are
 subject to disciplinary measures for engaging in political activities. All meetings of
 10 or more non-Israeli citizens in the occupied territories must have prior CIVAD
 approval. During 1992 unions were able to conduct meetings without reported inter-
 fernce. There was no dissolution of unions by administrative or legislative action.
 Strikes are legal, and several took place in various factories and public institu-
 tions in 1992, some as a result of disputes with management or nonpayment of
 wages. No Israeli interference with these strikes was reported.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is pro-
 tected by Jordanian or Egyptian law. The CIVAD does not record collective agree-
 ments because it does not recognize some unions and union leaders. However, most
 union-employer agreements are honored without interference from the authorities;
 approximately 60 are currently in force in the West Bank. According to the ILO Di-
 rector General's report, 7 labor committees consisting of from 3 to 5 members each
 in businesses employing more than 20 worers, have been formed to mediate labor
 grievances. The C enter for Trade Union Rights, headquartered in Bethlehem, is also
 active in conducting labor courses and working with many different trade unions on
 labor-related issues.
 There are no export processing zones in the occupied territories.
 c. Prohibition of Forced oi Compulsory Labor.-There is no forced or compulsory
 labor in the occupied territories.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-A 1978 military order raised the
 minimum working age in the West Bank and Gaza to 14, though this order is not
 effectively enforced, and underage labor is used in the agricultural sector and in
 some West Bank and Gaza factories.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no minimum wage provision in the
 West Bank or Gaza. In the West Bank, Jordanian law allows a maximum workweek
 of 48 hours, except for certain hotel, food service, and cinema employees, whose
 workweek is 54 hours. In Gaza, Israeli authorities amended this law to provide for
 a 45-hour workweek for day laborers and a 40-hour week for salaried employees.
 
 
 1030
 There is no effective enforcement of maximum workweek laws. The Ministry of La-
 bor's Office of Inspection Services is charged with enforcing health and safety stand-
 ards in the West-Bank and Gaza, and claims to have undertaken a small number
 of inspections. Health and safety conditions in some factories do not meet industry
 standards established by international labor union organizations.
