 CYPRUS
 Cyprus has been divided since the Turkish military intervention
 of 1974, following a coup d'etat directed from Greece. Since
 then, the southern part of the Country has been under the
 control of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus, and the
 northern part under an autonomous Turkish Cypriot
 administration supported by the presence of Turkish troops.
 In 1983 that administration proclaimed itself the "Turkish
 Republic of Northern Cyprus," which has been recognized only
 by Turkey.
 The internal political systems of the Republic of Cyprus and
 the Turkish Cypriot administration are democratic and based on
 free elections, and accord basic human rights to their
 populations both in law and in practice.
 Both Cypriot economies are based on free enterprise, private
 initiative, and the right to own property. The economy in the
 south has prospered in recent years, benefiting especially
 from tourism and manufactured exports. The economy in the
 Turkish Cypriot area is closely linked to that of Turkey.
 Conflict between the Greek and Turkish-Cypriot communities
 during the 1963-74 period, Turkish intervention in 1974, and
 the subsequent presence of Turkish troops in the north
 resulted in the uprooting of Greek Cypriots and Turkish
 Cypriots from the northern and southern parts of the island
 respectively, the loss of lives, homes, and livelihoods have
 led to continuing charges of human rights violations.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no political or extrajudicial killings in 1990.
 b. Disappearance
 Therewere no reports of persons abducted, secretly arrested,
 or held in clandestine detention during 1990. However, the
 issue of missing persons remains a source of dispute between
 the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities. A
 tripartite committee on persons missing during the 1963-74
 period, established under the auspices of the U.N. Secretary
 General in 1981, continued its investigations but to date has
 been unable to resolve any cases.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Both the Cyprus Constitution and the basic document governing
 the Turkish Cypriot community specifically prohibit torture.
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment is provided for in law and respected in practice in
 both communities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Laws providing for freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention
 are respected in practice by the Government of Cyprus and
 Turkish Cypriot authorities. Preventive detention is not
 
 
 1118
 
 CYPRUS
 legally authorized, nor has it been reported in practice. No
 No one may be held for more than 1 day for investigation of a
 crime without referral of the case to the courts for extension
 of the period of detention. Most periods of investigative
 detention do not exceed 8 to 10 days before formal charges are
 filed. Attorneys have free access to detainees. No instances
 of exile were reported.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In both parts of Cyprus, fair public trial is provided for in
 law and accorded in practice. The judiciary is independent of
 executive or military control. Defendants have the right to
 be present at their trials, to be represented by counsel (at
 government expense for those who cannot afford one), to
 confront witnesses, and to present evidence in their own
 defense. Cases are generally tried before a judge or panel of
 judges, although a request for a jury trial is usually
 granted. There are no special courts to deal with security or
 political offenses. In the Turkish Cypriot area, civilians
 deemed to have violated military zones are subject to trial in
 a military court. These courts consist of one military and
 two civilian judges and a civilian prosecutor. There are no
 political prisoners in Cyprus.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Both the Cyprus Constitution and the'basic document governing
 the Turkish Cypriot community include provisions protecting
 the individual against arbitrary interference by the
 authorities. A judicial warrant is required, for example, for
 a police official to enter a private residence. Abuses of
 privacy run counter to the democratic traditions of both
 communities. However, Turkish Cypriots continue to complain
 that mail coming through the Republic of Cyprus postal system
 is often delayed, opened, or not delivered.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These rights are provided for by law and are freely practiced
 throughout the island. The press is free and represents the
 entire political spectrum. There is no press censorship.
 Greek Cypriot authorities do, however, exercise monopoly
 control over television, while Turkish Cypriot authorities do
 so over both radio and television. Legislation was passed by
 the Republic of Cyprus in 1986 giving each party represented
 in Parliament a seat on the board controlling the Cyprus
 Broadcasting Corporation. In July 1990, however, the Supreme
 Court ruled this legislation unconstitutional- The Greek
 Cypriot House of Representatives in 19SO adopted a law
 authorizing private broadcasting, and several privately owned
 radio stations have commenced operating. This law is expected
 to end monopoly control over television broadcasting. In
 addition, the proliferation of party and independent
 newspapers in both communities enables ideas and arguments to
 circulate freely. Opposition papers on both sides of the
 island frequently criticize the authorities.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The freedom to associate, organize, and hold meetings is
 protected by law and respected in practice.

 CYPRUS
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is respected in Cyprus. In the south, the
 vast majority of the population is Greek Orthodox; in the
 north, Sunni Muslim. The Greek Orthodox Church in the south
 has the character of a state institution, all the activities
 and holdings of which -are exempt from taxation. Missionaries
 are permitted to proselytize in both communities. Both Greek
 Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot authorities closely monitor
 missionary activities.
 Approximately 100 Turkish Cypriots who still live in the south
 of the island are. allowed to practice their religion freely.
 In the.north, non-Muslims include approximately 700 Greek
 Cypriots, over 300 Christian Maronites, and some foreign
 residents--all of whom are free to practice their religions.
 Persons who conscientiously object to military service on
 religious grounds are required by the Cyprus Government to
 carry out unarmed military service. A bill tabled in the
 House of Representatives in 1988 that would permit alternative
 nonmilitary service for religious objectors has remained
 stalled in committee.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Turkish and Greek Cypriots enjoy general freedom of movement
 within their respective areas. Turkish Cypriot authorities
 regulate travel into and out of the Turkish Cypriot area. In
 general, they have barred Greeks, Greek Cypriots, and
 sometimes third-country nationals with Greek surnames from
 entering the north and Turkish Cypriots from visiting the
 south. The applications of Greek Cypriot residents of
 enclaves in the north to visit the south are usually granted,
 but the applicants must return within a designated period or
 risk losing their right to return, along with their property.
 Foreigners coming from the south must obtain permission to
 enter the north. From March to December the Government of
 Cyprus has effectively barred foreign tourists from ,crossing
 into the north in retaliation for the detention of several
 Greek Cypriot youths by Turkish Cypriot authorities. At the
 same time, it bars entry into the Greek Cypriot area by
 foreigners who enter Cyprus at Turkish Cypriot ports of entry.
 The right to travel abroad and to emigrate is observed,
 although persons facing military service or legal action in
 either part of Cyprus may-not travel without specific
 permission. Turkish Cypriots have difficulty in traveling to
 some countries because travel documents issued by the Turkish
 Cypriot authorities are not widely recognized. Usually in
 such cases, they travel on Turkish passports provided by means
 of a special arrangement with Turkey. Citizens may repatriate
 freely.
 The Government of Cyprus does not accept third-country
 refugees for resettlement in Cyprus on the grounds that it
 already has enough responsibilities in caring for the Greek
 Cypriots displaced after the 1974 Turkish intervention. The
 Greek Cypriot authorities generally endeavor to remove or
 deport all such third-country refugee claimants, preferring
 that they make their claims elsewhere.

 CYPRUS
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Both the Government of Cyprus and the administration of the
 Turkish Cypriot community are democratically elected. In
 their lively multiparty political systems, parties compete for
 popular support actively and without restriction. Suffrage is
 universal, and elections are held by secret ballot. Elections
 for the office of President of the Republic of Cyprus are held
 every 5 years, and for the House of Representatives every 5
 years or less.
 The Turkish Cypriots elect a leader and a representative body
 every 5 years or less. Such elections were held in April and
 May. Opposition parties charged that the Government of Turkey
 exercised undue influence over voting in certain areas, but
 such allegations could not be substantiated. Greek Cypriots
 and Maronites living in the north--the latter having chosen
 before independence in 1960 to be regarded as members of the
 Greek Cypriot community--do not participate in Turkish Cypriot
 elections but elect their own village officials. They are
 eligible to vote in Greek Cypriot elections but must make
 their way to the south in order to exercise that right.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no requests from international human rights
 organizations to investigate human rights conditions in
 Cyprus. Representatives of such human rights organizations
 have access to both the south and the north.
 The question of human rights in Cyprus is closely connected to
 the political differences that divide the two communities.
 Each group continued to blame the other for alleged human
 rights abuses stemming from the events in 1974.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Food, shelter, education, and health care are usually
 available to members of both communities regardless of race,
 religion, ethnic background, or political opinion.
 Nevertheless, there have been complaints that the welfare of
 minorities in the north is impaired by Turkish Cypriot
 restrictions on housing, education, and movement. In the
 summer of 1990, for example, Turkish Cypriot authorities
 attempted to restrict the visits of Greek Cypriot students,
 who were studying in the south, to their parents resident in
 enclaves in the north. Only following U.N. intervention. did
 the Turkish Cypriots relent and permit the students to remain
 with their parents for the full summer recess.
 The Cyprus Red Cross sends supplies weekly to Greek Cypriots
 remaining in the north; this effort is coordinated by the U.N.
 peacekeeping force in Cyprus and financed largely by the
 United States. The U.N. Force in Cyprus monitors the welfare
 of the Greek Cypriots and Maronites in the north, as well as
 that of the Turkish Cypriots in the south.
 Throughout Cyprus, women gener'ally have the same legal status
 as men. In the north, legal provisions requiring equal pay
 for men and women performing the same job are effectively
 enforced. In the south, government workers receive equal pay
 
 
 1121
 CYPRUS
 for equal work, regardless of sex. In October 1989, a law was
 passed requiring equality of pay between men and women working
 in the private sector. It is being implemented gradually.
 Social taboos, traditions, and family honor shroud incidents
 of wife and family abuse on Cyprus. Moreover, it is
 understood that police files on incidents of domestic violence
 are sometimes destroyed under the pretext that these are
 "personal matters." The Crisis Center for Family Violence in
 the south, nevertheless, has indicated that the number of
 reported domestic abuse cases, including wife beating, is on
 the rise. The Crisis Center, as well as several other support
 groups, was established in part to draw public attention to
 this problem and to encourage government action in dealing
 with it.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Trade unions and confederations are free to organize in both
 the north and south. For several years, however, the
 Committee of Experts of the International Labor Organization
 (ILO) has noted that Cypriot labor legislation restricting the
 rights of trade unions to elect their'representatives freely
 is not in full conformity with ILO Convention 87 on freedom of
 association which Cyprus ratified in 1966. At a June 1990
 meeting of the Conference Committee of the ILO, a Cyprus
 government representative stressed that the Industrial
 Relations Code, which governs union rights, is a freely
 concluded agreement between employers and workers,
 countersigned by the Minister of Labor.
 More than 80 percent of Greek Cypriot workers and 40-5U
 percent of Turkish Cypriot workers belong to independent trade
 unions. Union'officials in the north, however, allege that
 the ruling party has tended to exert its influence to split
 the labor movement, especially in the public sector, by
 supporting the establishment of rival unions. In both
 communities, trade unions freely and regularly take stands on
 public policy issues affecting the workers.
 All Cypriot workers have the right to strike. In general,
 strikes are infrequent and usually of short duration. Both
 the Government of Cjprus and the Turkish Cypriot authorities
 have the power to curtail strikes in what they  deem to be
 essential services. In 1989 the ILO Committee of Experts
 noted that "essential services" should be more strictly
 interpreted in-Cyprus as those whose interruptions would
 endanger the life, personal safety, or health of the whole or
 part of the population.
 Unions in both parts of Cyprus freely take part in
 international meetings. Most unions are affiliated either
 with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions or
 with the Communist-controlled World Federation of Trade
 Unions. Labor unions, more than most other organizations on
 Cyprus, attempt to maintain contact and cooperation across the
 dividing line.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collebtively
 Under law and in actual practice, trade unions and
 confederations are free to organize and to bargain collectively
 in both parts of Cyprus. In both the north and the south,
 
 
 1122
 CYPRUS
 parties to a dispute may request mediation by the authorities.
 In both sectors, legislation prohibiting dismissal for
 participation in trade unions is effectively enforced. Small
 export processing zones exist in Larnaca port in the south and
 Famagusta port in the north, but the laws governing working
 conditions and actual practice are uniform throughout the
 country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law, and no
 instances were reported.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Government of Cyprus has set the minimum age of employment
 of children in an "industrial undertaking" at age 16. In the
 north, the age is 15. The law is effectively enforced in both
 sectors by government labor inspectors.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 In the south, minimum wage laws exist for apprentices between
 the ages of 16 and 18. The wage set for this group is equal
 to about $260 per month. Minimum wages for other groups are
 fixed through collective agreement. In the north, the minimum
 wage equals about $135 per month. It is effectively enforced
 but it is not adequate to provide a decent living for workers
 and their families. The Government of Cyprus has set 40 hours
 as the maximum number of hours of work per week except for
 shop workers and drivers, whose legal limit is 42 1/2 hours.
 In the north, the maximum number of hours of work per week in
 the winter is 38, and in the summer 36.
 Although the standards are not equivalent to those in Western
 industrialized countries, occupational safety and health
 regulations are administered effectively in both sectors. In
 the Greek Cypriot sector, an inspector of factories under the
 Ministry of Labor is charged with inspecting and enforcing
 occupational and health safety standards. Complaints are
 received by the inspector based on ILO standards for
 occupational health and safety. Workers who file complaints
 are protected by Cypriot law and the Cypriot court system.
 The Turkish Cypriot system mirrors the Greek Cypriot system.
 An inspector of factories receives and processes complaints,
 and inspects factories and businesses for the purpose of
 ensuring that occupational safety laws are enforced.
