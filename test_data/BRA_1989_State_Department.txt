 BRAZIIL
 Brazil held its first direct presidential election since 1960
 on November 15, 1989, after returning to civilian rule in
 1985. A runoff election took place on December 17 and
 Fernando Collor de Mello won the presidency. Congressional
 elections will take place in October 1990. The present
 Congress, elected directly in 1986 to serve also as a
 Constituent Assembly, finishes its term on February 1, 1991.
 Internal security is provided by federal, state, and local
 police. The armed forces have traditionally considered
 external threats as their principal responsibility, but they
 also have a constitutional responsibility to guarantee law and
 order. They have been deployed internally in cases of threats
 to public order and to protect critical industrial
 installations during strikes and emergency situations. Brazil
 was under military rule from 1964-1984.
 Brazil experienced negative growth of some 2 percent per year
 per capita during 1988 and 1989. The country is marked by a
 wide disparity in income distribution among different income
 segments and geographic regions. It has the eighth-largest
 economy outside the Communist world and an external debt of
 about $115 billion. The Government ended a unilateral
 moratorium on most of its debt service to foreign commercial
 banks in early 1988, but did not make timely payments to
 commercial bank creditors in September 1989.
 The new Constitution of 1988 contains a series of provisions
 designed to increase the protection of human rights in
 Brazil. One is the "writ of injunction," which can be filed
 in court to request enforcement of a constitutional provision
 which has not yet been implemented by legislation. Others
 broaden the protections of individual and collective rights,
 especially in the labor area.
 The principal human rights concerns in Brazil are the
 treatment of Indians, of peasants involved in land disputes,
 and of common criminals. While the number of unauthorized
 homesteadings by the landless increased in 1989, reported
 killings of peasants and union organizers involved in land
 disputes continued to decline. The press frequently reports
 that common criminals in the custody of police are beaten and
 some criminal suspects not in custody are killed by unknown
 assailants. While the statistics of the government and Indian
 organizations show a decline in the number of violent deaths
 of Indians, the number of deaths due to disease reportedly
 increased. Demarcated Indian lands are threatened by
 settlers, miners, and lumber companies. The Constitution
 establishes additional rights and legal protections for
 Brazil's Indians, giving them full legal standing in the
 courts.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Several hundred Brazilians died in 1989 at the hands of
 vigilante groups, in urban gang wars, and in land conflicts.
 Brazilian human rights organizations charge that policemen and
 hired thugs often kill persons suspected of common crimes.

 BIRAZIL~
 The rate of violent crime in Brazil's major urban centers has
 continued to rise, and Rio de Janeiro now has one of the
 highest murder rates in the world. Kidnaping of prominent
 industrialists and innocent bystanders has also risen. The
 growing crime rate has led to a high degree of public
 acquiescence in police brutality against criminal suspects.
 Resources devoted by local and state governments remain
 insufficient to combat the problem.
 Conflicts between rural landholders and the landless continued
 in 1989. Many organizations involved in the landless movement
 attribute the large number of illegal peasant takeovers of
 land this year to a reported slowdown in land distribution
 efforts by the Brazilian Government during 1989. Most of the
 people killed in land conflicts were rural laborers or
 squatters in the northeast, the south, and the intbrior.
 Although there were fewer killings in land conflicts in 1989,'
 they attracted considerable publicity because the victims
 included rural labor leaders, lawyers, clergy and journalists
 helping to organize agricultural worker unions. According to
 the Pastoral Land Commission (CPT) of the National Conference
 of Brazilian Bishops, there was a 63 percent decrease in the
 number of killings compared to 1988. However, officials of
 the National Confederation of Agricultural Workers and the CPT
 expressed concern that growing assertiveness by rural workers
 will lead to further violence. They noted that confrontations
 have become more frequent in Pernambuco, Maranhao, Rio Grande
 do Sul and Santa Catarina, where rural unions are best
 organized and most active.
 Several prominent labor leaders were killed in 1989. Jose
 Mariano Dias, the president of the Rural Workers Union of
 Ribeirao, Pernambuco, was murdered in June after investigating
 a sugar mill for possible labor code violations. Verino
 Sossai, leader in the Sole Labor Central (CUT), was murdered
 in July after his involvement in a land "invasion."
 Journalist Rubens de Vabo, a leader in the landless movement,
 was killed'in western Rio de Janeiro state in September. In
 Itaituba, Para state, city councilman Raimundo Silva de Sousa
 was murdered on July 26, as was Socialist Party leader Jose
 Marciao Ferreira on November 23. The CPT estimates that in
 the first half of 1989 an estimated 27 people died in
 land-related conflicts. As in recent years, less than 10
 percent of the victims were landholders and, according to CPT,
 in 1989 there seems to have been an increase in the number of
 hired gunmen (working for landowners) who themselves were
 killed.
 Shootings, beatings, and death threats against advocates for
 the landless are also common. A CPT lawyer, Antonio Eder John
 de Souza, for example, was shot and injured in Manaus in
 March. Clergy involved in the landless movement and reporters
 who follow the stories routinely receive death threats.
 Federal and state authorities have expressed serious concern
 over the violence, but the national Government asserts that it
 does not have the legal authority to intervene unless asked to
 do so by a state government. State governments tend to
 neglect the issue until forced to respond to a land
 "invasion." The number of convictions for these murders and
 other crimes remains minimal, although the persons accused of
 murdering Francisco "Chico" Mendes Filho in 1988 for his
 efforts to preserve the Amazon rain forest were indicted in
 1989.
 Brazilian human rights organizations charge that federal,
 state, and local authorities have failed to take legal action
 
 
 486
 BRAZIlL
 against those responsible for such killings. These groups
 charge that police often fail to conduct complete
 investigations and frequently cooperate with either the hired
 gunmen themselves or their employers. Officials at the CPT
 estimate that, of more than 1,200 murders in recent years,
 fewer than 40 have resulted in convictions.
 While many urban murders result from narcotics gang wars,
 there are reports also of widespread killings of alleged or
 suspected criminals by unidentified vigilante groups. Often
 the corpses showed signs of torture or brutality. Vigilante
 groups tend to operate in working-class neighborhoods and in
 the shantytowns ("favelas"). The killings are viewed by some
 as the actions of hired thugs or policemen employed by
 shopkeepers who have either been robbed or are taking
 preventive action. These vigilante actions were cited as a
 major problem by Amnesty International and by most human
 rights groups in Brazil. Investigations into these incidents
 are hampered because witnesses hesitate to cooperate with
 authorities for fear of retribution or because they sympathize
 with the actions of vigilantes.
 On December 28, 1988, journalist Luis Otavio Monteiro was
 murdered in Manaus by a vigilante group apparently linked to
 or made up of local police, reportedly because of his
 investigation of the police role in local robberies. In
 March, Luis Tenderini, president of the Commission for Justice
 and Peace of the Archdiocese of Olinda and Recife, was
 kidnaped and tortured.
 According to human rights groups, the police use scarce
 resources for what they consider important cases, i.e., cases
 involving middle or upper class victims. It is also widely
 assumed by human rights groups in Brazil--given the slow
 nature of Brazilian justice, the frequpncy of escape of
 criminals from inadequate prisons, and the absence of a death
 penalty in Brazil--that the police commonly take justice into
 their own hands, including revenge for the killing of police.
 In the first 9 months of 1989, 32 Rio de Janeiro state
 uniformed policemen were killed in the line of duty. Police
 in major'cities are frequently accused of the deaths of
 innocent persons in the course of. conducting their operations,
 especially when raiding the shantytowns in search of narcotics
 traffickers or assailants.
 In the cities of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo there are
 indications that the situation with regard to vigilante group
 activities improved somewhat. Through October 1989 there were
 63 investigations initiated by the Commission of Inquiry on
 Death Squads in Rio de Janeiro. Of these, 18 were completed
 and three resulted in guilty findings. In Sao Paulo, police
 sources reported that 63 police and 450 civilians died
 violently this year, a slight increase over the figure for
 1988. These sources attributed the increase in deaths to the
 addition of 12,000 police, which increased the possibility of
 a confrontation between police and suspects. There were 208
 police disciplined for corruption and unjustified violence,
 including unjustified killings. Of the 208, 170 were expelled
 from the force and some face prosecution. In Sao Paulo, some
 human rights groups praised the current Sao Paulo
 administration for vigorously investigating and pressing
 charges against police and vigilante groups suspected of
 killings. Human rights groups reported that government
 reformers confront many obstacles in their efforts to contain
 these killings, including lack of support by the general
 
 
 487
 public, which is more concerned with high crime rates, and
 opposition among professional levels of the uniformed police.
 (Because the uniformed state police investigate alleged abuses
 by its own officers, many instances of unjustified use of
 lethal force by police go unreported and unpunished, according
 to human rights sources.)
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated abductions in
 1989.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by the Constitution, which strengthens
 the legal penalties for torture and acquiescence in torture.
 There continue to be many credible reports, however, that
 police beatings and torture of poor prisoners and landless
 peasants are widespread. These acts are intended to extract
 information, confessions, or money from criminal suspects, and
 sometimes to administer punishment. Human rights groups in
 Rio de Janeiro and southern Brazil note a continued reduction
 in reports of police brutality. They attribute the apparent
 trend to the promulgation of the new Constitution.
 In cases where police officers have been brought to trial for
 abuse, there have been few convictions. Human rights
 organizations find little public support for defending the
 rights of alleged criminal offenders. Public criticism of the
 police is directed not at the abuse of persons in detention
 nor at the dismal prison conditions, but rather at the lack of
 effective crime control.
 Most prison facilities are poorly maintained. In April,
 Americas Watch (AW) published a report entitled "Prison
 Conditions in Brazil." The report cited severe overcrowding,
 with only half the necessary prison spaces needed for Brazil's
 inmate population, and noted that many prisoners were being
 kept longer than their sentences due to poor record keeping.
 AW found that many long-term prisoners were held in short-term
 detention facilities because of lack of space. The report
 cited testimony that the "parrot's perch"--a bar on which a
 prisoner is suspended from the back of his knees, with his
 hands tied in front of his legs--continues to exist, as does
 beating of prisoners by guards. Poor prison conditions in
 Brazil were given international publicity in February when 51
 naked men were forced into a 5- by 10-foot room, causing 18 of
 them to die of suffocation. The three police officials
 believed responsible for the deaths were transferred to
 administrative positions pending trial. The detention
 facility where the incident occurred was closed and the
 surviving prisoners were moved to other jails or prisons.
 Partly as a result of poor security conditions and
 overcrowding in Brazilian jails, there are periodic outbreaks
 of violence and riots. In November 1989, in the Piraqura
 state penitentiary in Parana, prisoners took 40 hostages.
 This led to the killing of 10 prisoners and 1 hostage. A few
 days later, five inmates died in Rio de Janeiro's Evaristodo
 Morais prison uprising.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution limits arrests to those caught committing a
 crime or those arrested by order of a judicial authority. In
 
 
 488
 addition, soldiers charged with violating military rules and
 regulations, or with military crimes as defined by law, may be
 arrested. The constitutional provision for judicial
 determination of the legality of detention is respected.
 Legally, a person may not be arbitrarily detained, but the law
 does permit provisional detention in exceptional circumstances
 when ordered by a judge. Detention also may be ordered by a
 court during a police investigation or the prosecution phase
 and can be extended until the case comes to trial or until a
 judge rules that reasons for the detention no longer exist.
 Provisional detention in Brazil is used infrequently. In
 1989, however, there were several cases of illegal and
 incommunicado detention without a judicial order, as well as
 allegaions of arbitrary detention of squatters during
 evictions. Human rights groups charge that police detain
 people for questioning without probable cause, in some cases
 based on race or other questionable motives.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is an independent branch of government. The
 federal judicial system, with the Federal Supreme Court at its
 apex, includes courts of first instance and appeals courts.
 The states organize their own judicial systems, so long as
 they do not violate basic principles in the federal
 Constitution. Brazil also has a system of specialized courts
 dealing with military, .labor, electoral, and juvenile matters,
 among others. A system of small claims courts has been
 created by the new Constitution. Under the Constitution,
 military courts no longer have jurisdiction to hear cases
 against civilians.
 The right to a fair public trial is provided for by law and is
 generally respected in practice. Defendants are entitled to
 counsel and must be made fully aware of the charges against
 them. In cases where a defendant cannot afford an attorney,
 one must be provided free of charge; private attorneys are
 appointed by courts to represent poor defendants where public
 defenders are unavailable. The state of Rio de Janeiro
 recently established a special group of public defenders on
 continuous duty to serve newly arrested defendants.
 Defendants and their attorneys have the right to be informed
 of the evidence on which charges are based. Only cases of
 willful crimes against life are tried by jury; all others are
 tried by a judge. The judicial system has a serious backlog,
 and many cases may not be tried for months.
 Lynchings of suspected criminals by irate citizens attracted
 press coverage in 1989, and several human rights sources
 believe the number of lynchings was higher this year than in
 1988--14 occurred in a 2-month period in the spring.
 Lynchings.arise out of public rage against rising crime and a
 feeling that the judicial system cannot be counted on to mete
 out justice.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for freedom from arbitrary intrusion
 into the home. There have been no reports of illegal entry
 for political reasons. However, entry into homes without a
 warrant occurs in searches for criminal suspects.
 
 
 489
 BAZIL
 The new Constitution provides the right for a person to file a
 "habeas data" writ in court, at no financial cost, to obtain
 information about himself in the possession of Brazilian
 authorities. This writ may also be used to request the
 correction of inaccurate data about the citizen which may be
 in government files.
 Wiretaps are unconstitutional except for purposes of criminal
 investigation and prosecution when authorized by a judicial
 authority in circumstances defined by law. The inviolability
 of private correspondence is respected.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The right to free speech and to a free press is provided for
 in the Constitution and is broadly exercised. The press and
 broadcast media routinely discuss controversial social and
 political issues. Opposition viewpoints are aired freely.
 Most radio and television stations are privately owned, but
 the Government controls licensing authority. Newspapers are
 also privately owned and are vigorous in reporting and
 commenting on government policies and performance. Some media
 sources privately charge that self-censorship is widely
 exercised by many media organizations to avoid offending major
 governmental advertisers and creditors, including federal,
 state, and local governments and government-influenced banks.
 Foreign publications are widely distributed in Brazil. The
 new Constitution abolished all forms of censorship. Prior
 review of films, plays, and radio and television programming
 is practiced only to.determine the acceptable viewing age.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the right to assemble
 peacefully. Permits are not required for outdoor political or
 labor meetings, but such assemblies may not disturb another
 meeting previously scheduled for the same place, and prior
 written notification to government authorities is required.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no favored or state religion. I-ost Brazilians belong
 to the Roman Catholic Church, which maintains an active social
 and pastoral program. Spiritism has many adherents, and
 Protestantism has been expanding in recent years. All faiths
 are free to establish places of worship, train clergy, and
 proselytize, although the Government reserves the right to
 decide who may enter Indian lands. The National Council of
 Brazilian Bishops and other missionary groups continue to
 complain that visas for missionaries and other foreign
 religious personnel are systematically delayed by immigration
 authorities. In 1989 there were no expulsions of missionaries
 or other religious denominations by the Federal Government
 from the areas in or near Indian communities. In 1989
 Catarimani, a Catholic missionary group, was allowed to return
 to the Yanomami Reservation from which it was expelled in 1988.
 
 
 490
 BRAZIL
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within Brazil, nor are
 there any restrictions on emigration or return. Brazil admits
 few immigrants, does not formally accept refugees for
 resettlement, and is selective in granting asylum.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Constitution provides for the right of citizens to change
 their government through free elections; the November 15
 election confirmed that this right exists in practice. On
 that day, Brazil completed its democratic transition and held
 its first direct presidential election since 1960. After a
 runoff election on December 17, Fernando Collor de Mello was
 declared the winner by the Supreme Election Tribunal in an
 election that was singularly free and fair. Brazil had
 returned to democratic rule in March 1985, with the
 inauguration of a civilian president after 21 years of
 military governments. During the last few years, executive
 and legislative offices throughout the country at local,
 state, and national levels have all been filled through fair
 and democratic direct elections among candidates representing
 as many as 38 separate political parties.
 Voting is secret and mandatory for all literate Brazilian
 citizens aged 18 to 70 except military conscripts who may not
 vote. It is voluntary for minors aged 16 to 17, for the
 illiterate, and for those over age 70. Women have full
 political rights under the Constitution, and they are
 increasingly active in politics and government. Indians were
 also given the franchise under the 1988 Constitution.
 When one of the political parties which was in opposition to
 the military regime came to power in 1985 through a vote of
 the electoral college, it was viewed as a major test of the
 ability of the citizenry to change its government. Most
 Brazilians believe that the true test of the transition to
 full democracy were the free popular presidential elections
 held in 1989. The armed forces retain significant influence
 in the Government, but the military establishment is
 respecting its limited role under the new Constitution.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Many local human rights groups cite the importance of the 1988
 Constitution and the discussion preceding it in making
 Brazilians more aware of their civic, political, and social
 rights, and more sensitive to cases of human rights
 violations. Brazil is a member of the United Nations Human
 Rights Commission. A number of Brazilian nongovernmental
 organizati6ns (NGO's) actively investigate allegations of
 human rights violations and often initiate legal proceedings.
 Several international NGO's either maintain offices in Brazil
 or visit periodically. None of these organizations has
 complained of government interference in its activities.
 Brazilian human rights groups previously concerned with
 political repression have turned their attention to problems
 involving Indians,. police mistreatment of suspected criminals,
 poor prison conditions, urban vigilante groups, and rural
 violence.
 
 
 491
 BRAZIL
 Since 1985 a federal prosecutor in each state has been
 designated to monitor and assist in identifying human rights
 violations, and many states have established their own
 Councils for the Defense of Human Rights.
 Both Brazilian and foreign human rights organizations assert
 that elements of the Federal Government have been fairly
 responsive to human rights investigations, as have some state
 governments. State and federal police officials have accused
 the CPT of collaborating in illegal land invasions.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination on the basis of sex, race, religion, and
 nationalify is unconstitutional, and racial discrimination
 --illegal since 1951--is a crime excluded from bail. Brazil
 is a multiracial society with a high degree of racial
 tolerance. Public opinion polls, however, show most
 Brazilians believe that poor and uneducated darker-skinned
 Brazilians encounter substantial de facto discrimination. The
 vast majority of the black population is disproportionately
 concentrated in the lowest economic strata, a reflection of
 history and cultural attitudes. For example, while 40 to 60
 percent of Brazil's population is of African or other
 non-European ancestry, few senior officials in the Government
 or armed forces are black. In early 1988, the media reported
 that the Foreign Ministry had hired its first black career
 foreign service officer. Black consciousness organizations,
 generally lacking in political influence, challenge the view
 that Brazil is a "racial democracy" and denounce
 discrimination in housing, education, the workplace, and
 society at large. These organizations complain that blacks
 are more inclined to be stopped by police and deprived of
 their civil rights, and that they bear the brunt of police
 brutality.
 One year after the 1988 centennial of Brazil's abolition of
 slavery, black consciousness organizations have not been able
 to sustain broad public interest in discrimination. However,
 black rights activists believe the attention given to racial
 discrimination in the Constitution has served to improve the
 awareness of blackscivil and political rights. Recently,
 there have been signs that the situation is improving. In
 Porto Alegre, a large department store was closed temporarily
 in November under a municipal anti-discrimination ordinance
 when an elderly black man suspected of shoplifting was
 detained and verbally abused. In the city of Sao Paulo, a man
 was arrested and jailed for verbally harassing a young black
 student and spraying her with a hose.
 The 1988 Constituti6n specifically addresses the question of
 women's rights, prohibiting discrimination in employment or
 salaries as well as guaranteeing 120 days of paid maternity
 leave. As a reaction against the new maternity leave law,
 some employers reportedly seek sterilization certificates from
 prospective employees or try to fire women in their
 childbearing years.
 There is a high incidence of physical abuse of women in
 Brazil, principally but not exclusively among the lower
 classes. Women are killed and assaulted with virtual impunity
 in crimes of passion, where traditionally a man's "honor"
 takes precedence. However, men who-commit crimes against
 women are beginning to be brought to trial, albeit in small
 
 
 492
 BREAZIL
 numbers. In 1989 a man in Sao Paulo was convicted of sexual
 harassment of a woman. Officials note that women are
 increasingly sensitized to the problem and are more willing to
 make official complaints. Concern over abuse of women led to
 the opening of special women's police precincts in more than
 12 major cities. These centers provide shelter, assist in
 bringing actions against aggressors, and provide general
 information on women's health. Women's organizations have
 been active in promoting women's rights and lobbying the
 Government. Women's groups have also been active in politics,
 holding seminars and forums to inform women voters; one
 nationally televised presidential candidates' debate dealt
 exclusively with women's issues.
 The country's estimated 220,000 Indians suffer from higher
 levels of disease and infant mortality than other Brazilians
 and from the impact of greater contact with non-Indians as
 Brazil's internal frontier expands. Despite the Government's
 responsibility under the Constitution and the 1973 Indian
 Statute to protect the indigenous population, Indians continue
 to receive inadequate assistance. According to a June 1989
 report prepared by a citizens' action committee made up of
 members of Congress, attorneys, and human rights activists,
 several tribes lost half their population in the last decade
 due to disease and other factors associated with the
 colonization of nearby lands and the influx of miners and
 lumber companies.
 In 1989 the situation of some of Brazil's Indian tribes
 deteriorated, partly as a result of the Federal Government's
 decisions and actions. Following an August 1987 shooting
 incident in which four Yanomami Indians were killed by
 prospectors, the Federal Government declared that all
 outsiders would be removed from the Yanomami area, which
 contains 9,000 Indians. The outsiders who were forcibly
 expelled included anthropologists, missionaries, doctors, and
 nurses, while up to an estimated 50,000 prospectors remained
 in the area throughout 1989. With one exception, the medical
 teams have not been allowed to return. Indirect evidence
 suggests that, as a direct consequence of the prospector
 influx, the number of Yanomami who died from mercury poisoning
 or in epidemics of infectious diseases increased in 1989.
 According to the Committee for the Creation of Yanomami Park,
 it is likely that several hundred Yanomami died in 1989 due to
 these factors.
 In 1989 violence associated with land disputes between
 isolated tribes and non-Indian settlers increased. According
 to the citizen's action committee's June 1989 report cited
 above, three Yanomami were injured in January by miners who
 invaded their lands; in February a policeman entered the
 Maxcuxi area in the State of Roraima, burned down houses and
 arrested five people illegally; and in April four Indians were
 injured in a land dispute in the national Xingu Park. The
 same report states that in May, police entered the same
 Maxcuxi village in Roraima and burned down eight homes, the
 church, and the school, and detained 25 men, women, and
 children without charging them. According to the Indigenous
 Missionary Council of the National Conference of Brazilian
 Bishops (CIMI), more Indians have died as a result of attacks
 or of disease in the past 2 years than in the previous decade.
 Indian leaders complain that the Government has systematically
 ignored their needs and promoted settlement or development
 projects at their expense. They claim that many state and
 
 
 493
 BRAZIL
 local governments, for example, have refused to pay the
 salaries of Indian teachers in schools where grade school
 instruction is in their native language. Indian leaders
 charge that the Federal Government has used pressure and legal
 subterfuges to avoid the demarcation of traditional Indian
 lands required under the 1973 Indian Statute and the
 Constitution. They criticize the Federal Government's
 decision to establish national forests on the grounds that
 they are open to colonization and economic exploitation by
 prospectors and other non-Indians. Indian leaders claim that
 the federal and state governments are more concerned about the
 exploitation of mineral and other natural resources than
 attending to the needs and rights of Indians.
 The Constitution includes a chapter on the rights of Indians.
 It guarantees them the exclusive use of the riches existing in
 the soil, rivers, and lakes located on their lands, including
 a share of the proceeds from any exploitation of water,
 mineral, or energy resources found on these lands as
 demarcated by law. Any act which permits the occupation or
 possession of Indian lands by non-Indians, or which. permits
 exploration or exploitation of the natural resources existing
 on them (except when there is relevant public interest, as
 defined by law), will be considered null and void. The
 Federal Government has the responsibility to demarcate and
 protect Indian lands. Such lands cannot be sold, and Indian
 rights over them will not expire under any statute of
 limitations. Indian groups cannot be removed from their lands
 except with Congressional approval, and in cases of force
 majeure their immediate return is statutorily guaranteed as
 soon as feasible. Brazilian Indians now have the authority to
 bring suits in court to defend their rights and interests. In
 all such suits they are to be assisted by a public
 prosecutor. How effectively these provisions will be
 implemented was unclear at year's end.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Brazil's labor code has long provided for union representation
 of all Brazilian workers. The law imposed a hierarchical,
 unitary system known as "Unicidade," which prohibited multiple
 unions of the same professional category in a given geographic
 area. It also stipulated that no union's geographic base
 could be smaller than a "municipality." Workers in a union
 .whose numbers increased (as when an industry grew) could
 petition the state to split a preexisting union into two or
 more unions. Brazil's Constitution retains both "Unicidade"
 and the requirement that no union's geographic base may be
 smaller than a municipality, but it frees workers to organize
 ,new unions out of old ones without prior authorization from
 government authorities. The 1988 Constitution also eliminates
 powers previously granted to the Minister of Labor to
 "intervene" (i.e., depose) a union's independently elected
 representatives and substitute others of the Minister's
 choosing. The Government did not exercise this authority from
 1985 to 1988.
 At its June 1989 meeting, the International Labor
 Organization's (ILO's) Committee on Freedom of Association
 (CFA), considering a complaint by the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), concluded that
 provisions of Brazil's Constitution'providing that no more
 than one union can be formed in any occupational category in
 
 
 494
 any one territory, as well as compulsory union contributions,
 violated Convention 87 on Freedom of Association. The
 Committee asked the Brazilian Government to bring its
 legislation into conformity with the Convention.
 Organized labor actively participated in the drafting and
 approval of the Constitution in 1987-88. Reacting against
 labor code provisions that made most work stoppages "illegal,"
 the unions lobbied successfully for a constitutional guarantee
 of the right to strike. The same meeting of the CFA cited
 above considered two complaints filed by the ICFTU and other
 labor entities alleging the discharge of strikers, and
 government use of the military to suppress strikes resulting
 in death and injury to the strikers. The Committee deplored
 the violence and concluded that the Government's actions did
 not conform with relevant ILO Conventions.
 Complementary legislation passed in June 1989 stipulated that
 essential services remain in operation during a strike, and
 that workers notify employers at least 48 hours before
 beginning a walkout. The Constitution prohibits interference
 and intervention in labor unions by the Government, but
 provides that abuse of the right to strike (such as not
 maintaining essential services or giving advance notice,
 denying workers not on strike access to their jobs, damaging
 property, etc.) will be punished under the law. It also
 incorporates a provision from the labor code which prohibits
 the dismissal of employees who are candidates for union
 leadership positions from the date of the registration of
 candidacy until 1 year after the termination of their
 mandates, if elected, except in the case of serious misdeeds,
 as defined by law.
 The two major labor centrals are the General Workers Central
 (CGT) and the Sole Workers Central (CUT). Until mid-1989, the
 two maintained similar positions regarding international
 affiliation. Provisions in the CGT and CUT founding charters
 mandated cooperation with all international labor
 organizations and affiliation with none. Following an April
 congress, however, new CGT leaders applied for affiliation
 with the ICFTU. In May 1989, the Government designated labor
 delegates to the ILO Conference from both the newly formed
 centrals and the traditional confederations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize is guaranteed by the Constitution, and
 trade unions are legally mandated to represent workers.
 Although Brazilian laws do not make any provision for a
 central labor organization, three such groups have
 emerged--the CGT, CUT, and the Independent Workers Central
 (USI). Communist Party of Brazil officials recently launched
 a "fourth" central, the so called Classist Union Movement
 (Corrente Sindical Classista). To date this organization has
 attracted no unions of significance. The Centrals do not have
 legal standing to represent professional categories of workers
 and have been created in Brazil as nonprofit civil
 associations.
 The Government has encouraged labor and management to resolve
 differences through collective bargaining, which has become
 commonplace. Nevertheless, a system of special labor courts
 continues to exercise normative powers with regard to the
 settlement of labor disputes, thereby discouraging direct
 negotiation. Existing law charges these same courts (as well

 BRAZIL
 as personnel linked to the Federal Labor Ministry) with
 mediation responsibility in preliminary stages of dispute
 settlement. On the other hand, arbitration by neutral,
 professional third parties is unknown.
 Labor law applies uniformly throughout Brazil, including the
 Free Trade Zones and Export Processing Zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 While the Constitution prohibits forced labor, there have been
 repeated charges that it is utilized in Brazil, despite
 federal government assertions that it is taking steps to halt
 the practice and prosecute perpetrators. In 1989, the CPT
 again denounced specific labor contractors in certain
 northeastern and Amazon states for maintaining "slave" work
 forces. The CPT charged that these contractors deducted
 transportation and other inflated expenses from the workers,
 meager salaries and employed armed guards to prevent the
 "indebted" workers from leaving. According to press reports,
 such cases of forced labor typically involve the exploitation
 of vulnerable workers, especially minors or migrants. The CPT
 charges that such work forces are most common deep in the
 Amazon, where jungle areas are being cleared to prepare land
 for agricultural use. The CPT has complained that state and
 federal authorities have not promptly investigated reports of
 the practice of compulsory labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum working age under the Constitution is 14, except
 for apprentices, and legal restrictions have been approved to
 protect working minors under age 18. By law, permission of
 parents or guardians is required for minors to work, and
 provision must be made for them to attend school through the
 primary grades. All minors are barred from night work and
 from work that constitutes a physical strain. Minors are also
 prohibited from employment in unhealthy, dangerous, or morally
 harmful conditions. However, it is estimated that 34 percent
 of all children between the ages of 10 and 14 are economically
 active. Many, perhaps most, of these working minors are
 thought to be working in violation of the law, but accurate
 statistics are not available. Enforcement of the law is
 severely limited because of the lack of resources.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Organized labor demonstrated growing political strength by
 lobbying for and achieving the adoption of significant
 provisions in the Constitution. A workweek limit was set at
 44 hours, pay benefits were expanded, and new protections were
 established for agricultural and domestic workers. Several of
 these advances were conditioned on the passage of
 complementary enabling legislation that proved difficult to
 enact. In June Congress overturned presidential vetoes of
 minimum wage and cost of living adjustment measures. Real
 worker income continued to lag in 1989. It is estimated that
 some 40 percent of those economically active, including
 minors, earned no more than the equivalent of one minimum
 monthly salary of about $80, which is probably not adequate to
 support a family with only one wage earner.
 Brazilian workers also suffer because of the gap between the
 legal assurance and reality of a safe work environment. Labor
 Ministry figures indicate that Brazil ranks first worldwide in
 
 
 496
 BRAZIL
 the number of workplace accidents. According to figures
 gathered by the Government's Social Security system, 17
 workplace-related fatalities occur daily across the country.
 As these figures measure only thdse incidents involving
 covered workers (some 23 million), they undoubtedly understate
 the problem. (The total work force exceeds 50 million.)
 There are no reliable statistics available covering the
 incidence of job-related illness. Unofficial estimates,
 however, link as much as 80 percent of Social Security system
 payments to workplace factors.
