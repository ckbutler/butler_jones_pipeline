 CZECH AND SLOVAK. FEDERAL REPUBLIC
 The Czech and Slovak Federal Republic (CSFR) is ruled by a
 democratically elected government formed after parliamentary
 elections in June 1990. It replabed the Government of National
 Understanding which was installed in December 1989 after
 popular opposition led to the fall of the totalitarian
 Communist regime that had ruled Czechoslovakia since 1948.
 Under the prevailing federal structure--which is emphasized in
 the country's official title-free elections resulting in
 democratic governments were also held for parliaments in the
 CSFR's two constituent republics.
 Under Communist rule, both regular uniformed police and an
 internal security apparatus known as State Security were used
 as instruments to control the population. The democratically
 elected Government undertook steps in 1990 that dismantled
 repressive security organs and brought both uniformed police
 and the security apparatus under its control. The Government
 in 1991 continued with its program to reform police and
 security units, including a reorganization of the Federal
 Ministry of Interior that placed the federal police under the
 direct control of a civilian director. A July I law, codifying
 the activities of the new domestic intelligence and security
 service, the Federal Security and Information Service, grants
 explicit oversight authority to the Federal Assembly. The
 Slovak republic and Czech republic each have their own police
 forces, under directors responsible to the republic interior
 ministers, who are civilians. In accordance with the 1990
 Czechoslovak-U.S.S.R. agreement, all Soviet troops stationed in
 the CSFR were withdrawn by June 30, 1991.
 The year 1991 was a year of economic transition in which the
 Government began the massive privatization of an economy that
 had beeii heavily dominated by state-owned industrial
 enterprises-and by state farms and state-run cooperatives. The
 Federal Government in 1991 continued to implement an economic
 reform program, including price liberalization, the institution
 of internal exchange convertibility, and the elimination of
 most governmental subsidies, designed to transform the formerly
 centrally controlled economy into a market economy. In
 addition, privatization programs were launched to transfer
 ownership of state-owned economic establishments and
 enterprises to private persons and firms. Privatization of
 small firms proceeded smoothly in 1991; privatization of larger
 companies was delayed until early 1992. The restitution of
 property seized by the former Communist government from private
 persons has also begun.
 Following up on the progress made in restoring human rights
 during 1990, the Federal Government took additional steps in
 1991 to guarantee the full spectrum of human rights for its
 citizens. Highlights included the passage of a comprehensive
 constitutional law on Basic rights and freedoms and creation of
 a Constitutional Court with jurisdiction to hear human rights
 cases.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 No political or extrajudicial killings were known to have
 occurred.                                    N

 CZECH AND SLOVAK FEDERAL REPUBLIC
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of abductions, disappearances, secret
 arrests, or clandestine detentions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There was no evidence of such practices.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Czechoslovak law requires arrest warrants issued by the courts,
 except in cases such as hot pursuit. Persons may be held
 without being charged for 24 hours. The arrestee has the right
 to consult with counsel during this period. A person charged
 with a crime has the right to appear before a judge for
 arraignment. If charges are formalized at the arraignment, the
 judge then determines whether the person charged should be kept
 in custody or released pending trial. The law permits a person
 committed to pretrial detention to be held for a period not to
 exceed 1 year. Any person so held appears before a judge
 monthly for a determination of the necessity for continued
 detention. He or she may consult with legal counsel and
 receive regular visits from family members. Procedural
 safeguards related to arrest and detention are observed in
 practice. There is no exile either in law or in practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The court system consists of district courts, regional courts,
 Supreme Courts of the republics, and the Supreme Court of the
 CFSR. The law on judges and the judiciary of July 19
 transformed the judiciary from its former role as an arm of the
 Communist government and party to an independent and impartial
 judiciary. Most judges who served during the Communist regime,
 including virtually all who were involved in political trials,
 have left the profession or been removed.
 Persons charged with criminal offenses are entitled to fair and
 open public trials. They have the right to be informed of the
 charges against them and of their legal rights, to retain and
 consult with counsel of their own choosing or court-appointed
 counsel, and to present a defense. They enjoy a presumption of
 innocence and have the right to refuse to testify against
 themselves. Defendants may appeal any judgment against them.
 These rights are honored in practice.
 In early 1991, the Federal Assembly created a special
 commission to screen federal government officials for past
 collaboration with the secret police during the period of
 Communist rule. It is estimated that hundreds of officials
 resigned as a consequence of the screenings, including members
 of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Ministries and the Federal
 Assembly.
 The screening process was criticized as not providing those
 identified as collaborators with an adequate opportunity to
 review and rebut the evidence against them and not setting up
 an adequate administrative or judicial mechanism whereby
 disputed cases could be heard. The law's defenders argued that
 the removal of collaborators from high governmental positions
 was a political necessity and that archival records identifying
 persons as collaborators were reliable.
 
 
 1087
 CZECH AND SLOVAK FEDERAL REPUBLIC
 A new screening law, passed in the fall of 1991, widened the
 scope of.the screening process by barring many former Communist
 party officials, members of the People's Militia, and secret
 police collaborators from holding a wide range of elective,
 nominative, and. appointive government offices for a period of 5
 years. The law required an applicant for such positions to
 obtain a certificate froi the Federal Interior Ministry showing
 he was not ineligible to serve as a consequence of his past
 association with the specified organizations.. The law provided
 a formal administrative mechanism whereby disputed cases could
 be reviewed; a pardon could be issued in certain cases.
 This second screening law also drew criticism on the grounds
 that it violated Czechoslovak and international legal and human
 rights standards, including prohibition of discrimination in
 employment. Several Czech and Slovak trade unions filed
 complaints before the International Labor Organization (ILO)
 charging that the law violates ILO conventions prohibiting
 discrimination in employment on the basis of political belief.
 The law's defenders, in turn, argued the necessity of excluding
 those closely associated with the Communist past from important
 government positions during the transition period.
 All laws detailing political offenses have been repealed.
 There are no political prisoners.
 -f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Federal Government does not practice extralegal electronic
 surveillance, home searches, the tapping of telephones, and the
 interception of mail. Police may conduct searches of homes
 only with a warrant issued by a court.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is provided for by law and
 respected in practice. Persons are free to'speak out on
 political and other issues and to criticize the Government and
 public figures without fear of harassment and persecution.
 Hundreds of different newspapers, magazines, and journals are
 now published in the CSFR. Most newspapers are organs of
 political parties, but many independent newspapers not
 connected with political organizations have also been
 established. Newspapers, magazines, and journals are free to
 publish what they wish without censorship or fear of government
 reprisal.
 All domestic television broadcasting facilities are government
 owned. A federal channel broadcasts throughout the country,
 while Slovak and Czech channels focus their programming on
 their respective republics. A third government-sponsored
 channel, known as OK-3, broadcasts programs from Western
 sources. The directors of each television channel, who are
 appointed by the Federal Government, have editorial control
 over programming. Government channels during 1991 featured a
 wide range of opinions, including opinions opposing government
 policies.
 The Government also supports radio broadcasting facilities
 whose program content, like that of television, is determined
 by the management of each station. Although most radio
 
 
 1088
 CZECH AND SLOVAK FEDERAL REPUBLIC
 stations are government sponsored, a number of privately owned
 and controlled stations now exist. Radio Free Europe, the
 British Broadcasting Corporation, and Europa 2 also broadcast
 on local frequencies.
 Legislation grants universities the authority to decide their
 internal affairs, including pedagogic and academic orientation
 and internal structure. Academic freedom is guaranteed by law
 and is respected in practice.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right of persons to assemble peacefully is protected by
 law. Permits for some public demonstrations are required by
 law but are routinely granted. In addition, police have not
 interfered with spontaneous peaceful demonstrations for which
 organizers lacked a permit.
 The right of persons to associate freely is also protected by
 law, as is the right of persons to form political parties and
 movements. Certain organizations, such as political parties,
 are required to register, but registration is essentially a
 formality.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Czechoslovakia enjoys religious freedom. There is no official
 religion, and no religion is banned or discouraged by law.
 The Federal Government has returned to religious orders the
 property confiscated from them by the former Communist
 government. During 1991 government and church officials also
 discussed the extent to which other church property confiscated
 by the Communist regime should be returned to church ownership,
 but no final decision concerning disposition of the property
 was made.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on domestic or foreign travel,
 emigration, and repatriation. Passports are freely available
 to all wishing to travel abroad. Czechoslovak citizens who
 emigrated during the period of Communist rule are now free to
 return to visit or live in Czechoslovakia and may regain their
 Czechoslovak citizenship if they desire.
 The Government abides by internationally accepted standards in
 processing requests for refugee status and political asylum. A
 person granted refugee status is given permission to reside in
 Czechoslovakia for a 5-year period. Thereafter, the person may
 be granted Czechoslovak citizenship or have his refugee status
 continued.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens have the right and ability to change their government
 peacefully. All citizens 18 years of age and older may vote in
 national and local elections. Voting is by secret ballot.
 Opposition groups, including political parties, function openly
 and freely participate in the electoral process. The Federal
 Assembly amended the criminal codein December to make the
 spread of fascism and communism punishable with prison terms of
 1 to 5 years. The chairman of the Czechoslovak Supreme Court
 
 
 1089
 CZECH AND SLOVAK FEDERAL REPUBLIC
 maintains'that the law does not affect members of the Communist
 Party of Bohemia and Moravia unless they violate human rights.
 President Havel condemned the amendment and warned against
 efforts to ban the Communist party. The next parliamentary
 elections are expected to be held in June 1992.
 Czechoslovakia-has two major nationalities--Czechs and
 Slovaks. Differences between their political representatives
 were often evident during 1991. The debate generally centered
 on the appropriate division of powers between the federal and
 republic governments and on the appropriate level of
 sovereignty for each. -Much of this debate took place over the*
 content of new republic and federal constitutions, but the
 issue also surfaced in discussions of nearly all other issues.
 The year 1991 ended without new constitutions and with the
 political debate over the future of Slovak-Czech relations
 unresolved.
 There are no restrictions, in law or in practice, on women's
 participation in politics and government.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Local human rights groups which became active during Communist
 rule, such as Charter 77, the Committee for the Defense of the
 Unjustly Persecuted, and the Czechoslovak Helsinki Committee,
 continue to monitor the human rights situation in the country.
 Other groups concerned with human rights, such as the
 organization Human in Slovakia, have been formed since the
 revolution and now also work for human rights in the CSFR.
 Czechoslovakia cooperates with international and domestic
 investigations of alleged violations of human rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Health care, education, retirement, and other social services
 are provided without regard to race,'sex, religion, language,
 or social status. Women are equal under the law and receive
 pay equal to that of male colleagues for the same job.
 However, only relatively small numbers of women are found in
 the higher levels of professional and government employment. A
 few organizations concerned about women's issues have been
 created in the CSFR since the November 1989 revolution, but
 they have tended to focus their attention on issues of
 particular concern to mothers rather than on issues of equality
 in the workplace.
 Violence against women, including wife beating, is generally
 believed by local human rights observers to be uncommon in the
 CSFR. Statistics oh violence against women are not kept.
 Observers believe that some cases of spouse abuse may go
 unreported and that police on occasion are reluctant to
 intervene in such cases. Prosecutorial authorities are thought
 generally to accept and conscientiously prosecute charges
 involving cases of violence against women brought to their
 attention.
 There are two sizable minorities--Hungarians and Romanies
 (Gypsies). Hungarians, who are concentrated in southern
 Slovakia, form the country's largest minority (approximately
 600,000, according to official statistics). The State provides
 .some primary and qecondary education in Hungarian, but no
 
 
 1090
 CZECH AND SLOVAK FEDERAL REPUBLIC
 Hungarian-language universities exist in the CSFR. Ethnic
 Hungarians complain that the lack of opportunities for higher
 education in Hungarian contributes to a shortage of qualified
 Hungarian-language teachers. As a practical matter, virtually
 all Hungarians who reside in the CSFR and who are of college
 age speak Slovak and have access to higher education
 opportunities within the CSFR. Some Hungarians who live in the
 CSFR do choose to attend university in Hungary, although
 financial barriers and stringent admissions requirements limit
 their numbers.
 A 1990 Slovak republic law designates Slovak as its official
 language and provides that, in communities in which a
 non-Slovak-speaking ethnic group constitutes 20 percent of the
 population, official business may also be transacted in the
 language of that group. Some Hungarian representatives have
 complained that the language law has had the effect of making
 it difficult or impossible to use Hungarian in official
 business in some communities where Hungarians constitute less
 than 20 percent of the population but nonetheless are present.
 Romanies constitute the CSFR's second largest minority group.
 They are officially recognized as a minority and are accorded
 the rights enjoyed by other minorities. Although only
 approximately 114,000 persons identified themselves as Romanies
 during a 1991 census, knowledgeable observers believe that at
 least another 300,000 persons could have claimed Romany
 ethnicity but chose instead to identify themselves as Czechs,
 Slovaks, or Hungarians on census forms. Romanies tend to
 suffer disproportionately from high rates of poverty, crime,
 and disease. These problems appear to stem more from
 traditional conditions and a strong popular prejudice against
 Romanies rather than from current governmental policies,
 although anecdotal evidence suggests lower level government
 officials at times tolerate and fail to take action to correct
 discrimination against Romanies.
 Officials in both the Federal and republic Governments during
 1991 established policies intended to improve the situation of
 Romanies, but the policies had little immediate effect. In
 fact, the growing unemployment that accompanied economic
 restructuring hit Romanies especially hard, with the
 unemployment among Romanies approaching an estimated 50 percent
 in some areas of the CSFR.
 Romanies in the Czech Republic were also the victims of
 racially motivated attacks during 1991, mostly by youth gangs
 known as skinheads. Government officials have acknowledged
 that at least six deaths have resulted from such attacks,
 although some Romany organizations have claimed that at least
 seven poeple were killed. Government authorities condemned
 these attacks and generally prosecuted persons responsible for
 the attacks, but in some circumstances police apparently were
 slow to intervene to stop the violence.
 Although perhaps only a few thousand Jews reside in the Slovak
 republic, there were signs of rising anti-Semitism there during
 1991, generally in the form of graffiti and ethnic slurs
 directed at random against members of the Jewish community.
 There were several cases of anti-Semitic slander and threats
 made in the context of political rivalries. CSFR government
 leaders, including President Vaclav Havel, strongly condemned
 anti-Semitic actions and sentiment in both republics.
 
 
 1091
 
 CZECH AND SLOVAK FEDERAL REPUBLIC
 At the start of 1991, some 20,000 Vietnamese were temporarily
 working and residing in the CSFR. The Governments of
 Czechoslovakia and Vietnam concluded an agreement that allows
 Czechoslovak enterprises to terniinate the employment of
 Vietnamese guest workers before the formal conclusion of their
 work agreements. Those terminated early are entitled to
 receive 5 months' salary as compensation.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The 1990 law on freedom of association provided workers the
 right to form and join unions of their own choosing without
 prior authorization. These rights were given added protection
 by a constitutional law, the Law of Basic Rights and Freedoms,
 enacted in 1991. Over 70 percent of workers are members of
 labor organizations. Most workers in the CSFR are members of
 unions affiliated with the democratically oriented Czech and
 Slovak Confederation of Trade Unions (CSKOS). There is a
 separate Confederation of Arts and Culture and other smaller
 - independent trade unions that are not affiliated with CSKOS,
 including a union formed during 1991 and led principally by
 officials from the former Communist trade union organization..
 CSKOS and its affiliated unions grew out of strike committees
 formed to support a November 1989 general strike against the
 former Communist regime. The Communist-controlled labor
 organization known as the Revolutionary Trade Union Movement
 (ROH) disbanded in March 1990, and its assets were taken over
 by the new democratic unions. The new unions are totally
 independent of the Government and political parties.
 Workers, except those in what are described as essential
 services, were granted the right to strike by the law on
 collective bargaining passed in 1991. A strike is illegal
 unless mediation procedures prescribed by law have been
 exhausted. Strikes during 1991 were rare, of short duration,
 and affected only small numbers of workers. In November there
 was a symbolic 1-hour work stoppage in Slovakia protesting the
 failure of the Government and employers to live up to
 guidelines for wage increases provided for .in the 1991
 tripartite general agreement in which government, unions, and
 employers were represented. The following are prohibited by
 law from striking: judges, prosecutors, members of the armed
 forces and police, air traffic controllers, nuclear power
 station workers, persons who work with fissionable material,
 and oil or gas pipeline equipment workers. In addition, health
 and social care workers may not strike if to do so would
 endanger life or health. Members of fire fighting and rescue
 units and telecommunications employees may not strike if to do
 so would endanger life, health, or property. Mediation and
 arbitration of collective bargaining disputes is mandated for
 workers who are not permitted to strike.
 A law passed in 1991 that would bar former secret police
 collaborators and certain Communist party officials from
 holding designated government offices was the subject of
 complaints presented to the ILO (see Section i.e.).
 Unions in the CSFR are free to form or join federations and
 confederations and may affiliate with and participate in
 international bodies, and this freedom is fully exercised.
 
 
 1092
 CZECH AND SLOVAK FEDERAL REPUBLIC
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 A new collective bargaining law went into effect in
 Czechoslovakia in 1991. The law provides a framework in which
 collective bargaining may occur, allows solidarity strikes
 under certain limited conditions, and prevents the use of
 replacement workers for strikers. A substantial number of
 collective bargaining contracts were completed within the
 framework of the new law, but trade union officials noted that
 the process of converting state-owned enterprises to private
 firms sometimes made it difficult to identify employer
 representatives with whom to bargain. Government, trade
 unions, and employer representatives in 1991 negotiated a
 tripartite general agreement on minimum wage, wage indexation,
 and other employment standards for the CSFR as a whole.
 Technically, the tripartite agreement was not a legally binding
 agreement, but in practice it set the pattern for subsequent
 collective negotiations at both the industry and plant levels.
 The Czechoslovak labor code provides that, when competing
 unions claim to represent the same group of workers, an
 employer has an obligation to deal with the most representative
 organization in the workplace. However, the code provides no
 explicit administrative or other mechanism for making or
 challenging such a determination. A charge of antiunion
 discrimination may be filed with a republic ministry of labor
 and social affairs, which may impose fines against those found
 to have violated the antiunion discrimination prohibition.
 Victims of such discrimination may also institute proceedings
 in the courts. The courts may issue injunctions against
 antiunion activities as well as order reinstatement of
 dismissed workers and-payment of back wages and other damages.
 The first export processing zone was established in the
 Moravian region of the CSFR in 1991. Workers in the export
 processing zone have the same right to organize and bargain
 collectively as other workers in the CSFR.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is expressly prohibited in the
 constitutional Law on Basic Rights and Freedoms adopted in
 January, and there is no evidence that such practices occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Generally, persons must be 16 years of age before they may
 work. However, those 15 years of age who have completed
 elementary school may work. Those who have completed the
 course of study at "special schools" (schools for persons with
 severe disabilities) may work at the age of 14. Workers
 younger than 16 years of age may work no more than 33 hours per
 -week. The Slovak and Czech Offices of Labor Safety enforce
 these provisions.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 A minimum wage was introduced in Czechoslovakia in 1991 for the
 first time as a result of the tripartite general agreement.
 The Federal Ministry of Labor establishes mandatory minimum
 wage rates for general occupational categories. The minimum
 wage provides an adequate standard of living for an individual
 worker and, when combined with special family allowances paid
 to families with children, provides an adequate standard of
 living for a worker and his family. Republic ministries of
 
 
 1093
 
 CZECH AND SLOVAK FEDERAL REPUBLIC
 labor are responsible for enforcement of the minimum wage law,
 and enforcement efforts appear effective.
 A standard workweek of 42.5 hours is mandated by law, as is a
 paid rest period of at least 30 minutes during the standard
 8.5-hour workday. and annual leave of from 3 to 4 weeks.
 Overtime generally may not exceed 150 hours per year or 8 hours
 per week. These limits may be exceeded by receiving permission
 from the ministry that oversees an industry. The ministry,
 however, may not grant permission unless it has first consulted
 with a trade union iepresenting woikers in the industry involved
 about lifting the restriction on maximum overtime. Republic
 labor and social affairs ministries are responsible for
 enforcement.
 The Slovak and Czech Offices of Labor Safety and the Federal
 Office of Standards and Measurement. are responsible for
 enforcement of health and safety standards. Under the
 Communist regime, less attention was paid to occupational
 health and safety than in advanced industrial countries, and
 officials believe that workplace,safety conditions have
 continued to deteriorate since'the 1989 revolution. Industrial
 equipment that is obsolete by Western standards complicates the
 efforts of the Government tQ improve occupational safety and
 health conditions.
