 LAOS
 The Lao People's Democratic Republic (LPDR) is a totalitarian,
 one-party, Communist state. The Lao People's Revolutionary
 Party (LPRP) is the source of all political authority in the
 country, and the party's leadership imposes broad and arbitrary
 controls.
 The LPRP came to power in 1975 after a protracted and bitter
 insurgency, supported by North Vietnam, whose military,
 political and economic assistance during that conflict was
 invaluable to it. Vietnamese influence, codified in a 25-year
 Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation signed in 1977, continues
 to be pervasive. The leaders of both Lao and Vietnamese
 Communist parties have been comrades in arms and colleagues in
 government for over three decades; hence they share many
 ideological, political, and economic perceptions. In addition,
 Vietnam stations between 40,000 and 50,000 troops in Laos to
 guarantee the security of the regime. Laos also receives
 large amounts of economic, technical, and military assistance
 from the Soviet Union. The Government constantly proclaims
 its indissoluble link to Vietnam and Cambodia as a loyal
 member of the Indochina group of nations and of the "Socialist
 community of states."
 Nonetheless, unlike every other Socialist state, the LPDR has
 no constitution and no published code of law. The individual
 is subject to the arbitrary control of the State and the LPRP.
 No national elections have been held since the establishment
 of the regime. A constitution is reportedly in draft, but
 there has been no announcement yet about its promulgation.
 Laos' approximately 3.6 million ethnically diverse people,
 scattered thinly over difficult terrain about the size of
 Oregon, have no common national history and share few
 traditions. National institutions are weak. The policies of
 the LPRP, particularly in its first 5 years, as well as very
 difficult economic conditions in general, have driven about
 325,000 Lao into exile since 1975. Among those refugees were
 most of the educated elite; hence the LPDR has a shortage of
 teachers, administrators, and technicians in all fields. This
 has made the task of development--and Laos is one of the
 poorest countries in the world--more difficult than ever.
 There appears to be little enthusiastic support for the regime.
 Several armed Lao resistance groups, supported financially
 from abroad, continue their activities along the Lao-Thai
 border and in selected areas inside Laos. Although the regime
 cites these groups as a menace to its safety and security, in
 fact they pose no serious threat to it.
 Human rights violations continued in 1987, although, on the
 basis of the limited information available, the number of
 reported violations may have decreased since the formation of
 the LPDR in 1975. However, the limited availability of
 information makes it difficult to confirm such a trend.
 Reeducation camps, the regime's preferred instrument for
 inducing obedience, continued to decline in population and an
 undetermined number of camps have been closed. Some former
 camp prisoners have been permitted to obtain passports and
 exit visas and have been able to travel overseas.
 Economic reforms in the past year have introduced a greater
 choice of consumer goods and greater freedom to associate for
 profit. Provinces have been encouraged to engage in direct
 trade with foreign commercial concerns in certain economic

 LAOS
 fields. This, coupled with traditional provincial autonomy (a
 historical consequence of rugged topography and poor
 transportation and communications) has meant a slight but
 noticeable brightening of daily life in many parts of the
 country.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There have been reports that Lao government and Vietnamese
 patrols'have fatally shot persons fleeing from Laos as well as
 those entering the country illegally. In those instances in
 which the LPDR confirms such incidents, it generally claims
 that the persons were smugglers or suspected members of the
 Lao resistance.
 An unknown number of people are killed annually in combined
 Lao/Vietnamese military operations against resistance forces.
 Many of the insurgents appear to be former Royal Lao Army
 troops and Hmong tribesmen. Both sides are reported to use
 brutal tactics, with the antigovernment forces attempting
 assassination and ambush of Lao, Vietnamese, and other
 Communist military and civilian personnel. There are also
 recurrent reports of attacks by bandit groups in isolated or
 interior areas on vehicles bearing government officials and on
 civilian buses. Official policy calls for the execution of
 resistance leaders, but no such executions were reported in
 1987.
 In mid-March international attention focused on a press story
 of three Hmong (a Lao highland minority) groups who were
 pushed back from Thailand and reportedly suffered casualties
 after their forced return- Similar reports surfaced in
 'November. The Government has denied such casualties, but
 international organization representatives have thus far not
 been allowed to contact these groups to verify their safety.
 The Lao Government has denied knowledge of these incidents.
 h. Disappearance
 There were numerous cases of secret arrest and removal of
 persons'to reeducation camps in the first years'of the current
 regime. In the last several years reports of disappearances
 have decreased, however.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 A relatively small number of "reeducation" prisoners continue
 to be beld in harsh conditions. Former prisoners have reported
 that punishment for misbehavior could include brutal public
 beatings, shackling, deprivation of food, and sometimes, for
 those who tried to escape, torture with electric dhocks or
 execution.. Some inmates have died from malnutrition.
 Government-officials have publicly denied reports of
 mistreatment of persons in reeducation camps.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 The Government continues to maintain a number of reeducation
 camps, or "seminar camps," in which persons who served the
 
 
 745
 LAOS -
 previous government, or who have offended the current one, are
 imprisoned. Accurate figures for camp populations are not
 available, but rough estimates are that 2,000 persons are
 still detained.
 Since 1979 conditions in most of the camps have improved
 noticeably, and a number of the camps have been reported
 closed.
 Most detainees now live in a kind of internal exile with
 severe restrictions on their freedom of movement. Generally,
 these conditions are no worse than those of poor Lao living in
 the countryside. Many reportedly have been assigned to
 collective farms or construction units inside their former
 camps. Some are on probation or cannot obtain necessary
 travel documents. Others who have lost property and families
 are reported to have chosen to remain in areas near the camps
 to begin new lives.
 In 1987 government officials claimed, as they had in 1985,
 that nearly all soldiers and officials sent to the camps in
 1975-76 had been released and that "only a few" remained in
 detention. The accuracy of that statement cannot be verified.
 There are accounts, however, that groups of camp detainees
 were released in late December 1986-January 1987, in February,
 and again in May-June. Release of some categories of detainees
 appears to have become more regular over the past year.
 Those accused of hostility to the regime or of what the
 Government calls "socially undesirable habits," such as
 prostitution, drug abuse, idleness, and "wrong thought," are
 sent to "rehabilitation" centers, usually without trial. Most
 of these persons have been allowed to return to their homes
 after periods ranging from a few months to-several years of
 hard labor, political indoctrination, and admission of guilt.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 No code of law exists in Laos, and there is no guarantee of
 due process. The Government has promulgated interim rules and
 regulations for the arrest and trial of those accused of
 specific crimes, including armed resistance to the Government.
 Although the regulations allow an accused person to make a
 statement presenting his side of the case, they provide no
 real opportunity for the accused to defend himself and do not
 permit bail or use of an attorney. Rather, the Government has
 issued instructions on how to investigate, prosecute, and
 punish wrongdoers. These instructions are applied capriciously
 and inconsistently. People can be arrested on the unsupported
 accusations of others and detained while the accusations are
 being investigated, without being informed of the charges or
 of the identity of the person making the accusations.
 Investigations often take a long time unless family members
 and friends take a strong interest in the case. Government
 officials and their families easily can influence the judgments
 reached. There is some provision for appeal, although
 important political cases tried by "people's courts" are
 without an appeals process. Death sentences must be approved
 by the Council of Ministers. Lao regulations call for
 judgment to be given in public. This often amounts to a
 public announcement of the sentence and not a public trial.
 
 
 746
 LAOS
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Search and seizure are authorized'by the security bureaus
 themselves rather than by an impartial judicial authority, and
 government regulations, which are not always followed, provide
 little protection for the persons affected. International and
 domestic mail is selectively opened on a routine basis. Mail
 from China and non-Communist countries is particularly suspect.
 Telephone calls frequently are monitored. Privately owned land
 may not be sold but may be inherited. Houses, appliances, and
 other private property can be sold only with difficulty in most
 cases, since the possession of large amounts of cash in this
 poor country draws immediate government suspicion.
 Inheritances cannot be passed on to relatives who have left
 the country as refugees and acquired another nationality.
 The Government makes no attempt to stop Lao from listening to
 foreign radio stations such as the Voice of America, nor from
 setting up antennas to bring in Thai television from across
 the Mekong River. The state security apparatus monitors
 family life extensively through a system of neighborhood
 wardens and informers.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Public expression of opposition to the Government is not
 permitted, and persons who indulge in such activity have been
 jailed. Newspapers and the state radio are subservient to the
 LPRP and to the Government, reflecting only their views.
 Ordinary Lao citizens may not import foreign news magazines or
 books; censorship is strict. Academic freedom does not exist.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government controls all meetings and, except for
 religious, athletic, and communal events, organizes them.
 Individuals do not have the right to join together to promote
 nonregime-sponsored activities nor to protest government
 policies. All associations--such as those for youth, women,
 workers, and a "peace organization"--are government-controlled
 and authorized "mass organizations." These are organized to
 exercise government control and disseminate government
 policy. All professional groups are organized by the party,
 and their leadership is ordinarily drawn from party ranks.
 Lao associations are permitted to maintain relations with
 like-minded politically acceptable organizations in other
 countries, particularly those in Communist countries.
 Ordinary Lao citizens are permitted association or contact
 with foreigners only in unusual circumstances, usually
 involving their work.
 Trade unions are organized as "mass organizations" of the
 party without the right to engage in collective bargaining.
 They have no real influence in determining working conditions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Nearly all Lao are Buddhists or, in the case of most highland
 groups, animists. In official statements, the Government has
 recognized the right of the people to free exercise of
 religious belief as well as the contributions religion can
 make to the development of the country.
 
 
 747
 LAOS
 Many Lao believe, however, that the Government is engaged in a
 long-term effort to subvert the role of religion because it
 considers the maintenance of temples and the activities of
 monks nonproductive and because it objects to an active group
 with an independent system of beliefs. This effort includes
 carefully controlling the education of young monks and
 compelling the Buddhist clergy to propagate elements of
 Marxist-Leninist doctrine. Further, since 1975, the Government
 has periodically taken over Buddhist and Christian places of
 worship for use as government schools, offices, and fire and
 police stations, as well as for political indoctrination
 centers and warehouses. Nonetheless, since the Third Party
 Congress in 1982, the Government has eased its stand on
 Buddhism. While it has not, so far as is known, contributed
 to the restoration of temples and religious institutions, it
 has not opposed efforts of the faithful to do so.
 Monks remain the only social group still entitled to special
 honorific terms of address, which even high party and
 government officials continue to use. 'Buddhist clergy are
 prominently featured at important state and party functions.
 Religious festivals are permitted to take place without
 hindrance. Young people regularly enter into religious orders
 for short periods.
 Links may be maintained with coreligionists and religious
 associations in other countries only in cases approved by the
 Government, usually involving other Communist countries. Most
 traditional links to Thai Buddhists have been severed..
 Missionaries are not formally banned from entering Laos to
 proselytize, but in most cases they are denied permission.
 Many top party officials still participate in religious
 ceremonies, but members of the military are forbidden even to
 have Buddhist funerals.
 Roman Catholics and Protestants are permitted to worship, but
 the activities of their churches are closely observed.
 Vatican officials visited Laos in 1987 to meet with the Bishop
 of Vientiane, as well as with local church and government
 officials. However, the Government did not permit the Bishop
 of Vientiane to travel to Bangkok to meet with Pope John Paul
 II when he visited southeast Asia last year.- Attendance at
 Christian services continues to require discretion. Since
 1975 Christians have not been permitted to operate schools,
 seminaries, or associations.
 The Government takes steps including the use of media to
 persuade highland minority groups to abandon their "old
 fashioned" animist beliefs.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Lao citizens must obtain permission from the authorities for
 all internal travel of any distance and in all cases when
 crossing provincial boundaries. Non-Lao residents in
 Vientiane must in principle obtain permission to travel
 outside it, and in practice, except for nationals of a very
 few countries, such permission is rarely granted. A curfew is
 enforced intermittently in the capital and other major
 cities. Its rules change from time to time, often without
 notice. Government officials have cited threats of
 "disorders" created by "reactionary elements" as the reason
 for the restrictions.
 
 
 748
 LAOS
 Foreign travel is permitted for officials, students in
 government-approved programs, and some others who have access
 to foreign exchange. Few Lao are permitted to study or train
 in non-Communist countries, even At their own expense. Exit
 visas, which are required, are not easy to obtain, but
 restrictions have been eased over the past 2 years. For
 pensioners, the elderly in general, and those with hard
 currency, it seems less difficult to obtain exit visas than in
 the past, and the number of travelers to the West and to the
 United States has increased sharply--although the absolute
 numbers are still small. Border crossing permits are available
 for those with business in Thailand. The number of permits
 increased in 1987 in keeping with the opening of additional
 border trade locations and the reduction in the number of items
 restri6ted by the Thai Government for trade with Laos. The
 permits are not, however, granted automatically and may be
 denied for political or personal reasons.
 The Government states that those wishing to emigrate may do
 so. In practice, however, legal emigration is rarely
 authorized for ethnic Lao. To guard against emigration, those
 permitted to travel must often leave their families behind as
 a guarantee of their return. Since 1975 over 325,000 Lao have
 registered as refugees in Thailand. An unknown number have
 crossed the border and simply settled with kindred ethnic
 groups.
 Some of those fleeing are fired upon and killed by Lao or
 Vietnamese border patrols as they attempt to cross the Mekong
 River. Government authorities have imprisoned many Lao
 seeking to leave the country illegally.
 The Lao and Thai Governments have agreed to take back, on a
 case-by-case basis, those of their respective citizens who
 have illegally crossed into the other country and now wish to
 return home. Since May 1980, when agreement was reached with
 Thailand and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) on a voluntary repatriation program, over 3,000 Lao
 voluntarily have returned to Laos under the auspices of the
 UNHCR. Those accepted for return receive several days of
 political indoctrination and then are released to return to
 their homes, where they are placed under the control of
 village authorities. The UNHCR provides basic necessities for
 the returnees and monitors their treatment and living
 conditions thereafter. There appears to be no official
 harassment or maltreatment of these voluntary returnees, and
 UNHCR officials have not been prevented from visiting them.
 In addition, perhaps as many as 10,000 persons have
 repatriated themselves without official involvement.
 The Lao Government also has agreed in principle to take back
 Lao in Thailand whom the Thai have determined do not meet the
 requirements for refugee status. Although procedures for the
 return of these "screened-out" Lao were worked out between the
 two countries in late 1986, it was not until October 1987 that
 the first small group of Lao was repatriated. A second,
 larger group returned in December.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of
 Citizens to Change Their Government
 Laos is ruled by a small elite of the LPRP, the sole party.
 There is neither freedom to participate in politics outside
 the party nor popular choice of policies or officials. After
 the Communists seized power in May 1975, but before the
 
 
 749 -
 
 LAOS
 establishment of the present regime in December of that year,
 local elections were held in which voters chose from a list of
 candidates selected by the party. Reportedly, those local
 officials not only constituted the National Council of
 People's Representatives, which proclaimed the LPDR, but also
 chose the Supreme People's Assembly, although the latter
 process was not publicized. There have been no national
 elections. A few "by-elections" have been organized to
 replace representatives who have died or been transferred.
 Citizens are not free to change their system of government.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Laos does not cooperate generally with private international
 organizations interested in human rights. However, it does
 occasionally permit visits by officials of international human
 rights organizations if the purpose of the visit is not
 specifically related to allegations of human rights
 violations. In mid-1986 Amnesty International wrote to
 government officials concerning allegations that Laotian armed
 forces had killed 35 Lao refugees in Thailand, including women
 and children,*as punishment for leaving Laos and suspected
 involvement in armed opposition activities. In response, the
 Government provided Amnesty International with an official
 statement denying responsibility for the incident.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Traditionally, women in Lao society have been subservient to
 men and often discouraged from obtaining an education. Today
 the active, government-controlled Lao Women's Federation has
 as one of its stated goals the achievement of rights for women
 "equal" to those of men. The Government claims that a higher
 percentage of women make up the school population now than
 before 1975, and that women are being encouraged to assume a
 greater role in economic and state-controlled political
 activity.
 Approximately half of the population in Laos is ethnic Lao,
 also called "lowland Lao;" 20 percent are tribal Thai; 15
 percent are Phoutheung (or Kha); and another 15 percent are
 other highland groups (Hmong, Yao, and others). The
 Government is attempting to integrate these groups and
 overcome traditional antagonisms between lowland Lao and
 minority groups.
 The Hmong are split on clan lines. Many were strongly
 anti-Communist; others sided with the Communist Pathet Lao and
 the Vietnamese. The Government is repressive toward all groups
 that fought against it, especially those continuing to resist
 its authority by force. The Hmong tried to defend some of
 their tribal areas after 1975, and some continue to support
 anti-LPDR resistance groups. Vietnamese and Lao armed forces
 conduct military operations against both resistance groups,
 the minority-based ones in the north and the resistance forces
 from lowland Lao groups, mainly in southern Laos.
 The Government wants to resettle in the lowlands some ethnic
 minorities who now inhabit mountainous areas. After
 resettlement they would be under closer government control and
 engage in settled agricultural production rather than
 destructive slash-and-burn techniques. For this purpose, the
 
 
 750
 LAOS
 Government has reportedly relied on a voluntary program based
 on material inducements. The situation for local ethnic
 Chinese has been marked by government suspicion and
 surveillance in the period after 1979 when Sino-Lao relations
 deteriorated seriously. These relations appear to be
 improving. At the September 1987 meeting of the Front for
 National Construction, state and party leaders called for
 cooperation with and from the Chinese (and south Asian)
 merchant communities. A majority of the Chinese community
 departed in the post-1975 period, largely for economic
 reasons. Those who remain have maintained Chinese schools in
 Vientiane and Savannakhet and Chinese associations in several
 provincial capitals.
 CONDITIONS OFLABOR
 Laos has set neither minimum wage, maximum workweek, nor
 safety or health standards for the workers in its almost
 entirely rural and agricultural economy. Public wages in
 particular remain extremely low. Workweeks typically are
 under 48 hours, with some exceptions, such as during urgent
 road-building or construction projects. Workplace conditions
 are not systematically exploitative, but they sometimes fail
 to protect workers adequately against sickness or accident.
 Work permits customarily are not issued to persons under age
 18, although children frequently work with their parents in
 traditional occupations such as farming and shopkeeping.
