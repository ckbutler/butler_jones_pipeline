 GRENADA
 Grenada is a parliamentary democracy, with a Governor General as titular Head
 of State. In June parliamentary elections, Prime Minister Dr. Keith Mitchell's New
 National Party (NN) won 8 of 15 seats and formed a majority government. The
 elections were openly and fairly contested, and were free of violence.
 The 750-member Royal Grenada Police Force is responsible for maintaining law
 and order. It is controlled by and responsive to civilian authorities.
 Grenada has a free market economy based upon agriculture and tourism. The real
 economic growth rate was about 2.3 percent for 1994, and the estimated annual
 growth for 1995 was 3 percent.
 Citizens enjoy a wide range of civil and political rights. Human rights problems
 included allegations of police brutality in the course of criminal investigations, but
 there were no documented cases. The Commissioner of Police has spoken out strong-
 ly against police use of unlawful force. Violence against women is common.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such practices, and there were no reported incidents of
 torture. Flogging, a legal form of punishment, is rare but has been used recently
 in sex crime and theft cases.
 The press occasionally reported claims of police brutality, some of which arose fol-
 lowing the complainants' alleged attempts to resist arrest. The Police Commissioner
 supervised officers investigating a few complaints, but did not release any results.
 No one brought a case of police brutality before the courts in 1995. The Police Com-
 missioner can disci line officers in valid cases of brutality with penalties which may
 include dismissal ?rom the force. The Police Commissioner has spoken out strongly
 against police use of unlawful force.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards and the Government
 permits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law provides the police with the
 right to detain persons on suspicion without a warrant, but they must bring formal
 charges within 48 hours. The police adhered to this time limit in practice. If the
 police do not charge a detainee within 48 hours, they must release the person.
 The law provides for a judicial determination of the legality of detention within
 15 days after arrest on a criminal charge. The police must formally arraign or re-
 
 
 416
 lease a detained person within 60 days, and the authorities generally followed these
 procedures. There is a functioning system of bail, although persons charged with
 capital offenses are not eligible. Persons charged with treason may be accorded bail
 only upon recommendation of the Governor General.
 Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary, a part of the Eastern Caribbean
 legal system, is highly regarded and independent. Final appeal may be made to the
 Privy Council in the United Kingdom. There are no military or political courts.
 Those arrested on criminal charges are brought before the independent judiciary.
 Following a determination by a judicial hearing that there is sufficient evidence to
 substantiate a criminal charge, the judge remands the defendant for trial.
 The law provides for the right to a fair public trial, and the authorities observe
 it in practice. There is a presumption of innocence, and the law protects persons
 against self-incrimination and requires the police to explain a person's rights upon
 arrest. The accused has the right to remain silent and to seek the advice of legal
 counsel. The defense lawyer has the right to be present during interrogation and
 may advise the accused how to respond or not to respond to questions. The accused
 has the right to confront his accuser.
 The court appoints attorneys for indigents only in cases of murder or other capital
 crimes. In other criminal cases that reach the appellate stage, the court will simi-
 larly appoint a lawyer to represent the accused i he was not previously represented
 or reappoint the defendant's earlier counsel if the appellant can no longer afford the
 lawyer's services. Due to the backlog of cases caused by a shortage of judges and
 facilities, up to 6 months can pass before those charged with serious offenses face
 trial in the high court. With the exception of murder and foreign-born drug suspects,
 the courts grant most defendants bail while awaiting trial.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for protection from these abuses, and there were no reports
 of such actions. The law generally requires judicially issued warrants for searching
 homes, except in cases of hot pursuit. The Firearms Act of 1968 and the Drug Abuse
 Prevention Act Number 7 of 1992 contain other exceptions which $ive the police and
 security units legal authority to search persons and property without warrants in
 certain circumstances. In practice, police obtain warrants in the majority of cases
 before conducting any search.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the Government does not restrict these rights. There are four
 weekly newspapers and several newspapers which publish irregularly. One of the
 weeklies is affiliated with an opposition political party, but the three most widely
 circulated newspapers are independent and often are critical of the Government.
 The newspapers frequently carry press releases by the opposition parties, one of
 which regularly provides a weekly column expressing the opposition party's views.
 Grenada has four radio stations. The main station is part of the Grenadian Broad-
 casting Corporation (GBC), a statutory body not under direct government control.
 Grenada's main television station is also part of the GBC. A privately owned tele-
 vision station began broadcasting in 1992, when a cable company began operating
 in the capital area with plans to expand eventually throughout the country.
 Throughout 1995 the television news often carried reports on opposition activities,
 including coverage of the political rallies of the various political parties and can-
 didats, public forums featuring political leaders of each of the major parties, an~d
 other public service broadcasts. Election results were broadcast live on both tele-
 vision stations and three of the four radio stations (the fourth concentrates on reli-
 gious broadcasting).
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to assemble for any peaceful purpose. Supporters of political parties meet
 frequently and hold public rallies; permits are required for the use of a public ad-
 dress system but not for public meetings themselves.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement within the country,
 and all citizens have the right to enter and leave the country, except in special cir-
 cumstances as outlined in and limited by the 1986 Act to Restrict the Freedom of
 Movement of Certain Persons. This law allows the Minister for National Security
 to restrict travel out of Grenada by any person whose aims, tendencies, or objectives
 include the overthrow of the democratic and parliamentary system of government;
 
 
 it has not been invoked in the past few years. Anyone so restricted may appeal after
 3 months to an independent and impartial tribunal. The Chief Justice appoints an
 accredited lawyer to preside over such a tribunal.
 No formal government policy toward refugee or asylum requests exists. There
 were no reports of forced expulsion of anyone having a valid claim to refugee status;
 however, government practice remains undefined.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage. The next parliamentary elections
 must be held by October 2000.
 There are no restrictions in law or practice on participation by women in govern-
 ment and politics. Three of the 15 elected members of Parliament are women, as
 well as 1 of the 13 appointed senators (who also serves as Deputy President of the
 Senate). Women account for 7 of the 12 permanent secretaries, the highest civil
 service position in each ministry; in addition, a woman is the Cabinet Secretary, the
 highest civil service position in the Government.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local human rights groups operate without government restriction, and the Gov-
 ernment cooperates with visits from international human rights organizations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based upon race, place of origin, politi-
 cal opinions, color, creed, or sex, and the Government generally adheres to these
 provisions.
 Women.-Knowledgeable women's rights monitors report that violence against
 women is common and that most cases of spousal abuse go unreported. The police
 confirm that most cases of alleged abuse are not reported and others are settled out
 of court. Grenadian law stipulates a sentence of 15 years imprisonment for a convic-
 tion of rape. Sentences for assault against a spouse vary according to the severity
 of the incident. There is no evidence of official discrimination in health care, employ-
 ment, or education. Women frequently earn less than men performing the same
 work; such wage differences are less marked for the more highly paid jobs.
 C hildren.-The Social Welfare Division within the Ministry of Labour provides
 probationary and rehabilitative services to youths, day care services and social work
 programs to families, assistance to families wishing to adopt or foster children, and
 fmancial assistance to the three children's homes in Grenada run by private organi-
 zations.
 The Government reported 63 cases of child abuse through September 1995. The
 law provides for harsh penalties against those convicted of child abuse and disallows
 the victim's alleged "consent" as a defense in cases of incest.
 People With Disabilities.-The law does not protect job seekers with disabilities
 from discrimination in employment, nor does it mandate provision of accessibility
 for public buildings or services. The National Council for the Disabled, which re-
 ceives a small amount of financial assistance from the Government, was instrumen-
 tal in placing visually impaired students into community schools, which in some
 cases previously were reluctant to accept them. The Council also approached archi-
 tects to assist in construction of ramps at various hotels and public buildings, and
 ramps have already been installed at some hotels.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers are free to organize independent labor
 unions. Labour Ministry officials estimate the percentage of the work force that is
 unionized to be between 20 and 25 percent. Union leaders play a significant role
 in the political process, and one labor leader serves in the Senate.
 While workers in the private sector are free to strike at will, workers in the public
 sector must give advance notice. There were several incidents of industrial action
 including strikes in 1995, but all were short-lived and settled with the intervention
 of the Ministry of Labour or the Prime Minister. All unions were free of government
 control and none received government financial support. All the major unions in
 Grenada belong to one umbrella labor federation, the Grenada Trades Union Coun-
 cil (GTUC), which holds annual conventions and determines some policies for mem-
 ber unions. The GTUC and its unions freely affiliate with regional and international
 trade union groups.
 
 
 b. The Riht to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers are free to organize
 and to participate in collective bargaining. Legislation requires employers to recog-
 nize a union that represents the ma*ority of workers in a particular business. The
 law prohibits discriination by employers against union members and organizers.
 If a complaint of discrimination arises, mechanisms exist to resolve it. After all ave-
 nues for resolving a complaint have been exhausted between union representatives
 and employers, both sides may agree to ask for the assistance of the Labour Com-
 missioner. If the Labour Commissioner is unable to find a resolution to the impasse,
 the Minister of Labour may appoint an arbitration tribunal if both parties a"ree to
 abide by its ruling. The law requires employers found guilty of antiunion discrimina-
 tion to rehire dismissed employees, but in most cases the employee accepts the op-
 tion of compensation. There were no such cases in 1995.
 Unions may organize and bargain anywhere in the country, including in export
 processing zones (EPZ's), which are not exempted from Grenada's labor legislation.
 However, in 1994 the one unionized firm previously operating in an EPZ closed its
 Grenada-based operations.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution specifically pro-
 hibits forced labor, and there were no reports of it.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The statutory minimum age for
 employment of children is 16 years. Inspectors from the Ministry of Labour enforce
 this provision in the formal sector by periodic checks. Enforcement efforts in the in-
 formal sector are lax.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Legislation sets minimum daily wage rates for
 the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors. Most recently revised in 1994,
 minimum wages for farm laborers are $5.73 (EC$15.48) per day for men, and $5.33
 (EC$14.40) for women. Most workers, including nonumonized ones, receive other
 benefits from their employers through the collective bargaining agreements reached
 with that firm's unionized workers. Even when these benefits are added to wages
 from a full-time minimum wage job, it is insufficient to provide a decent standard
 of living.
 The law does not prescribe a set number of hours as the standard workweek, ex-
 cept for the public sector which is expected to work a 40-hour week Monday through
 Friday. The normal workweek in all sectors seldom exceeds 40 hours, although in
 the commercial sector this includes Saturday morning work.
 The Government sets health and safety standards, but they are minimal, and the
 authorities do not effectively enforce them. Workers can remove themselves from
 dangerous workplace situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
