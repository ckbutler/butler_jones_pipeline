 COSTA RICA
 Costa Rica is a constitutional democracy. The Government is
 divided into three independent branches: executive,
 legislative, and judicial. There is a quasi fourth branch, the
 Supreme Electoral Tribunal, which operates independently,
 maintaining vital statistics and administering elections. The
 executive branch of the Government is headed by an elected
 president who is constitutionally prohibited from succeeding
 himself. There are two elected vice presidents.
 Costa Rica held elections on February 7, 1982; 78.6 percent of
 the eligible electorate voted. There were six candidates for
 president, and five political parties or coalitions fielded
 full slates of candidates for the 57 seats in the Legislative
 Assembly in all seven provinces. Several smaller parties ran
 candidates in some provinces. Participating parties ranged
 from ultra-conservative to far left. The leader of the major
 opposition party won the presidential race and there was a
 peaceful transition of power with Luis Alberto Monge's
 inauguration on May 8. This continues a Costa Rican tradition
 of thirty years of free and democratic elections.
 The most alarming threat to human rights in Costa Rica is
 terrorism. Political turmoil in other Central American
 countries has produced a sharp increase in terrorist activity
 in Costa Rica. Further, the country's longstanding policy of
 offering refuge to political dissidents of various persuasions
 has, in the highly charged atmosphere of political violence
 prevalent in much of Central America, made Costa Rica a
 battlefield for foreign extremists. In January 1982, an
 Iranian businessman's son was kidnapped by assailants widely
 believed to be Salvadoran terrorists. That same month there
 was an attempted kidnapping of a Salvadoran businessman by
 Salvadoran terrorists trained in Nicaragua. In February,
 terrorists made an attempt on the life of a Nicaraguan exile
 leader and wounded his son. In March, police arrested a group
 of eight persons of various nationalities on charges of
 smuggling arms to Salvadoran guerrillas. In July, three
 Nicaraguan diplomats were declared persona non grata for their
 role in bombing the Honduran airlines office"in San Jose.
 Later in the year, a Salvadoran diplomat was declared persona
 non grata for an alleged bombing attempt on the life of a
 foreign resident whom he apparently suspected of involvement in
 arms traffic to Salvadoran guerrillas. An Argentine citizen
 was kidnapped by presumed leftist extremists in October. Costa
 Rican police have discovered several arms caches belonging to
 extremist groups of one political coloration or the other.
 There is also a small but dangerous Costa Rican extreme left
 terrorist organization which works with the foreign terrorist
 groups.
 Costa Rica has a mixed economic system with emphasis on free
 enterprise capitalism. At present there are severe strains on
 the Costa Rican economy. Indeed, the nation was brought to the
 brink of bankruptcy under the Carazo Administration
 (1978-1982). In September the Nonge Administration initialed a
 draft letter of intent with the International Monetary Fund.
 The economic program outlined in the letter of intent will put
 Costa Rica on the road to getting its economic house in order
 and will open the door to U.S. and other external aid.
 However, for the first time in many years, Costa Rica is
 experiencing significant unemployment and under-employment, as
 well as hyperinflation. Solutions will not come quickly, and
 domestic and foreign extremists are demonstrating their
 intention to take advantage of deteriorating economic
 conditions.

 Costa Rica remains one of the world's most committed nations to
 protecting human rights and has an excellent record in this
 regard. In spite of the political turmoil in neighboring
 Central American countries, and the increasing threat of
 terrorist activities within the country, there are no political
 prisoners in Costa Rica and all residents of the country --
 citizens, refugees, and terrorists -- receive fair and
 equitable treatment under law.
 The Costa Rican Constitution forbids the establishment of a
 standing army, and there is virtually universal support for
 this provision. The Public Security Forces, the Civil Guard
 and the Rural Guard are charged with maintaining public order
 and policing borders. During a national emergency, these would
 form the core of a National Civil Defense Force. The present
 Government, backed by a popular consensus, has begun a modest
 upgrading of the training and equipment of these forces within
 severe budgetary constraints.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 Neither:the Government nor major Costa Rican political
 organizations have used killing as a political weapon. A
 Salvadoran diplomat allegedly made a bombing attempt on the
 life of a foreign resident for apparently political reasons.
 Costa Rican authorities thoroughly investigated this attempted
 homicide, and those responsible have been identified. The
 diplomat, upon his recall by the Salvadoran Government to face
 criminal charges in another case, fled to a third country, but
 legal proceedings have been instituted against his accomplice.
 Earlier in the year unidentified terrorists made an attempt on
 the life of a Nicaraguan exile leader. No suspects have been
 arrested in that case.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no known abductions, secret arrests, or persons
 held clandestinely by an agency of the Costa Rican Government.
 An Iranian citizen, Kevah Yazdani, was kidnapped in January
 1982 and is apparently still being held for ransom. Ifis
 abductors are widely believed to be Salvadoran terrorists.
 Assailants who kidnapped an Argentine citizen in October have
 nbt been identified, but press speculation is that they were
 Central American extreme leftists.
 c. Torture
 The Constitution specifically forbids torture. This is not
 only the law, but also the practice. As a result of
 allegations abroad that prisoners held on arms smuggling
 charges had been tortured, the Government conducted a thorough
 investigation. That inquiry, which was made public, concluded
 that two prisoners had been beaten by police attempting to
 subdue them at time of arrest when they were arrested in Mlarch,
 but medical reports showed no evidence of deliberate torture.
 To deter such conduct and to help insure that any such
 incidents that do occur are thoroughly reviewed, the Justice
 Ministry sought, and received, legislative approval for
 creating a special prosecutors' office empowered to investigate
 and prosecute human rights violations by representatives of any
 public institution.
 
 
 456
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution provides that, 'No one shall be submitted to
 cruel or degrading treatment nor to life imprisonment. A
 statement obtained through violence shall have no value.' The
 Government has made efforts to upgrade conditions in the
 prisons; overcrowding is not a problem. All prisoners are
 apparently treated both humanely and equally.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The Constitution requires that an arraignment take place within
 twenty-four hours of an arrest, and this is strictly enforced.
 The right of habeas corpus is guaranteed. The law is upheld in
 both spirit and practice.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Accused persons may select their own attorneys; access to
 counsel is guaranteed. Free public counsel is provided for
 defendants without means. The judiciary maintains its
 independence through a constitutional mechanism that provides
 funding at a fixed percentage of the national budget. There
 are only civilian courts, which provide first instance and
 appellate procedures. There is also a court which accepts
 appeals from administrative decisions of the Executive Branch.
 Courts are sometimes slow in processing criminal cases, but a
 recent United Nations study by The Latin American Institute For
 the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders showed
 Costa Rica has the lowest percentage of detainees awaiting
 trial of 18 Latin American countries surveyed.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Court-ordered search and seizure warrants are required for any
 form of invasion of privacy of private residences, and the
 procedure is observed.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution specifically guarantees freedom of speech and
 press. There are three major daily newspapers, and each
 presents its own independent views. There appear to be no
 limitations, governmental or self-imposed, upon the press.
 There are three privately-owned television stations and
 numerous radio stations which pursue independent editorial
 policies. The media freely air differences with the
 Government. There is no evidence of either collusion or
 repression. Terrorist activities receive full coverage and
 editorial excoriation. Scholars are also free to teach and
 publish divergent views. Costa Rica has a tradition of rule by
 consensus, and free discussion is actively encouraged as a
 means of arriving at such consensus. Although a 1973 law is
 designed to control the importation and production of
 pornographic materials, in practice materials generally
 available to the US public are available in Costa Rica.
 
 
 457
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 No legal or social impediments to freedom of assembly or
 association exist. These rights are enumerated in the
 Constitution. The rights of labor unions are constitutionally
 guaranteed. Unions may organize and bargain; they can and do
 strike. About 14 percent of the labor force is organized.
 Unions are active in the political arena, and despite their
 small membership have an influence on national policy.
 Numerous prominent political leaders, including the President,
 have labor backgrounds. There are some unions which are
 identified as 'company unions,' but none labeled 'government.'
 There are extensive laws protecting laborers, and social
 security and public health laws to safeguard the elderly, the
 injured, and the disabled. There are laws protecting children
 and women from abusive labor treatment and specific guarantees
 for workers regarding vacation and sick leave, pension rights,
 and separation pay. Virtually all worker rights are protected
 by law. Professional groups also have the right to unionize
 and bargain collectively. Costa Rica is a member of the
 International Labor Organization.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although Rolaan Catholicism is the religion of the state,
 freedom of religion is guaranteed in the Constitution and
 exists in practice.
 d. 'Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no impediments to travel within and without the
 country. People are free 'to live anywhere within the national
 boundaries. Costa Rica has accepted many thousands of refugees
 from Nicaragua, El Salvador, and other Central American
 countries as well as many Cubans and South Americans. Costa
 Rica has supported multinational refugee programs and has
 provided a sanctuary for as many refugees as its limited
 resources permit. The Constitution specifically forbids the
 government from repatriating any person who may be subject to
 political persecution in his own country. Citizenship through
 birth or naturalization is a carefully guarded right and cannot
 be lost except by abandonment. The Government accepts
 responsibility for repatriating its own citizens.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Costa Rica is goverened by a president and a 57-member
 legislative assembly, the members of which were last elected in
 February 1982. The Constitution provides for a free, open, and
 competitive electoral system whose integrity is overseen by the
 independent Supreme Electoral Tribunal. Not only do guarantees
 for an open democratic process exist in law, they exist in
 practice. No political party is outlawed or excluded from the
 electoral process; no party has dominated the affairs of the
 nation, nor is any eligible voter deterred from participating
 in elections. Women and minority groups--principally black
 descendents of Jamaican settlers--are the political equals of
 other members of the electorate both in law and in fact. Four
 women, including one black, are currently serving as deputies
 in the Legislative Assembly, and women occupy prominent
 positions in both the executive branch and the judiciary.
 Costa Ricans pride themselves on their devotion to their
 democratic political system. Virtually all segments of the
 population view with hostility any effort by any group,
 internal or external, to interfere with the free electoral
 process.

 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 Costa Rica is a strong advocate of human rights and vigorously
 supports international human rights organizations. The
 Government has extended a permanent invitation to the
 Inter-American Human Rights Commission to visit whenever it
 wishes. The Government has accepted the jurisdiction of the
 Inter-American Human Rights Court, which is based in San Jose,
 and was one of the earliest ratifiers of the American
 Convention on Human Rights. It hosts the Inter-American
 Institute of Human Rights and enthusiastically supports its
 activities.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Costa Rica has for many years lived beyond its means.  As a
 result, the external debt ($3.2 billion public sector and $650
 million private sector) is staggering for a country of its
 size. In agreeing to an economic austerity to program with the
 IMF, Costa Rica agreed to reduce the public sector deficit,
 control credit and money supply, raise interest rates, devalue
 the colon (monetary unit), and maintain a flexible exchange
 rate system. The Government will next seek to reschedule its
 debts with commercial banks and bilateral donors.
 The GNP per capita in 1980 was reported to be $1,728, but the
 figure does not reflect Costa Ricans' real buying power. The
 Costa Rican colon has been severely devalued (500 percent) in
 the last two years, and the debt structure and lack of external
 credit have produced a deep recession. There is, for the first
 time in many years, significant unemployment and
 underemployment as well as hyperinflation (100 percent plus).
 Current figures given by the Government indicate about 10
 percent of the work force is unemployed; it was reported that
 approximately 12 percent of the work force is underemployed,
 working drastically reduced hours per week.
 These conditions have been aggravated by the large influx of
 refugees from the region. The income tax system is progressive
 in principle, but the majority of government revenues come from
 trade and sales taxes which fall most heavily on lower income
 groups.
 In general, Costa Rican society is cohesive and the country's
 institutions enjoy a high level of legitimacy. Costa Ricans
 are proud of their democratic traditions and the fact that they
 spend more on education than defense.
 Costa Rica has attained an exceptionally high literacy rate, in
 excess of 90 percent. The Government has sought to assure low
 cost, readily accessible health care to its citizens. More
 than 80 percent of the population of approximately 2.3 million
 is covered by social security programs, and approximately 60
 percent enjoy medical and retirement benefits. The successful
 health care delivery system (life expectancy is now 70 and
 infant mortality has fallen to 24.2 per 1000) and a moderately
 high birth rate of 2.5 percent will mean increasing demands on
 social service agencies. In times of fiscal restraint, these
 will be extremely difficult to meet.
 
 
 459
 Traditional attitudes which assign a primarily domestic role to
 women are prevalent, but attenuated, in Costa Rica. Women are
 increasingly attaining equal access to jobs at equal salaries
 in both private and public sectors.
 The reported 1975 figure of 72 percent of the population with
 access to safe water is probably higher now. Based upon 1979
 figures, primary school enrollment stood at 107 percent of
 those available to attend. (The excess over 100 percent is.
 enrollment of students over the expected age of primary level
 students.) Costa Ricans are generally well fed. The ratio of
 calorie supply available for consumption relative to
 nutritional requirements was reported to be 114 percent in
 1977. There are no Costa Ricans reported to be living below
 the absolute poverty level.
