 CONGO
 In 1992 Congo completed a peaceful transition to multiparty democracy, ending
 decades of one-party Marxist rule. A specific agenda for this transition was laid out
 during Congo's National Cohference of 1991 and culminated in August 1992 with
 multiparty presidential elections. Congo's new President, Professor Pascal Lissouba,
 was inaugurated on August 31. In November, confrontations between the Presidency
 and the National Assembly resulted in a motion of censure after which President
 Lissouba dissolved the Assembly. (The new Constitution gives the President the
 right to dissolve Parliament in the face of persistent and serious disagreements.)
 Elections to form a new Parliament are expected in early 1993.
 During 1992 the transitional Government, headed by Prime Minister Andre
 Milongo, succeeded in its mandates to hold a constitutional referendum as well as
 local,legislative, and presidential elections. Approved by national referendum in
 February. Congo's new Constitution includes a list of fundamental rights and lib-
 
 
 erties similar to those adopted a year before by the National Conference. Although
 ofen fraught with organizational and practical hurdles, the year's series of elections
 were generally described as free and fair b, impartial election observers from many
 different countries and international organzations. During the transition in the first
 half f the year, former President Sassou-Nguesso remained in office in a ceremonial
 role and, as head of the former ruling Congolese Workers Party (PCT), was a major
 presidential contender.
 Congo's armed forces played a pivotal role in the country's democratic trans
 formation. The army supported the concept of a national conference and provided
 security for the delegates througout its sessions. A concerted effort was made dur-
 ing the transition to reform and depoliticize Congolese military forces. Initially, the
 armed forces resisted the transitional government's efforts to restructure the ili-
 tary high command, and on three occasions military units occupied Congolese tele-
 vision and radio studios to impose broadcast censorship. The Government acceded
 to the main demands of the military leadership, and once the lines between civilian
 and military authority were reestablished without bloodshed, the armed forces went
 on to play a generally constructive, neutral role during the elections. Many former
 military officers purged in previous years for refusing to support the PCT were rein-
 stated. At the end of 1992, military leaders again played a constructive role by
 bringing opposing coalitions together in a neutral setting to negotiate a way out of
 a political mpasse that might otherwise have led to violent confrontations and even
 civil war. Congo  military expenditures for 1989, the last year for which the U.S.
 Arms Control and Disarmament Ageny conducted a detailed analysis, were esti-
 mated at between $76 and $90 million. While there is criticism that the army is
 top-heav, anticipated reductions in the near future will occur more as a response
 to tight financial constraints rather than to a new policy designed to downsize the
 forces.
 In recent years, Congo's economy has been heavily dependent on petroleum earn-
 ings and external borrowing. Faced with the collapse of world oil prices after 1985
 and saddled with a very large foreign debt, Congo has been under pressure from
 international lending institutions to implement structural ajustment measures and
 free market ecnomnic policies. Congo's economic difficulties have continued to serve
 as a driving force behind political reforms.
 Despite short-lived tensions with the s-med forces early in the year and con-
 frontations between the Government and the opposition late in the year, the human
 rights situation in Congo saw significant improvements in 1992 under determined
 civilian leadership. The new Constitution provides citizens with a broad range of
 legal protections and extensive civil liberties, includin freedom of speech, press, as-
 sembly, association, and political choice. It also establishes a number of new courts
 (not yet functioning) as a check on arbitrary executive power. While in 1992 many
 of these new freedoms were exercised fully, some persistent human rights problems
 continued, including credible reports of police and military brutality and harsh pris-
 on conditions. There was also continuing societal discrimination against women and
 against the indigenous Prgmy villagers in remote parts of the country.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section . Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-There were no reports of such
 killings authorized or condoned by the Government or by the Congo's military or
 security forces.
 b. Dsappearance.-There were no reports of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.--
 The new Constitution forbids the use of torture. There were no reports of its use
 in 1992 either by the transitional government or by the newly installed Lissouba
 Government.
 However, unacceptable interrogation methods remain a persistent problem among
 military and security forces in the Congo. Army, police, and customs officials con-
 tinue to beat detainees both to extract information and as punishment, particularly
 for accused thieves and for those who resist arrest. This practice continues in part
 because lower level officers do not receive adequ ate training in the rights and proper
 treatment of suspects and because military and security force leaders seem to tacitly
 condone such beatings.
 Despite the fact that the transitional government publicly recognized the problem
 and vowed to undertake improvements, Congolese prison conditions continued to be
 harsh. Prison buildings are dilapidated; security is lax; there are no constructiveac-
 tivities such as classes or exercises; and food and medical care are inadequate. Most
 nrgins, huilt durin French colonial rule when convicted felons were sent out of the
 
 
 country, were never designed for long-term prisoners. Nevertheless, dozens of pris-
 oners are often kept in the same cell for long periods of time, sleeping on the floor
 and subsisting on only one meal per day.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The new Constitution forbids arbitrary
 arrest, detention, or exile. There is no evidence that the new or transitional Govern-
 ments deliberately engaged in any of these practices. Nevertheless, while the Con-
 go's Code of Penal Procedure requires that all detainees be brought before a judge
 within 3 days and be charged or released within 3 months, these limits are often
 ignored in practice due to official indifference and limited resources to handle cases.
 Delays in bringing cases to trial and arbitrary denial of bail continued to be prob-
 lems in 1992.
 There were no political detainees or prisoners held at year's end. The general am-
 nesty declared by the National Conference for all those responsible for political
 crimes, including human rights abuses, precluded official investigations and pros-
 ecutions by the new Government. The amnesty was approved by all parties in the
 name of national unity.
 The new Government has not used forced exile as a means of political control.
 During the transition, all voluntary exiles from the former regime were invited to
 return, and many did. Some members of the previous government, particularly
 those suspected of embezzlement or other wrongdoings, have gone into self-imposed
 exile rather than face possible prosecution for past crimes.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Modeled on French institutions, the Congolese ju-
 dicial system consists primarily of local courts, courts of appeal, and the Supreme
 Court. All "special" courts and secret trials were abolished by the National Con-
 ference. Defendants have the right to be represented by lawyers of their choice, and
 the State will cover legal fees in cases of destitution.
 The new Constitution established two new high courts, whose decisions cannot be
 appealed or reversed by the Supreme Court or any other court. The Constitutional
 Council, with its power to rule on the constitutionality of Congolese laws, is to act
 as the primary judicial counterweight to legislative and executive authority. The
 High Court of Justice will preside over cases of crimes committed against the State
 by the President or members of the Government. However, pending the organization
 of other branches of government which play an active role in the naming of their
 members, neither of these new high courts was actually formed or seated during
 1992. Apart from constitutionality and impeachment issues, ultimate legal authority
 will continue to be held by the Supreme Court.
 Operating mainly in rural areas where justice is often still administered at the
 village level, Congo's traditional courts continued to handle many local disputes, es-
 pecially property cases and probate functions. Dispute resolution is by extended de-
 bate, with no known instanes of resort to physical punishment. Many domestic dis-
 putes are also adjudicated under traditional law and within the context of the ex-
 tended family.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy. Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution protects theprivacy of homes as well as all forms of correspondence
 and telecommunications. Under current law, all official searches of private property
 require a warrant. The transitional government publicly announced that the police
 have limited powers and encouraged citizens to insist on their rights. It also prohib-
 ited the maintenance of security files on citizens who have not been accused of vio-
 lating the law.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Like the bill of rights that preceded it, Congo's
 newly adopted Constitution guarantees complete freedom of expression. In addition,
 the Constitution provides for the eventual establishment of a special court or "Supe-
 rior Council of Information and Communication" meant to guarantee and protect
 specific freedoms of speech, press, and expression. Even after this court is formed,
 however, the Supreme Court will still serve as the highest judicial authority on such
 matters. The Superior Couicil of Information and Communication is meant to act
 as a specialized appellate court, screening cases before they are heard by the Su-
 preme Court.
 Congolese citizens spoke freely and openly throughout the year. Print media were
 often critical of past and contemporary political leaders, and many private news-
 papers flourished. The most important media in reaching the public-the govern-
 ment-owned radio and television stations-became the center of controversy in 1992.
 In May the authorities fired a television reporter for reading a series of letters criti-
 cal of the interim legislature without prior clearance from his editors. This incident
 was interpreted widely as a clear case of media censorship by forces hostile to the
 transitional government. Even more dramatic was the presence of military troops
 
 
 occupying both the main television and radio stations and actively censoring news
 broadcasts during two periods of heightened tensions, in January and again in May.
 After the installation of President issuba, the new Government resorted to par-
 tisan staffin and censorship of broadcast media toward the end of 1992. Outright
 refusal to air opposition views on several occasions late in the year did much to
 erode public confidence in the newly acquired rights of free speech and press. In ad-
 dition to the protests of the opposition and neutral human rights groups, several key
 radio  broadcasters  and   television  journalists  resigned  to  protest  these
 progovernment, antiopposition policies. Indeed, heavy press censorship served to in-
 tensify the end-of-the-year political impasse.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution also guaran-
 tees freedom of assembly and association. Any gup wishing to hold a public assem-
 the Minister of the Interior, woas   e rght to forbid assemblies
 public peace or welfare. There were no reports of government deni-
 als of such requests in 1992. Indeed, the year saw numerous rallies organized by
 many different groups and independent political parties without government inter-
 ference. This freedom was widely exercised, particularly during the election period.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Ther is no state religion; .people are free to join any
 church and practice any religion. Denominations not already established in Congo,
 however, must register with the State, a sometimes cumbersome process. Congolese
 of many different creeds were represented both in the transitional government and
 in President Lissouba's administration.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution declares the right of all citizens to circulate freely
 within the country and specifically prohibits roadblocks and barricades, which were
 commonly used by past regimes to restrict movement and extract illegal tolls. Dur-
 ing a brief uprising in January, there were both military and civilian barricades.
 To combat fraud, all motorized travel was forbidden on election days, although spe-
 cial exemption permits were granted to the press and to certain diplomatic and gov-
 ernment vehicles, particularly those carrying election observers. Barricades
 reappeared in November at the height of the confrontations between the Lissouba
 Government and a coalition of opposition parties. However, the army successfully
 intervened to restore order and dismantle these civilian roadblocks.
 The Congo traditionally provided hospitality to refugees and asylum seekers.
 However, the influx of refugees from neighboring Zaire strained limited Congolese
 resources, and in 1991 the Government forcibly deported some 40,000 to 50,000
 Zairians, including many who had lived in Congo for years. There were no further
 mass deportations in 1992 and, indeed, many deported Zairians returned to Congo
 along with other political and economic refugees. In November more refugees
 streamed in from Cabinda as tensions heightened in Angola. During 1992 some
 5,000 Cabindans sought refuge in southern Congo, where most depended on ex-
 tended families or tribal ties to provide for lodging and support. Because family and
 tribal links are often found on both sides of the CabindaCongo border, there was
 little need for the State to provide refugee assistance for newly arrived Cabindans.
 A government-provided camp in Pointe-Noire was virtually empty at the end of the
 year.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 In 1992 after decades of authoritarian, one-party rule, the Congolese were able
 to change their government peacefully and democratically. The 1991 National Con-
 ference laid out a framework for this change and appointed a transitional govern-
 ment to oversee a constitutional referendum as well as a series of local, legislative,
 and presidential elections. The new Constitution was ratified by popular reIerendum
 on March 15. The elections were finally completed by Augu st, but they were still
 marred by significant organizational problems, including a shortage of ballots.
 There were 17 candidates in the presidential elections, including former President
 Yhombi-Opanga, incumbent President Denis Sassou-Nguess, and head of the tran-
 sitional government Andre Miongo. Several former political prisoners were also
 among the presidential contenders or otherwise active in political campaigns. No
 presidential candidate was able to win an absolute majority in the first round. Sec-
 ond-round results showed a clear majority of votes for Pascal Lissouba, who was in-
 augurated 2 weeks later. The Constitution provides for a 5-year term of office for
 the President, who is limited to two terms, and for 5-year terms of office for Na-
 tional Assembly members, who may serve an unlimited number of terms. The
 Lissouba Government includes two women as part of its 28-member Cabinet. How-
 ever, such female representation is sparse and normally the exception rather than
 the rule. While not officially prohibited, the indigenous Pygmies, living in remote
 
 
 64
 regions, are largely excluded from the political precess (see Section 5). In the 1992
 election campaign, there were several reports of local efforts to keep Pygmies from
 participating in the election process.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several local human rights organizations remained active. These included the Na-
 tional Committee on Human Rights, the Congolese Human Rights [e.aque, and a
 committee of the Congolese Association of Women Lawyers. All freely criticized past
 government human rights violations as well as abusive and discriminatory aspects
 of some traditional local customs. In addition, the Government actively encouraged
 and even solicited the presence pf international and nongovernmental observers for
 the elections held during the year.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The new Constitution specifically forbids such discrimination and there was no
 evidence of any officially sanctioned discriminatory practices. Nevertheless, much
 traditional discrimination persisted, particularly against Pygmies and against
 women.
 The two primary sets of indigenous people in the Congo are those tribes de.
 scended from Bantu peoples and Pygmies. The two groups are unrelated in terms
 of language, culture, morphological type, and lifestyle. Bantu Congolese predominate
 in all aspects of Congolese society and politics. The Pygmies, now numbering about
 7,000 persons, live primarily in remote northern forest regions and continue to be
 exploited as a cheap labor source. Pygmy workers are generally underpaid for their
 work relative to others, with compensation often being in the form of clothing, food,
 or other goods instead of wages. This practice is reinforced by an ancestral tradition
 of Pygmy slavery by Bantus, and in 1992 there were still some unconfirmed reports
 that this practice continued in isolated locations. One human rights monitor reports
 "incontrovertible evidence" that Bantus in the north exploit Pygmies in slave-like
 conditions. In the past, Pygmies were denied access to public education, health, and
 other basic services and to the right to own property. Pygmies have traditionally
 been excluded from the political process, a practice which reportedly continued in
 1992.
 Although the new Constitution prohibits discrimination based on sex and specifi-
 cally endorses the right of women to earn equal pay for equal work, discrimination
 against women is endemic in Congo. Inequities persist in salaries as well as in em-
 oyment opportunities and access to education. According to one 1991 U.N. study
 females receive only 33 percent of the schooling provided to males. While traditional
 inheritance customs favor maternal links, marriage and family laws overtly dis-
 criminate against women; for example, adulteryis considered illegal for women but
 not for men, and male polygamy is accepted. Women in rural areas are especially
 disadvantaged in terms of education and wage employment and are confined largely
 to family farm labor and child-raising responsibilities.
 Nonetheless, Congo has instituted some progressive policies with regard to gender
 issues. Educated women are increasingly finding pay equity and promotion opportu-
 nities more in line with their individual strengths rather than reflective of tradi-
 tional gender disparities. White-collar and government jobs, in particular, seem to
 treat Congolese women more fairly. As more wealthy or middle class women return
 from extended stays in Europe and elsewhere, their expectations of equal treatment
 have risen along with their qualifications, which are often enhanced by scholarships
 and foreign-sponsored studies. They are also filling jobs such as magistrates and
 customs inspectors once reserved only for their male colleagues.
 Violence against women occurs frequently. In particular, wife beating is an accept-
 ed practice and almost never prosecuted except within the context of the extended
 family and in the most extreme cases. This issue is largely ignored by the general
 Congolese population, including by the media. The police rarely intervene in domes-
 tic disputes. The new Govertment has not addressed the issue of violence against
 women. Local women's groups were more concerned with addressing economic and
 social problems than in focusing on issues such as rape.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Both the new Constitution and the Congolese Labor
 Code affirm the right of workers to associate freely, allowing no restrictions on the
 formation of trade unions.
 Formerly the Congo's only recognized union, the Congolese Trade Union Confed-
 eration (CSC) remains a powerful force and was still the only umbrella trade union
 organization in 1992. After the 1991 National Conference revoked the CSC s monop-
 oly status and abolished the check-off system which gave it much of its power ad-
 
 
 vantage, numerous small competing unions were established, including the General
 Confederation of Supervisors and Instructors (CGCAM), the Congolese Free Union
 of Teachers (SLEC), and the Free Union of Bank Workers (SLB).
 Unions are free to strike, but must file a notice of intent with the Ministry of
 Labor beforehand. In theory, a strike may not take place until after both parties
 have submitted to a process of nonbinding arbitration under the auspices of a re-
 gional labor inspector from the Ministry of Labor. In practice, this aspect of the Con-
 golese Labor Code is seldom enforced, and many strikes occurred without prior at-
 tempts to resolve disputes through arbitration. Often targeted were oil companies
 or oil-related service firms, public corporations employing railway and electrical
 maintenance workers, and the Government. The public sector was particularly hard
 hit by labor disputes which erupted into strikes at the Ministries of Agriculture,
 Mines and Energy Commerce, Culture, and Finance.
 Strikers most often sought increases in pay or other monetary benefits or, in the
 case of civil servants, wages overdue for a number of months.
 Unions are now free to join federations or confederations and affiliate with inter-
 national trade unions. Exercising this new freedom, some Congolese trade unions
 signed cooperative accords with other African, European, and American trade union
 organizations. Although the CSC has not formally disaffiliated from the Communist-
 dominated World Federation of Trade Unions, the relationship has all but dissolved
 due to lack of interest and funding.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Still adapting to the new re-
 ality of trade union pluralism, Congo has not yet reformed its old Labor Code, dat-
 ing from 1975, or adopted new laws to create a legal framework for collective bar-
 gaining. In the past, many benefits were legally mandated and industry-specific
 wage scales or "conventions were determined by negotiated agreement between rep-
 resentatives of -the CSC, the employer or employers' association, the Ministry of
 Labor, and the ruling Congolese Workers Party. Independent unions may now nego-
 tiate freely on their own or in cooperation with other unions, federations, or confed-
 erations.
 Under the Constitution, employers are forbidden from discriminating against em-
 ployees who exercise their constitutional right to organize or join a union. There are
 no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law, and there is no evidence of its practice in the formal economy. (See
 Section 5, however, for a discussion of allegations of the slave-like exploitation of
 Pygmies.)
 nimum Ale for Empl ment of Children.-The new Constitution specifically
 forbids any children under the age of 16 from working. The Ministry of Labor is
 responsible for enforcing child labor laws but rarely enforces them outside the for-
 mal wage sector. Children often work at younger ages on small family subsistence
 farms in rural areas and can be seen working in the informal economic sectors of
 Congo's cities without government interference.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government administratively sets a mini-
 mum wage at a level which in theory allows for "human dignity." In those trades
 still subject to "conventions" (see Section 6.b.), the negotiated minimum wages are
 without exception considerably higher than the legal minimum. Yet, even these
 preferential salary scales often set minimum wages quite low relative to the exorbi-
 tant cost of living in Congo. Many workers are obliged to hold second jobs, practice
 subsistence agriculture, or receive help from the extended family. During 1992 this
 was particularly true for government workers, who were forced to cope with salary
 arrears of several months.
 The Constitution guarantees paid holidays, periodic paid vacations, and limits on
 allowable hours of work. Furthermore, the Labor Code stipulates that overtime
 must be paid for all work in excess of 40 hours per week and regular days of leisure
 must be granted by employers. Although health and safety regulations require twice
 yearly visits by enforcement officers from the Ministry of Labor, in practice such in-
 spections occur on a much less regular basis.
