 MACAU
 Macau's current status is unique: This small piece of land,
 only 6 miles square, located near Hong Kong, is recognized by
 both China and Portugal as Chinete territory operating under
 Portuguese administration. The "Organic Statute" of 1976,
 which serves as Macau's constitution, grants it considerable
 administrative, economic, financial, and legislative autonomy.
 Macau's Governor, who holds expansive powers under the statute,
 is appointed by the Portuguese President following local
 consultation.
 Legislative power is shared by the Portuguese Government and
 the territory's Legislative Assembly. Portuguese metropolitan
 law serves as the basis for the legal system, which features
 Portuguese as the official language, an independent judiciary,
 and jury trials. The fundamental human rights contained in the
 Portuguese Constitution apply also in Macau. The small police
 force is firmly under the control of the civilian authorities.
 Macau's private enterprise economy is expected to grow about 3
 percent in 1991. This growth is fueled by legalized gambling,
 which has produced a thriving tourist industry, and by the
 export of textiles and other light industrial products,
 principally toys. With a population of less than half a
 million people, Macau has a per capita gross domestic product
 of over $6,900.
 Under the agreement reached between the Portuguese and Chinese
 Governments in 1987, Macau will become a Special Administrative
 Region (SAR) of China on December 20, 1999. Macau's current
 social, economic, and legal systems are supposed to remain
 basically unchanged during the first 50 years of the SAR's
 existence.
 Citizens of Macau enjoy a wide range of rights and freedoms.
 The principal human rights problem inherent in Macau's status
 as a territory is the restriction on the right of citizens to
 change their government. Although there are no legal
 restrictions on trade unions, there are de facto problems in
 realizing the full range of worker rights. Efforts are under
 way, in the form of followup diplomatic negotiations and the
 drafting of Macau's future constitution (basic law), to
 conclude the legal and other arrangements necessary to effect
 the transition to Chinese rule. Actions taken by Chinese
 .authorities against the prodemocracy movement on the mainland
 have affected local confidence negatively, prompting concern
 over the future effectiveness of such arrangements in
 safeguarding existing rights and freedoms.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no indications of such abuses being condoned or
 practiced by government authorities.
 b. Disappearance
 The authorities do not practice or condone secret arrests or
 clandestine confinements.

 MACAU
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Such abuses are prohibited by law and were not known to occur
 in 1991.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Legal prohibitions exist and are honored. The examining judge,
 who conducts the pretrial inquiry in criminal cases, has wide
 powers to collect evidence, order or dismiss indictments,
 validate and maintain the detention of suspects, and determine
 whether to release accused persons. Persons remanded in
 custody must be presented to an examining judge within 48 hours
 of being detained. The evidence is examined by the accused's
 counsel. If the judge is not convinced that the evidence is
 fully adequate, he may dismiss the accused, and the trial will
 not take place. Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair trial is guaranteed and practiced. The courts are
 independent of the executive. All are courts of first instance
 and are integrated into the Portuguese judicial system. Juries
 determine questions of fact in serious criminal cases.
 Decisions of the Macau courts are appealable to the superior
 Portuguese courts, which are empowered to uphold, amend, or
 reverse the decision of lower courts or to order a new trial,
 except where administrative acts are declared invalid.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Macau currently has in effect laws ensuring the inviolability
 of the home and of communication, the right of ownership of
 private property and of enterprises, and the freedom to marry
 and raise a family. There is no indication of any abuses
 either condoned or practiced by the government authorities.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Independent or critical opinions receive consistent airing in
 the mass media, public forums, and by public associations.
 Newspapers and television stations are privately owned. The
 academic community is free to express its views.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Legal guarantees exist and are observed in practice. With full
 cooperation of the local authorities, fully half the population
 participated in multiple, peaceful demonstrations in 1989 in
 support of the mainland prodemocracy movement.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Macau is a multireligious, predominantly Buddhist society.
 Other religions may and do exist and practice freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement is subject neither to arbitrary nor discriminatory
 limitation.

 MACU
 The Government's official policy since 1982 has been to guide
 all Vietnamese boat people arriving in Macau waters into or
 near Hong Kong territorial waters. While the Hong Kong
 Government does not endorse this practice and would like Macau
 to provide first asylum for Vietnamese, no formal protest has
 been lodged. The Government closed its only refugee center in
 July and moved the remaining 100 residents into public
 housing. Prior to the closing, the camp had been run as an
 open facility with virtually all able-bodied adults working in
 the local economy.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens have only a limited ability to change their
 government. The 17-member Legislative Assembly is an
 organizational hybrid in which 6 members are chosen in
 universal, direct elections, an additional 6 are indirectly
 elected by local community interests, and the remaining 5
 members are appointed by the Governor. The Consultative
 Council, an advisory group to the Governor, also provides some
 measure of popular representation. The Macau Government, by
 tradition, also consults informally on a regular basis with
 local business and cultural leaders.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 A local organization known as the Union of Democracy works
 openly to promote democratization and human rights in Macau.
 There have been no reports that any international or
 nongovernmental body has made 'any request to carry out human
 rights investigations in Macau.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Freedom from discrimination in these areas is guaranteed-by law
 and observed in practice. Because Macau's governmental and
 legal systems place a premium on knowledge of the Portuguese
 language and metropolitan law, about 60 percent of the
 approximately 130 senior government officials come from
 Portugal. Among the 700 people in the Government's
 professional grades, about half come from Portugal. Most of
 the other middle- and upper-ranking civil servants are
 Macanese. Legislation is now being drafted in both Chinese and
 Portuguese, and both languages have equal status in the
 Legislative Assembly and Consultative Council.
 By tradition and custom, women play a minor role in local
 political life. They are becoming more active and visible in
 business and government, and some enjoy considerable influence
 and responsibility in these areas. Reported cases of violence
 against women are not common. For cases that are reported,
 Macau's criminal statutes prohibiting domestic violence are
 enforced and violators are prosecuted. Abuses are reported by
 police and doctors to the Social Welfare Department, which
 investigates them. If hospital treatment is required, a
 medical social worker counsels the victim and informs her about
 social welfare services. Until their complaints are resolved,
 battered women may be placed in public housing, but no
 facilities are reserved especially for them.

 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Macau labor law recognizes the right and freedom of all workers
 to form and join trade unions and of private sector unions to
 strike. The Government neither impedes the formation of trade
 unions nor discriminates against union members. No strikes
 occurred in 1991. The police are legally prohibited from
 striking but occasionally engage in massive "job actions" which
 are strikes in all but name.
 Local trade union activities, including the selection of union
 leadership, are heavily influenced or directly controlled by
 the interests of the People's Republic of China, which places
 emphasis on maintaining Macau's economic and political
 stability with minimum disruptions in the work force. Nearly
 all of Macau's 7,000 private sector union members belong to a
 pro-PRC labor confederation. Many local observers claim that
 this organization is more interested in furthering the PRC
 political agenda in Macau than in addressing classic trade
 union issues. One tiny private sector union and all three
 public sector unions are outside PRC control.
 Macau unions may freely form federations and affiliate with
 international bodies. The three civil service unions are
 affiliated with the major non-Communist Portuguese union
 conferation, which itself has international labor ties.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Unions tend to resemble local traditional neighborhood
 associations, promoting social and cultural activities rather
 than issues relating to the workplace. Local custom, moreover,
 favors employment without the benefit of written labor
 contracts, the exception being the importation of labor from
 China, which is under contract. Reflecting the mainland
 Chinese influence, unions traditionally have not attempted to
 engage in collective bargaining. While Portuguese laws
 protecting collective bargaining apply to Macau, and the Macau
 Government does not impede or discourage collective bargaining,
 there are no government mechanisms to promote voluntary
 negotiations. There is no minimum wage law in Macau; wages are
 set by the market. Some workers complain that they do not dare
 speak out against unfair practices for fear of losing their
 jobs. Portuguese law applied to Macau prohibits antiunion
 discrimination. There were no complaints about this issue in
 1991. There are no export processing zones in Macau.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Compulsory labor is illegal and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Minors under the age of 15 are forbidden legally to work except
 in businesses operated by their immediate families. The law is
 enforced by the Macau Labor Department, which refers flagrantly
 offending employers to the judicial authorities for
 prosecution. The Labor Department claims that the incidence of
 child labor has declined radically since effective enforcement
 began in 1985. There were no prosecutions for child labor
 violations in 1991.

 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Existing labor legislation provides for a 48-hour workweek,
 (regularly 8 hours per day, but'no more than 10 1/2 hours per
 day), overtime, annual leave, medical and maternity care, and
 employee compensation insurance. The Labor Department is
 responsible for processing complaints. However, Government
 enforcement of the labor laws appears to be lax at times,
 partly owing to limited fiscal resources and personnel, but
 also as a matter of policy. Some workers complain that workers
 receive no assistance from the Government in disputes between
 workers and factories.
 In the absence of any statutory minimum wage or publicly
 admihistered social security program, some large companies have
 provided private welfare and security packages. Calls for
 labor reform, medical insurance, a social security system, and
 increases in. employee compensation figure regularly in
 political campaign platforms. To offset a current labor
 shortage, the Macau Government allows the importation of labor
 from China under contract, while at the same time imposing
 heavy fines on employers harboring illegal immigrants. The
 number of imported workers probably totals between 1,500 and
 3,000 workers out of an estimated work force of 195,000.
 Laws on occupational safety and health are enforced by the
 Macau Labor Department, which cited various employers for a
 total of 83 infractions last year. Failure to correct
 infractions leads to prosecution by the Macau Government.
