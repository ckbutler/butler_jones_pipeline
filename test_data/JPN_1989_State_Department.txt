 JAPAN
 Japan is a parliamentary democracy based on a constitution
 adopted in 1947. Sovereignty is vested in the people, and the
 Emperor is defined as the symbol df state. On the national
 level, power is divided among executive, legislative, and
 judicial branches. Executive power is vested in a cabinet,
 composed of a prime minister and ministers of state,
 responsible to the Diet, Japan's two-house parliament. The
 Diet, elected by universal suffrage and secret ballot,
 designates the prime'ninister, who must be a member of that
 body. Nearly 70 percent of the electorate usually votes in
 general'6lections, contested by six political parties covering
 a broad ideological spectrlum. The judicial system has several
 layers of courts, with the Supreme Court as final authority.
 A well-organized and disciplined national police force
 respects the human tights of the populace, although there have
 been reports of incidents of misconduct by individual police
 officers, including harsh treatment of prisoners-in custody.
 The police force is firmly under the control of the civil
 authorities, and there is no evfdence that it'resorts to
 extralegal measures in the discharge of its duties. The Civil
 Liberties Bureau in the Ministry of Justice and the Human
 Rights ahd Refugee Division in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
 monitor problems relating to human rights prictices in Japan.
 Japan's fr&e market economy has the world's second largest
 gross national product. Despite a second quarter net drop in
 gross national product caused by introduction of a 3-percent
 consumption tax, the economy has continued to expand rapidly
 due to increased consumer demand and capital investment.
 The Constitution states, "all of the people are equal under
 the law and there shall be no discrimination in political,
 economic, or social relations because of race, creed, sex,
 social status, or'familk origin." The human rights assured by
 the Constitution and Bill of Rights ate secured by a just and
 efficient legal system. However, alien residents, the
 "Burakumin" (a group traditionally treated as outcasts), the
 Ainu (Japanfs indigenous people), and women experience varying
 degrees of-discrimination. Current laws against
 discrimination cbntain'virtually no penalties for offenders.
 RESPECT FOR HUMANRIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudical Killing
 There were no knowncases of political or other extrajudicial
 killing. -
 b. Disappearance
 There were'no knowr-cases of'abducttons, secret arrests,
 clandestine detention, or hostage holding by security forces
 or any other organization.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from torture, cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment
 or punishment is guaranteed by the Constitution and respected
 
 
 868
 in practice. There is no evidence that penal treatment varies
 by social class, sex, or religion.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaranteed by
 the Constitution and respected in practice. Japanese law
 provides for judicial determination of the legality of
 detention. Persons cannot be detained without charge, and
 prosecuting authorities must be prepared to demonstrate before
 trial that probable cause exists to detain the accused. The
 length of time before a suspect is brought to trial depends on
 the nature of the crime but rarely exceeds 2 months; the
 average is 1 to 2 months. The Ministry of Justice has
 stipulated that a detained person should be able to meet with
 counsel within 48 hours of the accused's request, though this
 time limit has not been honored in a few cases. Counsel is
 provided at government expense when the arrested person cannot
 afford one. Preventive detention does not exist.
 Under the criminal procedure code, a suspect may be held in
 police custody for up to 72 hours. This period may be
 extended by a judge for up to 25 days if necessary. If an
 indictment follows, the suspect is transferred to a criminal
 detention facility. The Japan Bar Association opposes the
 legislation, which was first presented to the Diet in 1982
 (and defeated), on the grounds that police powers need to be
 reduced and more fundamental revisions of the detention system
 are necessary.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for the right to a speedy and public
 trial by an impartial tribunal in all criminal cases, and this
 right is respected in practice. The defendant is informed of
 charges upon arrest and assured a public trial by an
 independent civilian court with defense counsel and the right
 to cross-examination. The Constitution assures defendants the
 right not to be compelled to testify against themselves as
 well as free and private access to counsel, although the right
 to such access is sometimes abridged in practice. Defendants
 are also protected from the application of laws retroactively
 and have the right of access to incriminating evidence after a
 formal indictment has been made. Judges are appointed by the
 Cabinet for a 10-year term which can be renewed until the age
 of 65. Justices of the Supreme Court can serve until the age
 of 70, but face periodic review through popular referendum. A
 defendant who is dissatisfied with the decision of a trial
 court of first instance may, within the period prescribed by
 law, appeal to a higher court. There are several levels of
 courts, with the Supreme Court serving as the highest judicial
 authority. There is no trial by jury in Japan.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under the Constitution, each search or seizure must be made
 upon separate warrant issued by a judicial officer. The
 standards for issuing such warrants exist to guard against
 arbitrary searches. There are no reports that the Government
 or any other organization arbitrarily interfered with privacy,
 family, home, or correspondence.

 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution, an independent press and judiciary, and a
 functioning democratic political system combine to ensure
 freedom of speech and press.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These freedoms are guaranteed by the Constitution and
 -respected in practice.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a..
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution and
 respected in'practice. While Buddhism and Shintoism remain
 the two major religions, there are many others, including
 several'Christian denominations. Foreign missionaries are
 welcome and receive special visa status. Some temples and
 shrines receive public support as treasured national
 properties.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Japanese,*citizens have the right to travel freely, both within
 Japan and abroad, to change their place of residence, to
 emigrate, and to repatriate voluntarily. Japanese nationality
 can be lost by naturalization in a foreign country or failure
 to elect Japanese nationality at the proper age.
 In 1985 the Government agreed to the permanent settlement of a
 total of l0,O0G Vietnamese refugees of which about 6,200 have
 been processed. An organization was set up by the Government
 to train thdse refugees and find them jobs. Officials working
 with the immigrants say they face frequent police harassment
 and widespread di~criminition in obtaining housing, jobs, and
 health care.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Japanese citizens have the right and ability peacefully to
 change their government. A parliamentary democracy, Japan is
 ruled by the political party or parties able to form a
 majority in the loker house of its bicameral Diet. The
 Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has been in power on the
 national level-through control of the lower house--
 continuously since its establishment in 1955; however,
 opposition parties took control of the upper house of the Diet
 from the LDP in elections in July. Local and prefectural
 governmehts af6 often controlled by coalitions. Elections on
 all levels are held frequently, suffrage is universal, and
 ballots are secret.
 Postwar population movements have left some parliamentary
 electoral districts overrepresented, in a number of cases by
 more than a three-to-one ratio. The Supreme Court has called
 for greater equality in the value of votes, but the lack of a
 nonpartisan mechanism to make such changes has slowed the
 process of adjustment.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigations of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government does not obstruct or inhibit the investigative
 activities of international nongovernmental organizations.
 Japan is a member of the U.N. Human Rights Commission.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The exclusive nature of Japanese society, reinforced by
 cultural and ethnic homogeneity and a long tradition of
 isolation from other cultures, has impeded the integration of
 minority groups. Although the legal system has gradually
 evolved toward granting equal opportunity to minorities,
 entrenched social prejudice against both Korean residents
 (most of whom were born, raised, and educated in Japan) and
 the Burakumin (descendants of feudal era "outcasts" who
 practiced so-called unclean professions such as butchering and
 undertaking) has restricted the access of both groups to
 private housing, employment, and marriage opportunities. The
 Ainu, descendants of the original inhabitants of Japan, also
 have complained of discrimination, especially regarding
 employment opportunities. Societal alienation has also been
 faced by the nearly 100,000 illegal immigrants, mostly from
 south and southeast Asia, who have come in search of jobs,
 enticed by a labor shortage and the high value of the yen in
 the last few years. Although they suffer social
 discrimination, as Japanese citizens Burakumin and Ainu enjoy
 equal protection under the Constitution. The Government also
 has enacted a special budget measure for area improvement
 projects, which provides funds until 1992 to complete projects
 started under a similar law which expired last year. That
 law, first issued in 1969, was designed to help assimilate
 Burakumin into mainstream society through a number of social,
 economic, and legal Rrograms.
 In recent years the Government has enacted several laws and
 regulations extending to permanent resident aliens, 82 percent
 of whom are Koreans, equal access to public housing and loans,
 social security pensions for those qualified, and certain
 public employment rights. However, antidiscrimination laws
 affecting Korean residents were initiated as government
 guidance and are not backed up by penalty provisions, which
 makes enforcement difficult.
 The Government addressed an issue of concern to resident
 Koreans in 1987 in revising the Alien Registration Law to
 require a single fingerprinting of foreign residents rather
 than repeated fingerprinting at 5-year intervals. Human
 rights activists representing Korean residents have called for
 complete abolition of the fingerprinting requirement.
 In February, following the death of the Emperor, the Ministry
 of Justice announced a general amnesty which pardoned, among
 others, approximately 10,000 people who had violated an
 earlier alien registration law. Some critics of the present
 law plan to challenge the section that requires a person to
 carry his registration card at all times.
 According to law, aliens with 5 years, continuous residence
 are eligible for naturalization and the simultaneous
 acquisition of citizenship rights, including the right to
 vote. In fact, however, relatively few eligible aliens have
 
 
 871
 JAPAN
 been naturalized. Many permanent residents are unwilling to
 seek naturalization, fearing their cultural identity would be
 erased by that act. A high intermarriage rate and changes in
 the naturalization law several years ago to allow Japanese
 women, as well as men, to convey citizenship to the offspring
 of mixed marriages will eventually reduce the number of
 noncitizen Korean residents of Japan.
 The position of women in society and the home, although
 significantly improved during the last few decades, continues
 to reflect deep-seated traditional values in which women play
 a subordinate role. In this environment, violence against
 women, particularly domestic violence, often goes unreported
 due to social and cultural concerns for shaming one's family
 or endangering the reputation 6f one's spouse'or offspring.
 Typically, victimized women more often return to the home of
 their parents rather than file reports with authorities. The
 Ministry of Justice maintains no statistics on reported crimes
 specifically victimizing women and was unable to provide
 estimates for those cases which go unreported. Local
 governments have begun to respond to a need for confidential
 assistance by establishing special women's consultation
 departments in police and prefectural offices.
 Discrimination by private employers against women is
 prohibited by the Constitution. Women comprise 40 percent of
 the employed population. Legislation over the past 30 years
 has been adjusted to accord them the same legal status as
 men. The-Equal Employment Opportunity Law of 1986 was aimed
 at eliminating sex discrimination in such'areas as
 recruitment, pay, and working hours. Under this law, the
 Ministry of Labor attempts to induce corporate compliance with
 its objectives by positive inducements, including subsidies;
 it does not enforce them through fines or other punitive
 measures. According to some experts on the situation of women
 in the workplace, the law has been a valuable tool in
 promoting change in employment practices. Other observers
 believe that the law as written does not achieve sufficient
 compliance from employers. In any case; significant
 disparities'in pay and access to managerial positions
 persist.. ,The-public awareness of sexual harassment in the
 workplace as a problem appears to be on the rise, as indicated
 by an increased frequency of press reports in 1989.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The right of association as defined by the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) is protected. The right of workers to
 organize, bargain, and act collectively is assured by the
 Constitution. Approximately 26.6 percent of the active work
 force belongs to unions. Unions are free of government
 control and influence. There is no requirement for a single
 trade union-structure, and there are no restrictions on who
 may be a union official. Most unions are involved in
 political activity as well as labor relations. The right to
 strike is implicitly assUmed by the Constitution, and it was
 exercised frequently in 1989. Public employees, however, do
 not have the right to strike, although they do have recourse
 to mediation and arbitration in order to resolve disputes. In
 exchange for a ban on their right to strike, government
 employees, pay raises are determined by the Government based
 on a recommendation by the independent National Personnel
 Authority (NPA). The right of Japan's fire fighters to
 
 
 872
 JAPAN
 organize has been debated in the ILO for over 30 years. At
 the end of its 1989 deliberations, the ILO's Committee on the
 Application of Standards expressed the firm hope that the
 discussions with representative trade unions would be
 intensified and that they would soon lead to the recognition
 of the fire fighters' right to organize in conformity with
 Convention 87 on Freedom of Association. Unions are active in
 international bodies, most notably the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions, and maintain extensive
 international contacts.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Constitution states that unions have the right to
 organize, bargain, and act collectively and these rights are
 exercised in practice. Antiunion discrimination is prohibited
 by law and in practice. Members of the armed forces, police,
 and fire fighters are not permitted to organize. Japanese law
 also allows unions to lobby and to make political campaign
 contributions. There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Labor Standards Law prohibits the use of forced labor, and
 there are no known cases of forced or compulsory labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Under the revised Labor Standards Law of 1987, minors under 15
 years of age may not be employed as workers and those under
 the age of 18 years may not be employed in dangerous or
 harmful work. Child labor laws are rigorously enforced by the
 Labor Inspection Division of the Ministry of Labor.
 e.   Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Labor Standards Law provides for the phased reduction of
 maximum working hours from the present 46-hour/6-day workweek
 to 40 hours by early in the 1990's. Although introduced as a
 means of increasing the leisure time available to the work
 force, the law has been criticized by employee groups because
 of the increased flexibility it gives employers in calculating
 actual working hours and vacation benefits. Nevertheless,
 despite the fact that 1988 (the last year for which figures
 are available) was a year of strong business expansion, annual
 hours worked showed a modest decline, reversing a trend which
 saw them increase annually since 1975.
 Minimum wages are set regionally, not nationally. For
 example, effective October 1989, the Tokyo metropolitan area
 minimum wage wac $3.75 hourly. This is the highest regionally
 set minimum. The minimum wage for Kagoshima prefecture was
 $3.18, Japan's lowest regional minimum wage. In addition,
 regions have minimum wage rates for certain industries. These
 vary from region to region, but they are higher than the
 regional minimum wage rates, which are not industry-specific.
 These wage rates are sufficient to provide workers and their
 families with a decent living. The Ministry of Labor
 effectively administers various laws and regulations governing
 occupational health and safety, principal among which is the
 Industrial Safety and Health Law of 1972.
