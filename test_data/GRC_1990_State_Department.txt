 GREECE
 Greece is a constitutional republic and parliamentary
 democracy. In-freely and vigorously contested parliamentary
 elections in April,-thet-conservative New Democracy party.put
 together a bare majority-and formed a government under Prime
 Minister Constantine Mitsotakis. The President, the largely
 ceremonial Head of State, is elected by Parliament every 5
 years.
 Activities of the .police and security services are monitored
 by a-free press and an independent judiciary, although some
 human rights groups believe that such oversight is less
 effective in cases involving the Turkish-speaking and other
 minority groups. Occasional instances are -reported of police
 mistreatment of criminal suspects.
 One of the least developed countries in the European Community
 (EC), Greece has a state sector bloated by a long tradition of
 politically motivated hirings, and it is dependent on EC
 subsidies. Government efforts to reduce the budget deficit
 and strengthen the private sector are hampered by, among other
 things, a high-degree of polarization among the political
 -parties, which extends-to the labor federations, employer
 .associations, and the bureaucracy.itself.
 The Constitution protects all fundamental human rights.
 However, discrimination against some ethnic, religious, and
 cultural minorities persists (see Section 5). The Government
 has indicated its intent to address certain complaints of the
 Muslim (primarily Turkish) minority in Western Thrace. It
 denies the existence of a Slavic-speaking ("Macedonian")
 minority entitled to claim rights within the framework of the
 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. There
 appears to be a pattern of obstacles to social, cultural, and
 religious contacts between that minority and other
 Slavomacedonians, many of whom were exiled from Greece to
 Yugoslavia and elsewhere during the 1940's. About 400
 Jehovah's Witnesses are in prison due to the absence of
 nonmilitary alternative service to conscription.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Neither government forces nor legal opposition organizations
 engage in political killings. Responsibility for the murder
 of a prison psychiatrist in February was claimed by a domestic
 terrorist group.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of official abductions, secret arrests,
 or clandestine detentions during 1990.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 -Treatment or Punishment
 A 1984 law, never yet invoked, makes the use of torture an
 offense punishable by a sentence of from 3 years to life
 imprisonment. Greek human rights groups contend that police
 are overly reliant on confessions, leading to occasional
 mistreatment or intimidation of criminal suspects. Amnesty
 
 
 1167
 GREECE
 Internatiopal-(AI) brought several such cases to the attention
 of the Government in 1990. A, small number of cases of police
 mistreatment were investigated in 1990 without charges being
 brQught- against police. Late in'1990, prisoners took over
 several prisons to protest overcrowding and poor treatment.
 Order was restored with minimal force following pledges by the
 Justice Ministry- that improvemehits would be made in the early
 release program.
 Spurred by international protests over the poor treatment
 received by the severely mentally handicapped inmates of a
 psychiatric facilityon the remote island of Leros, the
 Government in 1990 undertook a long-range program to release
 the less severely handicapped:apd create smaller, better-
 staffed facilities closer to the homes of the remaining
 inmates.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution states that a judicial warrant is required
 for any arrest exgept-during the actual commission of a
 crime. The legal-system generally protects.againstarbitrary
 arrest orders. Occasionally, suspects are briefly and
 informally detained pending.confirmation of their identity,
 but there is no evidence of any serious infringement of civil
 liberties. A person arrested on the basis of a warrant or
 while-committing'a crime must be brought before an examining
 magistrate within-24 hours and charged. The magistrate must
 issue a-warrant of imprisonment or.,order the release of the
 detainee within 3.days of the examination unless special
 circumstances require a 2-day extension-of this time limit.
 The effective maximum duration of detention pending trial is
 18 months for felonies and 9 months for misdemeanors.- Release
 pending trial, with or without bail, is granted in limited
 cases by decision of a judicial council.
 Exile is unconstitutional and does not occur, except in the
 form,-f an administrative decree of the loss of citizenship by
 nonethnic-Greeks (see Section 2.d.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for fair and public trials. The
 independence .of the-judiciary is provided for by the
 Constitution, but judges are occasionally accused of allowing
 politicalcriteria to influence their judgments. Defendants
 enjoy a presumption of innocence, and defense lawyers are
 available to all accused persons. A defendant or his attorney
 may confront witnesses. Court sessions are public, unless the
 court decides that privacy is required for the protection of
 victims or in matters of national security. The latter
 provision is not.abused.- A defendant may appeal a court
 verdict to.an appeals-court. The decisions of military
 courts, however, .are.not subject to review by the Supreme
 Court, and these courts are criticized for inadequately
 safeguarding the rights of defendants. Military courts have
 no jurisdictioi over civilians, except in draft refusal cases.
 The arrest-and conviction of Muslim activist Ahmet Sadik, on
 charges of "fomenting discord" by insisting on the Turkish
 identity of the Muslim minority (see Section 5), provoked
 widespread accusations (e~g., from AI). that the charges were
 political and that Sadik's trial by aKomotini court did not
 meet international judicial norms. Aix appeals court
 
 
 1168
 GREECE
 subsequently commuted his sentence to a fine. There are
 currently no political prisoners in Greece.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Greek authorities generally comply with constitutional
 prohibitions against invasions of privacy, searches without
 warrants, and monitoring of personal communications. Judicial
 warrants showing probable cause are required for home
 searches. A series of early morning police raids in September
 on the houses of persons suspected of involvement in terrorism
 provoked wide public outcry. A former Prime Minister awaited
 trial at the end of 1990 on illegal wiretapping charges.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and the press is provided for in the
 Constitution and generally respected in practice. The
 Constitution allows for the seizure of publications which
 insult the President, offend religious beliefs, contain
 obscene articles, advocate violent overthrow of the political
 system, or disclose military and defense information. Charges
 are occasionally filed against newspapers for articles which
 "insult authority." Late in 1990 a prosecutor filed charges
 against several major newspapers for printing the proclamation
 of a leftist human rights group in support of some alleged
 terrorists. Almost all convictions on such charges are
 reversed on appeal or commuted to nominal fines. A new
 antiterrorism law passed in December 1990 gives the prosecutor
 the right to ban publication of terrorist proclamations on
 pain of large civil penalties.
 In an effort to reduce ethnic activism by minorities, the
 security services seize most Turkish and Yugoslav Macedonian
 publications at the border. Members of the Muslim minority
 contend that the security services jam broadcasts by Turkish
 state television to Western Thrace, an accusation denied by
 the Greek Government.
 Commercial television was legalized in 1989, and private
 channels now air a wide range of political viewpoints. The
 state-owned television channels tend to emphasize the views of
 the government in power but allot time to the activities of
 opposition figures. Academic freedoms are protected by
 democratically chosen faculty organizations, though such
 groups tend to be highly politicized.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly. Police
 permits are routinely issued for public demonstrations, and
 there were no reports that the permit requirement was abused
 in 1990.
 The right of association is provided for by the Constitution.
 However, requests by a minority group to found a "Macedonian
 Cultural Center" in Florina were reportedly turned down by
 Greek authorities. The Supreme Court ruled that the bylaws of
 Turkish minority associations in Western Thrace were
 incompatible with Greek law, !ue to their use of the term
 "Turkish" to refer to their members (see Section 5). In
 August the district governor of Florina reportedly barred
 
 
 1169
 GREECE
 cultural festivities that included performances by a
 Macedonian musical group.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and
 prohibits discrimination against religious minorities. The
 Constitution also establishes the Greek Orthodox Church, to
 which 98'percent of the population at least nominally adheres,
 as the "prevailing" religion, and prohibits proselytism by any
 religious group. In the first 6 months of 1990, 44 Jehovah's
 Witnesses were arrested for proselytism, primarily for
 distributing pamphlets. Only a handful were convicted and
 sentenced, including an 86-year-old man who died before his
 appeal could be'heard.
 Although Greece provides for alternative noncombatant military
 service, it has no provision for nonmilitary alternative
 national service to its universal conscription of men. In
 September approximately 385 Jehovah's Witnesses were serving
 prisonsentences of between 3 and 5 years after having. been
 convicted by military courts for refusal to serve. A portion
 of this sentence may be served in a minimum security
 (civil'ian') agricultural prison, where each day served is
 credited as 2 days toward fulfillment of the sentence. The
 Jehovah's Witness organization complains that transfers to the
 agricultural prison have been blocked and that members of the
 sect are singled out for discriminatory treatment in the
 overcrowded military prison. Jehovah's Witnesses complain
 that the Government does not grant Jehovah's Witness clerics
 the exemption from military service accorded Orthodox and
 other recognized clerics. Three ministers from the Jehovah's
 Witnesses were in prison in 1990 for refusing military
 service. Late in 1990, the Supreme Administrative Tribunal
 found in favor of one of the three ministers, overturning a
 ruling by the Ministry of National Education and Religious
 Affairs that the Jehovah's Witness faith was not a "known
 religion."
 Mosques and other Muslim religious institutions operate in
 Western Thrace, where the bulk of Greece's Muslims reside. In
 December, some members of the Muslim minority, denying the
 validity of-the Government's appointment of the Mufti (supreme
 religious leader) of Komotini, moved to elect their own Mufti,
 appealing'to a never-applied 1920 statute: The Government
 responded just before that election with a Presidential decree
 abrogating the 1920 statute, confirming the 10-year tenure of
 the current Mufti, and codifying procedures under which the
 Minister of Education and Religion (with the advice of an
 11-member committee of prominent local Muslims appointed by
 the regional governor) will henceforth choose the Mufti from
 the candidates who present themselves.
 Another Presidential decree was also in progress at year's
 end, designed to address a longstanding complaint about local
 control of Muslim religious endowments (WAKF). The decree
 provides for direct election of five-member WAKF committees by
 the minority.
 Independent Muslim Member of Parliament Ahmet Sadik, a sponsor
 of the attempt to elect a new mufti, complained that the
 minority had not been consulted on either measure. Members of
 the minority also complain that district authorities have
 blocked permits for the maintenance and repair of some
 
 
 1170
 
 GREECE
 religious buildings, e.g., by demanding proof of title which
 is not available.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution protects freedom of movement within the
 country, foreign travel, and emigration. Ethnic Greeks
 intending.to emigrate and emigrants who return to Greece
 experience no discrimination. However, Article 19 of the
 Greek citizenship code makes a legal distinction between Greek
 citizens who are ethnic Greeks and those who are not. Under
 that article, nonethnic Greek citizens may be deprived of
 their citizenship by a simple administrative decree if it is
 determined that they moved abroad with the apparent intent not
 to return. There is no hearing or judicial review, and no
 effective right of appeal. No statistics on loss of
 citizenship are published.
 At least 122 Muslim Greek citizens lost their citizenship in
 1988, and an additional 66 as of June 1990. Minority leaders
 allege that many of those.deprived of citizenship did, in
 fact, intend to return to Greece. (They also say that a
 smaller number lost citizenship in 1989.) An official of the
 Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the U.S. Embassy that the
 Government intends to introduce legislation abolishing Article
 19.
 Greece maintains a large military zone along its northern
 border, in areas where many members of the Pomak and
 Slavomacedonian minorities reside. Within the zone, movements
 are strictly controlled, even for local inhabitants. Critics
 charge that this zone is used as a means of controlling the
 activities of the minorities. Foreign diplomats are allowed
 into the zone only with special authorization.
 Greek civil war refugees of Slavic ethnicity, who were
 stripped of their Greek citizenship for participation in the
 Communist-led insurrection of 1946-49, were expressly excluded
 from the general amnesty and return of exiles completed in
 1982.
 Increasingly a destination for economic migrants, Greece
 offers temporary asylum to a large number of bona fide and
 other refugees from Eastern Europe, Africa, and the Middle
 East. In 1990-Greece struggled to resettle more 20,000 ethnic
 Greeks from the Soviet Union and confronted a sudden influx of
 some 5,000 refugees from Albania late in December. The
 Government expects the influx from the Soviet Union to
 continue in 1991.
 Resettlement is not available for most refugees who are not
 ethnic Greeks. Because of limited resources and unclear
 regulations, many bona fide refugees end up working illegally
 at subsistence wages.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Greece is a multiparty democracy in which all citizens enjoy
 full political rights, without regard to race, sex, religion,
 or political persuasion. Greek citizens freely choose the
 officials governing them. The President is elected by
 Parliament to a 5-year term. Members of the unicameral
 
 
 1171
 
 GREECE
 Parliament are elected to maximum 4-year terms by compulsory
 universal suffrage (over age 18) and secret ballot.
 Opposition parties function freely, have broad access to the
 media, hold public meetings, and serve as a check on actions
 by the Government. In April the conservative New Democracy
 Party-won exactly half the seats in parliamentary elections
 (the third set of elections 'since June 1989), and a majority
 government under Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis was
 -formed with the support-of the single deputy from the centrist
 Democratic Renewal.Party. There are no restrictions, in law
 or in practice, on the participation of women in government or
 polltics.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has not objected to visits and investigations
 by human -rights organizations. However, visits by diplomats
 to the border regions, where Greece's minority populations
 reside, are subject to prior notification to and occasional
 refusal by the Government, as well as surveillance by the
 security services. Domestic human rights organizations are
 allowed to operate freely and actively assist Greeks who
 believe their rights have been violated. In 1990 domestic
 human rights groups did not direct their attention to minority
 issues inside Gr~eece.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The public perception in Greece of ethnic and religious
 minorities is influenced by history. In the public mind, a
 "Greek" has a Greek name, speaks the Greek language, and is an
 adherent of the Greek Orthodox faith. Persons not meeting
 these criteria tend to be regarded as outsiders or foreigners,
 evenif their ancestors have resided within the borders of the
 modern Greek state for centuries. Conversely, immigrants of
 Greek ethnic origin from the Soviet Union are now being
 accepted by the public as "Greek" even though their ancestors
 came from Asia Minor and never resided in Greece.
 Under the Treaty of Lausanne, Greece recognizes an official
 Muslim minority in Western Thrace, now comprising some 130,000
 Turks, Pomaks, and Gypsies. There are smaller Turkish
 communities (with no formal legal status) in the Dodecanese
 islands and in Athens and other industrial areas. Pomaks
 (Bulgarian-speaking Muslims) occupy the mountainous border
 with Bulgaria, and Gypsies (both Christian and Muslim) are
 scattered throughout Greece. There are remnant populations
 speaking Albanian, Vlach (related to Romanian), and
 Slavomacedonian dialects.
 A violent incident in the Western Thrace city of Komotini on
 January 29, in which Christian extremists smashed and looted
 Muslim-owned shops without interference from nearby police,
 called international attention to a pattern of economic and
 societal discrimination affecting the minority. Greek
 government policy in recent years has reflected the concern
 that Muslims would eventually become, through their relatively
 high birthrate, a clear majority in Western Thrace and would
 settle in the district of Evros which adjoins the Turkish
 border. As a result of that concern, members of the Muslim
 minority have-been almost completely prevented from purchasing
 
 
 1172
 
 GREECE
 land in Western Thrace, have been denied access to subsidized
 bank credits available to Christians there, and have faced
 serious informal obstacles to receiving building permits,
 tractor licenses, and other documentation needed to create
 small businesses or exercise certain professions. Muslims
 generally have not been hired by the state sector, and the
 private employers in the depressed economy of the region also
 have given employment preference to Christians. Large-scale
 land expropriations for public projects have tended to be
 concentrated in Muslim-owned areas. Muslims who migrated
 elsewhere in Greece have faced little'or no official
 discrimination. Muslims who have moved to Turkey or elsewhere
 for work or study have risked having their citizenship revoked
 under Article 19 of the Greek citizenship code.
 There are some indications that the Mitsotakis Government may
 be shifting its policy regarding Western Thrace to emphasize
 economic development and reduce official discrimination.
 Press reports confirm anecdotal evidence that hundreds of
 long-delayed driver's licenses and firearms permits were
 issued to minority members during the summer of 1990. Muslim
 sources report that some land purchases by Muslims were
 approved in 1990, while other Muslims finally received title
 deeds on family holdings. Planned expropriations for an
 agricultural prison were canceled.
 The Treaty of Lausanne guarantees the right to Turkish-
 language education for the minority (and reciprocally for the
 Greek minority in Istanbul). Chronic disputes with Turkey
 over teachers and textbooks have left the minority school
 system with outdated textbooks, poorly equipped schools, and
 inadequately trained teachers. The imposition, only on the
 minority school system, of a secondary school entrance
 examination given in Greek has reduced minority school
 enrollment.
 Muslim villages elect Muslim mayors. In the principal towns
 in Western Thrace, Komotini and Xanthi, Muslims Are elected as
 town councilors. Muslim candidates participated in the slates
 of the three major national parties in the April parliamentary
 elections and October municipal elections. Two independent
 Muslim candidates were elected to Parliament in April.
 However, a new electoral law voted by the Government late in
 1990 set a 3-percent nationwide threshold which will
 effectively preclude the election of minority candidates who
 are not sponsored by a major party.
 The Government, backed by Supreme Court rulings, bars attempts
 by ethnic Turks to assert their Turkish (and hence ethnic)
 minority status rather than the Muslim religious status
 dictated by the Greek interpretation of the Treaty of
 Lausanne. One of the two Muslim deputies in the current
 Parliament, Ahmet Sadik, won an overwhelming share of the
 minority vote after insisting in his platform on the ethnic
 Turkish identity of the minority and campaigning for an end to
 economic discrimination and for improved Turkish-language
 education. Sadik insisted, however, that he is a loyal Greek
 citizen operating within the Greek political system.
 Northern Greece has a Slavophone Orthodox population, largely
 rural and economically relatively underdeveloped, numbering
 probably between 20,000 and 50,000, the remnant of a much
 larger population that emigrated before and during the Greek
 Civil War (1946-49) into Yugoslavia (the Socialist Federal
 Republic of Macedonia) or abroad. The Government denies that
 
 
 1173
 GREECE
 this population has a minority ethnic conciousness and imposes
 restrictions on minority contacts with Yugoslavia to prevent
 the development of such a consciousness and to encourage the
 full assimilation of the population. For example, tight visa
 requirements bar Yugoslavs suspected of Macedonian activism,
 as well as some U.S. citizens of Slavic descent, from entering
 Greece. Greece does not recognize the existence of a
 Macedonian language and denies the validity of studies
 undertaken or documents presented in that language. There are
 no minority schools or language classes, in accordance with
 the Greek insistence that Slavomacedonian is a nonliterate
 dialect.
 There are broad constitutional and legal protections for
 women; for example, equal pay is mandated for equal work.
 However, women are only gradually becoming represented in the
 higher echelons of business and government, as traditional
 social barriers recede. The Government has a General
 Secretariat-for Equality of the Sexes, which coordinates
 efforts to remove these barriers.
 Violence against women is a problem identified by women's
 rights groups, but there is a strong cultural bias against
 reporting cases of rape, incest, and wife beating. There are
 no reliable statistics to indicate its extent. Police and
 local authorities generally do not intervene in domestic
 conflicts. *The social infrastructure for battered women is
 almost nonexistent, despite past funding by the European
 Community. Women's groups continue to press the Government,
 which acknowledges the need for more active measures.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 All workers except the military and police are entitled to
 form or join unions of their own choosing. The right of
 association is provided for in the Constitution and in -
 specific legislation passed in 1978 and amended in 1982. In
 1990 an estimated 35 percent of wage and salary earners were
 organized in unions.
 Unions receive most of their funding through a Ministry of
 Labor organization, the Workers' Hearth, which distributes
 mandatory contributions from employees and employers. Only a
 few of the more powerful unions have dues-withholding
 provisions in their contracts with employers. The
 International Labor Organization (ILO) has expressed concern
 about the Workers' Hearth and its status as a government
 agency. New labor legislation passed in December will
 eliminate Workers' Hearth funding for labor unions effective
 in January 1992.
 More than 4,000 unions are grouped into regional and sectoral
 federations and two umbrella confederations, one for civil
 servants and the other for private sector workers. The unions
 are highly politicized, with factions within the labor
 confederations and individual unions linked with each of the
 principal political parties, but they are not controlled by
 the parties or the Government in their day-to-day operations.
 There are no restrictions on who may be a union official.
 There are no restrictions on international contacts. Greek
 unions are affiliated with several international trade union
 secretariats, and the General Confederation of Greek Labor
 (GSEE) is affiliated with the European Trade Union
 
 
 1174
 GREECE
 Confederation and the International Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions.
 Some 300 to 350 strikes took place during the past year,
 including broad public sector strikes in September and
 December which caused considerable disruption and public
 irritation at the labor federations. Although the courts can
 declare strikes illegal, the effective right to strike was
 legally restricted in 1990 only by the Government's power to
 declare the civil mobilization of workers when there is a
 danger to national security, life, or property, or to the
 social and economic life of the country. This provision is
 used sparingly, but is considered by the ILO to exceed the
 standards of ILO Convention 87 on freedom of association. In
 September, following a prolonged bank employee strike, the
 Government mobilized 30 Bank of Greece employees needed to pay
 the salaries of public employees.
 Addressing union complaints that most labor disputes ended in
 compulsory arbitration, legislative remedies were enacted in
 1989 which provide for mediation procedures with compulsory
 arbitration as a last resort. In 1990 the Ministry of Labor
 was still working on implementing procedures to bring the law
 into effect.
 In December the Government enacted legislation which
 eliminates the Workers' Hearth payments to unions and will
 restrict the right to strike by requiring skeleton staffs
 during strikes in public service institutions--electricity,
 transportation, communications, banking-which serve "social
 needs" defined by the Government. A general strike took place
 in December to protest the antistrike law. Full implications
 of the new law will not be clear until it is implemented.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize and bargain collectively is ensured by
 legislation passed in 1955 and amended in 1990. Antiunion
 discrimination is prohibited. Complaints of discrimination
 against union members or organizers may be referred to the
 Labor Inspectorate or to the courts, where most cases are
 resolved. Recent court rulings have mandated the
 reinstatement of improperly fired union organizers.
 There are no restrictions on collective bargaining for private
 workers, although social security benefits, legislated by
 Parliament, are excluded from the collective bargaining
 process. Civil servants collectively negotiate their demands
 with the Office of the Minister to the Prime Minister, but
 have no formal system of collective bargaining. Greece has no
 export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by the Constitution
 and is not practiced. The ILO's Committee of Experts,
 however, continued in 1990 to express concern over legislation
 dealing with mobilization in emergencies and punishment of
 seamen, which it considers not in conformity with the ILO
 Conventions on forced labor. The Government has responded
 that it has initiated reform of the emergency mobilization
 legislation and that it does not consider the maritime
 legislation to violate the Conventions.
 
 
 1175
 GREECE
 d. Minimum Age of Employment of Children
 The minimum age for work in industry is 15, with higher limits
 in certain activities. In family businesses, theaters, and
 the cinema, the minimum age is 12 years. Enforced by
 occasional'labor inspectorate spot checks, these age limits
 are generally respected. However, families engaged in
 agriculture, food service, or merchandising often have younger
 family members assisting at least part time.
 " e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum.ages and salaries, established by the national
 collective bargaining agreement (negotiated annually between
 the GSEE and the Employers' Association) and by branch
 collective agreements, are generally respected by employers.
 In May, however, the Government froze wage indexation for 4
 months, thereby violating the national collective bargaining
 agreement. The Government cited imminent economic crisis and
 previous excessive wage increases to justify this action. The
 minimum wage established by negotiated agreements was $20 per
 day as of September, sufficient for a decent standard of
 living.
 The maximum legal workweek is 40 hours in the private sector
 and 37.5 hours in the public sector. Legislation in July 1989
 allowed greater flexibility in business hours as long as, over
 a period of time, the average workweek did not exceed the
 legal maximum. The law mandates an annual paid holiday of 1
 month per year and sets maximum limits on overtime.
 Minimum standards of occupational health and safety are
 provided for by legislation. Although the GSEE characterizes
 health and safety legislation as satisfactory, it charges that
 the enforcement of the legislation, the responsibility of the
 Labor Inspectorate, is inadequate, citing statistics
 indicating a relatively high number of job-related accidents
 in Greece. Inadequate inspection, failure to enforce
 compliance with regulations, outdated industrial plants and
 equipment, and poor safety training of employees all
 contribute to the accident rate. Inspectors are prohibited
 from divulging the names of workers who lodge complaints about
 unsafe working conditions.
