 MAURITANIA
 President Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya has ruled Mauritania since 1984, first
 as head of a military junta and since 1992 as head of an elected civilian Govern-
 ment. The January 1992 presidential elections, however, were widely regarded by
 observers as fraudulent. In April 1992, there were elections-boycotted by most op-
 position parties--for a new civilian Parliament to replace the Military Committee
 which had previously functioned as the country's legislative body. The 1991 Con-
 stitution delegates most powers to the executive; the Parliament, composed of a Sen-
 ate and a National Assembly, posed no challenge to the executive's dominance. The
 sition boycott also gave the President's party, the Democratic and Social Repub-
 lian Party (PRDS) , effective control over Parliament.
 The President and the Government have strong military support. Mauritanian se-
 curity forces number between 19,000 and 20,000 and include the regular armed
 forces, the National Guard, the Gendarmerie (a specialized corps of paramilitary po-
 lice), and the police. The Gendarmerie is directed by the Ministry of Defense, while
 the National Guard and police come under the Ministry of Interior. The security
 forces continued to engage in human rights violations, but the incidence and sever-
 ity of violations continued to drop from the massive scale of abuses during 1989-
 91. The security forces, especially the military, are dominated by the Arabic-speak-
 ing (Hassaniya) Maurs.
 Most of Mauritania's 2.1 million inhabitants, either nomadic herders, settled
 farmers, or small merchants and traders, live within a market-oriented subsistence
 economy. Mauritania is burdened with numerous long-term economic and social
 problems: drought, desertification, insect infestation, extensive unemployment, one
 of the highest per capita foreign debts in Africa, minimal infrastructure, inadequate
 health and education systems, and rapid urbanization. Low rainfall levels over the
 past years have forced large numbers of nomads to settle, with a consequent weak-
 ening of traditional nomadic culture, a severe strain on government resources, and
 increased ethnic tensions with the sedentary African, non-Hassaniya-speaking farm-
 ers in the south (see Section 5).
 While the observance of human rights improved, there was only limited progress
 in resolving major human rights violations of previous years. The political system
 still fell far short of a genuine democracy; despite numerous parties, the regime's
 legitimacy remained in question with a large part of the electorate-namely, many
 African non-Hassaniya-speakinj citizens-excluded from effective political represen-
 tation. Some 56,000 African-Mauritanians, among the approximately 60,000 ex-
 
 
 178
 pelled in the 1989-90 period, remained in refugee settlements in Senegal. Most were
 waiting to be repatriated and to be reimbursed for their lost property and belong-
 ings. Ethnic tensions remained high because of the Government s failure to bring
 to account those responsible for the bloody purge conducted by the military among
 its own ranks from September 1990 through March 1991, in which approximately
 500 persons-almost entirely from Mauritania's black African ethnic groups (largely
 Halpulaar and Soninke)-are believed to have died, and many hundreds more were
 tortured and maimed. In June the PRDS-dominated Parliament aggravated the sit-
 uation by passing an amnesty bill to preclude legal pursuit of those involved in this
 purge.
 The Government undertook efforts to restructure the judiciary, including abolish-
 ing the Special Security Court, but in practice, the right of fair trial remained re-
 stricted, the police continued to mistreat suspects, and slavery remained a problem.
 Violence against women became an issue for open discussion.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Exirajudicial Killing.-While it was not clear whether secu-
 rity forces were acting under orders or whether individuals were acting as armed
 vigilantes, there were a number of unexplained and uninvestigated deaths in the
 border region of Guidimaka. In that area, there is a high incidence of cattle rustling
 and vigilantism by both civilians and security forces.
 There are credible reports that black Mauritanians, previously expelled to Senegal
 and associated with radical, antigovernment groups killed two Mauritanian mili-
 tary officers, both white Maurs, in August along the 4enegal River where the major-
 ity of the country's non-Arabic-speaking black population lives.
 Extrajudicial killings, primarily of African-Mauritanians, from past years re-
 mained uninvestigated and unresolved. The principal example of unresolved
 extrajudicial killing dates from 1990-91 when, while in military custody, approxi-
 mate ly 500 largely Halpulaar and Sninke military and civilian personnel died;
 many of these persons were summarily executed after being tortured. They were
 part of a large group of as many as 3,000 who were rounded up, detained, and tor-
 tured, allegedly for coup-plotting. The results of an internal military investigation
 into this matter have never been made public, and no one has been charged with
 or faced trial for the tortures and deaths. In fact, several high-placed military offi-
 cials who reportedly were involved remain on duty and in some cases were pro-
 moted, including Colonel Sid'Ahmed Ould Boilil, Colonel Cheikh uld Mohamed
 Salah, Major Mo amed Cheikh Ould El Hadi, and Major Ely Fall.
 In June Parliament approved a bill granting amnesty to members of the armed
 forces and police, as well as to private citizens, involved in those killings and other
 abuses during the 1990-91 period. The bill was a setback for efforts by human
 rights groups and others to bring to account those responsible or otherwise resolve
 these abuses. The Government offered compensation to victims of these abuses and
 to relatives of those who were killed, but very few of the concerned families accepted
 the compensation in the absence of an overall settlement.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances. In previous years,
 there were occasional credible reports of black Africans disappearing after being
 taken into military custody. The Government appears to have made no effort to in-
 vestigate these past incidents.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits the use of torture and other forms of cruel or inhuman punish-
 ment. However, while there was no repetition of the large-scale mistreatment of
 1990-91, there continued to be credible evidence of mistreatment by security forces.
 In particular, police occasionally beat criminal suspects prior to interrogation. Per-
 sons who commit such abuses are only occasionally tried and punished. In one in-
 stance, police reportedly apprehended a journalist in Nouakchott for not having his
 identity papers with him; they stripped and beat him and then released him. There
 was no report of an investigation or punishment of the police involved.
 Security forces, claiming retaliation for cross-border raids in the Guidamaka area
 near the Mali border, reportedly sometimes resort to brutality-usually severe beat-
 ings-in questioning people, and on some occasions have themselves stolen goods
 from the people they were supposed to protect.
 Prison conditions are harsh and do not meet minimum sanitary or humanitarian
 standards. In September an independent journal featured an expose on abysmal
 conditions at the central prison for men in Nouakchott. The article cited, inter alia,
 inadequate food and medical treatment for inmates. There was also a report of some
 inmates being forced to wear manacles continually so as to restrict their movement.
 
 
 Another independent newspaper reported the arrest of two minors, aged 10 and 12,
 who were held in an adult prison where they were beaten before being released. The
 Government permitted visits by the International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICRC) to monitor prison conditions.
 There were a few reports of policemen being brought to justice for the mistreat-
 ment of individuals. In one case, four police officers entered a house under the guise
 of searching for drug traffickers. After raping and robbing a woman, they were ap-
 prehended by other police officers; the perpetrators were tried and sentenced to
 len hy prison terms.
 d  Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The 1991 Constitution provides for due
 prcess and the presumption of innocence until proven guilty by an established tri-
 unal. It further states that no one can be arrested, detained, prosecuted, or pun-
 ished except as provided for under the law. The Government, with the participation
 of an association of lawyers, revised the Code of Civil and Criminal Procedures in
 1993 to bring it into line with the Constitution and to spell out more clearly safe-
 guards to protect the accused. Nonetheless, actual application of these safeguards
 remained inconsistent and continued to vary widely from case to case.
 By law, the courts are required to review the legality of a person's detention with-
 in 48 hours of arrest. However, the police can extend the period for another 48
 hours, and a prosecutor has the authority to detain persons for up to 30 days in
 cases considered to involve national security. Only after the prosecutor submits the
 charges is the suspect permitted to contact an attorney. It is, moreover, common
 practice to detain prisoners incommunicado for prolonged periods without charging
 them with any crime and without judicial review. Sometimes prisoners who have
 been charged find themselves released before trial without explanation. Such re-
 leases usually can be attributed to the prisoner's familial, tribal, or political connec-
 tions. There is a provision for granting bail, but it is rarely used.
 There was a credible report of suspects being held for extended periods without
 being tried or charged. For example, in Sory Male, a Halpulaar vil a e with a his-
 tory of abuse and torture by security forces, four persons were arrested in November
 1992 for the murder of a Maur storekeeper. At the end of 1993, they remained in
 pretrial detention.
 There continued to be occasional reports of arbitrary arrests and intimidation
 committed by security forces, particularly in communities along the Senegal river.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-While the judiciary is nominally independent, it
 is controlled and influenced by the executive. The Government appoints judges and
 subjects the courts to pressure in reaching verdicts. This influence w&s dem-
 onstrated clearly when the Government refused to allow the courts to accept the op-
 position parties challenge of the January 1992 presidential elections. Other exam-
 ples include the court's dismissal, at the Government's direction, of banks' suits to
 seize collateral on defaulted loans held by influential community members and the
 rejection of class actions which could embarrass the Government. Furthermore, ef-
 fective implementation of justice is problematic due in part to poorly educated and
 trained judg[es and their susceptibility to tribal or social pressures.
 To a signficant degree, the judicial system continues to be dominated by rulings,
 conciliations, and settlements conducted by tribal elders based on Shari's (Islamic
 law), tribal regulations, and personal connections.
 The revised formal judicial system (see Section I.d.) includes a system of lower,
 middle, and upper level courts, each with specified jurisdiction. The Security Court,
 a chamber reserved for cases involving the Government, was abolished. Bridging the
 traditional and modern system of justice are 43 department-level tribunals staffed
 by Qadis or traditional Islamic magistrates trained primarily in Koranic law.
 Mauritanians aiminr to use the courts to seek redress in matters such as marriage,
 inheritance, succession, noncommercial suits, and land issues in rural areas must
 address themselves to one of these tribunals, which operate on the basis of both
 Shari'a and legal codes. The use by Islamic judges of extreme physical punishment,
 such as amputation, is no longer practiced in Mauritania. The Government is con-
 tinuing to eliminate a number of unqualified Shari'a judges, and it held two training
 seminars for judges and members of the security forces to increase their awareness
 of the basic rights of detainees.
 The 10 regional courts or tribunals of first instance handle litigation between com-
 panies, civil suits against the Government, trarnic accidents and infraction'i embe'z-
 zlement of public funds, banking or insurance matters, money changing violalions,
 and land issues in urban areas.
 Challenges to decisions at the department and regional levels ar handled by ue.
 of three regional Courts of Appeals. A Supreme Court, nominally indelondert, is
 headed by a magistrate named to a 5-year   tainythe President. The S preme
 
 
 Court reviews decisions and rulings made by the Courts of Appeal to determine
 their compliance with the law.
 Constitutional review is the purview of a six-member Constitutional Council. Es-
 tablished by the 1991 Constitution, it has three members named by the President,
 two by the National Assembly President, and one by the Senate President. Submis-
 sion of laws for review by the Council can be done only by the President, the Senate
 or National Assembly Presidents, or by one-third of the members of either house.
 Council findings may not be appealed. At the end of 1993, two laws submitted for
 review had been declared not in conformity with the Constitution on technical
 grounds. Both were being reformulated to bring them into compliance.
 In theory, all defendants, regardless of the court or their ability to pay, have the
 legal right to be present with legal counsel during the proceedings. The law also
 states that defendants may confront witnesses, present evidence, and appeal their
 sentences. However, in practice these rights are not regularly applied.
 The Government's claim that there were no political detainees or prisoners ap-
 peared accurate at year's end.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-By law,
 judicial warrants are required to perform home searches, but this requirement is
 often ignored. There were fewer reports of government surveillance of suspected dis-
 sidents than in the past. The extent to which the Government uses informants is
 unknown.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The 1991 Constitution provides for freedom of
 speech and press, but there are important restrictions including prepublication
 press censorship. With regard to freedom of speech, opposition political leaders
 spoke openly at lare rallies in preparation for the municipal elections expected to
 take place in early 1994.
 The Government controls the electronic media (radio and television) and the coun-
 try's two daily newspapers, Horizon and Chaab. Radio is the most important me-
 dium by far in reaching the public, and all the official media strongly support gov-
 ernment policies. All newspapers and political parties must register with the Min-
 istry of Information, and newspapers must submit their copy to the Ministry prior
 to publication. There were no reports of the Ministry excising material from journals
 or otherwise censoring their articles, and in contrast to 1992 there were no .cases
 of the authorities seizing issues of newspapers.
 Independent, privatey owned journals, established following the press law of
 1991, numbered approximately 60-most appearing weekly in the capital and other
 large towns. For the most p art, these weeklies reach a limited audience not only
 due to financial constraints but also because of the high rate of illiteracy. They were
 boldly critical of the Government, particularly on itshuman rights record, and the
 President himself was oten criticized by name. Some of them undertook investiga-
 tions of human rights violations, unresolved crimes, and government corruption.
 Antigvernment tracts, newsletters, and petitions circulated widely in Nouakchott
 and other major cities.
 The one university is government operated, but since 1991 limits on academic
 freedom have eased. There were no cases of professors being prevented from pursu-
 ing their research andpublication interests or of having their lectures censored.
 d.Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association. The law governing political parties requires
 that all groups must register with the Minister of Interior and obtain permission
 for large meetings or assemblies. There were reports of some permits being denied
 or conditions placed on some marches or rallies to limit their effectiveness.
 Over 16 political parties and a wide array of nongovernmental organizations
 (NGO's), many of them highly critical of the Government, met openly, issued public
 statements, and chose their own leadership. Legally required to register with the
 Government in order to operate, a large number of newly formed NGOs, such as
 the Association of Human Rights, a women's group on the environment, and a group
 concerned with the rights of the handicapped, operated unfettered, although they
 had yet to receive the Government's approval by year's end.
 c. Freedom of ReliAion.-yFreedom of religion does not exist. Islam is the official
 religion of Mauritania, and all citizens are, by law, Sunni Muslim and prohibited
 from converting to another religion. Proselytizing by non-Muslims is prohibited, and
 Mauritanians are prohibited from entering non-islamic houses of worship and from
 possessing sacred texts of other religions.
 The small Lebanese Shi' community is allowed to practice its religion privately.
 The expatriate Christian community is allowed to holdworship services that are re-
 strictednto resident foreigners.
 
 
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Histrically there were few restrictions on movement within Mauri-
 tania, where nomadism has long been a way of life. The Government has ended pre-
 vious strictures on movement along the riverine area imposed by local authorities
 following the rupture of relations with Senegal in 1989 and the attendant violence.
 Travelers are regularly stopped and papers checked by the Gendarmerie on the
 roads between towns and on the outskirts of Nouakchott and other large towns. No
 cases were reported of persons being denied passports for political reasons.
 The approximately 200,000 Mauritanian Maurs expelled by the Government of
 Senegal in 1989-90 have now been largely absorbed through government and pri-
 vate means. Some of them have settled on land belonging to Africans who were ex-
 pelled by Mauritania during the 1989-90 crisis, heightening ethnic tensions in the
 a River Valley. Of the approximately 60,000 Arian-Mauritanians who were
 expelled, an estimated 56,000 remain in refugee settlements in Senegal, the others
 presumably having returned to Mauritania or been absorbed into the Senegalese
 population. The 1989 crisis also led ap proximately 13,000 Mauritanian Peuhi to
 take refuge in Mali. Although the overwhelming majority apparently continue to re-
 main there, some reportedly have returned.
 The Government claims that it places no restrictions on the return of those ex-
 pelled in 1989-90, including the Senegalese previously resident in Mauritania, and
 some refugees have traveled to Mauritania to visit family or to seek work. In the
 town of Debaye, 705 of the former 1,000 residents returned. The Government ap-
 peared to be encouraginga gradual case-by-case repatriation. In some areas regional
 and local government officials have encouraged refugees to return and have prom-
 ised to issue new identity papers, return their land (or land nearby in cases where
 other settlers now occupy their land), and provide economic assistance to farmers.
 Authorities have fulfilled their promises of support for some returning refugees but
 not for others.
 The impasse for the 56,000 refugees still in Senegal centers on their demands that
 the Mauritanian Government repatriate them en masse and acknowledge having ex-
 pelled its own citizens, issue the refugees identity papers before their return, return
 their land, animals, and other personal goods, and pay compensation for their
 losses. Toward the latter part of the year, the Government began meeting with the
 U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to discuss conditions for repatri-
 ation. However, the Government has so far failed to set up clear administrative,
 much less judicial, procedures for expellees wishing to obtain confirmation of their
 citizenship and associated rights. The Taya Government has always maintained
 that most persons who fled or were expelled in the wake of the 1989 crisis were,
 in fact Senegalese nationals and that their Mauritanian identity documents were
 fraudulent. However, certification of identity was problematic because security
 forces had destroyed or confiscated many of the deportees' identity documents dur-
 ing the 1989-90 expulsions.
 At year's end, the UNHCR was beginning to arrange for the gradual return to
 Mali of some of the over 46,000 Tuareg and Maur refugees residing in camps in
 southeastern Mauritania. These refugees had fled to Mauritania in 1991-92 follow-
 ing conflict between Tuareg factions and government forces in Mali's northern re-
 gions.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have not been able to exercise their Constitutional right to change their
 government through free and fair elections. The 1992 multiparty election of a civil-
 ian President ended 14 years of military rule, but the elections were considered by
 international observers and the opposition to have been marred by fraud. Moreover,
 the military continued to provide strong support to the regime, and some previous
 Military Council members, in addition to President Taya, remained in positions of
 P ower within the armed forces and elsewhere in the Government. For example, the
 resident of the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament, was a former
 army colonel. As the major opposition parties, including the Union of Democratic
 Forces (UDF), boycotted the 1992 legislative elections, the President's party, the
 PRDS, has near-total control of the National Assembly, 106 seats out of 132.
 The opposition political parties announced that they would participate in the mu-
 nicipal elections scheduled for early 1994. In preparation for these elections, the
 Government met with leaders of the major opposition parties and updated the voter
 registration rolls.
 Although the PRDS enjoys the advantages of incumbency, it nonetheless faces
 strong opposition in a number of constituencies, including the capital city, other
 major towns, and in some southern border areas. The main opposition party, the
 
 
 UFD, draws its support particularly from the African-Mauritanian community as
 well as from Maurs opposed to Taya and his group and a significant percentage of
 the Haratine class. Only a few of the other parties have a wide popular following,
 though a recently created centrist party will run candidates for municipal office in
 a number of constituencies.
 Women have the right to vote, although few are active in political parties. There
 were five women in senior government positions: Counselor to the President, the As-
 sistant Director of the President's Cabinet, the Secretary of State for the Condition
 of Women (raised to Cabinet level in 1993), and the Secretaries General of the Min-
 istries of Commerce and of Justice. There is one elected woman Senator belonging
 to the ruling party, the PRDS, and one elected town mayor. There is only 1 female
 senator in a Parliament totaling 132 members.
 While there are black Mauritanians in senior positions in the Government, they
 are underrepresented. Of the 17 Ministers in Prime Minister Sidi Mohamed Ould
 Boubacar's Cabinet, 3 are black Maurs, 1 is Pulaar, and 1 Soninke. The other min-
 isters are white Maurs.
 Section 4. /Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In.
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The only officially recognized human ights organization within the country, the
 Mauritanian League for Human Rights (HRL), was increasingly active on behalf of
 human rights. The League, through its newspaper and press statements, did not
 criticize the President or top officials directly, but it openly criticized the amnesty
 law granting immunity from prosecution for those guilty of violations dating from
 the 1990-91 period.
 The Government continued to withhold recognition from the Mauritanian Human
 Rights Association (HRA), which applied for a permit in 1991, and two women's
 rights groups that were active in 1993: the Support Committee, for assistance to the
 wives and orphans of victims of the 1990-91 military purge; and the Collective of
 Families Separated by Deportation, which represented the spouses (mainly female)
 and children of persons who were deported to Senegal during the 1989 crisis. Never-
 theless, the Government allowed these associations to function.
 The HRA was extremely active in pursuing its agenda, specifically in providing
 information to the press and in sponsoring seminars. The Government has still not
 processed the applications for recognition from the HRA and many other institu-
 tions, partly out of suspicion toward NGO activities in general and partly to keep
 potential opposition groups on a short leash.
 In July the Government created a post of mediator or "Ombudsman" to assist citi-
 zens with problems they may have with government institutions. Requests for as-
 sistance must go through Members of Parliament. There have been no reports as
 yet of the mediator's effectiveness.
 Representatives of the Government as well as delegates from the League for
 Human Rights, the Association of Mauritanians in Senegal, and the Committee of
 Solidarity with the Victims of Repression in Mauritania all attended a March meet-
 ing in Banjul of the International Commission of Jurists, where they openly aired
 their differences on the human rights situation in Mauritania. During a subsequent
 visit to Mauritania, members of the International Commission of Jurists met with
 government officials, human rights monitors, and others to discuss the human
 rights situation in Mauritania.
 owever, the Government was selective in its approach to international organiza-
 tions. It cooperated with the International Labor Organization (ILO) (see Section
 6.a.), Amnesty International, and the ICRC (see Section 1.c.). The Government re-
 fused to permit a visit by Africa Watch, a U.S.-based human rights group which has
 published articles highly critical of the Government's human rights record.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The 1991 Constitution's first article provides for equality before the law for all
 citizens, regardless of race, national origin, sex, or social status, and prohibits ra-
 cially or ethnically based propaganda. In practice, the Government operates under
 a hierarchy of unwritten rules where constitutional and other legally mandated
 rights, protections, and benefits are often accorded on the basis of racial or tribal
 affiliation, social status, and political influence.
 Women.-Women have legal rights to property, divorce and child custody and,
 among the more modern and urbanized population, these rights are observed. In
 theory, both marriage and divorce can take place without a woman's consent. Po-
 lygyny exists as sanctioned by the teachings of Islam; a woman does not have the
 
 
 183
 right to refuse her husbands's wish to be polygynous. In fact, such practices are in-
 creasingly rare.
 Women are also subjected to domestic violence, including wife beating. In recogni-
 tion of this and to mark International Women's Day, the United Nations Develop-
 ment Program sponsored a roundtable on violence against women. A large turnout
 included government representatives and, for the first time, all types of physical and
 psychological abuse against women were publicly aired. The police and judiciary oc-
 casionally intervene in domestic disputes, but women in traditional society usually
 do not attempt legal redress, preferring to turn to family and ethnic groups to re-
 solve domestic disputes.
 There are no legal restrictions on education for women, although the number of
 women attending university remained low. The Government has been instrumental
 in opening up new employment opportunities for women in areas traditionally re-
 served for men, such as hospital work. By law, men and women must receive equal
 pay for equal work; and while far from universally applied in practice, the two larg-
 est employers, the civil service and the State Mining Company, SNIM, respect this
 law. In the modern (wage) sector, women also receive generous family benefits, in-
 cluding 3 months of maternity leave. Once they return to work after giving birth,
 they are allowed 1 hour of leave per day to nurse their child.
 Children.-Children's rights are subsumed under the general provisions of law
 dealing with other civil rights. Government policy concentrates on the desprate eco-
 nomic conditions which a serous threat to children in this young population. Al-
 though child labor laws exist, they are not enforced and are seen as irrelevant by
 some in this tradition-bound society. Children often perform significant labor in sup-
 port of their families' activities.
 Female genital mutilation (circumcision), which has been condemned by inter-
 national health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is
 performed at an early age and is still widely practiced. Evidence indicates, however,
 that the incidence is diminishing in the modern, urbanized sector. Of the country's
 main population groups-Maurs and Africans-all except the Wolofs in the African
 up ractice genital mutilation. Some groups practice infibulation, the most severe
 form of mutilation. The Government has not attempted to interfere with these tradi-
 tional practices, but it permits some government health workers to educate mid-
 wives on the health dangers of the practice and of the fact that Islam does not re-
 quire it.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.--Mauritania is situated geographically and
 culturally on the divide between traditionally nomadic Arabic-speaking (Hassaniya)
 Maurs of the north and sedentary black African cultivators and herders who histori-
 cally lived along the Senegal river in the south. Though culturally homogeneous, the
 Maurs are divided among numerous tribal groups and are racially distinguished as
 white (Beydane) or black (Haratine, literally "one who has been freed"). The south-
 er black Africans represent three main ethnic groups-the Halpulaar, the Wolof,
 and the Soninke. The interaction of these groups produces complex cultural diver-
 sit as well as ethnic tensions.
 During the colonial period, the French administered what is now Mauritania as
 p art of French West Africa through reliance on the more settled black Africans who
 dominated the economy and civil service. This situation dramatically shifted follow-
 ing the partition of West Africa and the creation of an independent Mauritania.
 Northern Maurs dominated the newly established government and modern economic
 sectors centered in the capital of Nouakchott and initially coexisted with, but had
 little interaction with, the traditional nonmarket economies in the far reaches of the
 country.
 Also, 20 years of severe drought, desertification, and urbanization have ended the
 centuries-old nomadic way of life. Maurs have pressed further south into the more
 fertile river area, exacerbating tensions between farmers and herders, and between
 ethnic groups. The tensions surfaced dramatically in the mass expulsions of African-
 Mauritanians in 1989-90. Black Africans charge that the Government's 1983 land
 reform law is being misused to allow Maurs to encroach on fertile land in the Sen-
 egal river valley that traditionally has been the preserve of black Africans.
 The tensions have also been exacerbated by successive government regimes-both
 civil and militaryvigorousiy pursuing a policy of "Arabization" of the schools and
 the work force, which has the effect of serious discrimination against non-
 Hassaniya-spaking African-Mauritanans. Consequently, white Maurs now hold the
 majority of top positions in Government, state enterprises, business, and religious
 institutions. African-Mauritanians and black Maurs are likewise underrpresented
 in the senior ranks of other key institutions, such as the military and security
 forces. Many Africans and human rights groups contend that this situation is a re-
 suit of ethnic and linguistic discrimination.
 
 
 184
 Taken together, the black Maurs and Africans outnumber the white Maurs by a
 considerable majority. No precise figures are available, as the Government has not
 released the results of the last census taken in 1988. This racial majority however
 is by no means cohesive as there is little cultural identity or political cohesion be:
 tween the Haratines, who identify with the Arab/Berber tribal culture of the north,
 and the southern African ethnic gups.
 Although relations between ethnic groups have improved since the explosion of
 ethnic violence in April 1989, tension and bitterness persist. The Government's sub-
 sequent extra4udicial expulsions and reprisals by the security forces were clearly
 based on ethnicity. There are reports that the Government has begun to rehire some
 African-Mauritanians summarily dismissed from their jobs during the 1989 crisis.
 People with Disabilities.-The Government has no legislation or regulations pro-
 viding preference in employment or education for disabled persons, and has been
 able to afford only limited facilities easing access for the disabled. There is no legis-
 lation mandating accessibility.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for freedom of association
 and the right of citizens to join any political or labor organization. All workers ex-
 cept members of the military and police are free to associate in and establish unions
 at the local and national levels. However, many restrictive military decrees are still
 nominally in effect which circumscribe these and other constitutional rights. In 1993
 the Goverment cooperated with the International Labor Organization (ILO) in pre-
 paring a revision of its current Labor Code to bring it into closer conformity with
 international standards. The revised code is expected to be completed and passed
 into law in 1994.
 Prior to 1993, the government-controlled labor central, the Union of Mauritanian
 Workers (UTM), consisting of 36 unions, was the only labor confederation allowed
 by law. It remains the major worker confederation and is still close to the Govern-
 ment and the PRDS. A 1993 amendment to the Labor Code repealed provisions re-
 stricting trade union pluralism, and new confederations have developed to rival the
 UTM. In particular, the General Confederation of Mauritanian Workers (CGTM) is
 competing actively with the UTM which is still viewed by many workers as a tool
 of the Government. The CGTM, though not formally aligned with a political party,
 favors the Union of Democratic Forces, the major opposition political party. Another
 group of workers organized the Confederation of the Free Syndicates of Mauritania
 (CSL ) which declared itself free from politics, with its only concern being worker
 rights. Although they were permitted to function, neither of the two newly organized
 confederations had received recognition from the Government by year's end. The
 CGTM made a formal protest charging that its affiliates were being harassed by
 local government leaders.
 The UTM participates in regional labor organizations, but international trade
 union activity is minimal.
 Most workers are engaged in subsistence agriculture (informal sector) and animal
 husbandry and only a small number, 20 percent, are employed in the wage sector.
 However, close to 90 percent of industrial and commercial workers in Mauritania
 are members of unions. Some trade union leaders expressed concern that, given the
 small size of the formal sector in the economy, the increased competition among
 unions for members could fragment and weaken labor's bargaining strength.
 Although Mauritanian law grants workers the right to strike, strikes rarely occur
 because of government pressure. The law also stipulates that tripartite arbitration
 committees composed of union, business, and government representatives may im-
 pose binding arbitration that automatically terminates any strike. In practice,
 strikes are rare and appear to consist of brief, wildcat strikes by small groups of
 workers. In December the independent press reported a several-hour work stoppage
 in Nouakchott by bus drivers protesting the hiring of foreigners by the government-
 owned bus company.
 The ILO continues to criticize the Government for violation of worker rights, not-
 ing in particular charges of forced labor. In July the United States Trade Represent-
 ative announced that Mauritania's eligibility for United States Government Gener-
 alized System of Preferences (GSP) benefits had been revoked for failure to respect
 freedom of association and to take steps to eliminate forced labor, including slavery.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-By law, unions are free to or-
 ganize workers without government or employer interference. Genuine collective
 bargaining does not exist, however, because of the Government's heavy-handed role
 in shaping labor relations. Wages and other benefits are decided informally among
 individua unions (all controlled by the UTM until 1993), employers, and the Gov-
 ernment.
 
 
 There are laws providing workers protection against antiunion discrimination.
 Technically, employees or employers may bring labor disputes to three-person labor
 courts that are overseen jointly by the Ministries of Justice and Labor, but human
 rights groups charge that labor courts are controlled by the Government's race-
 based political program.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Although slavery has been offi-
 cially abolished several times-most recently in 1980-the legacy of slavery remains
 pervasive, particularly in its economic and psychological manifestations. Tens of
 thousands of persons whose ancestors were slaves still occupy positions of servitude
 and near servitude. Many of these are freed slaves (Haratine) who, because of eco-
 nomic necessity, have either stayed with, or returned to, their former masters. The
 most common situation involves Haratine who live independently but continue, from
 a sense of fear and duty, to perform unpaid labor for their former masters.
 Anedoctal accounts indicate that there still may be individuals forcibly held
 against their will in urban areas as well as in isolated communities. Their numbers
 are difficult to quantify, although credible reports indicate that there are from
 30,000 to 90,000 people living in slavery. In the freer political arena of 1993, a
 movement, entitled, El Hor (literally "the free man") developed an agenda to eradi-
 cate the vestiges of slavery and the associated mentality among former slaves. Ac-
 cording to the independent press, the Government recently intervened to return to
 her family a young girl who had been kidnaped and held in bondage as an unpaid
 herder.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Education is not compulsory, and
 only a small percentage of children regularly attend government schools. The law
 specifies that no child may be employed under the age of 13 in the agricultural sec-
 tor without the permission of the Minister of Labor, nor under the age of 15 in the
 nonagricultural sector. The law provides that employed children aged 14 to 16
 should receive 70 percent of the minimum wage, and those from 17 to 18 should
 receive 90 percent of the minimum wage. In practice, the Labor Ministry's few in-
 spector provide only limited enforcement of child labor laws.
 Young children in the countryside commonly pursue herding, cultivation, fishing,
 and other significant labor in support of their families' activities. In keeping with
 longstanding tradition, many children serve apprenticeships in small industries and
 in the informal sector. In Nouakchott and other large towns, youths in their early
 teens typically work as mechanics, blacksmiths, furniture makers, plumbers, and
 electricians. They can also be found in shops, gas stations, and laundry establish-
 ments, in private homes as domestics, and on the streets as petty vendors. The phe-
 nomenon of young workers is likely to increase, as urbanization proceeds apace.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The guaranteed minimum wage for adults was
 raised following a devaluation of the national currency in October 1992. It still bare-
 ly enables the average family to meet its minimum needs. The minimum wage is
 currently set by decree at $67 (ougiya 8,300) per month or approximately $700 per
 year, per capita gross domestic product is $520.
 The standard, legal, nonagricultural workweek cannot exceed either 40 hours or
 6 days without overtime compensation, which is paid at rates that are graduated
 according to the number of supplemental hours worked.
 Enforcement of the labor laws is the responsibility of the Labor Inspectorate of
 the Ministry of Labor, but in practice the Directorate is limited by the shortage of
 qualified personnel. Likewise, although the Government sets health and safety
 standards, which are theoretically en forced by the Ministry of Labor, enforcement
 of these standards is inconsistent.
