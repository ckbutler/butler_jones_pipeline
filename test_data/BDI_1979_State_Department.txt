 BURUNDI
 Burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world with
 a high population density and few natural resources.
 Conflict between the majority (85%) Hutu ethnic group and
 the minority (14-15%) Tutsi group has dominated the
 political, social and economic history of the country.
 While there are no longer important linguistic or cultural
 differences between the ethnic groups, the minority has
 for centuries dominated the majority. Ethnic tensions are
 heightened by the fact that in neighboring Rwanda, which
 shares a similar ethnic structure, the Hutu majority
 overthrew Tutsi rule in 1959 prior to Rwandan independence.
 On several occasions in Burundi's history, these tensions
 have led to violent conflict. The most recent violence
 stemmed from an abortive coup attempt by Hutu leaders in
 1972 against the Tutsi government. There ensued a
 government-sanctioned bloodbath of Hutus which left
 perhaps 150,000 dead and nearly 200,000 as refugees in
 Tanzania and Rwanda. Little progress to reconstruct the
 country occurred-until November 1976 when the military
 government of Colonel Jean-Baptiste Bagaza came to power
 in a bloodless coup and proclaimed a policy of national
 reconciliation and reform. The stated objective of the
 government has been to improve the conditions of the rural
 poor, who include nearly all of the Hutu majority. An
 effective formula for more proportionate power-sharing has
 yet to be developed.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is not sanctioned by law. Beatings occasionally
 occur during the arrest and questioning of common criminals,
 particularly those who threaten violence against the
 police, resist arrest, or are arrested in connection with
 violent crimes.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The legal system does not impose cruel, inhuman or degrad-
 ing treatment or punishment. Prisons are over-crowded and
 dirty, but prisoners are normally left to themselves and
 not abused. However, prisoners arrested for violent
 crimes such as rape or murder and those who resist arrest
 may be ill-treated. The Government claims to discipline
 police and prison officials guilty of abusing prisoners.
 The Department of State has no independent information to
 confirm or refute these claims.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The state has broad police powers which permit arbitrary
 arrests and imprisonment. Occasionally, suspects are
 detained without trial for extended periods of time.
 Legally a person may be held for only seven days before
 being charged.
 
 
 d. Denial of a Fair Public Trial
 By law, all persons arrested are guaranteed a speedy
 public trial, but the inadequacies of the judicial system
 and the lack of trained legal personnel often cause long
 delays. Complaints of corrupt or unfair actions by judges
 and prosecutors continue to be aired at meetings of the
 sole political party. Nonetheless, the Bagaza government
 has reformed much of the rural legal system and many
 corrupt or incompetent legal officials have been removed.
 This has improved the timeliness and fairness of judgments
 in many courts.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Invasion of the home is rare but it occasionally happens
 in politically-related cases.
 2. Government Policies in Relation to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 Burundi's economy is overwhelmingly dependent on a prim-
 itive agricultural sector which supports 90% of the
 population. Most Burundians engage primarily in subsistence
 agriculture supplemented by such cash crops as coffee, tea
 and cotton. There is also a small cattle grazing industry.
 The country has one of the highest population densities in
 Africa and few areas of arable land remain uncultivated.
 Per capita incomes are among the lowest in the world.
 The small industrial/commercial sector is under consider-
 able governmental influence through government participation
 in many of the major industries and close regulation of
 others. Due to the country's landlocked position away
 from major markets and the small size of the domestic
 market, few industries can operate efficiently.
 Health and educational facilities are inadequate for the
 needs of the country. The Bagaza government is conse-
 quently expending scarce resources to expand the provision
 of services to the rural poor. 1978 development budget
 greatly increased allocations for rural health care and
 education facilities. The 1979 budget reflects major
 cutbacks made necessary by declining revenues from coffee,
 but the budget continues to give priority to the needs of
 the rural poor as does the current 5-year plan (1978-1982).
 Primary education is in principle free to all residents.
 In practice, facilities in rural areas are unable to
 redeem this promise to more than half of all children of
 school age. Secondary schooling consists of both free
 government schools and tuition-charging private (generally
 religious) schools. Again, due to the inadequate facilities,
 only a fraction of those completing primary school can
 obtain places in secondary schools. The University of
 Burundi is a state institution offering free education on
 the European model to those few students able to obtain
 places in a highly competitive environment.

 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Freedom of religion is generally respected in Burundi.
 However, the involvement of many missionaries in social
 work with the poor, who are overwhelmingly Hutu, frequently
 has aroused government suspicion. The government has
 taken over all primary schools formerly operated by
 the missionaries, and has recently attempted to limit
 religious meetings to parish churches and to Sundays. In
 June 1979, when the nation's Catholic bishops protested
 these measures in an open letter to the President, the
 government responded by summarily expelling 74 mis-
 sionaries (including 18 American Protestants). Those
 expelled were generally accused of "spreading a spirit of
 ethnic discord" among the people. Many were long-term
 residents of Burundi. The government has not, however,
 prevented the church and missionary groups from replacing
 those expelled nor refused admission to new arrivals. The
 government has stated that the church is free to carry out
 its work but must confine its activities to religion and
 stay out of political matters.
 The government controls virtually all of the local press.
 The French-langudge daily (Le Renouveau) and Kirundi-
 language weekly (Ubumwe) are both published by the Ministry
 of Information, which also runs the only domestic radio
 station. Editorial direction generally comes from the
 presidency, but recent editions have featured muted
 criticism of local government policies, raised sensitive
 political and economic issues and reported instances of
 low level official corruption. The government closed down
 a missionary radio network in 1977 and orders were recently
 issued suspending publication of a Kirundi-language
 fortnightly newspaper sponsored by the Catholic Church.
 Foreign movies are subject to censorship, but cuts are
 generally made only on material deemed sexually explicit
 which might offend public morals. No evidence has been
 noted of foreign publications being banned or suppressed.
 The express authorization of the government is required
 for all political meetings or speakers, and this
 effectively guarantees government control of public
 fora.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Movement is generally free within Burundi, although
 some efforts have recently been made to slow the influx
 of unemployed persons from the countryside into Bujumbura.
 Foreign travel and emigration are open to all.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The military government rules by decree, without popular
 referendum procedures. The government endeavors to
 control all political activity; and only one political
 party, the government sponsored UPRONA, is permitted.
 Membership in the UPRONA party is open to all Burundians
 who profess allegiance to its principles. The government
 has announced that a recent membership drive resulted in
 over one million new members being accepted. The
 
 
 government is currently reviving UPRONA to serve as the
 vehicle for greater popular participation in the nation's
 political life. The party secretariat and provincial
 officials were named in 1978. This year has also seen a
 series of local and provincial party assemblies which are
 to conclude with a national congress in December. The
 party assemblies have been widely publicized and resulted
 in a fairly open discussion of the future of the party and
 the country. The discussion was kept within the framework
 of the party manifesto, but the official press reported
 complaints concerning corruption and the lack of schools
 and medical facilities.
 Women have esentially equal legal status with men in
 nearly all aspects of life in Burundi. In practice,
 cultural traditions have limited the participation of
 women in government and public life. The recent UPRONA
 party assemblies have included numerous women as delegates
 and they have raised questions of particular concern to
 women: polygamy, divorce laws, and the role of women in
 society. UPRONA sponsors a women's affiliate, the Union
 of Burundian Women (UFB), which is intended as the conduit
 for their special concerns and as the vehicle for the
 mobilization of women. It has recently held a national
 congress in preparation for the national party congress to
 be held in December.
 There is only one legal labor union, the Union of Burundian
 Workers (UTB), to which all workers belong. An arm of the
 UPRONA party, the UTB has long been a meek follower of
 government policy. Recently the union has begun to show
 signs of greater independence including calls for improved
 working conditions. Strikes are legal only within the
 framework of laws and Ministry of Labor directives.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 The previous government refused to permit outside investi-
 gation of ethnic rivalries in Burundi following the civil
 strife of 1972-1973. To the knowledge of the Department
 of State, the current government has received no requests
 for outside assessments of its program on ethrric relations
 or other human rights matters.
