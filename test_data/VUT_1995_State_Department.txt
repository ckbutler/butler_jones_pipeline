 VANUATU
 Vanuatu, a small South Pacific island nation which was jointly administered by
 Britain and France prior to its independence in 1980, has a parliamentary form of
 government with a 50-member Parliament, including a Prime Minister and a Presi-
 dent. The Iatter's powers are largely ceremonial, except when acting on the advice
 of the Council of Ministers. Political legitimacy is basedon majority rule.
 The civilian authorities control the small police and paramilitary mobile forces.
 Subsistence and small-scale agricultural production and fishing support mere
 than 80 percent of the population. Copra, cocoa, and beef cattle are the main cash
 crops. The service sector--government, tourism, and an offshore financial center-
 provides most formal employment and represents the largest component of the coun-
 try's gross domestic product.
 Government control over most media and occasionally strong pressures on the one
 independent newspaper, including the threat to revoke its business license, together

 with discrimination and violence against women, remain the major human rights
 problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-Con-
 stitutional provisions against torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment
 are observed in practice and enforced by the courts. The law provides that prisoners
 shall have recourse to the Ombudsman, a constitutional position.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Government
 permits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-There were no reports of arbitrary ar-
 rests. Arrest is by warrant. The Constitutional provision that suspects must be in-
 formed of the charges and given a speedy hearing before a judge is observed in prac-
 tice. There is no exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The courts are mainly free of military or executive
 interference. The courts uphold constitutional provisions for a fair public trial, pre-
 sumption of innocence until guilt is proven, prohibition against double jeopardy, the
 right of judicial determination of the validity of arrest or detention, and appeal to
 the Supreme Court.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-There
 were no reports of arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspond-
 ence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press; however, the Government occasionally pressured the media to limit
 the presentation of views contrary to the Government's position. Prior to late 1994,
 the Government controlled the nation's media which consisted of a weekly news-
 paper and two radio stations. An independent weekly newspaper began publishing
 in late 1994 and has since expanded to semiweekly editions. Opposition political
 parties occasionally publish short newsletters. Limited service television broadcast-
 ing with no local news features recently began in the capital, Port Vila; the station
 is partially owned by the Government.
 In early 1995, the Government ordered the radio not to air an interview with a
 leader of an opposition political party, according to international media reports. In
 June the Government banned the media it controlled from reporting the critical
 comments of an Australian judge who resigned unexpectedly from the Vanuatu judi-
 ciary. The judge publicly questioned the independence of the Chief Justice. The Gov-
 ernment also attempted to ban reporting on the hostile reaction within the region
 to France's decision to resume nuclear testing in the South Pacific.
 Freedom of the independent press remains tenuous. The President, in opening the
 Parliament in March, urged the Government to prohibit newspapers from false re-
 porting and invasions of privacy. In a prepared statement delivered shortly there-
 after in Parliament, a senior government minister threatened to revoke the business
 license of the independent newspaper, claiming that it reported an inaccurate and
 negative picture of the Government as it approached general elections at the end
 of the year. The newspaper denied that it had reported inaccurately. Following pres-
 sure from the Government, the newspaper began printing articles in French, even
 though it was uneconomical to do so and the newspaper catered to a predominantly
 English-speaking audience. A senior government official also threatened not to
 renew the expatriate publisher's residency permit. Although none of the threats
 were carried out, their persistence may induce a degree of self-censorship on the
 part of the otherwise independent newspaper.
 Media reports directed to external audiences do not incur the same government
 response. PACNEWS, a Pacific regional news agency which moved its headquarters
 to Vanuatu in 1994, continued to transmit stories throughout the region even when
 they included criticism of the countrys leaders. Correspondents for international
 media are also allowed to report from Vanuatu without interference.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Permits must be obtained to
 hold public demonstrations and rallies. Although not allowed such a permit for Bas-
 tille Day, when the French Embassy had planned celebratory activities, nongovern-
 
 
 737
 mental organizations (NGO'S) in Port Vila a month later were permitted to march
 and demonstrate against the resumption of French nuclear testing.
 The Government does not restrict the forming of political parties and other
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The law provides for freedom of religion, and the Govern-
 ment generally respected it in practice. Missionaries of various Christian denomina-
 tions work without restriction. In June Parliament passed the Religious Bodies Act
 over opposition objections that it was unconstitutional. The Act would have given
 the Government the right to register and control the activities of religious organiza-
 tions. The President refused to sign the Act into law.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-All citizens are free to travel internally and externally and to return
 from abroad without restrictions.
 There are no refugees in Vanuatu, and there is no clearly defimed policy on asy-
 lum. However the Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner or
 Refugees (UNHCR). A UNHCR representative visited Vanuatu twice in 1995 to dis-
 cuss the possibility of Vanuatu's accession to the Protocol Relating to the Status of
 Refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right peacefully to change their government. The Constitution
 provides for parliamentary elections every 4 years. After the general elections on
 November 30, a new coalition government was installed in December, with Serge
 Vohor, leader of the Francophone Union of Moderate Parties, as Prime Minister,
 and Fr. Walter Lini of the Anglophone National United Party as Deputy Prime Min-
 ister. The predominantly AngIophone Unity Front, which won the most seats in the
 November election, was unable to put together a coalition and now fbrms the opposi-
 tion. Former prime minister Maxime Carot Korman was elected Speaker of the 'Par-
 liament.
 Outside observers generally consider the 1995 campaign and voting to be fair, al-
 though the Government's influence on the media prevented opposition parties from
 fully publicizing their views. The Government has also been accused of politically
 biased employment practices, especially since the firing of a significant number of
 public servants following the 1994 general strike (see Section 6.a.).
 Traditional attitudes, in which males are dominant and females are frequently
 limited to customary family roles, hamper women from taking a more active role
 in economic and political life. One member of Parliament is a woman; however-as
 is the mayor of the second largest town.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitudes Regarding International and Nongovernmental
 Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no restrictions on the formation of local human rights organizations.
 Vanuatu's first such, the Human Rights Forum, was founded in 1994.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The 1980 Constitution provides fundamental rights and freedoms to "all persons
 without discrimination on the grounds of race, place of origin, religious or tradi-
 tional beliefs, political opinions, language, or sex." Despite constitutional and legal
 protections, women remain the victims of discrimination in this traditionally based
 society. Due to high rates of unemployment, there are few jobs available to the dis-
 abled
 Women.-Violence against women, particularly wife beating, is believed to be com-
 mon, although no accurate statistics exist. Courts occasionally prosecute offenders
 using common law assault as a basis for prosecution since there are no specific laws
 against wife beating. A senior police official was fined by the courts and threatened
 with imprisonment if he again physically abused his wife within the next 16
 months. However, most cases of violence against women, including rape, go unre-
 ported because women, particularly in rural areas, are reluctant to report them for
 fear of further abuse. In addition, police are frequently reluctant to intervene in
 what are considered to be domestic matters.
 While women in theory have equal rights under the law, they are only slowly
 emerging from a traditional culture characterized by male dominance, a general re-
 luctance to educate women, and a widespread belief that women should devote
 themselves primarily to childbearing. The then-Deputy Prime Minister, Sethy
 Regenvanu, at the U.N. Conference for Women in Beijing, where he headed
 Vanuatu's delegation stated that it would take time to implement the laws which
 the Government had passed giving equal rights to women. He also announced
 
 
 738
 Vanuatu's ratification of the International Agreement on Elimination of All Forma
 of Discrimination Against Women.
 The majority of women enter into marriage through "bride-price payment," a prac-
 tice which encourages men to view women as property. Women are also inhibited
 by tradition from owning land, and at least one women s advocate believes this limi-
 tation serves to underpin their secondary status. Members of the National Council
 of Women (NCW) also view village chiefs as a primary obstacle to the attainment
 of social, political and economic rights of women. To increase women's awareness
 of their political rights as general elections approached, the NCW organized a 2-
 week seminar on "women in politics and encouraged women to become candidates.
 Children.-Although the Government has made education a priority, access to
 education is limited and school attendance is not compulsory. Children are protected
 within the traditional extended-family system. Members of the extended family, par-
 ticularly paternal uncles, play an active role in a child's development. As a result
 virtually no children are homeless or abandoned. There is no pattern of societal
 abuse, although cases of child abuse are occasionally reported.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no known governmental or national policy on
 the disabled and no legislation mandating access for them. Their protection and care
 is left to the traditional extended family and to voluntary NGO's.
 NationallRacial /Ethnic Minorities.-Most of the population is made up of Mela-
 nesians. Small minorities of Chinese, Fijians, Vietnamese, Tongans, and Europeans
 are generally concentrated in two towns and on a few plantations; they experience
 some discrimination with regard to land ownership. There is no evidence to suggest
 a pattern of ethnic discrimination in the provision of the limited basic services
 which the Government provides.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Riht of Association.-The law provides workers with the right to organize
 unions. Unions may not affiliate with international labor federations without gov-
 ernment permission.
 Approximately 29,000 persons participate in the formal economy as wage earners.
 There are five trade unions. The unions are grouped under an umbrella organiza-
 tion, the Vanuatu National Council of Trade Unions, a member of the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions. The trade unions are independent of the Gov-
 ernment and ran a number of candidates under the Labor Party banner in the No-
 vember 1995 general election.
 The high percentage of the population still engaged in subsistence agriculture and
 fishing deters extensive union activity. In addition, membership in the Vanuatu
 Public Servants Union fell dramatically following the Government's wholesale dis-
 missal of hundreds of full-time public servants during a protracted general strike
 in 1994. The Supreme Court in February 1994 ruled that the union had not com-
 plied with its own rules when it undertook the general strike and it declared the
 strike illegal. Combined union membership in the private and public sectors report-
 edly  has fallen from more than 4,000 to less than 1,000 in the aftermath of the 1994
 strike.
 The law prohibits retribution if the strike is legal. In the case of private-sector
 employees, violations would be referred to the Labor Department for conciliation
 and arbitration. In the public sector, violations would be handled by the Public Serv-
 ice Commission.
 In August Parliament passed a law requiring unions to give 30-days' notice of in-
 tent to strike, with a list of the names of intending strikers.
 There was no strike activity in 1995.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions exercise the right to
 organize and bargain collectively. Labor unions negotiate wages and conditions di-
 rectly with management. If the two sides cannot agree, the matter is referred to a
 thre-member arbitration bard appointed by the Minister of Home Affairs. The
 board consists of one representative from organized labor, one from management,
 and the senior magistrate of the magistrate's court. While a dispute is before the
 board, labor may not strike and management may not dismiss union employees.
 Unions and management, however, generally reach agment on wages without
 having to refer the matter to arbitration. Complaints of antiunion discrimination are
 referred to the Commissioner of Labor. While the law does not require union rec-
 ogni'tion, once a union is recognized, it does prohibit antiunion discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, and there were no reports that either is practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law prohibits children under
 12 years of age from working outside of family-owned agricultural production, where
 
 
 many children assist their parents. Employment of children from 12 to 18 years of
 age is restricted by occupational category and conditions of labor, for example, re-
 strictions on employment in the shipping industry and on night-time employment.
 The Labor Department effectively enforces these laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Vanuatu has a legislated minimum wage, ef-
 fectively enforced by the Labor Department. In February it was raised to a Ilat rate
 of approximately $143 (16,000 Vatu) per month for both urban and rural workers.
 The previous minimum wage was approximately $93 for rural workers and $107
 (13,200 Vatu) for urban workers. The minimum wage would not support an urban
 family living entirely on the cash economy. Most families are not dependent solely
 on wages for their livelihoods.
 Various laws regulate the rights to sick leave, annual vacations, and other condi-
 tions of employment, including a 44-hour maximum workweek, with at least one 24-
 hour rest period weekly. Vanuatu's Employment Act, enforced by the Labor Depart-
 ment, includes provisions for safety standards. However, the 1987 safety and health
 legislation is inadequate to protect workers engaged in logging, agriculture, con-
 struction, and manufacturing, and the single inspector attached to the Labor De-
 partment is hard pressed to enforce the Act fully. Workers do have the right to re-
 move themselves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to their contin-
 ued employment.
