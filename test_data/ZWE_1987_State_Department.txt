 ZIMBABWE
 Zimbabwe has a parliamentary form of government, with a
 popularly elected legislature. A single party, the Zimbabwe
 African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU), has dominated
 the legislative and executive branches of government, but a
 parliamentary opposition has existed since independence. On
 December 22, 1987, the President of Zimbabwe and of ZANU,
 Robert Mugabe, and Joshua Nkomo, the head of the main
 opposition party, the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union (ZAPU),
 announced their agreement to merge the two parties. ZAPU has
 been strongest in Matabeleland North and Matabeleland South
 and has considerable strength in the Midlands, but is weak
 elsewhere. Historical animosities between the two major
 ethnic groupings, the Shona majority (which generally has
 supported ZANU) and the Ndebele minority (generally loyal to
 ZAPU) continued, despite the ultimately successful negotiations
 by the leaders of ZANU and ZAPU to unify their parties at the
 end of 1987.
 The security forces have three branches. The Zimbabwe
 Republic Police is responsible for maintaining law and order
 and includes the Criminal Investigation Division (CID), the
 Police Intelligence and Security Inspectorate (PISI), and the
 paramilitary Police Support Unit (PSU). All branches of the
 police report to the Minister of Home Affairs, Eaos Nkala.
 The Central Intelligence Organization (CIO), attached to the
 Prime Minister's office, has both an intelligence and
 counterintelligence function. CIO operatives have police
 powers and can arrest, detain, and interrogate suspects in
 internal security cases. Finally, the armed forces, which
 number about 50,000 members, are also involved in internal
 security, usually in antidissident operations. In marked
 contrast to the 1982-1985 period, few reports of human rights
 abuses have been ascribed to the armed forces although the
 military reportedly has been involved with the police in
 forced repatriations of Mozambican refugees.
 Zimbabwe has a wide range of resources, including both a
 strong agricultural and a manufacturing base, but its important
 export-import capacity is heavily dependent on the rail links
 that pass through South Africa. To overcome this dependency,
 Zimbabwe has undertaken a major effort, with Western donor
 support, to revitalize the rail-port system through Mozambique
 to the town of Beira. In so doing, Zimbabwe increasingly has
 become involved in the Mozambican civil strife and has
 committed thousands of combat troops to the war in Mozambique.
 Beginning in 1986, there has been a trend towards decreased
 human rights abuses by the Government of Zimbabwe; a
 significant exception has been the sometimes brutal forced
 repatriation of over 9,000 Mozambican refugees and the forced
 resettlement in refugee camps of thousands more spontaneously
 settled Mozambicans. Abuses by Mozambican National Resistance
 (MNR/RENAMO) guerrillas crossing over from Mozambique,
 dissidents in Matabeleland, and forces intent upon attacking
 persons and buildings believed to be associated with the
 African National Congress (ANC) are on the increase. The
 major incidents of 1987 include the bombing of an ANC-occupied
 apartment in June and the car-bombing of a shopping center in
 October (both of which occurred in Harare); MNR incursions
 along the length of Zimbabwe's eastern border, resulting in
 the murder, kidnaping, and disappearance of Zimbabwean
 citizens (with particular brutality toward children); and the
 murder of scores of unarmed black and white civilians in the
 western part of Zimbabwe by armed dissidents in Matabeleland.

 ZIMBABWE
 These attacks in Matabeleland and Midlands provinces provide
 the Government with its justification for continuing the state
 of emergency which the Parliament routinely ratifies every 6
 months. The Government banned meetings by the political
 opposition and detained some leading members of the opposition
 for several months in 1987.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 .Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There viere no reports of political killings by government
 security forces in 1987. There has been, however, an increase
 in killings, which appear to be politically motivated,
 committed by armed insurgents known as "dissidents".
 Dissidents increasingly have focused their attacks on whites
 in Matabeleland, although many black Zimbabweans also have
 been victims. According to official government figures for
 the 6 months ending June 30, dissidents committed 42 murders,
 22 rapes, and 80 armed robberies. On September 7, six
 government health workers were killed by dissidents. On
 November 26, armed dissidents massacred 16 persons, including
 2 Americans, in a nighttime attack on a religious mission.
 The tactics of the armed bandits are often brutal, include
 torture, and are aimed at suspected members of ZANU, government
 officials-, white farmers, and civilians accused of "selling
 out" to the Government.
 The MNR announced in late 1986 its intention to take the
 Mozambican conflict into Zimbabwe. MNR forces, operating
 along the Mozambique-Zimbabwe border, committed a number of
 atrocities in 1987, including, according to reliable reports,
 bayoneting to death five school children and mutilating others
 in Zimbabwe on November 19 and the axe murder of a family of 7
 on November 26.
 b. Disappearance
 Human rights observers in both Harare and Bulawayo reported
 that in 1987 there were no new cases of disappearance
 attributable to the Government. There has been, however, no
 progress in locating any of the people, almost all of whom
 were from Ndebele regions, who reportedly disappeared in
 1985. Estimates of the number of disappeared range from at
 least 80 to as many as 400.  In 1986 families of several
 missing persons filed legal action against the Government for
 failure adequately to investigate these disappearances. The
 Government has not resolved these cases which remain open.
 There also are numerous reports that MNR forces from Mozambique
 kidnaped black Zimbabwean citizens from the Eastern border
 areas, using them as bearers. Many of them have never been
 seen again.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There have been scattered, firsthand reports of torture in
 1987 indicating that torture may continue to be employed in
 some security cases. Senior government officials strongly
 deny that torture is condoned but have admitted that isolated,
 unauthorized instances have occurred.
 
 
 358
 ZIMBABWE
 Police brutality in ordinary criminal cases is also a problem.
 In one example of police brutality, a group of white school
 girls in Bulawayo reportedly were beaten by police after being
 detained for allegedly insulting an officer. Such cases of
 brutality against whites are reported more frequently than
 cases of brutality against blacks. Black Zimbabweans often
 appear not to report instances of police brutality out of fear
 of reprisals and the perception that they will not receive
 much public attention. Occasionally, police are prosecuted on
 charges of brutality but are rarely punished severely. In 1987
 a provincial court in Matabeleland convicted 2 police officers
 for torturing a civilian. The sentence imposed was a fine,
 with no term of imprisonment.
 Available evidence indicates that prison conditions in Zimbabwe
 are generally Spartan. There have been allegations of poor
 sanitary and medical facilities and routine mistreatment of
 prisoners in the notorious Stops Camp detention facility in
 Bulawayo. The regular prison population reportedly is lower
 than last year. The Government, however, will not divulge the
 actual number of inmates.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 A state of emergency, renewed every 6 months by parliamentary
 vote on the Emergency Powers Act, has been in continuous effect
 in Zimbabwe since 1965. Under the state of emergency, persons
 may be detained without an arrest warrant and held for up to 7
 days before being informed of the reasons for detention. The
 law states that a detainee has the right to see a lawyer
 "without delay" after having been detained. Though the reasons
 for detention may initially be quite vague, detainees must
 receive enough specific detail to enable them to make
 meaningful representations on their behalf.
 Zimbabwean law states that, after 30 days, a detainee must
 appear before an independent review tribunal which can
 recommend to the Minister of Home Affairs that the detainee be
 released if evidence is insufficient to warrant continued
 incarceration. The Minister may, however, recommend to the
 President that the detainee continue to be held. In such
 cases, the President may then order the Minister to overrule
 the tribunal's recommendation.
 The Government overruled the findings of the review tribunal
 in 1987 in the cases of John Austin and Neil Harper, two senior
 customs officials who were detained in 1986 on charges of
 spying for South Africa, released by the Supreme Court for
 lack of reasonable suspicion of the charges, and then
 redetained under the emergency powers regulations. Though the
 review tribunal initially confirmed their continued detention,
 a subsequent review recommended their release. The Government
 has, however, continued to detain them. The case again is on
 appeal to the Supreme Court.
 Due to procedural delays, a detainee may have to wait several
 months before appearing at the review tribunal, and there have
 been scattered incidents of the tribunal forgeting about
 detainees for several months. If the tribunal recommends
 continued detention, however, the case need not be reviewed
 again for another 6 months.
 The Government also has made extensive use of emergency powers
 in vaguely defined security cases, particularly in the absence
 of solid evidence of wrongdoing. Because the emergency powers
 
 
 359
 ZIMBABWE
 regulations do not require any evidence of criminal activity
 before a suspect may be detained, the professionalism of police
 investigations has been eroded. The most common reasons for
 detention under the state of emergency are suspected dissident
 activity, support for dissidents, or spying for foreign powers,
 particularly South Africa. The Government has detained
 political opponents of the ruling party (ZANU) as well as some
 of its supporters. In most cases, however, the Government
 ultimately orders the arrest and charging of individuals under
 the Law and Order Maintenance Act, which provides sanctions
 for political crimes. Such action then becomes part of a
 judicial process with recourse to a court trial.
 Bail is generally.left to the discretion of the courts.
 However', the Minister of Home Affairs can order the refusal of
 bail in any'case, particalarly those concerning security or
 exchange control violations, by submitting a certificate which
 denies bail to the persons under arrest. The Government has
 made extensive use of this prerogative in security-related
 cases.
 It is difficult to specify the number of persons currently
 detained on politically related charges. Reliable estimates
 point to 35-45 long-term detainees. Human rights observers
 report, however, that there are far fewer detainees in 1987
 than there were in 1986. It is impossible to determine the
 number of short-term detainees held at any given time.
 Zimbabwe law forbids the use of forced labor, and f6rced labor
 is not practiced.
 e. Deni[l of Fair Public Trial
 Zimbabwe's leg~l system is based on a mixture of Roman-Dutch
 and English common law practices and progedures, and consists
 of magisterial courts, a High Court, and a Supreme Court. All
 trials are open to the public, except in very rare cases when
 the Government orders proceedings to, be held in camera. In
 most instances defendants must retain their own legal counsel
 because there is limited provision-for public defenders.
 Defense ,ounsel can present evidence and confront witnesses.
 The right to appeal exists in all cases.
 Persons-brought to trial can be assured of a fair public
 hearing comparable to that found in most Western democracies.
 The Government generally abides by court decisions even when
 it strongly opposes the ruling. However, according to statute,
 the Executive Branch is not- ound to award damages to persons
 even if so ordered by the courts.
 Although there are at present 500 lawyers in Zimbabwe, there
 is a sh6rage of experienced magistrates. Zimbabwe's judicial
 system is hard pressed to cope with ordinary criminal cases.
 Case and law rporting are 3 years out of date. Given the
 inexperience of magistrates and'the slowness of information
 flows, it is inevitable that errors occur.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, .or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution formally protects citizens from arbitrary
 search or'entry. Under emergency power regulations, however,
 a police officei'mak stop and search any person or enter any
 area without a wairant when the officer has "reasonable
 grounds" for believing evidence of a crime may exist. *
 
 
 360
 ZIMBABWE
 Although no cases were brought to the courts in 1987, it is
 widely believed that the Government continues to monitor
 private correspondence and telephones.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Zimbabwe Constitution provides for freedom of expression
 but allows for legislation limiting this freedom in certain
 cases, for example, when the "interest of defense, public
 safety, public order, state economic interests, public
 morality and public health" are involved.
 The Government tends to interpret broadly its power to
 discourage free speech. In 1987, for example, several people
 were arrested and charged with misdemeanors under the
 Miscellaneous Offenses Act for uttering remarks disrespectful
 of the Prime Minister or government policies. At public
 events, it is generally assumed that speakers are under
 surveillance and may be subject to follow-up police action if
 the remarks are judged too controversial. Even in private
 gatherings, Zimbabweans are sometimes reluctant to voice
 political complaints openly, particularly if they do not know
 their interlocutors well.
 Zimbabwe's major print media (five English-language newspapers
 and one vernacular broadsheet) are government controlled.
 Other, smaller, privately owned print media are, however,
 allowed to operate. Television and radio are wholly
 government owned. Senior media officials follow the official
 government/ruling party line closely and practice a high
 degree of self-censorship. Press coverage which disputes the
 main lines of government policy, criticizes the ruling party,
 or questions the actions of senior government or party
 officials is rare. The Herald and the Sunday Mail were forced
 to issue retractions on at least two occasions in 1987. The
 first instance was over an article on India's involvement in
 Sri Lanka. Of greater consequence was the Sunday Mail account
 on April 12 of Cuba's expulsion of Zimbabwean students. The
 Prime Minister publicly apologized to Cuba's visiting Foreign
 Minister for the Sunday Mail stories and denounced the stories
 as "reactionary." Stating that Zimbabwe "cannot have a
 reactionary press," the Prime Minister promised to deal
 "personally" with the "holder of the pen." Sunday Mail editor
 Muradzikwa subsequently was dismissed, although eventually he
 was given an administrative position with the paper.
 On the other hand, the government-controlled press has devoted
 considerable coverage to reports issued by the commission of
 inquiry into parastatals (public corporations) because of the
 high status accorded to the commission by the Prime Minister.
 These reports often have narrated explicit tales of official
 corruption and mismanagement. There also have been reports in
 1987 criticizing inefficiency or poor planning in selected
 social or economic areas. The independent weekly Financial
 Gazette focuses on business news but exhibits more
 investigative range (including political coverage) and
 analytical depth than government-owned media. In 1986
 Information Minister Shamuyarira accused the Financial Gazette
 of serving as a "mouthpiece" for foreign powers and threatened
 unspecified action against the paper unless it modified its
 reporting and editorial procedures. Although the Financial
 Gazette was threatened with similar-"unspecified actions" in
 1987, no official action was taken against the paper.
 
 
 361
 ZIMBABWE
 International journal.ists also have been threatened from time
 to time.. In May three journalists were detained and
 interrdgated xeppatedly because  olic  suspected that the
 reporters had haa -advance knowledge of the South African
 attack.on'the Zamb*an-border town of Livingstone.
 b. Freedom f" Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution formally provides for the right of assembly
 and association for political and nonpolitical organizations
 including a broad spectrum of economic, professional, social,
 and recreational activities. In practice, there are serious
 obstacles to the full exercise of this right,, particularly in
 the case of poitibal~associations._
 Police permits  aie reqiiired for public meetings and political
 rallies. Althduigh~zAPu held some public rallies early in
 1987, its meetings-offici.ally were banned, and its offices
 closed by. police order fxoi mid-September until the end of
 November_-IThd"preponderaht position of ZANU in the country
 has helped  16 foster the assumption that mefibership in the
 party is a demonstration of loyalty and patriotism (as well as
 an advantagp~ik..terms of professional and social advancement),
 whereas identification with minority.parties is suspect and a
 form of political deviance.
 There are numerous nonjolitical bus iness and employers'
 organizations, professional associations, and recreational and
 sports.c.ubs, tiat.-are generally free~of governmental
 interference. The Government has. ntervened, however, when it
 perceives any association activity to b  straying into even
 remotely p6lit1ical waters.
 Under theco6hprehiensive.labor legislation passed in 1985,
 labor has-the righf to 6rganize and bargain.collectively. The
 Governh'nt, however,'sets guidelines for minimum salary
 increases which serve as a floor above which the trade unions
 may negotiate. Vith management for greater increases. The
 Government'also piomulgates all regu'laions iegarding the
 hiring and firing.of workers, thus effectively preempting._
 another aspect, of the col6ctiye. bargaining process. In ,
 addition, the Zimbabwe labor ,ofde'only permits "collective job
 action".which does. not affect "essential services-" The
 Minister of'Labor has the discretion to decide what is an
 "essentialservice," so the Government has the capacity to
 declare ant strike.to be illegal. Trade unions, acting
 through the umbrella Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU),
 generally cooperate.with the Government, though the
 Government's party, ZANU, does iot have any special strength
 within the trade union moyement.
 Approximately 17 percent of Zimbabwean workers belong to the
 ZCTU. The,.trade union movement is still young, somewhat
 disorganizbd, and undisciplined. The ZCTU also has been
 unable to promote'public discussions of the Government's labor
 policy. At the1987 May Day ceremonies, the Prime Minister
 declared that-the Government would issue guidelines for a wage
 increasb. In. July, however; the Government imposed a wage
 freeze, and the ZCTU was not even able to meet with the Prime
 Minister to present its case. Though the ZCTU has threatened
 strikes in the past, it did not call for strikes in 1987.
 Such inaction has eroded the ZCTU's credibility. Since the
 July wage freeze, workers have staged various short-term
 wildcat strikes, and a strike by the Shoemakers Union on
 October 26 was quickly quashed by government order.
 
 
 362
 ZIMBABWE
 The ZCTU is officially nonaligned. It receives funding from,
 but is not affiliated with, the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions. The ZCTU also maintains contacts with the
 American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial
 Organizations through the African American Labor Center and
 with trade unions from the Eastern Bloc. The ZCTU is a member
 of the Organization of Africa Trade Union Unity and the
 Southern Africa Trade Union Coordination Council, as well as a
 participant in the International Labor Organization.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is respected in Zimbabwe. There is no
 state-established religion. Denominations are permitted to
 worship openly, pursue social and charitable activities, and
 maintain ties to affiliates and coreligionists abroad.
 Religious belief is neither a handicap nor an advantage in
 terms of professional or political advancement. Many
 government leaders received their education in mission
 schools, and a number of senior ZANU officials are, in fact,
 clergymen. Elective courses in religious studies are part of
 the secondary school curriculum.
 The Government in isolated cases has intervened to settle
 disputes within fringe religious groups.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel at home and abroad is not generally subject to official
 restrictions, although travel restrictions have been
 occasionally applied against those who it was believed might
 criticize the Government before foreign audiences. This
 practice does not appear to be widespread. A far more serious
 practical obstacle to foreign travel is currency control,
 which severely limits the amount of foreign currency Zimbabwe
 nationals can take out of the country.
 Immigration is not restricted, although persons who have left
 the country are not guaranteed the right to return if they
 were not born in Zimbabwe. Applicants must be able to
 demonstrate proof of livelihood. Repatriates from South
 Africa are always suspect and are considered economic
 competition for black Zimbabweans. Another significant group
 of repatriates consists of political refugees who have
 returned primarily from Dukwe Camp in Botswana. Almost 950 of
 these repatriates have reentered Zimbabwe since 1985.
 Zimbabwe has also accepted at least 70,000 refugees and
 displaced persons from Mozambique, many of whom are fleeing
 civil strife and economic deprivation. These refugees are
 accommodated in camps near the Mozambican border. The
 Government fears that MNR guerrillas infiltrate Zimbabwe under
 the cover of these refugees, and it has declared its intention
 to repatriate them. The police and the army have forcibly
 repatriated over 9,000 Mozambican refugees from Zimbabwe. The
 repatriations have resulted in many injuries and some deaths,
 and about 300 Mozambican men are missing. Families also have
 been separated. Over 5,000 dependents were left behind in
 Zimbabwe. In addition, self-settled Mozambican refugees and
 transient workers have been forced into refugee camps which
 lacked the infrastructure to deal with the influx.

 ZIMBABWE
 Section 3 Respect'for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 .to Change Their Government
 Zimbabwe currently has a popularly elected government. The
 decision-to merge the two major parties, ZANU and ZAPU,
 announced Decdmber 22; 1987, will leave eight members of the
 Assembly who are not members of the merged party; seven of
 these, however; were supported by ZANU. Other parties are not
 forbidden by law. On December 31, Robert -ugabe, the head of
 ZANU, was inaugurated as the first dxecutive President of the
 country in a constitutional change to replace the Westminster
 model created by the Lancaster House agreement. Most Members
 of Parliament rdpresent electoral-districts and are chosen by
 direct, universal:suffrage. Other Members of Parliament are
 nominafed.bythe'President, are traditional chiefs, or'were
 elected by incumbent House of'Assembly members.-
 The President is Head of State and Head of Government and is
 responsible to Parliament. He presides over the Cabinet,
 which is the'executive decisionmaking body. The Parliament
 contains two chambers: the House of Assembly and the Senate.
 Late in 1987; Zimbabwe's-Parliament passed two major
 constitutibnal and election law amendments which affected
 racial representation in the Parliament and the nature of the
 executive.- The Lancaster House Constitution of 1979 previously
 reserved 20of 100 seats-in the House of Assembly and 10 of 40
 seats in the Senate for whites who were elected by a- separate
 white electoral roll. These reserved seats and the separate,
 white voters' roll were abolished by a constitutiohal
 amendment approved by Parliament. The remaining 80 mdmbers of
 the House of Assembly, acting as an electoral college, elected
 new members-to the House of Assembly and the Senate in October.
 Fifteen black and 15 white Zimbabweans were elected to fill
 the vacant seats. All of these replacement Members of
 Parliament were nominated by ZANU, which gives the ruling
 party an overwhelming majority in both houses of Parliament.
 It should be noted that the 15 whites elected to the
 Parliament late last year were not nominated by ZANU, although
 ZANU did support their election.
 The second constitutional amendment replaced the prime
 ministerial system of government with an executive presidency.
 Though the President will eventually be-directly elected by a
 common voters' roll to a term of 6 years, in the transition
 the President was chosen by a simple majority of the present
 Parliament and will-serve in office until the first popular
 presidential election. The constitutional amendment mandates
 that this presidential election take place not-later than the
 next parliamentary general election now scheduled for 1990.
 The President appoints the Vice President and the rest of the
 Cabinet, who'serve at his pleasure. The President is not
 obliged to consult the Cabinet on the dissolution or
 prorogation of Parliament or on ministerial appointments.
 Successful votes of no confidence require the approval of
 two-thirds of the Assembly. A two-thirds majority vote also
 is necessary to override a-presidential veto. As an
 alternative to resigning in response to a successful
 no-confidence vote, the President must either dissolve
 Parliament or dismiss the Vice President and the entire
 Cabinet. The office of Prime Minister does not exist in this
 nei executive system.
 
 
 a64
 ZIMBABWE
 The current President, Robert Mugabe, has made clear his
 intention to proceed toward the establishment of a one-party
 state, and the ZANU-ZAPU merger agreement explicitly endorses
 this goal. Creation of a one-party state in Zimbabwe will
 significantly alter the current governing arrangement whereby
 opposition parties, although discriminated against and
 harassed by the Government, still play an important role in
 preserving democratic processes. However, the new united
 ZANU, in absorbing the several and competing ethnic groups
 that make up Zimbabwe, will probably continue to be the arena
 of political jostling and competition.
 With regard to local government, the opposition party ZAPU
 swept 9 of 12 Matabeleland districts in the June elections for
 district councillors. During the campaign a ZANU activist was
 murdered for refusing to attend a ZAPU rally in Hwange, and an
 independent candidate (with close ties to ZANU) in the Inyati
 district elections claimed to have been threatened by "armed
 dissidents." Citing "voter intimidation," the Government
 annulled the elections in Hwange and Inyati and postponed
 elections in the Insiza and Gwanda districts for "security
 reasons." The incumbent district councillors, most of whom
 belonged to ZAPU, were allowed to remain in office in these
 districts. In the remaining districts, the newly elected
 councillors were allowed to take office.
 In September the Minister of Home Affairs ordered that ZAPU
 offices in Matabeleland be closed because ZAPU allegedly
 frustrated government programs and supported the "armed
 dissidents." Police raided the ZAPU office in Bulawayo and
 arrested 11 ZAPU officials, all of whom have now been
 released. Six Matabeleland district councils were dissolved.
 Five of these councils, including Hwange and Inyati, were
 ZAPU-controlled, and the sixth, Binga, was controlled by
 former ZAPU officials who had recently changed party
 affiliation to ZANU.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is highly sensitive to charges by international,
 nongovernmental organizations of human rights abuses in
 Zimbabwe. In 1986 the Government attempted to frustrate
 outside investigations of human rights abuses and denounced as
 lies reports of the abuse of human rights. It declared
 Amnesty International in 3986 an "enemy of the people," and,
 according to Amnesty International's 1987 Report, threatened
 that anyone who supplied the organization with information
 would be detained. In contrast to last year, there were
 neither threats nor detentions of human rights activists in
 1987. Though the Government reduced its pressure on human
 rights groups, officials continue publicly to deny that human
 rights abuses occur in Zimbabwe except in exceptional and
 unauthorized cases.
 Despite these public denials, senior government ministers
 privately have expressed a willingness to investigate cases
 involving alleged human rights abuses and to seek remedial
 action if necessary.
 Private Zimbabwean groups supporting efforts to increase
 public awareness of human rights principles and law operate
 without hindrance. For example, the Bulawayo-based Legal
 Projects Center and the Harare-based Legal Resources
 
 
 365
 ZIMBABWE
 Foundation operate libraries and information centers and are
 expanding activities to train lawyers in this branch of the
 law. The Legal Projects Center provides a legal aid clinic
 which handles matters ranging from locating missing detainees
 to domestic'disputes.
 The Government consistently has denied permission to the
 International Committee of the Red Cr6ss (ICRC) to visit
 prisoners. In 1986, however, some prominent foreigners were
 allowed to visit Stops Campdetention facility in Bulawayo,
 where fortxre and prisoner mistreatment had allegedly
 occurred. Evidence suggests that Stops Camp has been the
 scene of far fewer human rights abuses in 1987.
 Sectioi 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Government services in Zimbabwe are provided on a
 nondiscriminatory basis, and the Government has been able to
 work with 'the previously "whites only' infrastructure in urban
 areas to proVide health and other social services to all. In
 many rural areas, however, the neglect of the preindependence
 period still leaves the Government struggling to provide
 minimur care. Blacks on some commercial farms are still
 dependent mainly ons hite'farmers to meet basic health care
 and educational needs.
 In social terms, Zimbabwe remains a racially stratified
 country despite bans against official discrimination. While
 schools, churches, and clubs are all integrated, there is
 limited social interaction between racial groups. The
 "colored" (mixed race) community has complained of
 discrimination by the Government in allocation of civil
 service jobs.
 Efforts to change ingrained cultural practices are under way,
 but women still bear a heavy burden of discrimination in
 Zimbabwean society. All women still are vulnerable to
 traditional law, particularly concerning inheritance
 practices, but recent court rulings and legislation are
 improving the status of women. For example, the courts upheld
 in 1987 the legal right of a woman to inherit property. The
 contribution of wives to family property was recognized in the
 Matrimonial Causes Act passed late in 1985, which requires
 that family assets be distributed equitably when couples
 divorce. With regard to inheritance laws, the Government is
 attempting to blend customary practices into modern
 legislation. A woman's position is still tenuous when it
 comes to inheriting her husband's estate if he did not leave a
 valid will. Zimbabwe law prohibits "kuzvarira", or pledging of
 young girls to marriage partners notof their own choosing.
 However, unless the girl is well educated and outspoken,
 marriages based on "kuzvarira" still occur within the
 traditional setting Also, the tradition of "lobola" (bride
 'price) continues.
 Due to concern over the spread of AIDS, the police have again.
 attempted to crack down on prostitution. The police have
 shown considerably more restraint and discretion than they did
 in 1986, and there have been no reports of indiscriminate
 harassment or detention of innocent women.

 ZIMBABWE
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The 1985 Labour Relations Act calls for strict enforcement of
 acceptable standards of health and safety, and these standards
 are uniformly enforced in the industrial sector with only a
 few isolated exceptions. Under Zimbabwe law, the minimum
 working age for the formalized economy is 18, but it is
 possible to begin an apprenticeship at age 16. The workweek
 can be as high as 60 hours but averages 44 hours. The law
 prescribes a 24-hour rest period each week. There were 15,345
 work-related accidents, including 194 deaths, in 1987 among
 the 1.5 million workers included in the Government's labor
 statistics.
 Minimum wage levels in Zimbabwe are set by the Government
 along sectoral lines. The current level for agro-industrial
 workers is approximately $90 per month. The minimum wage for
 general agricultural and domestic workers is about $52 per
 month, minimally adequate for a decent living. Most employers
 also provide housing, food, medical care, and, on commercial
 farms, full schooling, for workers and their families. The
 Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions has called upon the
 Government to establish a minimum "living wage" for its
 members of $173 per month. It is unlikely, however, that the
 Government will mandate such a substantial minimum wage
 increase in the foreseeable future.
