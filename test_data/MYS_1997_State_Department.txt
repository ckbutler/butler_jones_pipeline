 MALAYSIA
 Malaysia is a federation of 13 states with a parliamentary system of government
 based on periodic multiparty elections in which the ruling National Front coalition
 has held power since 1957. The coalition headed by Prime Minister Mahathir bin
 Mohamad increased its majority in a 1995 general election. Opposition parties ac-
 tively contest elections, although they hold only about 12 percent of the seats in the
 federal Parliament. An opposition party controls one state government. The Con-
 stitution provides for an independent judiciary, however, government-sponsored con-
 stitutional amendments and legislation have undermined judicial independence and
 increased executive influence over the judiciary in sensitive cases.
 The Royal Malaysian Police have primary responsibility for internal security mat-
 ters. The police report to and are under the effective control of the Minister of Home
 Affairs. The Prime Minister also holds the Home Affairs portfolio. There have been
 instances of abuse by some police officers.
 Foreign direct investment has played a vital role in economic development. High
 growth rates in exports of manufactured goods, such as semiconductors, have great-
 ly reduced reliance on traditional commodity exports such as tin, rubber, and palm
 oil. Consistently strong economic growth has led to significant reductions in poverty,
 an improved standard of living, and more equal income distribution. In the second
 half of 1997, the effects of the regional financial crisis, in addition to growing inter-
 national concerns over economic policy, contributed to a marked depreciation of the
 ringgit (the national currency) and a substantial decline in the Kuala Lumpur stock
 exchange.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; however,
 there were problems in some areas. The Government continued to arrest and detain
 citizens without trial, and prolonged pretrial detention is a problem. The Govern-
 ment sometimes limited judicial independence and freedom of assembly, association,
 speech, and the press. Partly as a result of these limits, opposition parties could not
 compete on equal terms with the long-ruling governing coalition. A Western cor-
 respondent was sentenced to 3 months' imprisonment for contempt of court in a case
 that raised questions about freedom of the press and judicial impartiality. A United
 Nations special rapporteur and a prominent jurist faced libel charges for their criti-
 cism of the judiciary. The trial and harassment of a prominent human rights activ-
 ist on criminal charges under the Publications Act also continued. Religious worship
 is subject to some restrictions. The Government continued to impose long-term re-
 strictions on movement without due process hearings. Violence against women and
 child abuse remain problems. Police did not always act on reports of domestic vio-
 lence. Some discrimination against indigenous people and ethnic minorities, and re-
 strictions on worker rights, persisted.
 
 
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings.
 In a June raid on illegal aliens in Johor, soldiers killed one illegal alien. Four sol-
 diers were later charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder;, at year's
 end the case was still pending. Because of this incident, the Defense Minister and
 Police Inspector General later announced an agreement on guidelines for future
 raids.
 Human rights groups also raised questions about several cases of prisoners who
 died while in police custody. In January the father of a suspect allegedly found
 hanged in his cell while being detained without trial under the Dangerous Drugs
 Act (after being acquitted on criminal charges) filed a complaint alleging police
 abuse. In June a suspected serial rapist being escorted by four policemen was shot
 and killed "after a struggle." In August a handcuffed Indonesian suspected of theft
 died of severe head wounds after he fell to the ground while being escorted by police
 officers.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There continued to be allegations that police officers abused criminal suspects and
 illegal alien detainees during interrogation and detention. Abuses included strong
 psychological pressure and sometimes physical mistreatment. In some cases, au-
 thorities have investigated police officials for such abuses, but, because the Govern-
 ment does not routinely release information on the results of the investigations,
 whether those responsible for abuses are punished is not always known.
 In September police announced the suspension of an officer pending a criminal in-
 vestigation for the beating of a 14-year-old irl.
 Criminal law prescribes caning as an aditional punishment to imprisonment for
 those convicted of some nonviolent crimes such as narcotics possession, criminal
 breach of trust, and alien smuggling. Judges routinely include caning in sentences
 of those convicted of such crimes as kidnaping, rape, and robbery. The caning, which
 is carried out with a  2-inch-thick wooden cane, commonly causes welts, and some-
 times causes scarring.
 Organizers canceled a planned conference on police abuse in response to a warn-
 in  of possible prosecution (see Section 1.d.). Over a dozen police officers were de-
 tamed Tor alleged involvement in criminal activities (see Section 1.d.).
 Prison conditions generally meet minimum international standards. Prisons meet
 basic human needs, including medical care, sanitation, nutrition, and family access.
 Overcrowding is a problem. In September the Prisons Department said that the
 total prison population exceeded the facilities' "comfortable capacity" by 12.3 per-
 cent.
 Prison guards have been accused and convicted of criminal wrongdoing, mostly in
 nonviolent narcotics cases. "Security" prisoners (see Section l.d.) are detained in a
 separate detention center. Conditions there are not significantly different from those
 for the regular prison population.
 In April police arrested a gang including officials of the Home Affairs Ministry,
 laiyers, and a police officer for extorting money from families of prisoners held
 under the Emergency Ordinance (see Section L.d.). In return for these payments, de-
 tainees were allegedly released from restricted residence provisions.
 Although the Government still holds some illegal aliens under inhuman condi-
 tions, conditions of detention for aliens generally improved.
 The Government has not permitted visits to prisons by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Three laws permit the Government to de-
 tain suspects without judicial review or the filing of formal charges: The 1960 Inter-
 nal Security Act (ISA), the Emergency (Public Order and Prevention of Crime) Ordi-
 nance of 1969, and the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1985. The Government continued
 to use long-term detention without trial in cases alleged to involve national security
 (including economic security), as well as in narcotics trafficking and other cases. Ac-
 cording to the Home Affairs Ministry, in 1996 there were a total of 2,008 people
 being detained without trial under these laws, most held under the Dangerous
 Drugs Act. The Government has not announced the total number of detainees in
 1997.
 Passed more than 30 years ago, when there was an active Communist insurgency,
 the ISA empowers the police to hold for up to 60 days any person who may act "in
 a manner prejudicial to the security of Malaysia." The Minister of Home Affairs may
 authorize, in writing, further detention for periods of up to 2 years. Those released
 before the end of their detention period are subject to "imposed restricted condi-
 
 
 tions," for the balance of their detention periods. These conditions limit their rights
 to freedom of speech association, and travel outside the country.
 Accordin-g to the dovernment, the goal of the ISA is to control internal subversion.
 In fact, the act is now used for other purposes. The Government uses the ISA
 against passport and identity card forgers andi against teleommunications fraud. In
 April the Deputy Home Affairs Minister stated that no one was under detention
 under the ISA for political reasons. As of Apri, 189 people were being detained for
 document forgery. IJul the Police Inspector General said that 72 people were de-
 tained under the ISA for telecommunications fraud (primarily the illegal cloning of
 cellular phones). In November 10 people, 2 of whom were over 75 years old, were
 detained under the ISA for spreading Shi'ite teachings. Two of the prisoners were
 later released on a technicality, but rearrested (again under the ISA) just minutes
 after they left the courtroom. Police released two of these detainees in late Decem-
 ber (see Section 2.c.). In December police detained three people, including two civil
 servants, under the ISA for issuing forged identity cards. Also in December,plice
 detained nine Nigerians under the-ISA for bank fraud. According to prison officials,
 at the end of the year, slightly under 200 prisoners were under ISA detention.
 In 1997 all members ofthe outlawed Islamic fundamentalist movement Al Arqam
 who were still in detention after being previously arrested under the ISA were re-
 leased. Some members remain under restricted residence.
 Security authorities sometimes wait several days after detention before informing
 a detainee's family. Even when there are no formal charges, the authorities must
 inform detainees of the accusations against them and permit them to appeal to an
 advisory board for review every 6 months. Advisory board decisions and rec-
 ommendations, however, are not binding on the Home Affairs Minister, are not
 made public, and often are not shown to the detainee. In the past, a number of ISA
 detainees have refused to participate in the review process under these cir-
 cumstances.
 Amendments to the ISA severely limit judicial review of detentions. Opposition
 leaders and human rights oganizations continued to call on the Government to re-
 peal the ISA and other le slation that deprive people of the right to defend them-
 selves in court. In December the Bar Council sponsored a seminar on the ISA and
 called for its repeal.
 The Government has been reviewing the ISA since May 1995. In April the Deputy
 Home Minister said that the Government would revise but not abolish it. In May
 he said that sentencing under the revised ISA would be more flexible and that sen-
 tences would sometimes exceed the current limit of 2 years.
 In early September after a sharp fall in the ringgit and the Kuala Lumpur stock
 exchange, the Police Inspector General said that the Government would not hesitate
 to use the ISA against local "economic saboteurs" involved in supporting "rogue for-
 eign exchange speculators." The Deputy Prime Minister later stated that, although
 the Government reserved this right in principle, it was not currently necessary to
 pursue such prosecutions; no one has been prosecuted under the ISA for financial
 speculation.
 Organizers canceled a planned January nongovernmental organizations' (NGO's)
 conference on police abuse after the Government warned that NGO's that "baited"
 the Government might be prosecuted under the ISA.
 Under the 1969 Emergency Ordinance, which was instituted after intercommunal
 riots in that year, the Home Affairs Minister can issue a detention order for up to
 2 years against a person if he deems it necessary to protect public order or for the
 'suppression of violence or the prevention of crimes involving violence." According
 to the Home Affairs Ministry, there were 56 people in detention under the Emer-
 gency Ordinance in 1996, compared with 447 in 1995. The Government has not dis-
 closed the number of detainees in 1997.
 Police announced in June that 14 police officers had been detained without trial
 under the Emergency Ordinance for alleged involvement in criminal activities.
 Provisions of the 1985 amendments to the Dangerous Drugs Act give the Govern-
 ment specific power to detain suspected drug traffickers. The suspects may be held
 for up to 39 days before the Home Affairs Minister must issue a detention order.
 Once the Ministry has issued an order, the detainee is entitled to a habeas corpus
 hearing before a court. In some instances, the judge may order the detainee's re-
 lease. Suspects may be held without charge for successive 2-year intervals, with
 periodic review by an advisory beard, whose opinion is binding on the Home Affairs
 Minister. However, the review process contains none of the due process rights that
 a defendant would have in a court proceeding. According to the National Narcotics
 Agency, from January to September, 1,081 persons were arrested under the amend-
 ments that provide for detention without trial, an increase of 24 percent over 1996.
 The total number of people under detention has not been disclosed. The police fre-
 
 
 840
 quently rearrest suspected narcotics traffickers and firearms offenders under the
 preventive measures clauses of the Dangerous Drugs Act after an acquittal in court
 on formal charges.
 Immigrationilaws are used to detain possible illegal aliens without trial or hear-
 ing. The detainees are not accorded any administrative or legal hearings and are
 ree    d only after their employers prove their legal states. Those who can produce
 legal documents are normally released immediately; those who cannot prove their
 legal status may be held for extended periods before deportation. Illegal aliens are
 kept in detention centers that are separate from prisons (see Section l.c.).
 Law enforcement authorities also used the Restricted Residence Act to restrict
 movements of criminal suspects for an extended period. The act allows the Home
 Affairs Ministry to place criminal suspects under restricted residence in a remote
 district away from home for 2 years-the Ministry is authorized to issue the "ban-
 ishment" orders without any judicial or administrative hearings. Human rights ac-
 tivists have questioned the need for this law, which was passed 60 years ago under
 very different circumstances, and have called for its repeal. The Government contin-
 uedto justify the act as a necessary tool and in the past has used it primarily
 against vice and gambling offenses. In June the police proposed extending the act
 to commercial crimes such as copyright piracy. In August the Deputy Home Min-
 ister proposed extending the act to "dishonest traders" guilty of such crimes as hold-
 ing illegal sales, manufacturing fake medicine, selling adulterated gasoline, and im-
 perting piglets without a license. However, no action has been taken to do so. The
 Government has not disclosed how many people are subject to the Restricted Resi-
 dence Act, but human rights activists estimate it to be "scores."
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Past government action, constitutional amend-
 ments, and legislation restricting judicial review have undermined judicial inde-
 pendence and strengthened executive influence over the judiciary in sensitive cases.
 A number of high-profile cases continued to cast doubts on judicial impartiality and
 independence. Members of the bar and other observers continued to express serious
 concern about this issue. Occasionally, however, courts ruled against the Govern-
 ment. In February, for example, a court voided the victory of a ruling party can-
 didate in Sarawak because of extensive bribery in the election campaign.
 High courts have original jurisdiction over all criminal cases involving serious
 crimes and most civil cases. Civil suits involving automobile accidents and landlord-
 tenant disputes are heard by sessions courts. Magistrate's courts hear criminal
 cases in which the maximum term of sentence does not exceed 12 months. The
 Court of Appeal has appellate jurisdiction over high court and session court deci-
 sions. The Federal Court hears appeals of Court of-Appeal decisions. The legal sys-
 tem is based on English common law. Islamic religious laws administered by state
 authorities throughislamic courts bind ethnic Malays and other Muslims in some
 civil matters. The Government announced that it would harmonize Islamic law at
 the federal level and appoint an Islamic law federal attorney general. Indigenous
 people in Sarawak and Sabah also have a system of customary law that is some-
 times used to resolve matters such as land disputes between tribes.
 Malaysia also has rarely used "penghulu" (village head) courts empowered to ad-
 judicate minor civil matters.
 Most civil and criminal proceedings are fair and open. The accused must be
 brought before a judge within 24 hours of arrest and charges must be levied within
 10 days. Defendants have the right to counsel, bail is available, and strict rules of
 evidence apply in court. Defendants may appeal court decisions to higher courts
 and, in criminal cases, may also appeal for clemency to the King or local state rulers
 as appropriate. All criminal trials, including murder trials, are heard by a single
 judge. Parliament voted in 1994 to amend the Criminal Procedure Code to abolish
 jury trials in death penalty cases. The defense in both ordinary criminal cases and
 special security cases is not entitled to a statement of evidence before the trial.
 The Attorney General may restrict the right to a fair trial in criminal cases, by
 invoking the Essential (Security Cases) Regulations of 1975. These regulations gov-
 erning trial procedure normally apply oaly in firearms cases. In cases tried under
 these regulations, the standards or acceptin  self-incriminating statements by de-
 fendants as evidence are less stringent than in normal criminal cases. Also, the au-
 thorities may hold the accused or an unspecified time before making formal
 charges. The Attorney General has the authority to invoke these regulations in
 other criminal cases if the Government determines that the crime involves national
 security considerations, but such cases are rare. There were no cases involving this
 restriction in 1997.
 Following a number of high-profile corruption cases, the Government amended the
 Anticorruption Act in July. The new law removes the presumption of innocence and
 
 
 841
 requires accused persons to prove that their wealth was acquired legally; it is sched-
 uled to come into effect in January 1998.
 In cases widely thought to be politically motivated, several large Malaysian com-
 panies, prominent businessmen, and one prominent lawyer have brought suits for
 libel and slander against the U.N. Special Rapporteur on the Independence of
 Judges and Lawyers Datuk Pararn Curamaswamy, who is a Malaysian citizen, and
 against the Malaysian Bar Council's former secretary general Tommy Thomas. The
 charges stemmed from an article that alleged improprieties in the judiciary. A Ma-
 laysian court rejected Param's request to have the suit dismissed before trial based
 on his claim of immunity as a U.N. rapporteur, a claim sup ported by U.N. Secretary
 General Kofi Annan. The judge ruled that the case should proceed, but that Param
 should make this claim in his defense during trial. In eary; October, Param lost an
 initial appeal on this issue. In October and Dlecember, two more businessmen filed
 a third and a fourth suit against Param. All the cases are still pending.
 In September the Malaysian Bar Council expressed concern over 44 prisoners held
 "at the pleasure of the sovereign" for inordinate periods, often well exceeding the
 maximum sentences for their original crimes. In one case a prisoner had been held
 for 37 years. Most of these "forgotten prisoners" committed their crimes as minors
 or while of unsound mind.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Conrespondence.-The law
 provides for these ights and the Government generally respects them. However,
 provisions in the security legislation (see Section 1.d.) allow the police to enter and
 search without a warrant the homes of persons suspected of threatening national
 security. Police may also confiscate evidence under these acts. In some cases each
 year, police have-used this legal authority to search homes and offices, seize books
 and papers, monitor conversations, and take people into custody without a warrant.
 The law permits the Home Affairs Ministry to p lace criminal suspects under re-
 stricted residence in a remote district away from home for a 2-year period (see Sec-
 tion 1.d.).
 A clause in the new Anticorruption Act empowers the Attorney General to author-
 ize the interception of mail and the tapping of telephones. Such information would
 be admissible as evidence in a corruption trial.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Althouh the Constitution provides for freedom
 of speech and the press, some important limitations exist, and over the years the
 Government has restricted freedom of expression. The Constitution provides that
 freedom of speech may be restricted by legislation "in the interest of security (or)
 public order.e Thus, the Sedition Act prohibits public comment on issues defined as
 sensitive, such as citizenship rights or non-Malays, the special position of Malays
 in society, and certain aspects of relogion.
 The Government used the Sedition Act and the PrintingPrsses and Publications
 Act to file criminal charges against opposition Member of Parliament Lima Guan Eng
 before the 1995 general election. The charges stemmed from Lira's public comments
 about a statutory rape case involving a former chief minister of Malacca. In 1997
 Lira was convicted under beth acts and fred $5,000 (15,000 ringgit). Lim has kept
 his parliamentary seat pending appeal, but he would lose his seat if the conviction
 is wpeld.ntr
 Th  rnig Presses and Publications Act of 1984 contains important limitations
 on press freedom. Domestic and foreign publications must apply anually to the
 Government for a      vermit. The act was amended in 1987 to make the publication
 of "malicious news a punishable offense, expand the Government's power to ban or
 restrict publications, and prohibit court challenges to suspension or revocation of
 pubcation permits. Government policies create an atmosphere that inhibits inde-
 pendent or investigative journalism and result in self-censorship of issues that gov-
 ernment authorities might consider sensitive. The Government often conveys dis-
 pleasure with prss reporting directly to a newspaper's board of directors. In prac-
 tice, leading political figures, or companies controlled by leading political figures in
 the ruling coalition, own moat major newspapers and all radio and television sta-
 tions, thus limiting the range of views. These mass media provide generally lauda-
 tory, noncritical coverage of government officials and policies, and give only limited
 and selective coverage to political views of the opposition or political rivals. Editorial
 opinion frequently reflects government positions on domestic and international is-
 sues. Chinese-language newspapers are generally more free in reporting and com-
 menting on sensitive political and social issues.
 The Government continued to prosecute human rights activist Irene Fernandez
 under the Printing Presses and Publications Act for charges that she made in 1995
 
 
 842
 
 of mistreatment at illegal alien detention centers. Final judgment is still pending
 although Fernandez has lost several procedural motions. The Government called an
 unusually large number of witnesses (34 as of December 16), which observers say
 is tying up the time and resources of Fernandez and her NGO. Police raided the
 offices of Fernandez's NGO in January because it had failed to file financial state-
 ments for 3 years. After the NGO paid a fine, the case was withdrawn. In October
 three additional charges based on information obtained during the raid were filed.
 The self-censorship of the Malaysian press was glaringly evident during the finan-
 cial crisis in 1997. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad made a number of controver-
 sial remarks about the crisis. Pertinent information about international reaction to
 the Prime Minister's remarks appeared in the press of neighboring countries and
 in the international press. Much of this information went unreported in Malaysia,
 however.
 Another example of self-censorship is local cable television companies' frequent
 elimination of foreign press reports on Israel and Malaysia.
 The press did report on some sensitive social issues, such as the role of Islam.
 It also vigorously reported on allegations of corruption against some prominent poli-
 ticians. The Prime Minister's remarks on the existence of a Jewish agenda" to un-
 dermine the Malaysian economy, his subsequent statement that he had been mis-
 interpreted, and international reaction to the remarks were well covered in the local
 press.
 In past years, the Government has on a few occasions used the defamation clauses
 of the Penal Code to prosecute newspapers and reporters that publish criticism of
 government officials. In 1997 the police filed reports for possible defamation charges
 against a newspaper that reported a survey alleging that officers often did not act
 on reports of domestic violence. No further action was taken, however.
 In September Far Eastern Economic Review correspondent Murray Hiebert was
 convicted of contempt of court and sentenced to 3 months' imprisonment. Hiebert,
 who is still free pending appeal, had written an article implying that the plaintiff
 in a civil suit had received preferential treatment in scheduling an early trial date
 because she was the wife of a prominent judge. This case, the first in which a for-
 eign correspondent has been sentenced to jail for contempt in the ordinary course
 of his duties, raises serious questions of freedom of the press and of judicial impar-
 tiality.
 In October the police said that they were investigating Asiaweek magazine under
 the Printing Presses and Publications Act for an article alleging that some foreign
 diplomats were concerned about the police's indifference to crimes against dip-
 lomats. The police interrogated the local correspondent of Asiaweek who had written
 this story. No further action was taken, however.
 Small-circulation publications of opposition parties, social action groups, unions,
 and other private groups actively cover opposition parties and frequently print views
 critical of government policies. However, the Government retains significant influ-
 ence over these publications by requiring annual renewal of publishing permits.
 There were no cases of denial of renewal requests in 1997.
 In September the Prime Minister said that he would issue a directive to enforce
 the (previously ignored) ban on street sales of the opposition party newspaper
 Harakah. Citing regulations that political parties may only distribute their publica-
 tions to party memers and not sell them publicly, the Prime Minister saia "since
 we find the tabloid is libelous, we will enforce the ban immediately." The Prime
 Minister was referring to reports quoting a religious leader as saying that the Prime
 Minister and some others in the ruling coalition were apostates. The Government
 is not vigorously enforcing the ban, however.
 The Official Secrets Act potentially can also restrict freedom of the press. Pointing
 out the dangers of abuse, the Bar Council and NGO's have called for a review of
 certain provisions that grant considerable discretion to the authorities.
 The government-controlled Malaysian News Agency (Bernama) is by law the sole
 distributor of foreign news, although the Government has not to date used this law
 to restrict foreign news coverage or availability.
 NGO's currently enjoy freedom to speak out against government policies. The
 Government's case against NGO activist Irene Fernandez under the Printing Press-
 es and Publications Act is being closely monitored as a test case of the Government's
 willingness to permit public criticism (see Section L.e.).
 Early in the year, the Government threatened to force NGO's to register under
 the more restrictive Societies Act rather than the current Companies Act. The For-
 eign Minister said that the Government's "cautious stand" against NGO's was nec-
 essary to check "alien influences." The Primary Industries Minister accused NGO's
 of having a hidden agenda opposing growth. The Deputy Home Minister said that
 
 
 843
 the Government would study NGO's to ensure that they are not exploited by "cer-
 tain parties." However, no action was taken.
 The Government generally respects academic freedom in the areas of teaching and
 publication. Academics are often publicly critical of the Government. However, there
 is degree of self-censorship among public university academics whose career ad-
 vancement and funding are prerogatives of the Government. Private institution aca-
 demics also practice a limited degree of self-censorship for fear that the Government
 may revoke licenses for their institutions. Legislation also imposes limitations on
 student associations and student and faculty activity (see Section 2.b.).
 In November the Government forbade academics from making any public state-
 ments or publishing any writings on Malaysia's ongoing air pollution crisis. The
 Government seems to have feared that unauthorized remarks on the air pollution
 crisis might harm the country's image and hurt tourism. The gag order was not vig-
 orously enforced, however.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of freedom of peaceful assembly, but there are significant restrictions.
 These rights may be limited in the interest of security and public order, and the
 1967 Police Act requires police permits for all public assemblies except for workers
 on picket lines. Spontaneous demonstrations occur periodically without permission,
 but they are limited in scope and generally occur with the tacit consent of the police.
 In the aftermath of the intercommunal riots in 1969, the Government banned po-
 litical rallies. The Government continued that policy during the 1995 general elec-
 tion. However, both government and opposition parties held large indoor political
 gatherings dubbed 'discussion sessions "during the campaign period. The ruling coa-
 tion also held several large-scale events that closely resembled political rallies.
 Government and opposition candidates campaign actively. There are, however,
 some restrictions on freedom of assembly during campaigns. During the actual cam-
 paign period, political parties submit lists of times and- plaes for their discussion
 sessions. In past campaigns some opposition discussion group meetings have been
 canceled for lack of a police permit, most recently during the 1996 Sarawak state
 election campaign. Outside the campaign period, a permit also is required, with
 most applications routinely approved. These restrictions and the ban on political ral-
 lies hanaicap the opposition's ability to campaign effectively.
 Organizers canceled a planned conference on police abuse in response to a govern-
 ment warning of possible prosecution under the ISA (see Section 1.d.).
 The Constitution provides for the right of association, but there are significant re-
 strictions. For example, certain statutes limit this right, such as the Societies Act
 of 1966, under which any association of seven or more members must register with
 the Government as a society. The Government may refuse to register a new society
 or may impose conditions when allowing a society to register. The Government also
 has the power to revoke the registration of an existing society for violations of the
 act, a power it has enforced selectively against political opposition groups. This
 threat of possible deregistration inhibits political activism by public or special inter-
 est organizations. Early in 1997, the Government threatened to force all NGO's to
 register under the Societies Act rather than the less restrictive Companies Act (see
 Section 2.a.).
 Another law that affects freedom of association is the Universities and University
 Colleges Act. This act mandates government approval for student associations and
 prohibits student associations, as well as faculty members, from engaging in politi-
 cal activity. A university vice chancellor must approve campus demonstrations.
 Human rights organizations assert that it inhibits the free flow of ideas and ex-
 change of views and have called for its repeal.
 In November 1996, youth wings of the ruling coalition parties disrupted an inter-
 national conference about East Timor. In February four leaders of the youth organi-
 zations received a *500 (1,500 ringgit) frme for their role in disrupting the meeting.
 In April police detained 55 opposition party members who demonstrated in protest
 of an Israeli team's participation at an international cricket championship. The case
 against the demonstrators is still pending.
 In May police detained overnight nine demonstrators at an Association of South-
 east Asian Nations (ASEAN) ministers meeting, who had protested ASEANs plan
 to admit Burma as a member. Judgment of the case against the demonstrators has
 been postponed until March 1998.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the official religion. Religious minorities, which
 include large Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, and Christian communities, generally may
 worship freely but are subject to some restrictions. Adherence to Islam is considered
 intrinsic to Malay ethnic identity, and therefore Islamic religious laws administered
 by state authorities through Islamic courts bind all ethnic Malays in some matters.
 Government funds support an Islamic religious establishment, and it is official pol-
 
 
 icy to "infuse Islamic values" into the administration of the country. At the same
 time, the Constitution provides for freedom of religion and the Government has re-
 fused to accede to pressures to impose Islamic religious law beyond the Muslim com-
 munity.
 The Government opposes what it considers deviant interpretations of Islam. In
 the past, the Government has imposed restrictions on certain Islamic sects. The
 Government continues to monitor the activities of the Shi'ite minority. In 1997 the
 Government proposed amending the Constitution to make Sunni Islam Malaysia's
 official Islamic sect. This would make illegal the practice of other forms of Islam.
 In November 10 people, 2 of whom were over 75 years old, were detained under
 the ISA for spreading Shi'ite teachings. Two of the prisoners were later released on
 a technicality, but rearrested (again under the ISA) just minutes after they left the
 courtroom. Police released two of these detainees in late December (see Section 1.c.).
 Some state governments were slow in approving buildingpermits for non-Muslim
 places of worship or land for cemeteries for non- uslims.  e Government has long
 discouraged the circulation of a popular Malay-language translation of the Bible and
 distribution of Christian tapes and printed materials in Malay. Some states have
 laws prohibiting the use of Malay-language religious terms by Christians, but the
 authorities have not actively enforced them.
 The Government permits but discourages conversion to religions other than Islam.
 Some states have long proscribed by law proselytizing of Muslims, and other parts
 of the country strongly discouraged it as well.
 In March the Government proposed creating a federal-level Islamic law attorney
 general and "harmonizing" the various states' Islamic law at the federal level. Dis-
 cussion of this proposal intensified after an incident in July when several Malay
 women participating in a beauty contest were arrested in the state of Selangor for
 breaking Islamic law. The proposal has not yet been implemented.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens generally have the right to travel within the country and live
 and work where they please, but the Government restricts these rights in some cir-
 cumstances. The east Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak have the independent
 right to control immigration into their territories and to require citizens from penin-
 sular west Malaysia and foreigners to present passports or national identity cards
 for entry. In December the Sabah state government ordered the expulsion of a West
 Malaysian attorney who had previously been involved in several lawsuits against
 the state government. The federal Government regulates the internal movement of
 rovisionally released ISA detainees. It also limits the movement of some released
 ISA detainees to a designated city or state. The Government also uses the Re-
 stricted Residence Act to limit movements of those suspected of some criminal ac-
 tivities (see Section L.d.).
 The Government generally does not restrict emigration. Citizens are free to travel
 abroad, although in some cases in the past, the Government has refused to issue
 or has withheld passports on security grounds or in the belief that the trip would
 be detrimental to the country's image. The Government usually takes such action
 because of suspected drug trafficking or other serious crimes.
 Citizens must apply for the Government's permission to travel to Israel. Travel
 to Jerusalem for religious purposes is explicitly allowed.
 About 1.7 million foreign workers are concentrated primarily in low-skill jobs. The
 Human Resources Ministry estimated that as much as 90 percent of the labor force
 in the plantation sector is foreign. The majority of foreign workers may be in the
 country illegally. Some illegal workers eventually are able to regularize their immi-
 gration status, others depart voluntarily after a few months, and some are formally
 deported as illegal migrants.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees.
 There were no reports of the forced expulsion of persons with a valid claim to refu-
 gee status. Over the past 22 years, Malaysia gave first asylum to approximately
 254,000 Vietnamese. In 1996 Malaysia closed its last camp for Vietnamese refugees.
 Only a handful of Vietnamese asylum seekers remain in Malaysia. The rest have
 returned voluntarily to Vietnam or resettled in third countries.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 By law citizens have the right to change their government through periodic elec-
 tions, which are procedurally free and fair, with votes recorded accurately. In prac-
 tice, however, it is difficult for opposition parties to compete on equal terms with
 the governing coalition (which has held power at the national level since 1957) be-
 cause of legal restrictions on campaigning, as well as restrictions on freedom of asso-
 
 
 845
 
 ciation and of the press. Nevertheless, opposition candidates campaign actively and
 agree that the voting and counting of votes are relatively free and fair. The Govern-
 ment coalition controls 12 of 13 states. An Islamic opposition party controls the
 northern state of Kelantan.
 Malaysia has a parliamentary system of government. National elections, required
 at least every 5 years, have been held regularly since independence in 1957. In the
 1995 general election the ruling coalition won an overwhelming victory, increasing
 its percentage of seats in Parliament to 82 percent. Several members of the opposi-
 tion camp have since joined the coalition, increasing its representation in the Par-
 liament to approximately 88 percent. The Malay-based United Malay National Or-
 ganization (UMNO) party dominates the ruling National Front coalition. Within the
 UMNO there is active political debate.
 The Parliament in 1995 passed amendments to its rules that strengthen the
 power of the Speaker and curb parliamentary procedures heavily used by the oPo-
 sition The amendments empowered the Speaker to ban unruly opposition Members
 of Parliament for up to 10 days, imposed limits on their ability.to pose supple-
 mentary questions and revisit nongermane issues, and established restrictions on
 the tabling of questions of public importance. The amendments have restricted the
 opposition's ability to criticize the Government in Parliament. Nonetheless, govern-
 ment officials often face sharp questioning in Parliament, although this usually is
 not reported in detail in the press.
 Women face no legal limits on participation in government and politics, but there
 are practical impediments. Women are represented in senior leadership positions in
 the Government in small numbers, including two cabinet-level ministers. Women
 hold 15 of 192 seats in the elected lower house of Parliament and 13 of 69 seats
 in the appointed upper house. Women also hold high-level judgeships.
 Ethnic minorities are represented in cabinet-level positions in government, as well
 as in senior civil service positions. Nevertheless, the political dominance of the
 Malay majority means in practice that ethnic Malays hold the most powerful senior
 leadership positions. Non-Malays fill 9 of the 28 cabinet posts. Ethnic Chinese lead-
 ers of component parties of the ruling coalition hold executive power in the states
 of Penang and Sabah.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The National Human Rights Association, a private organization, publicly criticizes
 the Government, as do other NGO's, although it does not conduct investigations ex-
 cept in response to individual complaints. It seeks repeal of the ISA and is review-
 ing opposition-controlled Kelantan's efforts to impose Islamic-inspired restrictions in
 that state.
 A number of other organizations, including the Bar Council and public interest
 groups, devote considerable attention to human rights. The Government generally
 tolerates their activities but rarely responds to their inquiries or occasional press
 statements. Officials criticize local groups for collaborating with international
 human rights organizations.
 NGO's are active and critical of the Government. However, the authorities still
 accuse some NGO's of painting a negative picture of the country to the outside
 world. Although the Government did not place any restrictions on their activities,
 in 1996 it announced that it might require NGO's to register under the more restric-
 tive Societies Act rather than the Companies Act (see Section 2.a.).
 There was concern among NGO's that the Government's case against prominent
 NGO activist Irene Fernandez, under the Printing Presses and Publications Act,
 might inhibit the willingness and ability of NGO's to speak out against the Govern-
 ment (see Section L.e.).
 NGO organizers of a planned conference on police abuse canceled the meeting
 after the Government warned of possible prosecution under the ISA (see Section
 1.c.).
 The Government has not acceded to any major international treaty on human
 rights, generally maintaining that such issues are internal matters. It rejects criti-
 cism of its human rights record by international human rights organizations and
 foreign governments and has blocked registration of a local chapter of Amnesty
 International.
 In July the Prime Minister endorsed the suggestion that the Universal Declara-
 tion of Human Rights should be reviewed to reflect different countries' values. The
 Prime Minister and the Foreign Ministry have since raised this idea with other na-
 tions.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equal protection under the law and prohibits dis-
 crimination against citizens on the basis of religion, race, descent, or place of birth.
 Although neither the Constitution nor laws explicitly prohibit discrimination on the
 basis of  sex or disabilities, the Government has made efforts to eliminate discrimi-
 nation against women and the disabled. Government policies include preferences for
 ethnic Malays in housing, home ownership, the awarding of government contracts,
 educational scholarships, and other areas.
 Women.-Government leaders have identified domestic violence as a continuing
 social ill. In June Minister of National Unity and Social Development Datin Paduka
 Zaleha Ismail accused police of failing to act on reports of domestic violence. Police
 officials denied this. The 1994 Domestic Violence Act offers a broad definition of do-
 mestic violence, gives powers to the courts to protect victims, and provides for com-
 pensation and counseling for victims. Those covered under the bill include a spouse,
 a former spouse, a child, an incapacitated adult, or any other member of the family.
 NGO's concerned about women's issues advocate legislative and social reforms to
 improve the status of women. These groups raise issues such as violence against
 women, trafficking in women and young girls, employment opportunities with equal
 pay, and greater participation by women in decisionmaking positions. Women's is-
 sues continued to receive prominent coverage in public seminars and the media.
 The cultural and religious traditions of the major ethnic groups heavily influence
 the condition of women in society. In family and religious matters, Muslim women
 are subject to Islamic law. Polygyny is allowed and practiced to a limited degree,
 and inheritance law favors male offspring and relatives. The Islamic Family Law
 was revised in 1989 to provide better protection for the property rights of married
 Muslim women and to make more equitable a Muslim woman's right to divorce. The
 small number of women obtaining divorces under the provisions of Islamic law that
 allow for divorce without the husband's consent is steadily increasing.
 Non-Muslim women are subject to civil law. Changes in the Civil Marriage and
 Divorce Act in the early 1980's increased protection of married women's rights, espe-
 cially those married under customary rites.
 Government policy supports women's full and equal participation in education and
 the work force. Women are represented in growing numbers in the professions, but
 women's groups argue that the level of participation is still disproportionately low.
 In the scientific ana medical fields, women make up more than half of all university
 graduates and the total intake of women into universities increased from 29 percent
 mn 1970 to one-half of the student population in recent years. The participation of
 women in the labor force increased from 37 percent in 1970 to almost one-half in
 1997.
 In the opposition-controlled state of Kelantan, the state government has imposed
 restrictions on all female workers, including non-Muslims. Female workers cannot
 work at night and are restricted in the dress hey may wear in the workplace. The
 state government justifies these restrictions as reflecting Islamic values.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's rights and welfare; it
 spends roughly 20 percent of its budget on education. The Government has taken
 some steps to deal with the problem of child abuse. Parliament passed the Chil-
 dren's Protection Act in 1991, effective in 1993. The Domestic Violence Act, which
 covers children, provides protection against child abuse. The police proposed tougher
 measures to dea with the crime of incest.
 Although statistics are not available, the incidence of child prostitution appears
 to have decreased in recent years. Women's organizations still highlight the continu-
 ing problem of trafficking in underage girls. Police frequently raid brothels and
 prosecute some brothel owners.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government does not discriminate against phys-
 ically disabled persons in employment, education, and provision of other state serv-
 ices. However, public transportation, public buildings, and other facilities are not
 adapted to the needs of the disabled, and the Government has not mandated acces-
 sibility for the disabled. Special education schools exist, but they are not sufficient
 to meet the needs of the disabled population. The Government and the general pub-
 lic are becoming more sensitive to the needs of the physically disabled. The Govern-
 ment has taken initiatives to make public facilities more accessible to disabled per-
 sons, and has increased budgetary allotments for programs aimed at aiding them.
 New commuter trains, for example, are being made wheelchair accessible. The Gov-
 ernment also provides incentives for employers to offer employment opportunities
 for the disabled.
 Indigenous People.-Indigenous groups and persons generally enjoy the same con-
 stitutional rights as the rest of the population. In practice, federal laws pertaining
 
 
 to indigenous people vest almost total power in the Minister of National Unity and
 Social Development to protect, control, and otherwise decide issues concerning them.
 As a result, indigenous people have very little ability to participate in decisions.
 Under the Aboriginal People's Act, indigenous people (known as Orang Asli) had no
 right to own land. The law did not permit Orang Asli in peninsular Malaysia who
 had been granted land on a group basis to own land on an individual basis or to
 receive titles to land. The Social Development Ministry announced in March 1996
 that state governments, which make decisions affecting land rights, had agreed to
 issue titles to Orang Asli. Amendments were drafted to enable Orang Ash to hold
 titles on an individual basis. Some Orang Ash welcomed this development while oth-
 ers expressed reservations, saying that individual land titles might divide and
 weaken Orang Ash communities.
 The indigenous people in peninsular Malaysia, who number fewer than 100,000,
 are the poorest group in the country; however, according to government officials,
 Orang Ash are gradually catching up to other citizens in their standard of living,
 and the percentage of Orang Asli who were still leading a nomadic lifestyle has
 dropped to less than 40 percent. The Government has said that allowing Orang Asli
 to own land in peninsular Malaysia would enhance their economic standing.
 In east Malaysia, although state law recognizes the right of indigenous people to
 land under "native customary rights," the deinition and extent of these lands are
 in dispute. Indigenous people in the state of Sarawak continued to protest the al-
 leged encroachment by state and private logging and plantation companies onto
 land that they consider theirs because of customary rights. A large project (Bakun
 dam) in Sarawak that would involve resettlement of a large number of residents in
 the area has raised several controversial questions regarding land disputes as well
 as potential environmental problems. NGO's and opposition politicians have called
 on the Government to address these issues before proceeding with the project. Al-
 though economic -conditions late in the year forced the indefinite postponement of
 dam construction, Sarawak officials said in September that resettlement continues.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Government implements extensive pref-
 erential programs designed to boost the economic position of the Malay majority,
 which remains poorer on average than the Chinese minority, despite the formers
 political dominance. Such preferential programs and policies limit opportunities for
 non-Malays in higher education, government employment, business permits and li-
 censes, and ownership of newly developed agricultural lands. Indian Malaysians
 continue to lag behind in the country's economic development. According to the Gov-
 ernment, these programs have been instrumental in ensuring ethnic harmony and
 political stability.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Associaton.-By law most workers have the right to engage in
 trade union activity, and a pproximately 10 percent of the work force belongs to
 trade unions. Exceptions include certain limited categories of workers labeled "con-
 fidential" and "managerial and executive," as well as defense and police officials.
 Within certain limitations, unions may organize workplaces, bargain collectively
 with employers, and associate with national federations.
 The Industrial Relations Act prohibits interfering with, restraining, or coercing a
 worker in the exercise of the right to form trade unions or in participating in lawful
 trade union activities. The Trade Unions Act, however, restricts a union to rep-
 resenting workers in a "particular establishment, trade, occupation, or industry or
 within any similar trades, occupations, or industries," contrary to International
 Labor Organization (ILO) guidelines. The Director General of Trade Unions may
 refuse to register a trade union and, in some circumstances, may also withdraw the
 registration of a trade union. When registration has been refused, withdrawn, or
 canceled, a trade union is considered an unlawful association. The Government jus-
 tifies its overall labor policies by positing that a "social compact" exists wherein the
 Government, employer, and worker are part of an overall effort to create jobs, train
 workers, boost productivity and profitability, and ultimately provide the resources
 necessary to fund human resource development and a national social safety net.
 Trade unions from different industries may join in national congresses, but must
 register as societies under the Societies Act (see Section 2.b.). In 1996 the Malaysian
 Labor Organization, which had split from the Malaysian Trade Union Congress
 (MTUC) in 1990, officially merged with it again, thus reunifying the principal labor
 organizations.
 Government policy discourages the formation of national unions in the electronics
 sector, the Government believes that enterprise-level unions are more appropriate
 for this sector. In May the MTUC dropped its long-standing objection to restricting
 
 
 the electronics sector to enterprise-level unions. The MTUC stated that it would be
 better for the workers to have the in-house unions "than none at all."
 Unions maintain independence both from the Government and from political par-
 ties, but individual union members may belong to political parties. Although union
 officers may not hold principal offices in political parties, individual trade union
 leaders have served in Parliament as opposition members. Trade unions are free to
 associate with national labor societies that exercise many of the responsibilities of
 national labor unions, although they cannot bargain for local unions. In 1997 long-
 time labor leader Zainal Rampak applied to join the ruling party.
 Although strikes are legal, the right to strike is severely restricted. The law con-
 tains a list of "essential services" in which unions must give advance notice of any
 industrial action. The list includes sectors not normally deemed essential under ILO
 definitions.
 The Industrial Relations Act of 1967 requires the parties to notify the Ministry
 of Human Resources that a dispute exists before any industrial action (strike or
 lockout) may be taken. The Ministry's Industrial Relations Department then may
 become actively involved in conciliation efforts. If conciliation fails to achieve settle-
 ment, the Minister has the power to refer the dispute to the Industrial Court.
 Strikes or lockouts are prohibited while the dispute is before the Industrial Court.
 According to 1994 data, the Industrial Court found for labor in 62 percent of its
 cases and for management in 14 percent. The remaining 24 percent were settled out
 of court. Figures for 1995 and 1996 are not available. The Industrial Relations Act
 prohibits employers from taking retribution against a worker for participating in the
 lawful activities of a trade union. Where a strike is legal, these provisions would
 prohibit employer retribution against strikers and leaders. Although some trade
 unions question their effectiveness, it is not possible to assess fully whether these
 provisions are being effectively enforced, given the limited number of cases of al-
 leed retribution.
 There are two national labor organizations. The MTUJC is a federation of mainly
 private sector unions. CUEPACS is a federation of civil servant and teacher unions.
 Public servants have the right to organize at the level of ministries and depart-
 ments. There are three national joint councils representing management and profes-
 sional civil servants, technical employees, and nontechnical workers.
 Enterprise unions can associate with international labor bodies and actively do so.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers have the legal right
 to organize and bargain collectively, and collective bargaining is widespread in those
 sectors where labor is organized. The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by em-
 ployers against union members and organizers. Charges of discrimination may be
 riled with the Ministry of Human Resources or the Industrial Court. When concilia-
 tion efforts by the Ministry of Human Resources fail, critics say that the Industrial
 Court is slow in adjudicating worker complaints. Other critics point out, however,
 that the Industrial Court almost always sides with the workers in disputes.
 Companies in free trade zones (FTZ's) must observe labor standards identical to
 those in the rest of the country. Many workers at FTZ companies are organized, es-
 pecially in the textile and electrical products sectors. During 1993 the Government
 proposed amendments to the Industrial Relations Act to remove previous restric-
 tions on concluding collective agreements about terms and conditions of service in
 "pioneer industries." Legislation to address this issue was introduced and subse-
 quently withdrawn in late 1994 by the Ministry of Human Resources to take into
 account other developments in the labor sector. The legislation was not reintro-
 duced. The ILO continues to object to legal restrictions on collective bargaining.
 Foreign workers are not allowed to join trade unions. The MTUC said in May that
 foreign workers should be unionized. The Government responded that "it did not en-
 courage" foreign workers to join unions and that labor laws were adequate to protect
 foreign workers' interests.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and there is no evidence it occurs. In theory, certain laws allow
 th    e of imprisonment with compulsory labor as a punishment for persons ex-
 pressing views opposed to the established order or who participate in strikes. The
 Government maintains that the constitutional prohibition renders these laws with-
 out effect. The constitutional prohibition applies as well to forced and bonded labor
 by children, and it is not practiced.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Chil-
 dren and Young Persons (Employment) Act of 1966 prohibits the employment of
 children younger than the age of 14. The act permits some exceptions, such as light
 work in a family enterrise, work in public entertainment, work performed for the
 Government in a schoo or training institutions, or work as an approved apprentice.
 In no case may children work more than 6 hours per day, more than 6 days per
 
 
 week, or at night. Ministry of Human Resources inspectors enforce these legal provi-
 sions. In December 1994, a Japanese electronics firm was fined $5,400 for violating
 the Children and Young Persons Act. This was the first time that a large firm had
 been fined under the act.
 Child labor is still occurring in certain sectors of the country. A joint report by
 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the Asian and Pacific Re-
 gional Organization put the child work force at 75,000. However, government offi-
 cials maintain that this figure is outdated, since it was based on a nationwide sur-
 vey of child labor undertaken in 1980, which estimated that more than 73,400 chil-
 dren between the ages of 10 and 14 were employed full time. NGO surveys indicate
 that most child laborers work on agricultural estates, but there are indications that
 some are being employed in small factories. Government officials do not deny the
 existence of child labor but maintain that foreign workers have largely replaced
 child labor and that the Government vigorously enforces child labor provisions.
 Forced and bonded labor by children (and adults) is constitutionally prohibited, and
 does not occur (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage, but the
 Wage Councils Act provides for a minimum wage in those sectors or regions of the
 country where a need exists. Under the law, workers in an industry who believe
 that they need the protection of a minimum wage may request that a "wage council"
 be established. About 150,000 workers in the labor force of 8 million are covered
 by minimum wages set by wage councils. Representatives from labor, management,
 and the Government sit on the wage councils. The minimum wages set by wage
 councils generally do not provide for a decent standard of living for a worker and
 family. However, prevailing wages, even in the sectors covered by wage councils, are
 higher than the minimum wages set by the wage councils and do provide a decent
 living.
 Under the Employment Act of 1955, working hours may not exceed 8 hours per
 day or 48 hours per workweek of 6 days. Each workweek must include one 24-hour
 rest period. The act also sets overtime rates and mandates public holidays, annual
 leave, sick leave, and maternity allowances. The Labor Department of the Ministry
 of Human Resources enforces these standards, but a shortage of inspectors pre-
 cludes strict enforcement. In 1993 Parliament adopted a new Occupational Safety
 and Health Act (OSHA), which covers all sectors of the economy, except the man-
 time sector and the military. The act established a national Occupational Safety and
 Health Council, compesed of workers, employers, and government representatives,
 to set policy and coordinate occupational safety and health measures. It requires
 employers to identify risks and take precautions, including providing safety training
 to workers, and compels companies having more than 40 workers to establish joint
 management-employee safety committees. The act requires workers to use safety
 equipment and to cooperate with employers to create a safe, healthy workplace.
 Trade unions maintain that relatively few committees have been established and,
 even in cases where they exist, that they meet infrequently and are generally inef-
 fective.
 There are no specific statutory or regulatory provisions that provide a right for
 workers to remove themselves from dangerous workplace conditions without arbi-
 trary dismissal. Employers or employees violating the OSHA are subject to substan-
 tial fines or imprisonment for up to 5 years.
 Significant numbers of contract workers, including numerous illegal immigrants,
 work  on plantations and in other sectors. Working conditions on plantations for
 these laborers compare  orly with those of direct hire plantation workers, many
 of whom belong to the ational Union of Plantation Workers. Moreover, immigrant
 workers in the construction and other sectors, particularly if they are illegal aliens,
 generally do not have access to the system of labor adjudication. Government inves-
 tigations into this problem have resulted in a number of steps to eliminate the
 abuse of contract labor. For example, besides expanding programs to regularize the
 status of immigrant workers, the Government investigates complaints of abuses, en-
 deavors to inform workers of their rights, encourages workers to come forward with
 their complaints, and warns employers to end abuses. Like other employers, labor
 contractors may be prosecuted for violating the labor laws.
