 COSTA RICA
 Human rights and democracy continue to be guiding principles
 of Costa Rica's domestic and foreign policy. Costa Rica
 is actively involved in international human rights issues.
 Costa Rica took the initiative in calling for the establish-
 ment of the Inter-American Human Rights Court and, in 1980,
 of its companion institution, the Inter-American Human
 Rights Institute. Both are now housed in new San Jose
 headquarters. The Costa Rican government supports both
 the court and the institute with a direct financial contribu-
 tion, supplementing the budget of the Organization of American
 States (OAS). Costa Rica also continues to press for the
 creation of the post of High Commissioner for Human Rights
 at the United Nations.
 Costa Rica is a democratic republic, with the government
 divided into three branches: executive, legislative and
 judicial. The independent supreme electoral tribunal,
 whose main role is to assure the integrity of the election
 process, is often considered a "fourth branch" of government.
 While the president is the undisputed head of the executive
 branch, he does not exercise control over the other branches.
 Costa Rican political life corresponds to the constitutional
 model in practice and in spirit. Government transitions
 have taken place smoothly after elections. During the
 last 30 years, the party not in power has won every quadren-
 nial election, with the exception of 1974. In 1978 the
 Liberation Party, which had governed the country for eight
 years under two presidents, was turned out in favor of
 an opposition coalition led by President Rodrigo Carazo.
 Elections for president, two vice presidents, all 57 members
 of the legislative assembly and city council members throughout
 the country will take place on February 7, 1982. Leaders
 of all political parties, the media and other Costa Ricans
 have repeatedly made clear that at a time of domestic economic
 crisis and Central American destabilization, Costa Rica
 is determined to resolve its problems and defend its democracy
 via the electoral process.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The Costa Rican constitution prohibits torture, a prohibition
 which is respected in practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Article 40 of the constitution reads: "No one shall be
 submitted to cruel or degrading treatment nor to life imprison-
 ment... A declaration obtained through violence shall
 have no value." There is no death penalty. The Costa
 Rican government is now in the midst of a program to improve
 conditions in the country's prisons. Some of the prisons
 that currently exist are crowded, old facilities which
 are being phased out as new ones are built.
 The most serious threat to human rights in Costa Rica in
 many years was the coming of terrorism, first in the near
 fatal San Jose bombing in March 1981 of a vehicle carrying
 
 
 391
 United States Marine Guards and a Costa Rican driver, a
 bomb the same day at the Honduran embassy, and later incidents
 culminating in a June gunfight which left three policemen,
 a terrorist and a bystander dead. The discovery of a large
 cache of documents in a terrorist *safe house" led authorities
 to arrest other members of the terrorist "family.' This
 terrorist group, founded with the direct assistance of
 South American guerrillas, appears to have connections
 with other Central American -- especially Salvadoran --
 groups, and less directly with Cube and the Soviet Union.
 The Costa Rican public has repudiated terrorist violence,
 given its support to efforts to suppress terrorism and
 called for control of arms trafficking.
 c. Disappearances
 There are no abductions or secret arrests by official security
 forces or by elements condoned by the government.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Constitutional guarantees against arbitrary arrest or imprison-
 ment are respected in practice. Under Costa Rican law,
 arraignment must take place within 24 hours. The constitution
 guarantees the right of habeas corpus. There are no political
 prisoners in Costa Rica.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Constitutional guarantees of fair public trial are respected
 in practice., Defendants have the right to choose their
 own counsel, and access to counsel is unimpeded. Public
 counsel is provided free of charge, if necessary. The
 independence of the judiciary is protected, inter ea,
 by a constitutionally-specified fixed percentage of the
 national budget allocated to the judicial system. There
 are no military or political courts. There is a regular
 system of appeals through the various court levels, as
 well as a separate court for appeals from administrative
 decisions of the executive.
 The July 1981 killing of a captured terrorist in her cell
 by a policeman raised the issue of human rights. The policeman
 was immediately apprehended and indicted for murder; his
 case is in the courts. President Carazo submitted the
 incident tO the Inter-American Human Rights Court for its
 judgment, but the court decided it could not accept jurisdiction
 and transferred action to the Inter-American Human Rights
 Commission.
 f.   Invasion of the Home
 Court-ordered warrants are required for entry into private
 residences.. Neither forced entry nor other violations
 of the home have been credibly alleged.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech, religion
 and assembly are respected in practice. The free press
 presents divergent views, and no limitations have been
 imposed on its ability to criticize the government. There
 is no discrimination on the basis of religion.

 Labor unions are free to organize, strike, bargain collec-
 tively and lobby. The labor union movement, however, is
 relatively weak, particularly in comparison with most other
 Costa Rican social institutions. There is currently an
 effort on the part of the government and the political
 parties to develop more efficient mechanisms to foster
 unions. Changes may include a reform of the 38-year old
 labor code to incorporate more specific ground rules for
 collective bargaining.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Domestic and foreign travel and emigration are unhindered.
 In addition, Costa Rica provides refuge for many people
 of varying political persuasions, including thousands of
 Nicaraguans who fled their country during the 1978-79 civil
 war, several thousand Salvadorans who have left their country
 in the past two years, and -- since late 1979 -- large
 numbers of Cubans (many only temporarily in Costa Rica
 en route to the United States, but over half remaining
 in the country because of ineligibility for emigration
 to the United States).
 Costa Rica accepts its responsibility to repatriate its
 own citizens, and is accepting into its own territory aliens
 who depart Costa Rica directly and illegally to enter another
 country.  (Several such undocumented Cuban nationals who
 attempted to enter the United States have been accepted
 back by Costa Rica.) The country does not forcibly repatriate
 citizens of other countries if there is any danger of political
 or other persecution in that country. With the assistance
 of local voluntary groups and international agencies, Costa
 Rica has provided for refugees to the best of its ability.
 In April 1981, following terrorist incidents, the govern-
 ment expelled several Guatemalan exiles to Nicaragua for
 violation of Costa Rica's immigration laws prohibiting
 political activity by exiles.
 Women are not subject to different rules in matters of
 internal or foreign travel, emigration or repatriation.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Freedom to participate in the political process is provided
 for in the constitution and respected in practice. Elections
 are free, competitive and open. No parties are outlawed.
 Registry of parties and of voters is impartially controlled
 by the supreme electoral tribunal, which operates free
 from interference by any individual or institution, including
 the government in power. A measure of the open political
 process in Costa Rica is the current campaign being conducted
 for the February 1982 elections.
 Free elections represent what is probably the most strongly
 and broadly held element of Costa Rica's democratic system.
 The coming of terrorism and related events in 1981, overlap-
 ping with the severity of the country's economic situation,
 centered much attention, during the 1981-82 political campaign,
 on reported extremist threats to the elections. Costa
 Ricans believe that the institutional strength of the country's
 democracy is great enough to prevent interruption of democratic
 continuity by the country's weakened economy or by the
 resultant social disruption.

 The constitution provides for equal job and income rights
 for women. They are employed in prominent positions in
 the government and the legislative assembly. At the University
 of Costa Rica, 46 percent of the students are women.
 3.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Costa Rica has been a strong and consistent supporter of
 human rights in international fora and has extended a standing
 invitation to the Inter-American Human Rights Commission
 to visit whenever it wishes. Costa Rican governments regularly
 invite observers from the OAS and other institutions to
 witness the quadrennial elections. Costa Rica has accepted
 the automatic jurisdiction of the Inter-American Human
 Rights Court and was among the first to ratify the American
 Convention on Human Rights.
 4.   Economic and Social Circumstances
 The government has conscientiously tried to reduce both
 rural and urban poverty by providing social services and
 by generating employment. Over the past three years almost
 25 percent of the national budget has been allocated each
 year to education. Costa Ricans have long been proud of
 the fact that they spend much more for education than for
 defense, resulting in an adult literacy rate of 90 percent.
 The government is committed to providing low-cost, accessible
 health care to all Costa Ricans and has made significant
 progress in recent years toward reaching this goal. There
 are three separate but complementary programs for health
 care: the social security system, the programs of the ministry
 of health and social development and the family assistance
 program. The social security system covers some 80 percent
 of the population and about 60 percent of the work force
 with medical and retirement benefits.
 Although the income tax system is progressive in principle,
 the largest portion of government revenues results from
 trade and consumption taxes which fall most heavily on
 low-income groups. Income distribution, though still skewed,
 is the most evenly distributed in Central America. However,
 economic difficulties will cause a deterioration in this
 situation over the 1981-83 period.
 The Costa Rican economy is mixed, but oriented toward free
 enterprise. The government operates several major industries,
 such as electric power production and distribution and
 telecommunications. Private ownership of property is protected.
 Costa Rica is at a crossroads in its national development.
 Over four decades of economic growth came to an end in
 1980, and the country is in a period of substantial and
 severe adjustment. External factors such as low coffee
 and high oil prices adversely affect the economy. Internal
 factors, especially large public sector deficits, have
 caused a loss in international reserves, pressure on domestic
 prices and growing debt. The current account deficits
 in the balance of payments have been financed for the past
 several years through borrowing from foreign commercial
 banks. With payments on long, medium and short-term public
 debt in 1982 expected to use over 90 percent of projected
 export earnings, and with the total public external debt
 at over $2.6 billion, the government is engaged in the
 
 
 394
 first steps of debt restructuring talks with private banks
 and official (bilateral) creditors. Unofficial devaluation
 of the colon on the free market was 240 percent from September
 1980 to September 1981. Inflation is projected at over
 70 percent for 1982 and the unemployment rate at over ten
 percent. Gross domestic product declined in 1981 by three
 to five percent and may stagnate or decline further in
 1982-83. Imports will drop in real terms by about 30 percent
 in 1981. Evolution of the economic situation over the
 coming five years will depend on government compliance
 with a new International Monetary Fund agreement and on
 new loans from unilateral and bilateral sources, as well
 as private international commercial banks.
 The tradition that women should remain in the home as wife
 and mother has, in many cases, inhibited their equal access
 to jobs and equal wages for the same work. This problem
 has diminished with time and with the increasing need for
 more trained workers, although the current economic crisis
 is liable adversely to affect job opportunities and upward
 job mobility for women. The national apprenticeship institute
 is offering non-traditional training for women in such
 areas as wood processing, appliance repair and gas station
 service. Some 23 percent of women age 12 and over are
 economically active, in contrast to 76.5 percent of the
 men.
 Although down from the 1960 rate of 3.6 percent, the moderately
 high population growth rate estimate of 2.5 percent for
 1979 indicates continued demands on social welfare services
 at a time of declining resources to meet these demands.
 An estimated life expectancy for 1979 of 70.3 years (up
 from 61.9 in 1960) and an estimated infant mortality rate
 of 28 per 1,000 live births for 1979 (down from 80 per
 1,000 in 1960) not only highlight the successes of the
 social welfare system and the generally good daily diet
 but are additional indications of the breadth of Costa
 Rica's social welfare system.
