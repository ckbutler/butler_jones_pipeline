 COMOROS
 The Comoros unilaterally declared its independence from France
 in 1975. The first President, Ahmed Abdallah Abderemane, was
 overthrown almost immediately but regained power in 1978 when
 mercenaries ousted the increasingly repressive and xenophobic
 regime of Ali Soilih. Abdallah was reelected unopposed to a
 second 6-year term in 1984. In recent years, constitutional
 amendments have strengthened the President's position, notably
 in the appointment of governors, in the centralized collection
 of taxes, and in the establishment of a single legal political
 party, the Comorian Union for Progress (UCP). Village
 notables and religious leaders dominate local politics while
 three major families, the President's being one, control most
 of the import-export business.
 A 75-member mercenary force continues to train and'lead the
 Presidential Guard, the best equipped security force' in the
 islands. French technical assistance is provided to the small
 Comorian armed forces and the Gendarmerie. Each island also
 has a local police force.
 Agriculture dominates economic activity. With a population of
 450,000, likely to double by the year 2000, the Comoros are
 rapidly approaching full utilization of arable land. Revenues
 from the export of copra, vanilla, essence of ylang-ylang, and
 cloves cover only a portion of necessary imports. There are
 no industries, inadequate port facilities, and limited highway
 and communications infrastructure. The Comoros are part of
 the francophone Africa monetary zone, and the Government
 depends heavily on France for budgetary support and technical
 assistance.
 There was little change in the human rights situation in 1986
 from 1985. Following the aborted coup attempt by Comorian
 soldiers in March 1985, which resulted in the trial and
 conviction of 77 coup plotters, the Government arrested 30
 soldiers at the end of 1985 for planning a second coup attempt.
 Most of those detained and sentenced in connection with both
 plots have now been released.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of government-inspired disappearances.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Reports that mercenaries beat alleged coup plotters were
 investigated by several human rights groups in 1985 and again
 in 1986. Amnesty International's 1986 Report indicated that
 one prisoner was said to have been beaten to death during
 interrogation.
 Penal discipline is lax; most prisoners are usually released
 during the day for prayers and work. Families are expected to
 help provide their meals. The arrest of some 200 persons
 
 
 COMOROS
 after the first coup attempt resulted in severe overcrowding
 of the Comoros' meager prison facilities until early 1986 when
 many of the prisoners were released.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Government made large-scale arrests after the March 1985
 coup attempt, and it kept about 80 of the principal suspects
 in extended incommunicado detention. Mercenaries reportedly
 participated in many of the arrests and in the interrogation
 of detainees. Current legal procedures permit the government
 to take such actions, especially in security cases. The role
 of the mercenaries in the interrogation process was not
 authorized and was quickly terminated. As of the end of 1986,
 all persons arrested in connection with the 1985 coup attempt
 and its aftermath had been subjected to judicial process. At
 the end of 1986 there were no persons in detention on political
 grounds.
 There is no evidence of forced or compulsory labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The 1978 Constitution provides for the equality of all citizens
 before the law and the right of all accused persons to a
 defense. The judiciary is independent in regular
 civil/criminal cases, and trials are open to the public. The
 Comorian legal system applies a mixture of Islamic law and an
 inherited French legal code. French and Comorian experts were
 drafting a new consolidated legal code at the end of 1986.
 Most disputes are settled by village elders or by a civil
 court of first instance.
 President Abdallah ordered the establishment of a special
 criminal court of appointed members to try many of the alleged
 March 1985 coup conspirators, based on a 1960 decree as amended
 in October 1985. Charges were not lodged until September, and
 the trial was held in November. Seventy-seven persons, both
 civilian and military, were sentenced to terms ranging from 10
 months to life imprisonment; 18 persons were subsequently
 pardoned in late 1985, but an additional 30 persons, all
 soldiers, were arrested at the end of 1985 for allegedly
 planning a second coup. Most of the persons sentenced or
 detained in these two coup incidents were pardoned or released
 during 1986. Approximately 34 alleged coup plotters were being
 held at the beginning of 1987.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for the inviolability of home and
 property. There were no known cases of arbitrary interference
 with privacy in 1986.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of expression. Comorians
 discuss and criticize their Government and its leading
 personalities in private but not in public. The only local
 news media are the government-controlled radio station and
 monthly newspaper, which are self-censoring when covering
 domestic events. Foreign journals and newspapers are
 available, as are books from abroad.

 COMOROS
 Clandestine tracts critical of the regime continued to
 circulate, despite several arrests and the occasional
 confiscation of printing equipment. Cassettes made in Iran
 and distributed by disaffected youths in Anjouan in early 1986
 prompted the arrest of 35 Islamic students and the confiscation
 of pro-Khomeini materials. The students were released
 uncharged 3 weeks later, after intense pressure from
 influential family members for their release.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Asociation
 The Constitution states that freedom of association and freedom
 to form unions are guaranteed, as well as the right to strike.
 In practice, these rights are partially circumscribed. In
 theory, all legal political activity takes place within the
 UCP. In practice, however, social occasions, such as the
 traditional lavish, extended Comorian weddings, serve as
 vehicles for intense political activity. Anniversaries of the
 death of former political figures and funerals of prominent
 Comorians sometimes also carry political overtones. On June
 10 the end of Ramadan featured a street demonstration in favor
 of an opposition figure recently returned from France. The
 Gendarmerie promptly dispersed the crowd but made no arrests.
 The wage labor force is small, and unions are not effectively
 organized. The scarcity of jobs is also a serious restraint
 on labor organization. As a result, there have been no
 strikes, but the Government's inability to pay wages and
 salaries on schedule sometimes results in work slowdowns,
 absenteeism, and informal peaceful protests to Comorian
 authorities.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 An overwhelming majority of the population is Muslim. The
 Constitution holds Islam to be the "wellspring of the
 principles and rules which guide the State and its
 institutions." However, the Government upholds the right of
 non-Muslims to practice their faith. There are churches for
 the small Protestant and Catholic populations. Christian
 missionaries work in local hospitals and schools, but they are
 not allowed to proselytize.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement within and outside the Comoros for citizens and
 foreigners is not restricted. A Comorian community abroad,
 concentrated in France, includes many persons who oppose the
 Government. In 1986 there was no evidence that those returning
 to the Comoros were subjected to government reprisals.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 During the Soilih period, undisciplined youth committees often
 terrorized society, all of the country's civil records were
 destroyed, and prominent families faced intermittent
 persecution. Soilih openly challenged the dominance of Islam,
 alienating much of the devoutly Islamic population. The Soilih
 experience caused many Comorians to fear radical change. The
 restoration of President Abdallah in 1978, and a commitment to
 moderately paced change, ended that phase of radicalism.

 COMOROS
 Abdallah remains the single most important factor in Comorian
 politics. He commands the personal loyalty of the mercenary-
 led Presidential Guard, and his position is buttressed by his
 own personal wealth. The inability of a fragmented opposition
 to coalesce around a viable alternative to Abdallah has also
 reinforced the President's position. Abdallah has been in
 conflict with some of the leading "notables" since a cabinet
 reshuffle in 1985. The replaced notables have undertaken a
 "constitutional" effort to depose Abdallah. Discontent with
 the privileges of the Abdallah family and frustration with the
 notables' modest role in Comorian political life surfaced in
 the debates in the 38-member National Assembly in 1986.
 According to the Constitution, Assembly elections must be held
 within 5 years of the previous election. Abdallah's political
 party, the UCP, was made the sole legal party in a 1982
 amendment to the Constitution. However, Abdallah has
 indicated that all political groups can nominate candidates
 for the next election to be held in March or April 1987.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The March 1985 coup prompted an investigation by several
 international human rights groups of the extended detention of
 alleged coup plotters. Subsequently the Interior Minister
 delivered a bitter rebuttal of published criticism of the
 Comorian human rights situation by Amnesty International and
 other human rights entities. He claimed that the Government
 invited all interested groups to make an on-the-spot
 examination of conditions in Comoros.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The constitutional deference to Islam formalizes the deeply
 held commitment of most Comorians to an Islamic world view.
 The Comorian commitment to a free society is essentially a
 traditional Islamic one of an open marketplace, tolerance of
 other religions, and equality of Muslims before Allah. The
 society respects authority based on inheritance, age, wealth,
 and religious leadership. The Government demonstrated its
 nervousness about fundamentalist Islamic groups by the
 detention early in the year of the 35 Anjouan students. The
 Constitution formally provides for the equality of citizens
 regardless of race, sex, or religion, but men have a dominant
 role within Comorian society. At traditional ceremonies and
 social gatherings, the sexes are separated. Suffrage is
 universal, but the opinions of husbands and fathers exercise a
 formidable influence over women's voting habits. Yet women
 are neither veiled nor limited to minor civil service posts.
 Women have the right to participate in the political process,
 but tradition has discouraged the exercise of that right.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Young children are employed in household chores but not in the
 public or commercial sector. The lack of a minimum age for
 employment does not in praotice encourage child labor abuse
 because jobs for adolescents and young adults are scarce, and
 wages for workers of all ages are very low. There is no
 industrialization or factory activity. Wages and standards of
 occupational safety and health are consistent with Comoros'
 status as one of the world's poorest countries. Hours of work
 in any category rarely exceed 35 hours per week.
