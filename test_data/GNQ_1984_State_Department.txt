 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 Although the 1982 Constitution proclaims Equatorial Guinea to
 be a democratic, unitary, and republican state, it is in fact
 under the absolute rule of its President, Teodoro Obiang Nguema
 Mbasogo, who is constrained only by the necessity to operate
 within a consensus of top government and tribal leaders.
 Equatorial Guinea is a former Spanish colony in central Africa,
 composed of a continental province (Rio Muni) and an island
 province (Bioko). The capital, Malabo, is on Bioko.
 The country's once thriving economy and managerial base were
 destroyed during the brutal 11-year Macias regime, overthrown
 in 1979. Civil order has been restored and the terror that
 characterized the former dictatorship has largely ended. A new
 Constitution was adopted and local and national assemblies were
 chosen.
 There was no single event in 1984 to focus international
 attention on human rights in Equatorial Guinea. There was one
 execution, for a non-political crime. One political detainee,
 sentenced to die for plotting to assassinate the President in
 1983, remains in prison. Sensitivity to the country's
 international image and a desire to highlight a contrast with
 the former regime have probably served to curb the worst
 abuses. Senior officials accused of serious violations have
 been punished in the past.
 The economy of Equatorial Guinea remains in a shambles and the
 state apparatus is weak and limited in its enforcement
 ability. The incidence of petty crime, discrimination against
 minority groups and migrant workers, and general mistreatment
 of common citizens by minor officials is widespread and shows
 no sign of abating.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of killings by government authorities
 during 1984.
 b. Disappearance
 No information has been received that secret arrests and
 detentions occur in Equatorial Guinea.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Police methods at low and middle levels often include beatings
 of prisoners either to extract information or to punish
 offenders for insolence or disrespect. Mistreatment of
 prisoners is officially condemned, however, and numerous
 examples exist of police officials receiving reprimands.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Incidents of arbitrary arrest occur but are not widespread.
 They are usually committed by lower level officials whose
 
 
 102
 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 orders are often countermanded in a day or two if they become
 known to superiors. Arrests without warrants are fairly
 common, but those arrested are formally charged or released at
 the police station. There are no reports of people being
 detained or jailed for expressing dissident views. The absence
 of print media makes the expression of any written views
 difficult. Habeas corpus is recognized by the Constitution and
 may be invoked by those few Guineans well-educated enough and
 in a position to hire a lawyer. The ordinary Guinean, when
 arrested, relies upon representations and payments of Ifines.
 made on his behalf by his family, which are often effective,
 even though taking place outside of the formal legal framework.
 The Government in the main cities of Bata and Malabo continues
 to round up 'vagrants' and put them to work for short periods
 with the sanction of law, but without the benefits of due
 process to each person arrested. Gainfully employed people who
 are not carrying identity documents may also be forced to join
 work gangs for several days before they obtain their release.
 The frequency and scope of such incidents is linked to the
 coming and going of important national days and visiting
 dignitaries. Most work gangs are involved in cutting brush,
 cleaning the streets, and painting government buildings.
 Another widespread practice includes the rounding up of
 "illegal' aliens, mostly Cameroonians, Nigerians, Ghanaians,
 and Senegalese who may be forced to work on cacao plantations
 owned by government officials. This practice is more prevalent
 during the cacao harvest and seems linked to the shortages of
 willing labor on the island of Bioko.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Twenty-six persons were tried in 1983 for plotting to kill the
 President and overthrow the Government. The three principal
 defendants were convicted and sentenced to death. Two of these
 were executed in 1983 and the third remains in prison, pending
 government review of his case. There is still no information
 available on the verdicts given to the 23 others. Amnesty
 International, in its 1984 Report, expressed concern that the
 trial of the 26 may not have been conducted in accordance with
 internationally recognized standards for a fair trial.
 The current court system is a combination of traditional,
 civil, and military justice, which often operates in an ad hoc
 manner for lack of established procedures and experienced
 judicial personnel. Most trials are speedy. In cases of petty
 theft or civil dispute, all parties are brought before a judge
 who listens, questions, and then most often sets a fine to be
 paid by one party to the other. Fines may also be levied in
 lieu of imprisonment in cases against the State. In one
 notable case, a ranking official was accused of issuing Guinean
 diplomatic passports to North Koreans. The official in
 question was heavily fined and banished to his home village for
 six years. Exclusion from public office and banishment are
 popular means of dealing with ranking offenders.
 The Ministry of Justice continues to work on structuring the
 judiciary and establishing a legal system. A major government-
 sponsored conference/lecture series on the judiciary and the
 Constitution was well attended. There were no major court
 cases during the past year to put the independence of the
 judicial system to the test. It is widely believed, however,
 that any court case interesting enough to attract international
 
 
 103
 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 attention would be conducted in a relatively open atmosphere.
 The 1983 trial was open to the public.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There have been no confirmed reports of arbitrary interference
 with privacy, home, or correspondence. Many people suspect
 that telephone conversations are routinely monitored. It is
 doubtful that search warrants are used, as provided for in the
 Constitution.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 What little communications media exist in Equatorial Guinea are
 government owned and operated. The single newspaper published
 only one issue in 1984. The radio and television stations,
 when operating, transmit official government notices and
 imported entertainment, sports and religious programs. The
 officially-controlled media do not criticize the Government.
 Direct criticism is never heard in speeches made in public
 forums but is frequently heard in private conversation.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government does not prohibit private associations, but
 membership in any type of opposition organization would
 probably result in the loss of official employment and
 exclusion from the ruling circles from which all benefits and
 privileges are derived. Non-political groups such as
 professional organizations and sports groups do exist and may
 receive government backing. There have been no attempts to
 form any type of labor union, and given the country's minuscule
 industrial and disorganized agricultural sector, little scope
 for union activity exists.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is freedom of religion in Equatorial Guinea. No religion
 is favored, but the Catholic religion is dominant. Religious
 publishing is permitted. Missionaries of several faiths are
 active and have government permission for their activities.
 Proselytizing is permitted. There does not appear to be any
 discrimination against persons on the basis of their faith.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no known restrictions on Equatorial Guineans with
 respect to travel within the country. Travel abroad is limited
 by shortages of foreign exchange. There are also often delays
 in the issuance of exit visas, but those delays do not seem to
 be politically motivated. Few Guineans currently seek refuge
 outside the country, but a large number of exiles continue to
 reside in Spain, Cameroon, and Gabon. Many exiles criticize
 the Government as being tribally based and undemocratic, but
 most probably remain abroad for economic reasons. The
 Government has repeatedly proclaimed the freedom of all
 Guineans to return and promises that returnees need not fear
 persecution. It would expect those returning not to engage in
 political activities outside the current system. One recently
 returned opposition political leader has apparently been
 
 40-387 0 - 85 - 8
 
 
 104
 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 allowed to reintegrate without major difficulties. There is
 only one foreign refugee, from Cape Verde, known to have sought
 asylum in Equatorial Guinea.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 President Obiang was confirmed in office in 1982 following a
 plebiscite which ratified a new Constitution. The plebiscite
 did not expressly permit a vote for president, but rather only
 approval or disapproval of the Constitution itself, which
 established a seven-year term of office for the president.
 Obiang interpreted the constitutional referendum as a mandate
 to rule for seven years, and consequently will not face
 reelection until 1989 under the present system. The law does
 not indicate what the ground rules of that election will be.
 Under the Constitution a partially elected, partially appointed
 National Assembly is chosen. Representation in the Assembly
 includes members of minority groups. The Constitution provides
 for members of the Assembly to freely voice dissenting views,
 but the Assembly's role in formulating policies which differ
 from those approved by the President and Council of Ministers
 has not been demonstrated.
 No formal opposition groups operate within the country, but
 opposition leaders do exist and maintain ties with exile groups
 in Spain. The scope for any organized political opposition
 remains extremely narrow at this time. The Fang tribe, which
 comprises more than 70 percent of the population, dominates the
 Government, but some Fang sub-groups maintain that they are
 underrepresented. Similarly, the Bubi tribe, which comprises a
 small percentage of the population, but has historically been
 the majority on the island of Bioko, where Malabo is located,
 also claims underrepresentation.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The President is sensitive to international criticism of his
 Government and concerned to prevent the occurrence of incidents
 that would portray his regime in a bad light. The President is
 often quick to address official complaints lodged by members of
 the diplomatic community on behalf of their nationals. The
 commitment at the higher levels of Government, however, is not
 sufficient to stop the abuses and discriminationg that occur
 widely at the lower levels. Freedom House rates Equatorial
 Guinea 'not free.*
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The economy in Equatorial Guinea shows little sign, after five
 years, of recovery from the devastation and anarchy of the
 Macias regime. While government institutions have been
 reactivated, schools reopened, and dozens of development
 projects initiated, there seems to be little significant
 progress. Roads, rebuilt several years ago, deteriorate with
 each rainy season.   Food is no more available in the markets
 now than in 1981, and prices continue to rise. Cacao
 production, the mainstay of the economy, has only partially
 recovered and seems to have hit a plateau due to limited
 foreign exchange for the importation of agricultural
 
 
 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 improvements. The problems of lack of willing local labor and
 trained management have not been successfully addressed.
 Health services have improved somewhat due to the continued
 presence of a large number of foreign aid medical personnel,
 though equipment and medicines remain scarce. Foreign aid has
 helped add variety to the local staples of plantains and yams,
 but malnutrition, particularly among children, remains high.
 The 1984 population is 275,000 with a growth rate of 2.5
 percent. Life expectancy at birth is 44 years and the infant
 mortality rate is 134 per 1,000 live births. Primary school
 enrollment (1973) was 88 percent of males, 71 percent of
 females, or 79 percent of all children. The adult literacy
 rate is about 60 percent. Per capita gross national product
 figures are unavailable but are variously estimated at between
 $100-200. The average Guinean lives at the subsistence level,
 though members of the bureaucracy and better educated people
 living in the larger towns live at something better than
 subsistence. The diet for nearly all Guineans is heavily
 dependent on locally available root and fruit crops,
 supplemented occasionally with game and some fish.
 Most salaried employment is with the Government. Minority
 groups complain that they are discriminated against in
 government employment. Discrimination that is prevalent in the
 top levels of Government in the allocation of politically
 sensitive positions probably carries over into the lower
 bureaucracy. While substantial numbers of people from all
 tribes and sub-tribes are employed at all levels of the
 government, certain Fang sub-groups, Bubi, and Rio Muni coastal
 tribes may be underrepresented.
 The law states that both sexes, and all tribal groups, are
 equal and entitled to the same rights and privileges. For a
 variety of reasons, some historical and cultural and others
 economic, women are accorded a lower status than men and have a
 correspondingly lower status and influence in the society and
 government. Men often take several wives but women are never
 permitted multiple husbands. Social tradition, and the fact
 that women produce most of the basic staple food items, keep
 most women engaged in agricultural or domestic work. Five
 times as many males as females enter secondary school and eight
 times as many graduate at this level. Because of the severe
 need for skilled people of all types, however, women can have
 professional careers and do hold important jobs in the health
 sector and in other socially oriented ministries.
