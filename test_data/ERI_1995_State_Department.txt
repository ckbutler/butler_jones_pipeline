 ERITREA
 Eritrea became an independent state in May 1993, following a U.N.-supervised
 referendum in which citizens voted overwhelmingly for independence from Ethiopia.
 The Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF), which led the 30-year war for inde-
 pendence, has been in de facto control of the country since it defeated Ethiopian
 army forces in 1991, and its leader, Isaias Mwerki, serves as the President. The
 EPLF, renamed the People's Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ), has outlined
 an ambitious program for transition to a democratically elected government by 1997.
 In April 1994, the National Assembly, partly appointed by the PFDJ leadership and
 partly elected, created a 50-member National Constitution Commission to draft a
 constitution by mid-1996. Committee members and other high-ranking government
 officials have stated that the constitution will provide for democratic freedoms, in-
 cluding the rights of free assembly, free speech, and free association.
 The Government has made a sustained effort to reduce the armed forces, over
 95,000 strong by the end of the war for independence, to its current 45,000 strength.
 The police are generally responsible for maintaining internal security, although the
 Government may call on the army and demobilized soldiers in times of internal ds-
 order. The army is responsible for external and border security. Since 1993 the
 army has been forced to deal with the Eritrean Islamic Jihad (EIJ), a small, Sudan-
 based insurgent group that has mounted sporadic terrorist attacks in western Eri-
 trea.
 The economy and infrastructure, devastated by the war, are making a slow recov-
 ery. The Government has passed a liberal investment code, but the industrial sector
 has suffered from outmoded, centralized economic practices and deteriorating cap-
 ital equipment. More than 80 percent of the population is involved in agriculture,
 mostly subsistence farming.
 The Government continued to have strong public support and generally respected
 the human rights of its citizens. However, problem areas remain. In particular, the
 Government harassed and in some cases arrested Jehovah's Witnesses for their re-
 fusal to vote in the referendum on independence or participate in national service
 on religious grounds. Prison conditions are generally Spartan, and the Government
 continued to resist international monitoring of prisons. The Government did not re-
 spond to questions about its human rights practices and did not register or recog-
 nize domestic human rights nongovernmental organizations (NGO's). In May the
 Government pardoned 91 detainees for collaboration with the Mengistu regime.
 Fifty-two persons associated with radical Islamic political elements or suspectedter-
 rorist organizations remained in detention without charge. The number of remain-
 ing detainees is unknown. The Government continued its strong support of the
 rights of women and took steps to broaden women's participation in politics. How-
 ever, its implementation of laws to improve women s status was uneven. Women
 generally have a lower status than men, and female genital mutilation remained
 widespread.
 
 
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for Integrity of the Person Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or other
 extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 Several members of the armed opposition group, the Eritrean Liberation Front-Rev-
 olution  Council (ELF-RC) were allegedly abducted from their Sudanese camps in
 1992 by Eritrean Government forces. The Government continued to deny that they
 were in Eritrea, and-despite repeated high-level inquiries-at years end, the
 whereabouts of the missing rebels remained unknown.
 Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Ethiopian Penal Code, as modified by the transitional Penal Code of Eritrea,
 prohibits torture. The Government does not permit independent monitoring of condi-
 tions in detention facilities. Prison conditions are Spartan, but generally not inhu-
 man. The Government does not permit prisoners to correspon with family and
 friends and restricts visitation privileges. There were isolated unconfirmed reports
 that prisoners were beaten or may have died due to lack of proper medical care.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The current Penal Code stipulates that
 detainees may be held for a maximum of 30 days without being charged with a
 crime. In practice, authorities sometimes hold prsons suspected of crimes for much
 longer periods. On the second anniversary of independence in May, the Government
 pardoned and released 91 detainees who had been held for up to 4 years for collabo-
 ration with the Mengistu regime. Atyear's end, an unknown number of additional
 suspected collaborators remained in detent ion without charge, despite a statement
 by President Isaias in September that their cases would be dealt with soon. Fifty-
 two persons associated with radical Islamic elements or suspected terrorist organi-
 zations also remaned in detention without charge. There also were unconfirmed re-
 ports that the Government detained arbitrarily several ELF members (see Section
 1.b.).
 The Government does not use exile as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of a Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is independent, and there were
 no known incidents of executive interference in the judicl process over the past
 year. The underdeveloped judicial system, however, suffers from a lack of trained
 personnel, resources, and infrastructure which in practice limits the State's ability
 to grant accused persons a speedy trial. At independence Eritrea chose to retain the
 Ethiopian legal system based on the Napoleonic Code, until the new constitution is
 promulgated. Under this Code, simple crimes are brought to the lower court and
 heard by a single judge. Serious crimes are tried publicly by a panel of threeojudgs,
 and defendants have access to legal counsel, usually at their own expense. Although
 there is no formal public defender's office, the Government successfully requests
 that attorneys work pro bano to re resent defendants accused of serious crimes who
 are unable to afford lea counsel. efendants may appeal verdicts to the Appellate
 Court, which is composed of a President of the Court and five judges.
 Since the population is largely rural, most citizens only contact with the legal sys-
 tem is through traditional icourts." Village judges, appointed by a panel of govern-
 ment magistrates, provide justice in civil matters. Criminal cases are transferred to
 magistrates versed in criminal law. Many local issues, for example property disputes
 and most peotty crimes are adudicated by local elders according to custom or, in the
 case of Muslims, the Koran.  hese traditional courts cannot give sentences involving
 physical punishment.
 Crimes committed by members of the military are handled by military courts.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Under
 the law, warrants are required before the Government can monitor mail, telephones,
 or other means of private communication. Warrants also are required in routine
 searches and seizures, except in cases where authorities believe individuals may at-
 tempt to escape or destroy evidence. There is no indication that the Government
 monitored private mail or telephone lines.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Government has repeatedly stated that the
 new constitution will provide for freedom of speech and of the press, and citizens
 were generally free to express opinions in various forums. In the past year, however,
 the Government restricted the rights of the religious media to comment on politics
 or government policies. A newspaper published by the Catholic Church was ordered
 to shut down after it criticized the Government's implementation of civil service
 cuts. The Government controls the media, which include three newspapers, one
 
 
 84
 radio station, and one television station. Nonreligious print media are free to criti-
 cize the Government, and a recent survey showed that about 14 percent of news-
 paper articles contained some criticism o a government action or policy. Nonethe-
 less, criticism tends to be limited and fairly mild. Although there is no formal cen-
 sorship body, it is likely that the media practice at least some self-censorship.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-A permit from the Ministry of
 Internal Affairs is required for a public meeting or demonstration. In general per-
 mits are granted freely for nonpolitical meetings or gatherings, and-although no
 political demonstrations have occurred-there are no reports that permits for politi-
 cal demonstrations were denied. The Government has stated that the right to form
 political parties will be provided for in the new constitution. However, the PFDJ has
 stated its opposition to the formation of religiously or ethnically-based parties.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Although the Government has stated that freedom of re-
 ligion will be a basic tenet of the new constitution, it has banned religious organiza-
 tions from any involvement in politics as defined by the Government. A mid-July
 proclamation listed specific guidelines on the role of religion and religiously affili-
 ated NGO's in development and government, stating that development, politics, and
 public administration are the sole responsibility of the Government and people of
 Eritrea. As a result religious organizations may fund, but not initiate or implement,
 development projects. The proclamation also set out rules governing the relations
 between Eritrean religious organizations and foreign sponsors.
 Government persecution of the small Jehovah's Witnesses community continued
 in 1995. The Witnesses' refusal on religious grounds to vote in the independence ref-
 erendum or participate in the National Youth Service program-which involves
 some military training-spurred widespread criticism that the group was collec-
 tively shirking its civic duty. The Government took arbitrary punitive measures
 against Jehovah's Witnesses, including barring Witnesses from government employ-
 ment, evicting them from governmenthousing, revoking their business licenses, and
 refusing to issue them passports. Although the law provides for penalties only for
 those who refuse to report for national service, these harsh measures were applied
 to the entire Jehovah's Witnesses community. The Government also refused to issue
 visas to two U.S. citizens representing the worldwide Jehovah's Witness organiza-
 tion who sought to interview local Witnesses.
 In 1994 and 1995 many Muslim women refused to participate in the National
 Youth Service on religious grounds, but the Government did not take similar puni-
 tive measures against the Islamic community.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-In general, citizens may live where they choose and travel freely inter-
 nally. Some areas are restricted for security reasons. In particular, clashes between
 government forces and EIJ members have led the Government to restrict travel
 along much of the border with Sudan. Some areas remain heavily mined, a legacy
 of the war for independence, leading to additional travel restrictions. Citizens are
 largely free to travel outside the country, although Jehovah's Witnesses, former
 Ethiopian ruling party members, and intending emigrants have been denied pass-
 ports and can only leave the country by traveling overland to Ethiopia. In general,
 citizens are guaranteed the right to return. Instances in which citizens living abroad
 have run afoul of the law, contracted a serious contagious disease, or been declared
 ineligible for political asylum by other governments are considered on a case by case
 basis. A pilot refugee return program resulted in the successful repatriation of
 25,000 refugees from Sudan by mid-1995. A further 100,000 of the estimated
 400,000 refugees in Sudan are scheduled to begin repatriation later this year under
 U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees auspices.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens To Change Their Gov-
 ernment
 Citizens do not currently enjoy this right, and credible reports suggest that au-
 thority within the Government is very narrowly held. There is no constitution and
 no provision for holding elections. The National Assembly in 1994 created a 50-
 member National Constitution Commission to draft a democratic constitution. The
 Commission is scheduled to complete a draft of the constitution in early 1996, pro-
 mulgate the document soon afterwards, and hold elections by the end of 1997. The
 transitional Government is dominated by the PFDJ.
 In an effort to broaden the participation of women in politics, the PFDJ has
 named 3 women to the party's Executive Council and 12 women to the Central Com-
 mittee. Women occupy seats on the Constitution Commission and in the National
 Assembly and hold senior government positions, including the ministerial portfolios
 of justice and tourism. As part of a draft plan to establish regional legislatures, 30%
 
 
 of legislative seats would be reserved for women who would also be able to compete
 for remaining seats.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government did not respond to questions about its human rights practices
 by international organizations and continued to be unreceptive to the formation of
 domestic human rights groups. The Government did not respond to a list of human
 rights cases presented to it in 1994 by concerned human rights groups and did not
 register or recognize domestic human rights NGO's. The Foreign Ministry and the
 Ministry of Internal Affairs are jointly responsible for handling human rights in-
 quiries but were slow to respond to allegations of human rights abuses.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Transitional Civil Code prohibits discrimination against women, children, and
 people with disabilities.
 Women.-The Government has taken a firm stand against domestic violence;
 health, police, and judicial authorities say that no serious domestic violence problem
 exists.
 The Government has taken a consistently strong stand in favor of improving the
 status of women, many of whom played a significant role as fighters in the struggle
 for independence. In 1991 the provisional EPLF government codified a broad range
 of rights for women, providing for equal educational opportunities, equal p or
 equa work, and legal sanctions against domestic violence. In 1994 the Third Party
 Congress advocated more rights for women, including parity in the right to the use
 of land and other property. Although Eritrea is a signatory to the International Con-
 vention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Na-
 tional Assembly has not yet passed legislation implementing the Convention.
 Much of society remains traditional and patriarchal, and most women have an in-
 ferior status to men in their homes and communities. The lawprovides a framework
 for improving the status of women, but these laws were uneveny im lemented, beth
 because of a lack of capacity in the legal system and ingrained cultural attitudes.
 In practice, males retain privileged access to education, employment, and control of
 economic resources, with disparities being greater in rural areas than in cities.
 Children.-The Ministry of Labor and Human Welfare is responsible for govern-
 ment policies concerning the rights and welfare of children. The Ministry has little
 funding, and the Government does not generally regard child welfare as a serious
 problem.
 Female genital mutilation, which is widely considered by international health ex-
 perts as dmaging to bethAphysical and psychological health, is practiced extensively
 on " is at an early age. The Government, through the Ministry of Health and the
 Natinal Union of Ertrean Women, i actively discouraging this practice.
 People With Disabilities.-The long war for indepndenice left thousands of men
 and women physically disabled from injuries they received as guerrillas and as civil-
 ian victims. The Government spends a large share of its meager resources to sup-
 port and train these war disabled, who are regarded as heroes, and does not dis-
 criminate against them in training, education, or employment. There were, however,
 no laws mandating access for the disabled to public thoroughfares or public and pri-
 vate buildings.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-There are no government restrictions regarding the
 formation of unions, including in the military, the police, and other essential serv-
 ices. Labor association is encouraged by the Government. The Government promul-
 gated a proclamation providing workers the legal right to form unions and to strike
 to protect their interests. The National Confederation of Eritrean Workers, which
 was part of the EPLF during the war, has reorganized since independence and be-
 come independent of both the Government and the PFDJ. It represents over 20,000
 workers from 129 unions. The largest union is the Textile, Leather, and Shoe Fed-
 eration.
 There were no reported strikes in 1995.
 Sb. The Right To Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Eritrea is a member of the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) and worked closely with that Organization
 in 1993 to prepar  e  draft labor code, which prohibits antiunion discrimination by
 employers andestablishes a mechanism for resolving complaints of discrimination.
 In concert with U.S. and Israeli labor specialists, labor leaders are in the process
 of developing a policy on cooperative associations. The Government has indicated its
 intention to ratify several key ILO conventions on labor-freedom of association, the
 
 
 86
 right to bargain, a labor administration system, and prohibitions against child
 labor-but has not yet done so. The Labor Ministry has indicated that ratification
 of the conventions may not occur until after the new constitution is promulgated.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-There is no law or signed conven-
 tion prohibiting compulsory labor. There were no known instances of forced labor.
 All youth are required, however, to participate in the national service program,
 which includes military training as well as civic action programs. High school stu-
 dents are also required to participate in a summer work program, for which they
 are paid.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age for em-
 ployment is 18 years, although apprentices may be hired at age 16. While the Min-
 istry of Labor and Human Welfare is responsible for enforcement of laws pertaining
 to employment of children, there is no inspection system in place to monitor compli-
 ane. D)espite the high rate of adult unemployment many chldren under age 18
 work in commercial enterprises. According to labor officials, 50 percent of children
 are not able to attend school due to a shortage of schools and teachers. Rural chil-
 dren who do not attend classes often work on their family farms, while urban chil-
 dren often sell wares, such as cigarettes, newspapers, or chewing gum, on the street.
 e. Acceptable Conditions for Work.-There are two systems regulating employment
 conditions: the civil service system, and the labor law system. The free market de-
 termines wage rates, and there is no legally mandated minimum wage in the pri-
 vate sector. In the civil service sector wages vary from $25 to $200 per month (150
 birr to 1,200 birr), with factory workers (in government-owned enterprises) earning
 the highest wages. Former guerrillas are entitled to a monthly wage of at least $75
 (450 birr).
 The standard workweek in Eritrea is 48 hours, but many people work fewer
 hours. There is no legal provision for a day of rest, but most workers are allowed
 1 to 11 days off per week. The Government has instituted occupational health and
 safety standards, but inspection and enforcement vary widely among factories. The
 draft labor law includes a number of provisions concerning women, including one
 that states that women during pregnancy shall not be assigned to jobs that could
 endanger their lives or the lives of their unborn children. Workers are permitted to
 remove themselves from dangerous work sites without retaliation.
