 ZAIRE
 
 Since independence in 1960, Zaire has experienced
 almost seven years of civil war or semi-anarchy.
 President Mobutu's main task has been to establish gov-
 ernment authority over a vast country with more than
 200 separate ethnic groups. Individual political rights
 have a substantially lower priority than collective
 economic, social and political development. The March
 1977 Shaba invasion heightened the government's sense of
 insecurity. Improvement of security and economic con-
 ditions should tend to create a more relaxed relationship
 between the government and the population.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the  erson, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There is no evidence of torture.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Isolated incidents of cruel, inhuman or degrading punish-
 ment occur. These appear to be caused by police -- who
 risk punitive action if caught -- rather than from any
 concerted government effort. There are often physical
 hardships in prison such as inadequate, crowded cells,
 poor sanitary conditions and severe malnutrition.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment do occur in Zaire.
 There were some such cases during the 1977 invasion of
 Shaba province from Angola. Most detainees were released
 relatively quickly but some remain in prison. In more
 normal times the number of arbitarily arrested indivi-
 duals is relatively small and they are released in a few
 days for the most part. These latter cases are generally
 attributable to overzealous or venal local officials,
 acting outside their directives, who are subject to
 disciplinary measures when exposed.
 A notable case involves former Foreign Minister Nguza
 who was arrested, tried, convicted and incarcerated for
 alleged treason in connection with the invasion of Shaba.
 While his treatment is often viewed as having been
 arbitrary and capricious, the judicial proceedings
 (127)
 
 
 128
 appear to have followed the provisions of the Zairian
 Constitution and statutes. The original death sentence
 was subsequently commuted by President Mobutu to life
 imprisonment.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Persons charged with non-political crimes are entitled
 to and receive a fair and public hearing by an
 impartial tribunal. Those accused of political crimes
 or trafficking in precious minerals and metals are
 tried in the State Security Court, whose sessions are
 not often public.
 Amnesty International's 1977 Annual Report noted the
 in camera military trial and sentencing of about 40
 persons in an abortive June 1975 coup plot. Death
 sentences, which have not been carried out, were given
 to seven persons. Seven others were acquitted and 26
 received terms of six months to 20 years. This account
 appears to be accurate.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Sanctity of the home is respected, except in rare political
 and security cases.
 2.    Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 In 1972-1973 Zaire began an ambitious development pro-
 gram concentrated on large, capital-intensive projects.
 The program assumed a continuing high level of copper
 export receipts. In addition the government launched a
 program of radical economic reform intended to increase
 national control over the economy. Neither program
 achieved its objective. This, combined with the fall of
 copper prices and the closure of the Benguela railroad
 in Angola, had a serious negative impact on the economy
 and the well-being of large segments of the population.
 At the same time, the government took over all educational
 institutions (hitherto largely church and missionary run).
 This resulted in significantly fewer educational oppor-
 tunities.
 In 1976 President Mobutu began returning properties as
 an inducement to expatriates to return to Zaire, making
 
 
 129
 peace with the church, returning control of basic
 education to the missionaries, and implementing a pro-
 gram of economic reform. The government accepted an
 International. Monetary Fund stabilization program in
 1976. This was only partially successful. In 1977 the
 government committed itself to a more severe IMF stabil-
 ization program to improve control over expenditures
 through better management of national resources.
 Corruption, which has increased over the years, diverts
 resources from the poor. President Mobutu's program of
 economic reform includes efforts to reduce corruption.
 3.    Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 There is a government-effort to inculcate a national
 philosophy of "authenticity" which does not encourage the
 expression of alternative intellectual outlooks.
 Accordingly, freedom of speech and press are restricted.
 Government restrictions.on the independence of religious
 institutions and the practice of religion have been
 rescinded and freedom of religion largely restored.
 The right of assembly for political purposes is pro-
 hibited unless under the aegis of the single political
 party.
 Although Zaire's sole legal labor movement, National
 Union of Zairian Workers (UNTZa), is under the domina-
 tion of the ruling party, it still possesses a degree of
 independence. In August 1977 the union held its first
 election since its formation in 1967.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 Freedom of travel within the country is generally un-
 restricted. Temporary limitations for reasons of..,.
 security may be imposed on travel to specific areas such as
 Shaba. Excessive migration to the capital is actively
 discouraged owing to such considerations as high urban
 unemployment. Foreign travel and emigration are generally
 unrestricted.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 
 
 Zaire is a one-party state. According to the new
 electoral law of June 1977, Zairians 18 years of age and
 older may vote for local officials, the national legis-
 lative assembly and for president. Exceptions are
 those mentally ill, subjected to military discipline
 within the last ten years, guilty of serious violations
 of party discipline, or residing abroad. Local,
 regional and party elections were held in October with
 wide voter participation.' To attain political office, a
 Zairian citizen must be an active party member.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Sensitive to earlier criticism that it restricts out-
 side access, the Government of Zaire permits mission-
 aries and international organizations such as the.Inter-
 national Red Cross, the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission, and the International Rescue Committee to
 operate relatively freely in Zaire. We know of no recent
 requests for outside investigations of human rights
 conditions in Zaire, although Amnesty International is
 researching several individual Zairian prisoners. On
 the other hand, foreign journalists are sometimes limited
 in their access or on occasion expelled for reporting
 judged to be inaccurate or otherwise contrary to the
 nation's best interests.
