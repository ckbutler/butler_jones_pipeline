 Italy has an extensive system of social welfare
 benefits covering old age, retirement, health and
 linemployment. These programs have experienced
 continuing problems of inefficient administration
 which have resulted in inequities in some cases.
 The Government recognizes this problem and is attempting
 to improve social services.

 Including:
 a. .Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion,
 and Assembly
 These freedoms are in effect.
 b. 'Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 There is freedom of movement, foreign travel and
 emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 In reaction to more than 20 years of fascist rule between
 the World Wars, the Italian Republic and its government
 have been scrupulous in defense of the fundamental rights
 and freedoms of individuals and groups. A variety of
 political parties and views, a vocal press, and a strong
 humanistic and religious tradition have all acted to
 guarantee civil liberties against governmental abuse.
 Political activity on the part of citizens is universal.
 Political parties represent the entire spectrum, from
 left to right. In a typical parliamentary election
 over 90 percent of eligible-voters cast ballots.
 4. Goverment Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Italian Government has an excellent record in
 supporting human rights throughout the world. Italy
 has not been the subject of investigation of alleged
 human rights violations.
