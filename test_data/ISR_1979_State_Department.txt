 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 
 Because of the sharply differing politico-social envir-
 onments in Israel and in the Arab territories Israel
 has occupied since the 1967 war, discussion of this
 subject must be treated in separate but parallel
 fashion for the two areas. Therefore, for its first
 three sections, this report is divided into separate
 narratives for Israel and the occupied territories.
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy with high standards
 of justice and human rights. These standards are ap-
 plied fully inside Israel proper. Under the military
 regime that governs the occupied territories, however,
 certain of the normal human rights guarantees that are
 taken for granted in Israel proper have been suspended
 on security grounds. This dichotomy poses a dilemma
 that will probably be resolved only in the context of a
 final peace settlement between Israel and its neighbors.
 ISRAEL
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Includ-
 ing Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Torture is prohibited by law in Israel, and is virtu-
 ally unknown.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment is not sanctioned
 in Israel, and law enforcement is carried out without
 the excessive use of force.
 The Government of Israel has appointed a special com-
 mittee to investigate conditions in Israeli prisons,
 where there have reportedly been problems of overcrowd-
 ing, and a report will soon be published. This year,
 the Cabinet decided to transfer the decision to ask for
 the death penalty for terrorists to the Attorney General,
 establishing it as a process of the judiciary rather
 than political procedure, but he has not exercised that
 discretion to date.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 In Israel proper, arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is
 not practiced and there are strong guarantees against
 it. Writs of habeas corpus and other guarantees of due
 process of law are employed and defendants are considered
 innocent until proven guilty.

 757
 Preventive detention is legal but there were no known
 cases in 1979. On March 5, the Knesset enacted a new
 law which replaces and further limits the use of pre-
 ventive detention as previously allowed under British
 Mandatory regulations. The new law imposes a 48-hour
 judicial review at all stages, transfers authority for
 imposing detention, defines recourse to the court, and
 spells out the right of appeal. It also grants the de-
 tainee certain specified rights, and makes detention
 more fully subject to judicial controls. Regulations
 for the application of the provision of this law are
 being enacted for the occupied territories.  (See Occu-
 pied Territories, 1 c).
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair hearing by an impartial tribunal
 with representation by counsel is observed. With the
 exception of security cases, all trials are open. In
 security cases, Israeli law provides that part or all
 of a trial may be closed, with the burden of justify-
 ing in camera proceedings falling on the prosecution.
 Counsel is always present during closed proceedings.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 There are effective legal safeguards against arbitrary
 invasion of the home. The Department of State knows
 of no invasions of the home, either this year or in
 prior years.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education.
 Israel is a welfare state whose economy is organized
 along the general lines of the Western European mixed
 economies. Income distribution in Israel is relatively
 egalitarian. All Israelis are guaranteed good health
 care, and housing for the poor is modestly subsidized.
 Since 1948, Israel has taken in well over one million
 largely impoverished Jewish refugees from Europe, the
 Soviet Union, the Middle East, and North Africa, and
 has worked to integrate them into its society and econ-
 omy. Integration of smaller numbers of immigrants con-
 tinues at the present time. Because of the wide dispar-
 ity in educational and cultural background there remains
 an economic and social gap between the Ashkenazi (Euro-
 pean) and Sephardi (Middle Eastern) Jewish communities,
 which the Government is committed to narrowing. All
 Israelis between the ages of 5 and 16 are guaranteed
 free public education. The parallel educational systems
 for Jews and Arabs, conducted in Hebrew and Arabic re-
 spectively, show a marked disparity in quality, with
 greater resources per student going into the Jewish
 system.
 
 
 758
 While title to 93% of the land in Israel is held by
 the State or quasi-public organizations in trust for
 the Jewish people, anyone, including Arabs, may pur-
 chase privately-owned land through ordinary commercial-
 transactions. There have been complaints that expro-
 priations of Arab land have been used for promoting
 Jewish settlement in densely Arab-populated areas.
 Such expropriations, however, are subject to legal re-
 view as to purpose and amount of compensation.
 Corruption is not widespread in Israel but crime has
 recently become more of a problem than previously. The
 Government has taken steps to combat organized crime
 and cooperates closely with other nations and with in-
 ternational organizations to deal with various common
 problems such as drug smuggling.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Israelis of all faiths and ethnic groups continue to
 enjoy freedbm of religion, expression, and assembly.
 An anti-proselytizing measure adopted by the Knesset
 in late 1977, which outlaws the offering of bribes or
 material benefits as an inducement to religious convbrs-
 ions,has caused concern to Christian groups who fear it
 might be used to curtail legitimate activities. In a
 clarification placed in the Knesset record on January
 15, 1979, the Minister of Justice stated that the law
 is not intended to restrict the religious freedom of
 any community nor to impede them from the pursuit of
 normal educational or philanthropic activities. The
 Attorney General has instructed that no action or in-
 quiry may be instituted under the 1977 law without his
 direct prior authorization. No legal action has,in
 fact, ever been taken under the law.
 There is full freedom of speech in Israel. Both the
 Hebrew and Arabic press are free and express a wide
 variety of political opinions, although all media
 are subject to censorship on security and military
 matters.
 There are two prominent human rights groups in Israel
 which work for the protection of individual liberties.
 In 1979 the Government opened an office for Human
 Rights in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
 
 
 759
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 All Israeli citizens enjoy freedom of movement within
 the country and are free to travel abroad or emigrate,
 subject to Government review to determine whether mili-
 tary service related obligations have been satisfied.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy, and Israelis
 enjoy the full freedom to participate in the polit-
 ical process.
 The organized labor movement functions without hin-
 drance and wields substantial political and economic
 power. The right to strike is exercised frequently
 and effectively. Most workers, Arab as well as Jewish,
 are members of the Histadrut, the general confedera-
 tion of workers.
 Because of the explicitly Jewish character of the
 state, and the isolation of Israel from most of its
 Arab neighbors, the Arab minority tends to feel power-
 less and largely alienated. Despite some governmental
 and private efforts to bridge the gap, there is very
 little social interaction between Israeli Arabs and
 Jews.
 The Arab minority has equal rights under the law, al-
 though various forms of discrimination do occur in such
 areas as employment and appointment to government posi-
 tions. Some Arabs have risen to responsible positions
 in the civil service. Several Arabs are members of the
 Knesset, Israel's Parliament. Unlike Druze, Circassians
 and Jewish Israelis, most Arabs are exempted from either
 compulsory or voluntary military service. Bedouin and
 Christian Arabs may serve voluntarily, however.
 Since early in the 20th century, Jewish women have
 played an active role in every sphere of life in
 Israel. The Equal Rights for Women Law (1951) for-
 malized women's rights in Israel, granting them the
 right to own and deal in property and the right to
 guardianship of their children, and abolishing uni-
 lateral divorce by a husband. Polygamy and child
 marriage were abolished. Also, minor females were
 included in compulsory education laws. Under the Em-
 ployment of Women Law (1954), women have the right to
 work without discrimination at'equal pay for equal work
 in the same jobs as men so long as they can do the job
 in accordance with their physical capacity without im-
 pairing their health.
 
 
 760
 There are strong secular and religious forces in contest
 over changes in the status of women in Israel. Although
 there is very little in the way of an organized "women's
 liberation" movement, Israeli feminists feel that the
 laws described above, once deemed advanced, now discrim-
 inate against women. Many women consider the 1978 law
 granting military exemption to any woman who claims to
 be orthodox to be biased against secular women. Also,
 feminists have complained about the lack of sufficient
 representation (nine of 120 Knesset Members, no Minis-
 ters). Since the establishment of the state, all mat-
 ters relating to the family are handled by the relevant
 religious courts. These courts, while operating within
 the confines of the law, base their decision on relig-
 ious law, which sometimes discriminates against women.
 4. Government Attitudes and Record Regarding Internat-
 ional and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights.
 This subject is discussed in Part 4 of the Section
 on the Occupied Territories.
 OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 The territories occupied in 1967 consist of the West
 Bank of the Jordan River, the Gaza Strip, the Sinai
 Peninsula, the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem. Under
 the terms of the Egyptian-Israeli treaty of peace,
 Israel is scheduled to complete the evacuation of ap-
 proximately two-thirds of Sinai by the end of January
 1980. Full evacuation is to take place in April 1982.
 The complex human rights situation in the occupied ter-
 ritories, particularly in the West Bank and Gaza, where
 virtually all of the settled Arab population is located,
 is largely a result of the tensions between the occupy-
 ing authorities and the indigenous population, mostly
 Palestinian Arabs. Israel and Egypt began negotiations
 in May 1979, pursuant to the September 1978 Camp David
 Accords, for an agreement which will define the powers
 and responsibilities of the self-governing authority
 to be exercised in the West Bank and Gaza, with further
 negotiations to follow to determine the final status of
 these territories at the end of five years.
 The occupied territories are under military government,
 and law enforcement and public security are in military
 rather than in civilian hands. Although Israel rejects
 the view of the United Nations (including the U.S.)
 that the stipulations of the Fourth Geneva Convention
 concerning the protection of civilian populations under
 military occupation apply to its governance of the occu-
 pied territories, Israel declares that it voluntarily
 observes most of these stipulations.
 
 
 The major difference is with respect to those provis-
 ions prohibiting the introduction of civilian settlers
 from the occupying power into occupied territories.
 In contravention of the generally accepted interpreta-
 tion of the Convention's Article 49, Israel has settled
 approximately 18,000 people in 111 non-military settle-
 ments in the occupied territories, excluding east
 Jerusalem. Of these settlements, 10 were established
 in 1979, seven on the West Bank and three in the
 Golan Heights. Also included are 19 settlements,
 (about 4000 people) in the Sinai, all of which Israel
 has agreed to withdraw by April 1982 as part of the
 Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Allegations about the use of torture including psycho-
 logical and physical pressures and instances of brutal-
 ity by Israeli officials during interrogation of Arab
 security suspects have been publicized widely. Infor-
 mation from the Israeli press and decisions by Israeli
 courts confirm that instances of mistreatment have at
 times occurred. Israeli authorities have repeatedly
 stressed that such practices are forbidden by Israeli
 law and that any violators are punished Israeli public
 and official reaction to allegations of torture and
 mistreatment has been vigorous and prompt.
 In December, two Israeli police officers were convicted
 of torturing an Arab suspected of the murder of a woman
 relative in order to obtain a confession. The officers
 were sentenced to one and two years respectively. In a
 separate case, an east Jerusalem journalist alleged that
 he was tortured during interrogation on a security charge.
 The latter case received considerable publicity in the
 Israeli press and brought calls for an investigation.
 In a detailed public report, the Attorney General stated
 that, although mistreated, the journalist had not been
 tortured or denied proper medical treatment. According
 to the Attorney General's report, the interrogator in
 the case was reprimanded and transferred, and the secur-
 ity services gave assurances that steps were being taken
 to prevent the repetition of such an incident.
 Israel and the International Committee of the Red Cross
 negotiated an agreement in 1978-79 for ICRC visits to
 detainees. Under the terms of the new agreement nego-
 tiated in early 1979, Israel agreed to shorten the time
 for notifying ICRC of the arrest of security detainees
 from 14 to 12 days, to allow ICRC visits once every 14
 days while under interrogation, and from the second
 visit to allow complete freedom of discussion (i.e.,
 beyond identity and health). Also Israel agreed to
 
 
 762
 allow the immediate examination of the detainee by an
 approved physician, and to investigate any complaints
 as requested by ICRC.
 Generally, the ICRC may at any time visit prisoners
 not under interrogation. In addition, ICRC delegates
 visit convicted Arab security prisoners in Israel and
 the occupied territories. Whenever the ICRC feels it
 necessary, an ICRC physician may conduct medical exam-
 inations without witnesses; the ICRC may submit inquir-
 ies about specific cases to the Israeli authorities.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There have been reports of instances of degrading
 treatment of some suspects in connection with interro-
 gations in the first hours following arrests.
 Overcrowding in prisons continues to be a problem
 and hunger strikes led by security prisoners have
 occurred.
 The Israeli Attorney General's office has conclud-
 ed the investigative phase of an inquiry into prison
 conditions, and the members of the commission are draft-
 ing their recommendations.
 In contravention of the Fourth Geneva Convention
 (on protection of civilian persons in time of war),
 occupation authorities on May 4, in the first such
 action since March 1976, deported a West Bank resident
 for political activities. The decision was upheld in
 an appeal to the Supreme Court.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 There have been reports of arbitrary arrests and deten-
 tion in Jerusalem and in the West Bank following demon-
 strations and acts of terrorism. Administrative deten-
 tion is authorized under Israeli law as well as under
 the Jordanian and British mandatory codes which were
 in force before 1967 in the West Bank and Gaza respec-
 tively, and which continue in force there. The Mili-
 tary Government is reviewing for use in the occupied
 territories regulations for the application of the pro-
 visions of the new March 5, 1979 law which places ad
 inistrative detention under judicial review and control.
 Under the Fourth Geneva Convention, Administrative De-
 tention is not permissible beyond one year from the
 "general close of military operations." Israel cur-
 rently maintains that administrative detention is
 occasionally necessary to prevent terrorist operations
 when a court proceeding would compromise sensitive
 security information. Administrative detainees have
 several forms of recourse from detention orders, but
 
 
 763
 the right to appeal is rarely exercised and appeals
 are not known to have ever resulted in a reversal of
 the decision of the military authorities.
 As of November 1979, there were about 2,661 non-Israeli-
 citizen Arabs in prison for security offenses in Israel
 proper or in the territories. Of this number, fifteen
 were under administrative detention. An additional num-
 ber of suspected security offenders were awaiting trial.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 As required by the Geneva Convention, Jordanian law
 (with a few Israeli modifications) is still in force
 in the West Bank in civil and criminal matters, as is
 British Mandatory law in Gaza. Its adjudication has
 been left in the hands of the indigenous judiciary,
 which carries out its duties in an equitable manner.
 Residents of the occupied territories accused of non-
 security offenses receive fair public trials by local
 civilian courts. Alleged security offenders are, with
 the few exceptions cited in the above section, tried
 in Israeli military courts by military judges trained
 in law.
 Alleged security offenders are, with the few exceptions
 cited in the above section, tried in Israeli military
 courts by military judges trained in law. Most mili-
 tary trials are open to the public. While military
 regulations require simultaneous translation of trial
 proceedings into the language of the accused, there
 have been complaints from Arab prisoners that insuffic-
 ient steps have been taken to enable them to follow the
 proceedings, or that they signed confessions in a lan-
 guage they did not understand. Legal procedures at such
 trials appear generally to meet the standards of a fair
 trial, although Arab prisoners charge that convictions
 are frequently based on confessions obtained through
 coercion. The Department of State is not able to sub-
 stantiate these charges. No appeal of military court
 verdicts is possible. The Area Military Commander can
 and does exercise the right of commutation, reducing
 and sometimes completely setting aside the sentences
 imposed. Non-judicial administrative orders by the
 Military Government, such as the deportation order
 issued in the case of Mayor Shakaa of Nablus, may be
 appealed to the Area Military Commander, and to the
 Israeli Supreme Court.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Under emergency regulations, military authorities may
 enter private homes and institutions in pursuit of se-
 curity objectives as they see fit. While this has some-
 times resulted in injury to inhabitants and damage to
 property, the military authorities frequently make re-
 pairs or restitution on the basis of both formal claims
 
 
 764
 and informal complaints. In violation of the Geneva
 Convention, houses of individuals believed to have
 been involved in terrorism have been demolished or
 sealed up and families displaced. In the last year,
 at least nine homes were demolished and there were at
 least six additional houses sealed up.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Investment in economic infrastructure in the territor-
 ies has been small; there are no indigenous financial
 institutions. Residents have complained that Israel
 restricts economic development on both political and
 commercial grounds, thereby keeping the West Bank and
 Gaza as captive markets. Nevertheless, unemployment
 in the occupied territories is very low and real per
 capita income has more than doubled since 1967. Much
 of this increase in per capita income can be attrib-
 uted to the large number of Palestinian workers emp-
 loyed in Israel. Many individuals, especially those
 with higher education, migrate to other countries where
 greater employment opportunities exist.
 Israeli settlement activity in the occupied territories
 has adversely affected the livelihood of some Arab resi-
 dents, particularly as a result of the taking of land
 for settlements. The Government of Israel voluntarily
 granted the inhabitants of the occupied territories ac-
 cess to the Israeli court system to appeal such actions.
 The Israeli High Court this year ruled that private land
 in the occupied territories may be legally requisitioned
 by the military for civilian settlements only when justi-
 fied primarily on security grounds. Arab residents have
 found it difficult to challenge land requisitions be-
 cause title is not always clear and many settlements
 are justified initially on military or security grounds;
 even after conversion from paramilitary to civilian
 status this justification continues to be advanced, but
 groups of Arab landowners have won several court orders
 delaying settlement activity. In two cases such orders
 were cancelled by the Supreme Court when it decided
 that the land was seized for valid military purposes.
 But in the most important decision of the year, the
 High Court ruled that land seizures for the Elon Moreh
 settlement did not meet the necessary criteria and that
 the settlement must be dismantled. Some existing set-
 tlements continue to grow, both in area--through fur-
 ther requisitions--and in population. Compensation for
 expropriated land is sometimes offered, but, for polit-
 ical reasons, is rarely accepted by Arab residents.
 
 
 765
 A further problem results from the exploitation of a
 part of the West Bank's limited water resources for
 the use of Israeli settlements, which Arabs charge has
 in some cases allegedly caused Arab wells to dry up and
 threatens long-term detrimental effects on Arab agri-
 culture and livestock, and on the rural population.
 Israeli authorities deny these claims, saying that
 while they have closely controlled water resources to
 prevent irreversible saline pollution through over-
 demand, substantial gains in Arab agricultural produc-
 tion--particularly in crops that are relatively heavy
 water users--prove that their conservation measures
 have not been detrimental. Israeli officials also state
 they have provided the West Bank with water from sour-
 ces in Israel proper. According to the best and most
 recent information available to the Department of State,
 since the 1967 occupation the military authorities re-
 cently have granted seven permits for private agricul-
 tural wells to be used by Arab farmers. In addition,
 five wells for exclusively Arab agriculture have been
 drilled by the Israeli water authority at its expense.
 The Military Government (or UNRWA for the refugees)
 meets the basic educational needs of students in the
 occupied territories. Following student demonstrations
 in the spring of 1979, the military government closed
 several schools, including Bir Zeit University, for a
 period of several months. One school, an UNRWA girls
 training institution, was closed for five and one-half
 months. All the closed institutions were permitted to
 reopen in time for fall classes.
 There is no known large scale element of organized
 crime or corruption in the occupied territories.
 Residents of the territories, both Arabs and Jews, suf-
 fer from criminal acts in the form of bombings and other
 forms of violence, responsibility for which usually is
 claimed by Palestinian organizations located outside
 Israel and the territories. In the first 10 months of
 1979, at least 86 bombs were-placed in Jerusalem, the
 West Bank and Gaza, resulting in 16 killed and 176
 wounded. There were also a number of vigilante acts
 against Arabs by extremist Israelis resulting in the
 death of one person and injury to several others.
 The Military Government has taken action against vig-
 ilantism and several offenders were apprehended and
 jailed.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion,
 and Assembly
 
 
 766
 Freedom of religion in the occupied territories is un-
 qualified although the ongoing conflict over the use
 of holy places venerated by both Muslims and Jews in
 Hebron, has continued and sharpened this year.
 Freedom of expression and assembly is restricted on
 security grounds. Permits are required for public
 meetings and rallies and few have been granted. The
 Military Government imposed curfews on several local-
 ities following demonstrations earlier this year.
 While these generally have been of short duration, the
 18-day, 23-hour per day curfew in Halhul this spring
 caused considerable hardship to the inhabitants of that
 town.
 The West Bank press is subject to censorship but is al-
 lowed in practice to operate quite freely and is fre-
 quently outspoken in its criticism of Israeli policies.
 This year the censors have prohibited the publishing
 and/or distribution of three West Bank publications
 and two new publications have not been granted licen-
 ses. At times, editorials are censored or removed
 entirely. Educational materiald originating in Arab
 countries are screened and selectively censored for
 anti-Israel or anti-Jewish content.
 While membership in a proscribed organization, e.g.,
 the Palestine Liberation Organization or one of its
 constituent elements, is grounds for arrest, it is not
 the policy of the authorities to arrest individuals
 because of positions privately or even publicly held.
 For instance, most of the Mayors elected in 1976 are
 Palestine Liberation Organization sympathizers. There
 was a controversy in November over the arrest of Mayor
 Shakaa of Nablus. The Military Court of Appeals ruled
 in favor of the Mayor and a deportation order issued
 against him was rescinded.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration.
 Freedom of movement is generally unrestricted in the
 occupied territories and thousands of Arabs travel
 daily to Israel for work. Vehicles owned by inhabi-
 tants of the occupied territories are so marked, how-
 ever, and are frequently stopped for security inspec-
 tion. Inhabitants of the territories, like Israelis,
 are required to carry identity cards. They are gener-
 ally free to travel abroad and return, and many thous-
 ands cross to Jordan every year. Inhabitants of the
 territories crossing from Jordan into the West Bank,
 as well as other Arabs or persons of Arab descent, are
 subject to searches for weapons and contraband. There
 have been complaints that these searches are more rig-
 orous than necessary on pure security grounds, and con-
 stitute harassment.
 
 
 The Military Government has restricted the travel of
 _some individuals in the Occupied Territories, most not-
 ably various West Bank mayors. Mayor Kawasmeh of
 Hebron, among others, was refused permission to attend
 the Palestine Human Rights Campaign annual meeting in
 Washington in September. Mayors Shakaa of Nablus and
 Milhim of Halhul were apparently also denied permiss-
 ion to attend the annual convention of the Arab-American
 University Graduates in November in Washington. Meet-
 ings of municipal leaders within the territories have
 also been restricted. Temporary travel bans occasion-
 ally have been applied to large population groups fol-
 lowing suspected terrorist acts or demonstrations.
 The Israeli Government states it has allowed since
 1967 more than 50,000 Palestinians to return permanent-
 ly to the occupied territories for family reunification.
 Most returned in 1968, with smaller numbers in the years
 since. In 1977, there were 1,397; in 1978, there were
 1,511; and from January through July 1979, there were
 1,008 returnees.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 There have been two elections of mayors and city coun-
 sellors in the West Bank since the beginning of the
 Israeli occupation, in 1972 and again in 1976. Israel
 permitted Arab nationalists outspokenly hostile to
 Israeli occupation to run for office in the second
 West Bank election and honored the results of those
 elections. No political parties are permitted. The
 next municipal elections are to be held in the spring
 of 1980.
 The status of women in the Occupied Territories
 reflects traditional Palestinian values and practices.
 Laws governing marriage, family and personal status
 discriminate against women. Changes are taking place,
 however. Since 1967, the proportion of women in school
 has steadily increased so that now they comprise
 roughly half the school population. Exposure to educa-
 tion, and to a basically egalitarian attitude toward
 women by Israelis, is changing the traditional status
 of women. Traditionally unenfranchised, women are per-
 mitted to vote in municipal elections. The younger gen-
 eration of women is growing up with different expecta-
 tions about its status.
 Relatively few women in the population of the occupied
 territories participate in the hired labor force. Many
 women workers are not counted officially since they are
 employed on farms, at home, or in small family enter-
 prises excluded from statistics. Women who work in
 Israel proper or for Israeli firms receive the benefits
 of Israeli labor laws and practices.
 
 
 768
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights.
 The ICRC regularly inspects prison conditions in
 the occupied territories and makes recommendations
 for improvement. Since 1976, Amnesty International
 and other groups repeatedly have requested an out-
 side investigation of allegations of mistreatment of
 prisoners and security detainees. An Amnesty dele-
 gation visited the West Bank in June, 1979 and its
 report currently is in preparation.
 For several years, the United Nations Human Rights Com-
 mission and other United Nations bodies have adopted
 resolutions condemning alleged Israeli human rights
 violations in the occupied territories. The United
 States voted against most of these resolutions, regard-
 ing them as one-sided and politically motivated. Al-
 though Israel has been generally unresponsive to
 efforts by United Nations bodies to conduct investiga-
 tions in territories under its jurisdiction, on the
 grounds that its experience suggests that the reports
 of such investigations would reflect political bias
 rather than the facts, it has cooperated with recent
 visits of representatives of the World Health Organi-
 zation, the International Labor Organization, and the
 United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural
 Organization (UNESCO). In September, 1979, a UNESCO
 delegation was allowed freedom to visit anyone anywhere
 in the Occupied Territories excluding East Jerusalem.
 The UNESCO mission received full cooperation of the
 Israeli authorities. The Director General recently
 released a report of the Mission's findings which was
 generally favorable to the Israeli Government.
