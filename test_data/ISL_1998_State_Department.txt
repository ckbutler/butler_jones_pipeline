 ICELAND
 Iceland is a constitutional republic and a multiparty parliamentary democracy. Its
 people participate in high percentages in regular, free, and fair elections which de-
 termine the distribution of power among political parties and leaders. The judiciary
 is independent.
 Elected officials control the police force, which scrupulously observes and enforces
 the laws that ensure protection of human rights.
 Iceland has a mixed, open economy, in which citizens have the right to hold pri-
 vate property. It provides residents with a high standard of living. The leading ex-
 port, marine products, accounts for almost 70 percent of export revenues.
 The Government generally respects the human rights of its citizens, and the law
 and judiciary provide effective means of dealing with individual instances of abuse.
 There is some societal discrimination against women, which the Government has
 begun to address.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment are pro-
 hibited by law and do not occur.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Government
 permits visits by human rights monitors. While many prisons are near capacity, the
 Government has over the past year modernized and expanded existing facilities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution and law provide for an independ-
 ent judiciary, and the Government.respects this provision in practice.
 The Ministry of Justice administers the lower court system, while the Supreme
 Court guards its independence and fairness. Juries are not used, but multijudge
 panels are common, especially in the appeals process. All judges, at all levels, serve
 for life.
 The judiciary provides citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process. Defend-
 ants are presumed innocent. They are provided access to legal counsel of their own
 choosing with sufficient time to prepare their defense. For defendants unable to pay
 attorneys' fees, the State assumes the cost Dfendants have the right to be present
 at their trial, to confront witnesses, and to participate otherwise in the proceedings.
 No groups are barred from testifying, and all testimony is treated alike. Trials are

 public and are conducted fairly, with no official intimidation. Defendants have the
 right to appeal.               I -               -  -
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondnce.-The
 Constitution prohibits, such practices and the Government' generally respect these
 prohibitions. Violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An inde-
 pendent press, -an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system
 combine to-ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Although the official state religion is Lutheranism, the
 Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government respects this
 right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice. The Government cooperates with the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in as-
 sisting refugees. There were no reports of forced expulsion of those having a valid
 claim to refugee status. The issue of the provision of first asylum did not arise in
 1998. In addition to the total of 50 refugees from the former Yugoslavia that Iceland
 accepted in 1996 and 1997, 23 were settled in the northern town of Blondous in
 June. Local government authorities in the towns where refugees are being settled
 have taken a strong interest in helping them adapt to their new environment, in-
 cluding providing Icelandic language classes and jobs.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage. The most recent elections to the
 Althingi (unicameral Parliament) were held in April 1995.
 There are no legal or, practical impediments to women's participation in govern-
 ment and politics. There is one woman in the cabinet. Women hold 17 of the 63
 seats in Parliament, There is an active feminist political party, the Women's List,
 which won 3 seats in the 1995 parliamentary elections. One of the three female Par-
 liamentarians left t he Women's List in, 1998 due to differences over the future of
 the movement, thereby reducing the Womdn's List to 2 seats.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Humah Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 tigating and publishing. their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are generally cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The culture of the ethnically homogeneous population is strongly egalitarian and
 opposed to discrimination based on any of these factors. Government legislation and
 practice generally reflect this attitude.
 Women.-Increased governmental awareness of violence against women, resulting
 from extensive media coverage, has led to stiffer sentences for sex offenders. The
 tougher sentencing.derives from' improved action by the courts in more -strictly en-
 forcing existing laws. A police program to train officers in correct interrogation pro-
 cedures in rape and sexual abuse cases appears to be addressing prior concerns that
 police indifference and hostility to female victims did not assure proper attention
 and consideration for victims of such abuses.
 There is a public, women's shelter that offers protection to approximately 350
 women and 200 children per year; these figures are virtually unchanged since 1995.
 There is also a rape trauma center sponsored and operated by women's organiza-
 tions; some 400 women and children seek assistance annually. Both facilities are
 funded by national and- municipal governments, and private contributions. The Rey-
 kjavik City Hospital emergency ward-has an all-female staff to care for rape victims.
 During the year the emergency ward reported iOl visits associated with incidents
 of rape-or sexual abuse, 97 by women and 4 by men. Hospital officials estimate that
 only 51 percent of these victims press charges and only a handful of cases actually
 
 
 1307
 
 go to trial. Officials attribute this low percentage to fear of publicity in such a small,
 tightly knit society.
 With an increasing number of interracial marriages, mostly involving Icelandic
 men and Asian women, there has been concern that these new Asian immigrants
 are not assimilating well into Icelandic society. Concern that these women might be
 vulnerable to mistreatment led the city of Reykjavik to establish a special Center
 for Immigrant Women, which focuses on providing information on their legal rights,
 and an introduction to Icelandic society and norms, as wen as language. training.
 Iceland's largest political party, the center-right Independence Party, has begun
 addressing women's issues as a priority in response to growing public awareness
 stimulated by the Women's List political movement and the efforts of the recently
 reelected female mayor of Reykjavik to put women's issues at the forefront. -While
 major political institutions and businesses remain male dominated, the Government
 is taking steps to enforce legislation requiring equal pay for equal work. There re-
 mains about a 20 percent gap in. earnings between men and women in comparable
 jobs-nationally, although the gap in Reykjavik is less, at around 10 to 15 percent.
 Since .1991 complaints regarding the Equal Rights Law have been referred to a
 special committee under the Equal Rights Affairs Office of the Ministry of Social
 Affairs. However, the committee has only advisory powers, and its recommendations
 to employers do not have the force of law. Few complaints are made to the commit-
 tee.
 Children.-The Government demonstrates its strong commitment to children's
 rights through its well-funded systems of public education and medical care. The
 Government provides free prenatal and infant medical care, as well as heavily sub-
 sidized children's care. Compulsory education ends in the 10th grade. About 85 per-
 cent of students continue to upper secondary education, which is financed com-
 pletely by the State. In 1994 the Government created the Office of the Children's
 Ombudsman in the Prime Minister's Office, with a mandate to protect children's
 rights, interests, and welfare by, among other things, exerting influence on legisla-
 tion, government decisions, and public attitudes.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse directed against children.
 People With Disabilities.-Disabled individuals are not subject to discrimination
 in employment, education, or provision of other state services. The Government has
 -legislated accessibility for the disabled �o public buildings.
 -Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers make extensive use of the right to establish
 organizations, draw up their own constitutions and rules, choose their own leaders
 and policies, and publicize their views. The resulting organizations are controlled
 neither by the Government nor by any single political party. Unions take active part
 in Nordic, European, and international trade union bodies. With the exception of
 limited categories of workers in the public sector whose services are essential to
 public health or safety, unions have had and used the right to strike for many years.
 Approximately 76 percent of all eligible workers belong to unions.
 b. The- Right to Organize andfBargain Collectively.-There are no impediments to
 union membership in law or in practice. Virtually all unions exercise their right to
 * bargain collectively..The central labor and management organizations periodically
 negotiate collective bargaining agreements that set, nationwide standards and spe-
 cific terms for workers' pay, work hours, and other conditions. The Government
 often plays a role in the negotiations and sometimes undertakes commitments in
 order to bring the two sides together. Labor courts effectively adjudicate disputes
 over, contracts and over the rights provided for in the 1938 Act on Trade Unions
 and Industrial Disputes, which prohibits antiunion discrimination.
 By law, employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to rein-
 state workers fired for union activities. In practice, the charges are difficult to
 prove.
 In 1996 the Parliament- passed legislation updating the labor laws and bringing
 them into compliance with-the European Convention for the Protection of Human
 Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
 - There are no export processing or other special economic zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law and does not occur. The law prohibits ,forced and bonded labor by
 children, and, the Government-enforces this prohibition effectively.
 d. -Status of Child Labor Practices and-Minimum Age for Employment.--The law
 prohibits-forced and bonded labor by children and the Government enforces this-pro-
 hibition effectively (see Section 6.c.). The law requires-children to attend school until
 the age of-16 years and prohibits employment of children under that age in fac-
 tories, on ships, or in other places -that are hazardous or require hard labor. This
 
 
 1308
 prohibition is observed in practice. -Children 14 or 15 years old may be employed
 part-time or during school vacations in light, nonhazardous work. Their work-hours
 must not exceed the 6rdinary-work-hourslof adults in the same occupation. The Oc-
 cupational Safety and Health Administration enforces child labor regulations.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Although there is no minimum wage law,
 union membership is so extensive and effective as to ensure that labor-contracts af-
 ford even the lowest paid workers a sufficient income for a decent standard of living
 for themselves and their families.
 Workers are protected by laws that effectively ensure their health and safety as
 well as provide for unemployment insurance, paid vacations, pensions, and reason-
 able working conditions and hours. The standard legal workweek is 40 hours. Work
 exceeding 8 hours in a workday must be compensated as overtime. Workers' are en-
 titled to 10 hours -of rest within each 24-hour period and to a day, off every week.
 Under defined special circumstances, the 10-hour rest period can be reduced to 8,
 and the day off can be postponed by a week, in which case the 'worker has a right
 to 2 additional hours offin the following week.
 Health and safety standards are set by the Althingi and administered and en-
 forced by the Ministry of Social Affairs through its Occupational Safety and Health
 Administration, which can close down workplaces until safety and health standards
 are met. Workers have a collective, not an individual, right to refuse to work in a
 place that does not meet the criteria of-occupational safety and-health. Firingwork-
 ers who report unsafe or unhealthy, onditions is considered a violation of the law.
