 ZAMBIA
 Zambia is a one-party state in which individual rights, basic
 freedoms, and due process are generally well observed while
 some political rights are restricted. Much of the
 decision-making power is concentrated in the hands of the
 President, Kenneth Kaunda, advised by a central committee of
 party leaders and governing through a cabinet and a parliament
 elected through controlled elections. The President possesses
 sweeping powers--conferred on him by emergency legislation
 which dates from 1964--to suspend observance of legal rights
 in the "interest of state security." The Constitution also
 accords power to the National Assembly to suspend basic
 constitutional guarantees.
 Candidates for political office at any level must be members
 of the United National Independence Party. No opposition
 candidate was permitted to run in the October 1983
 presidential election. Kenneth Kaunda received a "yes" vote
 of 93 percent and was reelected for his fifth consecutive
 five-year term. Elections for the National Assembly were held
 in single-member constituencies in 1983, with over 760
 candidates running for the 125 seats.
 In January 1983, the High Court convicted seven persons of
 conspiring to overthrow the Government and handed down
 mandatory death sentences. The convictions were appealed to
 Zambia's Supreme Court, which took testimony in open session
 during August and September 1984. The Supreme Court will rule
 on the appeals at a later date. Internal security continues
 to be a sensitive issue, but there have been no detentions of
 prominent figures for over three years.
 Zambia's economy continues to be severely depressed due to
 such factors as low prices for the country's mineral exports,
 a prolonged drought, statist policies which have led to
 inefficiencies, and a rapid rate of population growth which
 outstrips productivity. There has been a continuing decline
 in citizens' standard of living, but the Government is taking
 steps to improve the management of the economy and to remove
 some of the agricultural production disincentives, while
 attempting to maintain delivery of a wide range of social
 services to the citizenry. Numerous cases of urban crime and
 smuggling have severely taxed the limited capabilities of
 Zambia's police and military forces.
 Zambian institutions such as the judiciary, press, trade union
 movements, and churches have come under some pressure from
 central authorities to be more responsive to the wishes of the
 Government, but have maintained to the best of their ability
 their objectivity, status, and influence. There is stiff
 competition within the single party structure for
 parliamentary seats; the National Assembly provides a platform
 for the spirited consideration of issues; the judiciary is
 independent and takes full account of the rights of the
 accused; the trade union movement continues to be one of the
 best organized and most democratic in Africa; and the churches
 remain a strong independent force which can unite to defend
 common interests. Zambia continues to serve as a place of
 first asylum for refugees in the region.
 There has been no major change during 1984 in the status of
 human rights in Zambia. Future trends in human rights
 practices will doubtlessly be influenced by the nation's
 ability to cope with its difficult economic problems.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 During 1984 there were no killings in which there was evidence
 of political motivation or government instigation.
 b. Disappearance
 No case of politically motivated disappearance is known to
 have occurred during 1984.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture, but there are credible
 allegations that police and military personnel have used cruel
 treatment when arresting persons and have resorted to torture
 when interrogating detainees. Charges of torture and
 mistreatment are reported freely in the press when victims
 register their complaints in court. The courts frequently
 order investigations to ascertain if confessions or statements
 were made after torture or physical and mental mistreatment
 and have consistently rejected statements obtained under
 duress from arrested persons. Abuses of prisoners are
 reported to include beatings, pain inflicted on various parts
 of the body, and long periods of solitary confinement.
 Prisoners have successfully sued the state for damages as a
 result of prison abuses. In January 1984, three prison
 officers were fined and sentenced to one year in jail for
 putting leg irons on prisoners.
 Zambian prisons are overcrowded, understaffed, unsanitary, and
 lacking in rehabilitative facilities. Medical facilities are
 meager, but prisoners with serious medical problems are
 treated in public hospitals. Prisoners are generally
 segregated by sex, seriousness of the offense, and age group.
 There is no institutional differentiation in the treatment of
 different categories of prisoners charged or convicted under
 civil or criminal statutes, but presidential detainees receive
 better care in detention than that accorded common prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under the state of emergency which has been in effect since
 independence in 1964, the President has broad discretion to
 detain or restrict the movements of individuals, a power not
 exercised since 1982. Detention procedures have been revised
 to conform with provisions of the Constitution and have
 increased the President's authority.
 The President can incarcerate a detainee indefinitely and is
 not legally bound to accept a court's acquittal if he still
 believes that the detainee is guilty. In practice, detainees
 are almost always released if the court finds in their favor.
 By law, presidential detainees are entitled to: formal
 notice of the reasons for their detention; publication of
 their detention in the Government Gazette; access to counsel;
 frequent visitation by family and colleagues; immediate
 representation to the detaining authority; and the right to
 seek judicial review of the detention order by an independent
 
 
 383
 ZAMBIA
 and impartial tribunal after one year. Presidential detainees
 must have their cases heard by the High Court and have the
 right to appeal to the Supreme Court. Habeas corpus is
 available to persons detained under presidential order, but
 the Government is not obliged to accept the recommendation of
 the review tribunal. Six detainees were among the 243
 prisoners amnestied in October 1984 in conjunction with
 Zambia's 20th anniversary celebrations. It is estimated that
 there are fewer than 15 presidential detainees currently held
 in Zambia.
 There was no significant use of the President's detention
 authority in 1984. However, detainees from previous years
 face a slow process of investigations and legal actions which
 can take anywhere from a few months to several years.
 Detainees can sue the state for wrongful detention and false
 imprisonment, and several did so in 1984.
 Under the state of emergency, law officers and defense
 personnel have extraordinary powers. Police officers of
 assistant inspector rank and above may arrest without a
 warrant and detain an individual for up to 28 days if the
 officer has reason to believe grounds exist to justify a
 presidential detention order. However, police must within 14
 days provide the detainee with reasons for his detention, or
 his incarceration is void. This requirement is followed
 rigorously.
 Security officers have broad powers of search, and sometimes
 act without warrants when looking for smugglers or illegal
 aliens. During 1984, more than 3,000 persons residing
 illegally in Zambia were rounded up in police sweeps,
 especially in Copperbelt province, and were later deported.
 The majority of these aliens were deported to Zaire, with
 others being sent to Tanzania and a number of other nations.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Zambian judiciary system consists of a Supreme Court with
 appellate powers and a series of lower courts--of which the
 High Court is the most important. Presidential detainees are
 not automatically guaranteed public trials, but the majority
 have been tried in public. The safeguards of English common
 law are provided in court cases not involving presidental
 detainees. Independent observation confirms the independence
 of the Zambian judiciary from executive branch influence. The
 President's power to appoint and transfer judges has sometimes
 been cited as having the potential to influence judicial
 decisions. However, there is no evidence that such power has
 swayed court actions.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Zambian Government does not require membership in
 political organizations, and usually does not monitor
 correspondence or telephones, or otherwise interfere in family
 life. The sanctity of the home is generally respected, except
 in isolated incidents relating to the national emergency or to
 roundups and deportations of illegal aliens. In these cases,
 security forces often do not have search warrants. Such
 warrants can be issued by magistrates or police officers above
 the rank of sub-inspector.

 ZAMBIA
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There is considerable freedom of press and speech in Zambia,
 and the press regularly reports criticism of government
 activities expressed by sources ranging from elected officials
 to average citizens. The two national dailies are owned by
 the Government and party respectively, but substantial
 commentary critical of party and government performance is
 permitted. The Times of Zambia, the party paper, is generally
 independent of outside direction. The papers discuss economic
 policy, corruption, and poor administration. However, direct
 negative comments concerning the Head of State, the concept of
 the one-party state, and the national philosophy, "Humanism,"
 are prohibited. Journalists and commentators know the limits
 of criticism and are wary of reporting which could lead to
 charges of libel and slander. An independent biweekly paper
 sometimes critical of official policies is published by an
 association of churches, and two other independent papers
 focus on mining and financial subjects. Television and radio
 are owned and operated by the Government; frequent panel
 discussion programs provide for a wide range of views on
 Zambian issues.
 While the possibility of censorship of foreign publications
 and news items exists, it is seldom invoked. Academic freedom
 is highly respected in Zambian society, and Zambian educators
 are outspoken in their commitment to an educational system
 free of extraneous influence. There is little or no
 governmental interference in matters relating to curriculum,
 student selection, or faculty assignment.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Police permits are required for meetings and rallies or
 marches. These permits are issued routinely, unless the
 Government believes that the proceedings are likely to be
 directed against local authorities. While there is a ban on
 all political activity outside the one-party structure, Zambia
 has a profusion of trade associations and professional groups
 which can serve as unofficial pressure groups on various
 economic, political, and social subjects.
 Zambia has a history of strong labor union organizations,
 dating from the establishment of large copper mines during the
 1930's; Zambia's 18 national labor unions, which are organized
 by industry or profession, are all members of the Zambia
 Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU). Member unions defend worker
 interests, especially on wages and conditions of service, and
 have the right of collective bargaining. Under existing
 legislation, strikes are permitted only for specific reasons
 and only after all other recourse has been exhausted.
 Virtually all strikes are illegal, since they almost always
 commence before the process of mediation has run its course.
 However, the Government has relied on persuasion and continued
 mediation to end strikes once begun. There were no major
 labor disturbances during 1984. The trade union congress is
 not controlled by the party or the Government, and union
 leaders frequently criticize government policy on such
 subjects as wages, economic policy, conditions of service, and
 labor representation on party and government organs.
 Internally, the trade union congress is democratic and
 regularly conducts open elections to select its leadership.
 
 
 385
 ZAMBIA
 The ZCTU is a member of the Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity (OATUU).
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is constitutionally guaranteed and has
 been supported by President Kaunda. Zambia has no state
 religion, and adherence to a particular faith does not confer
 either advantage or disadvantage. Christian missionaries from
 a wide variety of faiths operate freely in the country. While
 Jehovah's Witnesses are prohibited from proselytizing, the
 sect functions openly and its freedom not to participate in
 various secular activities such as voting, singing the
 national anthem, and saluting the flag has been upheld in the
 courts and supported by senior party leaders. Lay
 associations and religious youth groups operate independently
 of party control or influence.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The President may, under emergency powers, restrict the
 movement of individuals within Zambia. The Government also
 reserves the right to refuse or to withdraw passports to
 prevent foreign travel by individuals whose activities are
 considered inimical to Zambian interests. However, strict
 currency regulations also serve to inhibit foreign travel or
 emigration.
 Acquisition, loss, and revocation of citizenship is governed
 by constitutional provisions and laws administered by the
 Citizenship Board. However, the President also has power to
 grant or revoke citizenship on an extraordinary basis.
 Zambia has long played host to a considerable refugee and
 asylum-seeking population that originates in several strife-
 torn southern African nations. The United Nations High
 Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) is conducting a refugee
 census, but estimates indicate that there are approximately
 103,000 refugees in Zambia. The largest group of refugees is
 from Angola, with significant groups from Zaire, Namibia, and
 South Africa. Smaller numbers are from Malawi, Mozambique,
 and Zimbabwe. Many of the Angolans and Zaireans have
 spontaneously resettled in Western and Northwestern provinces
 since the ethnic compositions on both sides of the border are
 similar. The Zambian Government operates two large refugee
 resettlement centers and the South West African People's
 Organization operates one camp. Urban refugees number
 approximately 700.
 Despite Zambia's reputation as a refugee haven, economic
 difficulties and political pressure from the refugees'
 countries of origin resulted in several instances of forced
 repatriation during 1984, especially to Angola, but also to
 Zimbabwe. The UNHCR protested to the Zambian Government the
 forced repatriations to Angola in early 1984, which apparently
 involved several planeloads of people.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Since 1973, the United National Independence Party, with an
 estimated membership of less than ten percent of the adult
 population, has been Zambia's sole legal political party.
 
 
 386
 ZAMBIA
 Power is concentrated in the hands of the President as leader
 of the party and chief of state. He plays a dominant role in
 determining the membership of Zambia's top executive
 institutions, the party central committee and cabinet,
 although traditionally both bodies contain a general balance
 of regional and tribal representation.
 Candidates for political office at any level must be members
 of the party and they are subject to close examination for
 suitability by senior party authorities. In practice,
 however, the Zambian political system is open to individuals
 of somewhat divergent opinions provided they are willing to
 work within the one-party structure and not challenge the
 President's preeminent position. In the latest parliamentary
 elections in 1983, 760 candidates contested 125 seats; 40
 incumbents were defeated, including 7 ministers of state.
 The National Assembly is reflective of constituent interests
 and sometimes thwarts or modifies executive branch policies
 and programs. In 1984 the Assembly voted down a motion for
 adjournment by the Prime Minister, for example. Presidential
 and general elections are by universal suffrage but the
 numbering of ballots, which could be cross-checked against
 voter registration numbers, could undermine the secrecy of the
 ballot. As noted elsewhere, voters can choose among multiple
 candidates for the Parliament from the one party. In the 1983
 presidential election, voters had the option of voting for or
 against the single candidate, or abstaining. A total of 63.4
 percent of registered voters went to the polls, of whom 93
 percent voted in favor of the President.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 While there is no public record of the Zambian Government
 having been subject to such investigations, queries, or
 messages during 1984, the Government generally neither
 encourages nor hinders investigations or visits by
 organizations such as Amnesty International. In its 1984
 report, Amnesty International expressed concern about the
 detention without trial of alleged political opponents of the
 Government and about allegations of cruel, inhuman, and
 degrading treatment of certain prisoners. Freedom House terms
 Zambia "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Zambia is in the midst of a prolonged economic recession,
 marked by high inflation, serious unemployment, and scarce
 financial resources. The application of various economic
 policies along socialist or centrally managed lines since
 independence has not lived up to expectations. Real per
 capita income has fallen below the level at independence, and
 due to depressed prices for Zambia's copper exports, even
 total real national income remains below the level reached in
 1977. In addition, a drought which has lasted three years has
 reduced the production of food and forced further reliance on
 food imports. The expansion of social welfare programs has,
 as a result, had to be subordinated to overall economic needs.
 In the past two years, however, the Government has restricted
 public spending, reduced government subsidies, raised farm
 producers prices, devalued the currency, and come to terms
 
 
 387
 ZAMBIA
 with the International Monetary Fund for an approximately $225
 million standby program extending to April 1986. These
 actions represent important initial steps toward economic
 stabilization.
 The average income of rural inhabitants is estimated to be
 substantially less than one-third the average earnings of
 urban dwellers. This imbalance has generated heavy rural-
 to-urban migration (over 40 percent of the population is
 urban), exacerbating already high unemployment and crime rates
 in urban areas. Nationwide, unemployment is well over a third
 of the potential work force.
 In addition, the gap between the rural and urban areas in
 terms of income, education, housing, nutrition, and the
 availability of public services is considerable. Eighty-six
 percent of the urban population has access to. safe water, for
 instance, as opposed to 16 percent of rural dwellers (1975).
 Within the population there are also significant
 inequalities. The top 20 percent of households claims over 56
 percent of the total income, while the bottom 40 percent gets
 only 11 percent.
 Women participate increasingly in Zambia's social, economic,
 and political life. They hold some senior positions in the
 party, the Government, and the judiciary, and are gaining
 increasing representation in the professions and higher
 education. At the party's 1983 convention, a subcommittee on
 women's affairs was created, which increased women's influence
 on the Central Committee. The party has also increased the
 number of women on the 25-member Central Committee from two to
 four. Nevertheless, the majority of Zambian women still
 occupy traditional roles.
 Under statutory law, women generally enjoy full equality with
 men. Customary law and practice still compete on a de facto
 basis in most rural areas with Zambia's Constitution and
 codified laws. Some customary statutes place women in
 subordinate or unequal status in property inheritance and
 marriage. The Law Development Commission is seeking ways to
 remove such anomalies.
 According to 1979 statistics on school enrollment as a ratio
 of population in age groups, about 99 percent (versus 114
 percent of males) of Zambia's primary-age females are enrolled
 in primary school. Moreover, female students can be admitted
 to secondary school with lower passing marks than male
 students as part of Zambia's 'affirmative action' program.
 However, because many women are burdened with heavy household
 duties, their opportunities for advancement lag behind those
 of men. Within the context of Zambia's traditional society,
 their primary role is to have children. Zambia's population
 growth rate, which stood at 2.8 percent in 1970, is now 3.2
 percent, according to 1984 figures. From 1969 to 1980 there
 was a 40 percent increase in population. The fertility rate
 in 1979 was 6.1 live births per woman, one of the highest in
 the world. Life expectancy at birth is 51.6 years. Barring a
 dramatic turnaround in Zambia's economy, its ability to
 sustain even existing social services will be seriously
 strained in the future by its rapidly expanding population.
