 ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
 A British colony until 1967 and afterward an associated
 state with the United Kingdom, Antigua and Barbuda
 gained its independence on November 1, 1981, and was
 acccepted into the United Nations by acclamation shortly
 thereafter. Antigua and Barbuda's independence consti-
 tution incorporated the long-established Westminster
 parliamentary tradition and respect for human and
 civil rights.
 Throughout most of its history Antigua was a primarily
 agricultural territory, as were its Eastern Caribbean
 neighbors, relying on sugar as its principal crop. In
 more recent times, as a result of changes in official
 policies and land-holding practice, the cultivation
 of sugar and agricultural activity generally has declined
 greatly. However, this traditional economic mainstay
 has largely been supplanted as a foreign exchange earner
 by tourism. Antigua's beaches and harbors have drawn
 thousands of visitors from North America and Europe,
 and tourism is now by far Antigua's largest industry.
 The sister island of Barbuda, almost as large as Antigua
 but sparsely populated, has an economy based largely on
 fishing. Barbuda has expressed periodic dissatisfaction
 with its association in a unitary state with Antigua.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture or inhuman or degrading punishment is expressly
 prohibited by the constitution. This prohibition
 is respected in practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The constitution prohibits such practices, and the
 government maintains vigilance against infractions.
 In one instance in late 1980, a Rastafarian cult youth
 died in police custody under mysterious circumstances.
 The government has taken'an active role in investigating
 the case and prosecuting the concerned police officers.
 Prison and detention facilities, located in an older
 building, are austere but acceptable. A doctor perio-
 dically visits the facilities. Prison and detention
 conditions have not been a subject of criticism. The
 death penalty can be levied for treason and murder.
 The last execution took place in 1979 for murder. There
 are no political prisoners in Antigua and Barbuda.
 c. Disappearances
 No disappearances have been reported.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment are constitutionally
 prohibited and are not practiced. Any person detained
 must be brought before the court within 48 hours.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A fair public trial is guaranteed by the constitution,
 and there have been no instances in which this provision
 has not been respected in practice. The regional West
 Indies Court of Appeal, widely respected for imparti-
 ality, serves Antigua and Barbuda. The individual
 is free to choose legal counsel, but the government
 does not provide counsel to indigents.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Arbitrary entry and search are specifically forbidden by
 the constitution and are not practiced. The constitu-
 tion requires that the government obtain the consent
 of the individual as well as a warrant for entry and
 search.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These civil rights are enshrined in the constitution
 and are respected in practice. Antiguans of all political
 persuasions are outspoken, and political rallies by
 all groups in the country are a common feature, especially
 at election time. Antigua's press is also active.
 There are three newspapers published by political
 parties representing varying viewpoints. The radio
 station is government-owned but reports the news fairly.
 Religious freedom is constitutionally guaranteed and
 respected in practice; there is a plethora of religious
 denominations. Freedom to assemble is also respected,
 and is extended to all groupings including labor unions,
 which regularly exercise the right to strike. There
 is no legal or practical impediment to the functioning
 of these groups.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Antigua and Barbuda's constitution guarantees these
 rights, all of which are honored in practice. There
 has been no known instance of refugee resettlement
 in Antigua and Barbuda. Exit permits are not required.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Antigua's political process is lively and representative,
 encouraging participation by all sectors of the society.
 Opposition parties are not strong in Antigua, but
 are free to work in any legal way to increase their
 standing. Women participate on an equal footing with
 men, and they hold positions in the civil service,
 although social tradition has limited their role in
 seeking elective offices.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There have been no expressions of interest in Antigua
 and Barbuda by international and non-governmental
 human rights groups, nor any requests for investigations.
 Antigua and Barbuda has not yet signed the Inter-American
 Convention on Human Rights.

 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 The Antiguan economy is heavily dependent on tourism
 which, according to World Bank estimates, accounts
 for approximately 30 percent of the gross domestic
 product (GDP). In 1980 the GDP was estimated to be
 approximately $72 million, or about $1,000 per capita.
 Historically, Antigua was an agricultural island,
 but agriculture now accounts for less than 15 percent
 of the GDP. Rebuilding the agricultural sector is
 an important priority for the government, but until
 a new land tenure system is developed, it is unlikely
 that any major progress will be made.
 The manufacturing sector accounts for approximately
 15 percent of GDP and is concentrated in the appliance
 assembly and garment industries. The government is
 actively seeking foreign investment and is seriously
 interested in working with other Eastern Caribbean
 states through the newly-formed Organization of Eastern
 Caribbean States to open a joint investment promotion
 office in the United States.
 Over the past two years approximately ten percent of
 Antigua's capital development program has been devoted
 to education and health. According to the latest
 available statistics, 80 percent of eligible children
 are enrolled in primary school. No similar statistics
 are available for secondary school or university,
 but the figures are considerably less. The unofficial
 development plan for 1982-86 allocates approximately
 four percent of the country's capital development
 funds for education. Over a third of that money will
 be for secondary and post-secondary education.
 Health care in Antigua has undergone substantial
 improvements overthe past 15 years, as illustrated
 by a drop in the infant mortality rate from 68.7 per
 1000 live births to 24.5. The Antiguans recognize
 this as a problem area and are allocating approximately
 three percent of their capital budget over the next
 four years to the health sector, concentrating primarily
 on improvements for the island's hospital. Additional
 funds have been allocated to extending the percentage
 of the population enjoying piped water and regular
 sanitation service.
