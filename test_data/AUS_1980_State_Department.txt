 AUSTRALIA
 Australia is a parliamentary democracy committed to the
 principles of freedom, justice, and rights of the
 individual. Political, economic, and social rights are
 guaranteed under the Australian constitution, legislation
 and common law. Australia's attitude toward human rights
 is exemplified by its adherence to the International Covenant
 on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights five years ago, and
 its ratification in August 1980 of the International Covenant
 on Civil and Political Rights. Australia has accepted in
 recent years large numbers of Indochinese refugees as well
 as immigrants from Eastern Europe.
 The Federal Racial Discrimination Act of 1975 prohibits
 all forms of racial discrimination based on color, race,
 ethnic background or place of birth. Under the 1975 Act an
 annual report is prepared by the Commissioner for Community
 Relations, an exercise which has proved an effective instru-
 ment for achieving greater equality of opportunity and
 enjoyment of human rights for the entire Australian community.
 A Human Rights Bureau is to be established to assist in
 monitoring observance of the provisions of the covenants
 which comprise the International Bill of Rights. Queensland
 and Western Australia dispute the validity of the Federal
 human rights statute as applied to their states, a consti-
 tutional question which has not yet been fully resolved.
 In addition to acting to eliminate racial discrimination
 at home, Australia has also undertaken a commitment to
 combat racism abroad. For example, Australia has been an
 active member of the United Nations Commission on Human
 Rights and was recently reelected to the Commission.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Torture is neither condoned nor practiced in Australia.
 Protection against torture and cruel treatment derives from
 English common law. Perpetrators would be punishable under
 criminal law governing assault, battery and malicious
 wounding.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Australian law prohibits such punishment and is
 respected in practice. Writs of habeas corpus are available.
 Preventive detention is not practiced.
 c.   Disappearances
 Disappearance is unknown in Australia.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Australian law prohibits such action and is respected
 in practice. The writ of habeas corpus is available to
 ensure that persons cannot be arrested without charges being
 brought against them promptly and to guarantee their right
 to apply to the courts for release pending trial.

 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Australian law guarantees the right to a fair hearing,
 the right to a fair public trial and the unimpeded right of
 counsel; these guarantees are respected in practice. Public
 assistance is available for those unable to pay for legal
 counsel. Defendants are informed in advance of charges
 and have pre-trial access to evidence against them. By law
 defendants are (a) entitled to call and cross-examine
 witnesses and (b) protected against self-incrimination and
 double jeopardy. Australians are protected against ex post
 facto criminal prosecutions. The Australian judiciary is
 independent.
 f.   Invasion of the Home
 Effective legal safeguards exist to prevent arbitrary
 invasion of the home in Australia. No search may be
 conducted without a judicially issued warrant.
 2.   Government  Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 Australia enjoys a high living standard. The country's
 per capita gross domestic product in 1980 approximates $9000.
 Income distribution in Australia is relatively equal; only
 10 per cent of employees earn more than one and a half times
 the average wage. Inflation is running currently at about
 10 per cent, with 6 per cent unemployment.
 Australia has a comprehensive social welfare system,
 which in 1980 was funded by 27.4 percent of the total federal
 budget. Basic food, shelter, health care and social security
 benefits are guaranteed for the entire population, including
 recent immigrants. Public education is universal and free,
 extending through the university level. Special facilities
 for the handicapped are available throughout the educational,
 social, and economic sectors. The general right to own
 private property is protected by law.
 Aboriginal rights and developments are of constant and
 active concern in Australia. Because of deep cultural
 differences between the aboriginal and European populations,
 the Commonwealth government experienced great difficulty
 in pursuing its former policy of assimilation. That policy
 was designed to promote social change among the aboriginals
 so that they would become indistinguishable from other
 Australians in standards of livinq, occupation, and partic-
 ipation in community affairs. By late 1975, government
 policy had changed to one of commitment to the principle that
 aboriginals should be as free as other Australians to
 determine their own varied futures. The Queensland State
 government, however, continues to promote the concept of
 full integration of all indigenous people.
 The government acknowledges that the aboriginal
 population is disadvantaged in such areas as education,
 housing, health and employment. Through the Department
 of Aboriginal Affairs and other federal and state agencies,
 the government has sought to secure for aboriginals access
 to government service equal to that accorded other Australian
 citizens together with additional services appropriate to
 their disadvantaged state. Special programs have been under-
 taken to assist aboriginals in becoming self-sufficient.
 These include encouragement of land ownership, expansion of
 employment opportunities, training programs, support for
 small business acquisition, home ownership and involvement
 in other development projects. These policies are directed
 toward helping the aboriginals to become economically self-
 sufficient while preserving their distinctive culture.

 In 1972 the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration
 Commission ruled that equal wages should be paid to men and
 women in the same occupation. Minimum wages for men and
 women, on an equal basis, were the subject of a 1974 ruling
 by the Commission. Three of Australia's six states have
 enacted legislation to proscribe discrimination on the
 ground of sex in areas including employment, provision of
 goods and services, and accommodation. A fourth state and
 the Australian Capital Territory are considering similar
 legislation. The Department of Home Affairs and Environment
 in the federal government has an Office of Women's Affairs
 which is responsible for promoting women's rights and
 assuring their equality as well as overseeing the imple-
 mentation of all laws and regulations towards these ends.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These basic rights are guaranteed in law and respected
 in practice. Private enterprise plays the dominant role
 in the media and there is no press censorship. Members of
 all religious sects are free to observe their rites without
 governmental interference.
 In Western Australia the Police Act, as amended, requires
 that advance permission be obtained from the Commissioner of
 Police or an authorized officer before a procession or a
 public meeting can be held in a public place. The Commis-
 sioner may not withhold permission unless he has reasonable
 grounds to believe the meeting will peril public safety.
 On only one occasion in 1980 has permission to hold a
 meeting at a specific place been denied. Upon several
 occasions, however, individuals, mostly trade unionists,
 have been arrested and fined for holding meetings without
 obtaining permission in advance.
 In Queensland, laws governing street marches have led
 to confrontation between the police and civil rights activists.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within or out of
 Australia including the right of emigration and repatriation.
 Race is barred as a criterion for approval or rejection of
 application to immigrate to Australia. Australia continues
 to be a major recipient for permanent settlement of Indo-
 chinese refugees, having accepted 41,000 such persons over
 the past five years.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Commonwealth law guarantees this freedom, which is
 respected in practice. Under the Commonwealth Electoral Act
 of 1918 persons 18 years of age and over who have lived in
 Australia for six months continuously and who are British
 subjects (including, of course, Australian citizens) are
 entitled to vote. Complaints have been made that certain
 amendments to state electoral laws of Western Australia have
 the effect of restricting the right of aboriginals to vote.
 These provisions relate to enrollment and voting procedures
 and could be applied in a manner to discourage voting by
 aboriginals and others not fluent in English. In one Western
 Australia electoral district where controversy has developed
 on this issue the sitting government member in the state
 legislature was defeated in the 1980 state election and
 replaced by a part-aboriginal member of the opposition party.

 Women have enjoyed political and civil rights in
 Australia since the turn of the century. Australia has
 participated fully in international fora devoted to women's
 affairs, and was among the first to sign in Copenhaqen the
 United Nations Convention on Elinination of Discrimination
 Against Women. The Australian government established the
 National Women's Advisory Council two years ago and has
 increased steadily funding for social programs benefiting
 women. In Australia's most recent Federal election three
 women were elected to the 125 member lower house, their highest
 such representation in history. Approximately 15 per cent of
 the upper house (the Senate) will be women when newly elected
 senators take their seats in July 1981.
 Australian trade unions are strong, well organized and
 active both in politics and in industrial relations. Nearly
 two thirds of the Australian work force is unionized. The
 rights to organize, strike, bargain collectively and lobby
 are guaranteed in law and exercised in practice (including
 government employees).
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 It is the Government of Australia's policy to respond
 to all communications coming through the United Nations
 Secretary General which allege violations of human rights in
 Australia. On occasion the United Nations Association of
 Australia has espoused human rights cases, to which the
 qovernnent has been responsive. The government has also
 replied to cases raised by the London-based Anti-Slavery
 Society, and the Minority Rights Group, regarding complaints
 by aboriginals. Australia will provide official support for
 convening the Third Assembly of the World Council of
 Indigenous Peoples, to be held in Canberra in April and May
 1981.
 For the first time an Australian aboriginal delegation
 presented a human rights case to the UN Sub-Commission on
 the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities
 in Geneva in September 1980. The dispute focuses on oil
 drilling at a site, which aboriginals deem to be sacred, at
 Noonkanbah in the Kimberley region of Western Australia.
 The Australian government is pledged to assist in the
 equitable resolution of this conflict through negotiation.
 There are a number of organizations in Australia which
 are active, strong, and independent monitors and protectors
 of human rights, including the Australian Chapter of the
 International Commission of Jurists and the Australian Council
 of Civil Libertarians. In addition, the Office of the
 Commonwealth Ombudsman, established in 1977, is empowered
 to investigate complaints concerning administrative actions
 of Commonwealth government departments, statutory bodies and
 other authorities. Whenever maladministration is found to
 occur, the Ombudsman is required to report to the body
 concerned and may include recommendations for remedy. In the
 event of a failure to comply with a recommendation, the
 Ombudsman may report the matter to the Prime Minister and
 Parliament.
