 BURUNDI
 Burundi's first democratically elected Government retained power following an
 October 1993 coup attempt and the assassination of President Melchior Ndadaye,
 an ethnic Hutu. Effective authority was limited, however, since government con-
 fidence in the loyalty of the armed forces remained tenuous and officials hesitated
 to resume full duties, fearing for their personal safety, thus leaving their ministries
 to management by incumbent civil servants of the opposition parties. Several min-
 isters received anonymous death threats.
 The assassinations of President Ndadaye, the President and Vice President of the
 National Assembly, and of other officials exhausted constitutional provisions for
 Presidential succession. In January a coalition consisting of the majority (predomi-
 nantly Hutu) FRODEBU Party, the elected opposition (predominantly Tutsi)
 UPRONA Party, smaller political parties, religious, business, labor, human rights,
 and other civic leaders negotiated an agreement which installed majority party lead-
 er Cyprien Ntaryamira as President. The coalition's selection of Ntaryamira in-
 volved the grant of a number of power-sharing concessions to the opposition parties.
 The National Assembly passed a constitutional amendment allowing the Assembly
 to fill the presidential vacancy.
 On April 6, President Ntaryamira and Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana
 were killed in a suspicious crash of Habyarimana's airplane, which remains under
 investigation. Renewed presidential succession negotiations eventually concluded in
 October with the installation of Acting President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya to serve
 out the remainder of the presidential term running to 1998. These negotiations re-
 quired further power-sharing concessions to the political opposition.
 Security forces consist of the army and gendarmerie under the Ministry of De-
 fense, the judicial police under the Ministry of Justice, and the public security and
 documentation police forces under the Ministry of Interior. The high command of
 the Tutsi-dominated military professed loyalty to the elected Government and neu-
 trality in political negotiations. However, in Bujumbura, it was not until August
 that the military acted quickly and professionally to end civil disturbances involving
 citizens of their own ethnicity. On several other occasions, military forces used ex-
 cessive violence in government-sanctioned operations to disarm civilians, fired on
 unarmed civilians, including women and children, and engaged in burning abuses
 were isolated, uncondoned breaches of discipline and and looting of homes. Military
 authorities insisted these were corrected internally. Neither the armed forces nor
 the Government provided a public accounting of measures taken to punish those re-
 sponsible for these excesses. However, at year's end, according to military sources,
 100 military personnel were in prison facing general court martial for excesses
 against civilians, looting, involvement in the 1993 coup attempt, or other acts of in-
 discipline.
 Burundi is extremely poor and densely populated, with over four-fifths of the pop-
 ulation engaged in subsistence agriculture. The small monetary economy is based
 largely on the export of coffee and tea. The severe disruptions and dislocations stem-
 ming from the October 1993 coup attempt increased the economic misery, as large
 numbers of internally displaced families were unable to produce their own food
 crops and had to depend largely on international humanitarian assistance. The Gov-
 ernment made little progress in its efforts to privatize parastatal enterprises.
 The Burundi security forces and armed civilian groups committed serious human
 rights abuses, which the Government was largely unable to prevent. Perpetrators
 generally went unpunished. The most serious abuses involved actions by the armed
 forces, carried out in a climate of ethnic conflict. Serious incidents of ethnically mo-
 
 
 23
 tivated killing and destruction occurred in the Bujumbura region, where armed
 troops brutally killed armed and unarmed ethnic rivals, including women and the
 elderly. Both Hutu and Tutsi civilians in paramilitary, displaced, or vigilante youth
 groups also committed extrajudicial kilings. The authorities made little or no
 progress in the investigations of extrajudicial killings and have neither tried nor
 punished any of the perpetrators.
 Government efforts to restore security were inadequate and mistrusted by Tutsis,
 particularly those gathered in displaced persons camps. Hutus often justifiably per-
 ceived the military to be the principal threat to their security, rather than its guar-
 antor.
 Members of the armed forces and vigilante groups committed serious human
 rights violations with impunity. The lack of accountability for those responsible for
 the coup attempt, assassinations, and ethnic violence was universally recognized as
 a primary cause of public insecurity. The dysfunctional justice system could not sat-
 isfactorily address this problem due to its own inefficiency, administrative disrup-
 tion, and public perception of its partiality. Legal and societal discrimination
 against women continues to be a serious problem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-In addition to extrajudicial killings
 by the armed forces, armed groups perpetrated unlawful, politically and ethnically
 motivated killings of that group's ethnic counterpart or political opponent. The
 armed forces frequently committed abuses in government-approved operations to
 disarm civilians.
 On March 1 soldiers attacked and killed 25 civilians, including women and the
 elderly, in the Kanyosha quarter south of the capital, according to resident wit-
 nesses who fled the attack. Soldiers also brutally killed 13 people taken into custody
 after they responded to military appeals for noncombatants to depart Kamenge.
 Their bodies were discovered discarded on the outskirts of Bujumbura, bearing bay-
 onet wounds. Some had crushed skulls.
 On May 9 troops in pursuit of armed civilians killed 52 unarmed civilian residents
 in the nearby Gashorora region of rural Bujumbura province. Military authorities
 said they did not condone these abuses and therefore punished the perpetrators, but
 specific information about those arrested was not available. At the end of the year,
 no trials had begun.
 In July, military forces removed approximately 30 male refugees from a U.N.
 High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) transit point in Kabarore, Ngozi prov-
 ince, without prior notification to UNHCR. The group never returned and a mass
 grave for a similar number of persons was found across the provincial border.
 Also in July, men in military uniforms gathered approximately 45 refugees, most-
 ly women and children, into a deserted church in Cendajeru, Ngozi, threw a grenade
 into the church and fired on those who survived the blast. The identity of the
 attackers is not known. These incidents received considerable international media
 attention.
 Huta and Tutsi paramilitary and vigilante youth groups; in territorial conflict,
 stoned, beat, and stabbed to death members of the opposing ethnic group in
 Bujumbura. Gangs also waylaid buses, removing and killing passengers of opposite
 ethnicity. Buses later restricted their routes to communities of the driver's ethnicity.
 This reduced, but did not entirely eliminate, the attacks. In March a group of armed
 civilians in Kamenge abducted and killed an army officer. During August 7 and 8,
 an extremist Tutsi political leader incited Tutsi youth to create civil violence which
 included the murder of 11 people. Authorities failed to identify and prosecute the
 perpetrators.
 In June, according to UNHCR reports, civilians-with some degree of complicity
 by unidentified military forces-separated about 100 Rwandan Hutu refugees from
 their families near Kiri, in Kirundo province, removed them to another location, and
 killed them. Local military authorities obstructed investigation of a mass grave of
 approximately 100 bodies which was subsequently discovered near the site of the
 killings. One civilian was arrested; his case is currently under investigation. Three
 other suspects fled to Rwanda before being arrested.
 In two incidents during August and September, assailants threw grenades into
 the Bujumbura central market, killing and injuring several people. Police made ar-
 rests in both incidents but later released the suspects due to a lack of witnesses who
 were willing to testify. It was not clear whether the attacks were politically, person-
 ally, or criminally motivated. Increasingly in Bujumbura, all three elements, in
 varying degrees, motivated individual incidents of violence.
 
 
 24
 In August gunmen attacked the Catholic Bishop of Muyinga at the altar while
 celebrating mass. When members of the congregation and clergy fled the church to
 the market, attackers armed with machetes killed 123; the Bishop escaped. One sol-
 dier was arrested and his case remains under investigation.
 A Hutu National Assembly member was shot in Bujumbura. Both Hutus and
 Tutsis have been accused of his murder, although an investigation in progress at
 the end of the year has yielded no suspects. Eight communal administrators, most
 of whom were Hutus, were killed in 1994. All eight murders were presumed to be
 politically motivated and investigations were pending. Police have made arrests in
 some but not all of these cases. Hutu governors in Buaa and Kirundo were killed
 in political or ethnic attacks. Police killed one attacker in Kirundo. No arrest has
 been made in the Bubanza investigation. Investigations are also pending in the po-
 litically or ethnically motivated cases of an expatriate UNHCR field officer killed-in
 an apparent attack on another Hutu communal administrator, attacks on a Hutu
 (wounded) and a Tutsi (unharmed) National Assembly member, and attacks on two
 more governors and several communal administrators, some of whom were wounded
 but who survived their attacks.
 b. Disappearance.-During separate incidents in August and September, six
 Tutsis, on legitimate business in the Kamenge quarter, disappeared and are pre-
 sumed dead. Government investigations failed to identify the perpetrators of the vio-
 lence since most witnesses either sympathize with the abductors or fear reprisals.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits these abuses but they occur in practice. Perpetrators of
 ethnic violence severely wounded women and children, using spears and machetes.
 Allegations of torture in prison made in May and June by international human
 rights organizations on behalf of several individuals charged with participation in
 ethnic violence were not substantiated. These charges were not made by the pris-
 oners, some of whom did, however, report brutal mstreatment by civilian arresting
 forces before raching the prison. While the overnent claims that it does not con-
 done such treatment, the authorities made no serious effort to address the problem.
 Prison conditions were life-threatening and characterized by severe overcrowding
 and inadequate hygiene, clothing, medical care, food, and water. Four or even five
 persons were forced to share a poorly ventilated cell 2 meters  are. Prisoners had
 to rely on family members to ensure an adequate diet, and ofiials acknowledged
 that digestive illness was a major problem among the prisoners. Women were held
 separately from men. At least one prison death occurred, due to poor health condi-
 tions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Presiding magistrates are authorized to
 issue arrest warrants. Regular police and gendarmes can make arrests without a
 warrant but must submit a written report to a magistrate within 48 hours of the
 detention. The magistrate can order the suspect released or confirm the charges and
 continue detention, initially for 15 days, then subsequently for periods of 30 days
 as necessary to prepare the case for trial. The law aows unlimited pretrial deten-
 tion; 6 to 12 months is a typical period, although less complex cases are dispatched
 more quickly. The police are obligated to follow the same laws but have detained
 peqple for many months without having their cases certified and forwarded to the
 Ministry of Justice as required. Bail is permitted in some cases. Incommunicado de-
 tention reportedly exists, although the law prohibits it.
 Authorities generally followed legal procedures in criminal cases, although they
 often exceeded the time limits prescribed by law. The lack of a well-trained and ade-
 quately supported judiciary constrains expeditious proceedings. The disruption of
 The polit ical process and the general level of insecurity within the country have se-
 verely impeded the judicial process, delaying a majority of criminal trials.
 A National Inquiry Commission with arrest authority was established to inves-
 tigate responsibility for the October 1993 coup attempt and subsequent violence. In
 May it began to make arrests. At year's end, the Ministry of Justice reported over
 800 persons (including military personnel) were in custody for crimes related to the
 coup attempt and assassinations or the ensuing violence and reprisals. (Military au-
 thorities confirm 14 military personnel in prison facing court martial charges relat-
 ed to the coup attempt.) Those arrested could not be tried and remain in custody
 since a fully empowered President, authorized to panel a criminal grand jury, was
 not installed until October and had not yet addressed judicial questions at year's
 end. Police hold all detainees on criminal charges, though several arrested in con-
 nection with ethnic violence claimed they were being held for their political convic-
 tions rather than involvement in violent acts. Pretrial detainees constitute about 75
 percent of the prison population of approximately 3,500 inmates.
 The Constitution prohibits politica exile and the Government did not use forced
 exile as a means of political control.
 
 
 25
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judicial system was severely disrupted as a
 result of the October 1993 coup attempt and the repeated presidential succession
 negotiations throughout 1994. When operating normally the judicial system is di-
 vided into civil ana criminal courts, with the Supreme &ourt at the apex. Military
 courts have jurisdiction over crimes committed by members of the military or those
 involving actions against the military. The Constitution provides for a High Court
 to try the President, Prime Minister, or the President of the National Assembly, and
 a Constitutional Court to review all new laws (including decree-laws) and constitu-
 tional issues.
 Citizens do not have regular access to civilian and military court proceedings, al-
 though trials are ostensibly public. Although defendants have a right to counsel and
 to defend themselves, few have legal representation in practice.
 The Constitution provides for an independent judiciary, but in practice, it is domi-
 nated by the Tutsi ethnic group. The President's authority to appoint judges and
 to pardon or reduce sentences was limited by constitutiona amend nt in Septem-
 ber during presidential succession negotiations. Most Burundians assume the courts
 still promote the interests of the dominant Tutsi minority.
 Besides the frequent lack of counsel for the accused, other major shortcomings in
 the legal system include: the lack of adequate resources, trained personnel, and an
 outmoded Legal Code. Legal Code revisions begun in 1993 continued at a slowed
 pace and had not yet been submitted for approval at year's end.
 Since President Ndadaye's 1993 amnesty decree, there have been no clearly iden-
 tifiable political prisoners in Burundi. However, police bring charges of involvement
 in violent crimes or disturbance of the peace against detainees in connection with
 political issues.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the right to privacy and the authorities generally respect
 the law requiring search warrants. Security forces can monitor telephones and are
 commonly assumed to do so.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Burundi's ethnic conflict did not erupt into civil war, but incidents of ethnic
 violence continued to plague the country. Ethnic violence resulted in 7 out of
 Bujumbura's 11 residential districts being largely segregated along ethnic lines be-
 tween January and May. Tutsis burned and looted Hutu homes in the Ngagara,
 Nyakabiga, Musaga, and Cibitoke quarters. Hutus responded in kind in Kamenge,
 Kinama and Kanyosha. In both cases, fleeing individuals were often killed.
 Credible witnesses alleged that troops pursuing armed Hutu militants killed un-
 armed civilians, including women and children, in rural Bujumbura, Muramvya,
 Gitega and Kayanza provinces. In two major operations in the Kamenge suburb of
 Bujumbura in March and September, soldiers in each foray shot and bayoneted
 more than 200 unarmed civilians, including women and children.
 Elements within the civilian intelligence organization provided arms and encour-
 agement to armed Hutu militants attacking military patrols and stationary outposts
 in the interior and in Bujumbura. Hutus in the interior frequently attacked small
 numbers of displaced Tutsis as they attempted to return to their homes. Military
 troops on legitimate disarmament operations frequently targeted noncombatants or
 destroyed homes or markets without authorization or provocation. Displaced Tutis,
 often with the help of members of the military or armed Tutsis from the capital,
 attacked futus and burned homes in tern, maintaining a cycle of retribution. Wit-
 nesses report over 800 deaths from ethnic violence in Muyinga province alone.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for the right to free
 opinion and expression so long as these rights are expressed "in a manner consist-
 ent with the public law and order." In practice, these rights are circumscribed by
 the Government's unrestrained exercise of this proviso. The 1992 Press Law, not en-
 forced until December 1993, restricts criticism of government policies, the person of
 the President, and statements which the authorities, at their discretion, could con-
 strue as contrary to national unity or injurious to the national economy. The law
 also provides for government review and possible censorship of all media prior to
 distribution. In practice, private newspapers were published without prior govern-
 ment review and no cases of seizure were recorded.
 Twenty-five newspapers appear regularly, in addition to the government-owned
 French-language daily Le Renouveau. There are 13 weekly and 3 monthly French-
 language newspapers; the remainder are Kirundi-language publications, but jour-
 nalistic standards are low and most papers were simply political party newsletters.
 Others were consistent and energetic organs of ethnic hatred. No newspaper was
 banned or suppressed.
 
 
 26
 In August an undetermined source threatened and harassed three senior editors
 of La Semaine, the most independent of the French-language newspapers, as they
 were researching a report on the military. They fled the country.
 Most citizens relied on the government-controlled radio Irgramming in French
 Kirundi, and Swahili for information. Newspaper readers 'p, however remained
 limited. Burundi's two government-owned radio stations (one broadcasting in
 Kirundi, the other in French, Swahili, and English) allowed political parties equal
 broadcasting opportunities in rotation. Some opposition parties complained that this
 arrangement provided insufficient access. In 1994, clandestine radio messages, origi-
 nating from unknown sources, were used to incite ethnic hatred.
 Academic freedom has not been tested. The Civil Code does not address academic
 freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-A 1991 decree-law established
 guidelines for granting permits for public meetings or parades. The Government
 granted opposition parties permits for several public rallies and demonstrations, but
 it occasionally denied this permission when it alleged that the lead time was insuffi-
 cient to arrange adequate security; most meetings were subsequently rescheduled.
 Since the June 1993 elections, there have been no reports of government harass-
 ment or bureaucratic obstacles to the formation of associations in rural areas. How-
 ever, rural residents other than those gathered in displaced camps were not inclined
 to form associations for reasons of general security.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is no state religion and the Government made no
 attempt to restrict freedom of worship by adherents of any religion. However, ethnic
 alignments by religious affiliation led to polarization, violence, and to mutual at-
 tacks on one another's churches by representatives of the Catholic majority and of
 various Protestant denominations.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel, Immigration, and Re-
 patriation.-In general, the Government made no attempt to restrict citizens' travel
 for political reasons, either internally or abroad. However, in one incident, officials
 of the Tutsi-dminatd Burundi immigration office denied exit to 23 Hutu students
 traveling on government scholarships to Bangui, on the grounds that the majority
 FRODEBU Party was sending the youths for paramilitary training. The immigra-
 tion office p resented no evidence for the claim but nonetheless prevented the stu-
 dents frmpleaving the country.
 Burundi now faces repatriation of several hundred thousand indigent Hutu refu-
 gees who fled after the presidential assassination and 1993 cou  attempt, as well
 as the continued repatriation of refugees from 1972 and 1991.  addition, nearly
 600,000 internally displaced persons remain in camps or dispersed in the hills. In
 April and May approximately 90,000 Tutsi refugees entered freely from Rwanda. In
 June violence in Rwanda drove Hutu refugees into Burundi and the UNHCR re-
 ported several incidents of Tutsi attacks on Hutu refugees. The Government made
 tentative efforts to resettle repatriating refugees on a voluntary basis.
 By October most Tutsi refugees had returned to Rwanda, while approximately
 216,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees remained in Burundi at year's end.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides for free, multiparty elections by secret ballot, with a 5-
 year term of office for both the President and members of the National Assembly.
 The October 1993 assassination of the elected President, National Assembly Presi-
 dent, and National Assembly Vice President exhausted constitutional provisions for
 presidential succession. Since security conditions precluded new elections, negotia-
 tions, which included a broad spectrum of political parties and other civic organiza-
 tions, were held, resulting in the formation of a coalition Government.
 There are no legal restrictions on the participation of women or indigenous peo-
 ples in elections or politics, although in practice, both groups are underrepresented.
 women currently hold 2 of 22 Cabinet ministries and 9 of 81 National Assembly
 seats. Though the Twa (approximately 1 percent of the population) voted in the
 1993 elections, none ran for office nor participated actively in the political process.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigations of Alleged Violations of Human Rihts
 Private citizens harassed and threatened members of one independent human
 rights group, Iteka, who left the country after receiving threats on their lives. Local
 human rights groups received varying degrees of cooperation from government min-
 istries.
 At the Government's reqeat, a group of international human rights organizations
 conducted an inquiry in January into responsibility for the October 1993 coup at-
 
 
 27
 tempt and subsequent massacres. The report, published in July, indicated extensive
 military and civilian complicity in the coup attempt and excessive and unnecessary
 use of force by the army and police. The report also concluded that some local
 FRODEBU government administrators participated in or incited the ensuing vio-
 lence against Tutsis and UPRONA Hutus in the provinces, but found no evidence
 of an organized FRODEBU plan of massacre at a national level. The military and
 the political opposition immediately dismissed the report as biased, inaccurate, and
 incomplete.
 Other human rights groups including Amnesty International sent delegations as
 well. Physicians for Human Rights reported resistance from local military authori-
 ties when visiting the site of a mass grave suspected to be that of the refugees mur-
 dered June 11 in Kirundo province. Local military officers prevented Physicians for
 Human Rights and other observers from examining the grave site and discouraged
 local residents from speaking with the group.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross reported good cooperation from
 government authorities in its prison visits.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution explicitly provides equal status and protection for all citizens,
 without distinction based on sex, origin, ethnicity, religion or opinion.
 Women.-Women hold a secondary place in society and face both legal and soci-
 etal discrimination. Explicitly discriminatory inheritance laws and discriminatory fi-
 nancial credit practices remain unchanged. Although women by law must receive
 the same pay as men for the same jobs, women are far less likely to hold any mid-
 or high-level positions. In rural areas, women traditionally perform hard farm work
 and have far less opportunity for education than men enjoy.
 Violence against women occurs, but there is no documentation of its extent. Wives
 have the right to bring physical abuse charges against their husbands. In practice
 this rarely occurs. Police o not normally intervene in domestic disputes, and the
 press does not report incidents of violence against women, including rape. There
 were no known court cases dealing with abuse of women.
 Children.-The Government has taken no action to protect children's rights, nor
 has it addressed the growing problem of the increasing population of orphans which
 resulted from the violence of 1993 and 1994.
 Indigenous People.-The indigenous Twa (Pygmy) minority remained almost com-
 pletely marginalized, economically, socially, and politically. Most Twa continued to
 live in isolation, uneducated, and without access to government services, including
 health care. The Twa voted in the 1993 election, but are otherwise outside the politi-
 cal process.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-lBurundi's fundamental problem continues to
 be ethnic conflict between majority Hutus, who gained political power only with the
 election of Ndadaye, and minority Tutsis, who have historically held power and still
 control the military and dominate educated society. De facto ethnic discrimination
 against Hutus-85 percent of the population--colors every facet of society and insti-
 tutions, including the military and the judicial establishment, despite constitutional
 provisions and some policies introduced under the Buyoya military administration
 to attract Hutus into the professions.
 The Ndadaye administration upon assuming office began a more concerted effort
 to put its FRODEBU faithful into the government bureaucracy. Those policy
 changes quickly led to increased tensions between long-term Tutsi professionals and
 the FROD EBU Government.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government has not enacted legislation or other-
 wise mandated access to buildings or government services for people with disabil-
 ities. Burundi's rudimentary economy effectively excludes the physically disabled
 from many types of employment.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and the Labor Code nominally pro-
 tect the rights of workers to form unions, though the military, the gendarmerie and
 certain expatriates working in the public sector are prohibited from union participa-
 tion. Most workers are urban civil servants.
 Since its independence from the Government in 1992 the national umbrella trade
 union organization, the Organization of Free Unions ofBurundi (CSB), has been fi-
 nancially dependent on a system of voluntary checkoffs, as are local unions. The
 CSB represented labor in drafting negotiations for the revised Labor Code and has
 participated in collective bargaining negotiations in cooperation with individual
 labor unions. The CSB includes all labor unions except the teachers' union and is
 
 
 the only existing labor federation. The Labor Code permits the formation of addi-
 tional unions or confederations outside the CSB.
 Unions are able to affiliate with international organizations. The Labor Code also
 provides workers with the right to strike. Restrictions on the right to strike and
 lockout are several: that the action must be taken only after exhausting all other
 peaceful means of resolution; that negotiations must continue during the action, me-
 diated by a mutually agreeable party or by the Government; and that 6 days' notice
 must be given. The law prohibits retribution against workers participating in a legal
 strike and this is upheld in practice.
 In September the Labor Court decided in favor of workers in the national data
 processing center strike, in process since October 1993. In the year's only other
 strike, teachers in several regions of the country struck briefly, and successfully, in
 September over their inability to claim assets from an obligatory savings program.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code recognizes
 the right to collective bargaining, which had formerly been acknowledged only by
 ordinance. Since most workers are civil servants, government entities are involved
 in almost every phase of labor negotiations. Public sector wages are set in fixed
 scales in individual work contracts and are not affected by collective bargaining. In
 the private sector, wage scales also exist but individual contract negotiation is pos-
 sible. In principle, private sector wage scales can also be influenced by collective
 bargaining, although this is infrequent.
 The Labor Code also gives the Labor Court jurisdiction over all labor dispute
 cases, including those involving public employees. Labor negotiations are still con-
 ducted largely between unions and employers under the supervision of the tripartite
 National Labor Council, the Government's highest consultative authority on labor
 issues. The Council represents government, labor, and management and is presided
 over and regulated by the Minister of Labor.
 The Labor Code prohibits employers from firing or otherwise discriminating
 against a worker because of union affiliation or activity. This right is upheld in
 practice.
 There are no export processing zones, although a decree-law making the entire
 country a free zone for many nontraditional, expert-oriented activities was promul-
 gated in 1992.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor and it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code states that chil-
 dren under the age of 16 are not allowed to be employed by "an enterprise" even
 as apprentices, although it also states that they may undertake occasional work
 which does not damage their health or schooling. In practice, young children do
 heavy manual labor in rural areas in daytime during the school year, including
 transporting bricks on their heads. Children are legally prohibited from working at
 night, although many do so in the informal sector. Children are obligated by custom
 and economic necessity to help support their families by participating in activities
 related to subsistence agriculture in family-based enterprises and the informal sec-
 tor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The formal minimum wage for unskilled work-
 ers is $0.58 (140 Burundi francs) per day in Bujumbura and Gitega and $0.37 (88
 Burundi francs) in the rest of the country, with a graduated scale for greater skill
 levels. This amount does not allow a family to maintain a decent standard of living
 and most families rely on second incomes and subsistence agriculture to do so. Em-
 ployees working under a contract, particularly in urban areas, generally earn sig-
 nificantly more than the minimum wage. All employees in the public sector work
 under contract. The CSB estimates that 70 percent of employees working in the for-
 mal private sector are covered by a contract.
 The Labor Code imposes a maximum 8-hour workday and 45-hour workweek ex-
 cept in cases when workers are involved in activities related to national security.
 Supplements must be paid for overtime in any case. The Labor Code establishes
 health and safety standards requiring an employer to provide a safe workplace and
 assigns enforcement responsibility to the Ministry of Labor. However, the Ministry
 does not enforce the Code effectively. Health and safety articles in the Labor "Code
 do not directly address the workers' right to remove themselves from a dangerous
 work situation.
