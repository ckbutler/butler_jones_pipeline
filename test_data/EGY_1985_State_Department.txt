 EGYPT
 Egypt is a republic in which the President and his party, the
 National Democratic Party (NDP), are the major political
 forces. The NDP commands a large majority in Parliament, but
 opposition parties play an important role. The Cabinet is
 headed by a Prime Minister responsible to the President. The
 parliamentary institutions are the People's Assembly and the
 Shura (consultative) Council.
 Vice President under Sadat, Hosni Mubarak was elected President
 in 1981, following Sadat's assassination. The NDP retained its
 majority in the hard-fought People's Assembly elections in May
 1984. One of the five opposition parties also won seats;
 another, although failing to qualify at the polls, was
 subsequently awarded several seats through discretionary
 presidential appointment. The governmental and legal systems
 are based on Egypt's Muslim and Arab heritage, as well as the
 experience of the 1952 revolution. Western influences are also
 present, reflected in the country's Napoleonic legal code.
 The state of emergency proclaimed after Sadat's assassination
 has been maintained through extensions decreed by President
 Mubarak, with the approval of the People's Assembly. Under it,
 the President and designated officials can suspend certain
 constitutional and legal safeguards normally associated with
 the protection of civil and political liberties. The
 Government has used its emergency powers sparingly, but
 evidence suggests that they were invoked in July 1985 to detain
 radical Islamic figures.
 The Government has permitted Islamic militants to pursue their
 cause through such legitimate channels as the People's
 Assembly, the judiciary, and the press. Proponents of the full
 implementation of Islamic law, for example, aired their views
 extensively in the press and, to some extent, in an assembly
 debate last May. Muslim fundamentalists have also gone to
 court on various occasions over Islamic-law issues. At the
 same time, the authorities have cracked down on activities seen
 as threatening public order and security. In June, the
 Government banned Sheikh Hafez Salaama's proposed "green march"
 in support of Islamic law and subsequently took over mosques
 suspected of being centers of radical, antigovernment activity.
 The Government has given priority to economic development and
 liberalization while continuing its policy of trying to
 safeguard living standards in the face of worldwide
 inflationary pressures. The primary vehicle for this policy
 has been a massive subsidy system that, in fiscal year 1984/85,
 cost about $2.4 billion--ll percent of total government
 expenditures.
 Egypt's human rights record in 1985 reflected the steady
 progress toward political liberalization achieved under
 Mubarak's leadership, although government restrictions on
 certain political activities and the expression of dissent
 remained. Some members of the Christian minority are concerned
 over the potential threat to their rights posed by resurgent
 Islamic forces, but the Government has generally demonstrated
 its commitment to protecting minority rights. Coptic Pope
 Shenouda III has performed his papal functions without official
 interference following the President's decree on January 1,
 1985 restoring his full papal authority. However, there were
 reports that legal action continued against 39 members of the
 
 
 1207
 EGYPT
 Baha'i faith who had been detained in February and subsequently
 released. The action against them apparently stemmed from some
 Muslims' conviction that the Baha'is are apostates of Islam.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 With the exception of one terrorist assassination, there were
 no political killings in 1985. In August an Israeli diplomat
 was killed in Cairo. An unknown group calling itself "Egypt's
 Revolution" claimed responsibility, as it had for an earlier,
 unsuccessful assassination attempt in 1984 against another
 Israeli diplomat. As of January 1986, the case remained
 unsolved, but the investigation was continuing. "Egypt's
 Revolution" also claimed credit for the hijacking to Malta of
 an Egypt Air jet in November which resulted in the death of
 over 60 passengers;
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known disappearances in 1985.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment are forbidden by the Constitution and by law.
 Persons claiming to have been tortured have redress in the
 courts, which have awarded financial compensation to various
 torture victims. Information gained through torture is not
 admissible in court. The law provides that police and security
 officials convicted of torture are subject to imprisonment and
 lesser sanctions, but known cases of officials being penalized
 are rare. On occasion, detainees and prisoners have claimed
 they were tortured and have appealed for redress to the courts
 or to the public prosecutor. These appeals, which generally
 lead to investigations by legal and medical authorities,
 sometimes end with the Government's denial of the alleged
 torture. More often, the Government fails to reveal the
 findings of investigations.
 In November 1984 the public prosecutor initiated a major
 investigation of torture incidents revealed by the Supreme
 State Security Court in the Ai-Jihad case that ended in
 September 1983. The court had cited torture as a factor in its
 decision to acquit 190 out of 300 Al-Jihad defendants and
 reduce prison sentences for others. According to the
 opposition press, former Interior ministers and still active
 senior police officers were among the numerous security
 officials suspected of involvement in the torture. The results
 of the investigation had not been announced by year's end.
 Torture allegations continue to surface periodically in the
 opposition press. In March, for example, the Socialist Labor
 Party's publication, Ash-Shaab, mentioned a hunger strike by 17
 students protesting police beatings while in detention for
 questioning, and there were several other such reports during
 the year. In August riots broke out in the Delta town of Fawa,
 
 
 1208
 EGYPT
 sparked by the death of a local resident while in police
 custody. The authorities attributed the death to natural
 causes, while the opposition press accused police officers of
 beating the detainee to death. In October, the New Wafd
 Party's weekly, Al-Wafd, reported that two policemen were being
 held for questioning in connection with the incident.
 In its 1985 worldwide survey, Amnesty International noted that
 it had not received any substantiated reports of torture in
 1984. In its separate report "Torture in Egypt 1981-1983,"
 published in August 1985, Amnesty International reviewed
 medical authorities' forensic records on torture victims for
 that period and found a "disturbing and consistent pattern of
 torture or ill-treatment of political detainees," including
 Islamic militants linked to the Al-Jihad organization; and some
 left-wing elements. The report mentioned Cairo's Citadel
 prison as a reputed site'of torture activities. This prison
 was subsequently closed.
 During the year there were several reports in the opposition
 press of hunger strikes by convicted Al-Jihad members in
 protest over mistreatment by prison authorities. There was
 also evidence that prison guards beat inmates and struck them
 with rifle butts to discipline them. Prisons vary as to living
 conditions and treatment; some facilities appear to be
 overcrowded and lacking adequate medical and sanitary
 facilities. Others, however, have better living conditions and
 programs for inmates' recreation and vocational training.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arbitrary arrest, detention, and exile are forbidden by law.
 As a rule, arrests follow investigations, and arrested persons
 are charged with violations of specific laws. With some
 exceptions, preventive detention is not practiced. Arrested
 persons have the right to a judicial determination of the
 legality of detention and there is a system of bail. The law
 states that a detained suspect must be brought before a
 magistrate and formally charged within 48 hours of his arrest
 or else be released. By and large, there is careful observance
 of constitutional and legal safeguards of due process in the
 arrest and pretrial custody stages. Arrests occur openly and
 with warrants, and the accused are brought before an
 independent judiciary. The Government does not appear to
 practice incommunicado detention.
 Exceptions to these arrest and detention procedures exist under
 the state of emergency provisions. The Constitution and the
 Emergency Law of 1958, as amended, empower the President, when
 security or public order are in peril, to invoke emergency
 powers authorizing the arrest and detention of persons.
 suspected of being dangerous to state security, irrespective of
 provisions of the penal code. Under the emergency law a person
 may be held without charge for renewable 30-day periods, up to
 6 months. After each 30-day interval, the detainee is allowed
 to petition the state security courts for release. If the
 court approves the petition, the President may exercise a
 one-time veto over the decision, keeping the detainee in
 custody for another 30 days. In the past few years, the
 emergency powers of ariest and detention have been
 circumscribed, and detainees have been accorded greater rights
 
 
 1209
 EGYPT
 of appeal, as well as prompt redress, including judicial
 review, against improper treatment.
 By the beginning of 1985 all those arrested under the emergency
 law in 1981 had been released, except for the 100 or so Islamic
 extremists serving prison sentences handed down in the Al-Jihad
 trial that ended in September 1984. According to press
 reports, the emergency law was invoked occasionally in 1985
 against members of banned leftist organizations and suspected
 Islamic extremists, including some former Al-Jihad defendants.
 In July, the Government arrested several groups of radical
 Islamic activists totaling 46 persons, among them Sheikh Hafez
 Salaama and former Al-Jihad defendant Sheikh Omar Abdel
 Rahman. By mid-August most detainees had been released.
 Subsequently, the Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported the
 Supreme State Security Court's decision to free Abdel Rahman
 and 12 other persons, apparently the last of the July detainees
 still under arrest. It remains unclear whether formal charges
 were filed against the 46 detainees; the authorities spoke of
 "investigating" them for various offenses but have not stated
 whether arraignment and trial proceedings were carried out.
 The number of detainees currently being held under the
 emergency law is probably 20 to 30, based on press reports and
 other sources.
 There have been no reports of the use of forced labor, which is
 legally prohibited.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Egyptian law provides for public trial and equal treatment
 before the law, and these legal safeguards appear to be
 observed. Persons accused of espionage, plotting to overthrow
 the State or similar crimes, however, are tried in state
 security courts, sometimes in closed session. These courts
 handled the al-Jihad trials, at which all defendants were
 present and represented by lawyers actively defending them.
 Civilians arrested for certain crimes may be tried in military
 tribunals as well as state security courts. A military
 tribunal conducted the trial of civilian Soliman Khatr, the
 border policeman charged with the shooting deaths of seven
 Israeli tourists and wounding two others in the Sinai in
 October. The jurisdiction of the military court was challenged
 by the defense, but an administrative court ruled that the
 emergency law allowed the President to give jurisdiction to the
 military courts. On December 28, Khatr, who was represented by
 civilian lawyers, was convicted and sentenced to life
 imprisonment at hard labor. On January 7, 1986, Khatr was
 found hanged in his prison hospital room, an apparent suicide.
 There are no public statistics on the number of persons serving
 prison sentences (as opposed to detainees on trial or awaiting
 prosecution) for acts of violent protest or membership in
 proscribed organizations espousing terrorism or the violent
 overthrow of the State. However, based on the convictions in
 Al-Jihad proceedings plus reports of trials in the opposition
 press, their number may reach 150 to 200. The conviction and
 sentencing of "prisoners of conscience" or other nonviolent
 dissenters appear to occur rarely, if at all. The emergency
 law provides ample authority to detain people believed to be
 planning violent acts against the Government.
 The judiciary enjoys an unprecedented degree of independence.
 In 1984, the Government sponsored legislation that extended
 
 
 1210
 EGYPT
 judicial immunity to members of the office responsible for
 investigating and prosecuting police charges against suspects.
 The effect of this immunity is to protect such officials from
 police pressures during investigations. Also in. 1984, the
 People's Assembly, at President Mubarak's initiative,
 reinstituted the High Judicial Council, which Nasser had
 dissolved. The Council is empowered to override decisions by
 the Ministry of Justice regarding judicial appointments,
 promotions, and other personnel matters. In 1984 the law
 concerning the Council of State, a court system having
 jurisdiction over disputes between private citizens and
 government agencies, was amended to separate the Council from
 the Ministry of Justice and to establish safeguards against
 arbitrary dismissal of council members.
 In 1985, the courts demonstrated their autonomy. In April,
 they ruled that it is illegal to dismiss an employee solely
 because of his political views; dismissal is warranted only if
 the employee has violated the law. In August, authorities
 released Sheikh Hafez Salaama from detention after the state
 security courts ordered them to do so; the Government chose not
 to challenge the court's action.
 Two judicial institutions criticized by the opposition and
 others as superfluous and potentially dangerous to the judicial
 system are the Court of Ethics and its investigating agency,
 the Office of the Socialist Public Prosecutor. Created in
 1980, the Court is charged with trying offenders of "socialist
 values." In 1985 the Court focused primarily on cases of
 corruption and illegal business activities, in contrast to its
 use by Sadat to prosecute opponents of the Government. The
 Office of the Socialist Public Prosecutor functions as
 investigator and prosecutor for the Court of Ethics. Its other
 tasks include approving candidates for elective positions in
 the trade union movement and performing security checks on
 appointees to senior government positions.
 Article 2 of the Constitution states that Islamic jurisprudence
 is the principal source of law. However, the literal
 application of Islamic law is limited to the so-called Family
 Status Courts, which have jurisdiction over such matters as
 divorce and inheritance for Muslims. In addition to Islamic
 law, these courts apply the codes of other religions in family
 matters if the parties are non-Muslim. In May 1985, the
 People's Assembly debated proposals for the implementation of
 the Shari'a (Islamic law). By a large majority, the Assembly
 voted to conduct a law-by-law review of. all statutes in order
 to change those conflicting with Islamic law. The review
 process is expected to require years to complete.
 The judiciary also issued an important decision in May in the
 area of Islamic law. The preeminent Islamic institution,
 Al-Azhar University, had challenged civil code statutes
 permitting commercial interest payments, arguing that interest
 constitutes usury under Islamic law and should be prohibited
 under Article 2 of the Constitution. In ruling against
 Al-Azhar, the High Constitutional Court stated that Article 2
 cannot be applied retroactively, thereby apparently
 establishing the principle that the constitutional provision
 for the primacy of Islamic jurisprudence does not supersede the
 body of law predating the Constitution and still in effect.
 
 
 1211
 EGYPT
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Freedom from arbitrary interference by the State or by
 political organizations in private life is guaranteed by the
 Constitution. The Government does not appear to interfere,
 except where actual crimes are involved or where the State
 believes there is evidence that persons may be engaging in
 potentially violent political activity. Except as allowed by
 the emergency law, police must obtain a warrant from the State
 Security Prosecutor before undertaking arrests, searches, or
 seizures. The warrant need not specify the material being
 sought in a search, and the material seized can be presented as
 evidence during trials. On occasion, the courts have dismissed
 cases when they considered that warrants were issued without
 sufficient cause. Police officials who conduct searches
 without proper warrant are subject to criminal penalties, but
 there were no reports of officials being so penalized in 1985.
 Monitoring of correspondence or telephones does not appear to
 take place without the legally required authorization
 beforehand from the State Security Prosecutor.
 The emergency law empowers the President to authorize searches
 of individuals or premises without regard for the code of penal
 procedure. Since the aftermath of Sadat's assassination in
 1981, there have been a few reports in the opposition press of
 warrantless searches being conducted in connection with
 investigations of extremist organizations, both Islamic and
 leftist. The Government has not confirmed any of these
 reports, but some of them appear factual. Also there have been
 several reports by opposition papers that their premises were
 entered and searched by unknown persons after working hours.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and of the
 press. The Government's respect for these freedoms is
 reflected in the debate of national issues and criticism of
 government officials in the media. Much debate appears in the
 so-called "national press"--the major government-owned dailies
 and news magazines--but the weekly opposition party newspapers
 and publications of Islamic groups are especially critical.
 Although the emergency law can be used to ban publications, the
 Government has not invoked it for this purpose.
 There is a widely held view, which extends to opposition
 circles, that the Egyptian press has never been freer.
 Nonetheless, the Government occasionally exercises influence on
 the national press, whose editors-in-chief are appointed and
 can be dismissed by the NDP-dominated Shura Council, the upper
 chamber of the Parliament, which has responsibility for press
 supervision. The Council theoretically exercises its
 supervision through the Government's ownership of.major
 nonparty newspapers and magazines and through its role in the
 Higher Press Council. The latter, a 45-member body chaired by
 the Speaker of the Shura Council and composed of senior press
 figures, is not designed to serve as a vehicle for imposing
 press censorship, nor does it appear to be a very active body.
 One of the Higher Press Council's functions, though, is to
 approve applications for new publications; on a few occasions
 applications to publish independently owned journals have been
 
 
 1212
 EGYPT
 rejected or delayed for lengthy periods. This approval,
 however, is required only for publications appearing regularly
 on a set schedule. Items appearing irregularly are published
 without the Council's certification.
 Overt censorship does not exist, but journalists and editors
 working for government-supported newspapers are "guided" by
 officials on occasion about the treatment of specific issues.
 Since Mubarak assumed the presidency, there have been no
 confirmed reports of government action to silence press
 critics. No censorship was applied regarding press coverage of
 the arrests of Islamic extremists in July and other sensitive
 stories during the year. No journalists have been arrested on
 political grounds. The courts overturned an attempt to
 confiscate an edition of an opposition newspaper in 1984. No
 attempt at confiscation was made in 1985. Two of the five
 Muslim and Coptic religious publications suspended by the Sadat
 Government in 1981 have yet to reappear, despite a 1982 court
 decision canceling the suspensions. The two publications are
 the Muslim brotherhood's Al-Dawa and the Coptic Al-Kiraza
 Al-Murqassia.
 A wide variety of foreign reading matter in both Arabic and
 other languages is readily available. In 1985, authorities
 banned a few issues of certain foreign publications, including
 the London-based newsmagazine Al-Majallah, as well as Newsweek
 and Time.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Under the emergency law, the Government can place limitations
 on the constitutionally guaranteed right of assembly.
 Permission is required from the Interior Ministry to hold
 public meetings, mass political rallies, and protest marches.
 Despite its emergency authority to restrict gatherings of
 government opponents, the Government has allowed opposition
 parties to hold numerous meetings and rallies, usually
 stipulating that they be held indoors. At the same time, the
 Interior Ministry has moved against radical Islamic elements,
 banning, in June 1985, Sheikh Hafez Salaama's proposed "green
 march" to the presidential palace in support of full
 implementation of Islamic law. Salaama asked the
 Administrative Court to lift the ban, but the Court upheld it,
 citing a 1923 law empowering authorities to prevent public
 meetings or demonstrations deemed threatening to public order
 or security. Subsequently, in July, the courts ruled in
 Salaama's favor when he filed suit challenging a second ban by
 the authorities of a public meeting proposed at Cairo's Abdin
 Square. However, Salaama canceled the meeting when the
 Interior Ministry specified a different site for the event.
 In October, following violent protest demonstrations by
 university students, the Interior Minister announced a ban on
 such activities. He stated that citizens have the freedom to
 express their views but should do so through "legal channels"
 --the media as well as political party and trade union forums.
 Earlier in 1985 there had been occasional protest
 demonstrations by students and others; police forcibly
 intervened when they became disorderly. Despite the Interior
 Minister's ban, students at Zagazig University reportedly
 staged protest demonstrations in December; both the
 progoverment papers and the opposition press reported clashes
 between demonstrators and police, resulting in some arrests.
 
 
 1213
 EGYPT
 About 20 to 25 percent of the work force is unionized, and
 there are no restrictions on workers' freedom to organize.
 Every 50 workers in a given activity can form a committee,
 which operates as a local union. These locals are affiliated
 with national unions, all 23 of which are required to affiliate
 with the sole labor federation, the Egyptian General Trade
 Union Federation (EGTUF). There have been complaints to the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) that the requirement
 that all unions must join a single national federation is an
 infringement of the workers' right of freedom of association.
 In response to these complaints, the Government established a
 commission to study the possibility of amending the labor laws
 to bring them into conformity with the ILO freedom of
 association conventions.
 The trade unions' principal function is to defend the rights of
 the membership in dealing with management on such issues as
 wages and working conditions. Labor defines its interests on
 these issues and pursues them with considerable freedom.
 However, there are restrictions. Setting wages through
 collective bargaining is not permitted. Instead, management
 consults closely with unions in fixing wages. The labor code
 also provides for a system of arbitration to resolve wage and
 working condition issues, but it omits any reference to the
 right to strike. Answering ILO criticisms, the Government
 points out that strikes do occur and there is no legal ban
 against them. In practice, strikes are discouraged by both
 government and trade union leaders, but in 1985, as in the
 past, there were occasional reports of work stoppages. These
 incidents apparently lasted a few days at most and focused on
 local bread-and-butter issues. In most cases, the strikes
 reportedly ended with management's pledge to act on workers'
 grievances; in a few cases the authorities intervened to
 restore normal operation.
 After the September 1984 workers' riots at the Delta textile
 center of Kaffar Al-Dawwar, police arrested, among others,
 about 20 union members suspected of orchestrating the
 disorders. Textile union leaders hired a team of lawyers for
 the arrestees' legal defense. By early 1985, according to
 reliable sources, all of the detained union members had been
 freed under court orders obtained by the lawyers.
 Professional associations, in particular the bar association
 and the press syndicate, criticize government policies in their
 pronouncements and occasionally sponsor protest activities.
 The associations also operate largely free of government
 interference. In 1985 the bar association and the commerce and
 engineers syndicates held elections for their respective
 governing boards; by all accounts the balloting was fair and
 competitive, with no intervention by the authorities.
 EGTUF adheres to the principle of nonmembership in
 international labor organizations, except for the Organization
 of African Trade Unity, the Arab Labor Organization, and the
 International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions. However, the
 latter suspended Egypt's membership in 1978 in reaction to the
 Camp David accords, as did the Arab Labor Organization in
 1979. Despite EGTUF's prohibition, some individual unions have
 affiliated with larger international trade union
 organizations. EGTUF itself has signed various international
 cooperation agreements, one of them with the AFL-CIO. There
 appear to be no restrictions on the international affiliations
 of professional associations.
 
 
 1214
 EGYPT
 c. Freedom of Religion
 According to the Constitution, Egypt is an Islamic state which
 guarantees freedom of religious expression and equality before
 the law regardless of religion. Egypt has a tradition of
 religious toleration, and the authorities generally uphold the
 rights of religious minorities. Islam and Coptic Christianity
 are the two major religions. While most Egyptian Jews
 emigrated many years ago, those few who remain appear to
 practice their faith without restriction or harassment.
 Various Protestant sects operate, some with significant
 Egyptian membership, while others have a small following
 largely among expatriates. All organized religions may
 maintain links with coreligionists abroad. Proselytizing of
 Muslim Egyptians is prohibited. Conversion from Islam, while
 officially not restricted or penalized, is discouraged by the
 Government.
 In February, the Government arrested 39 adherents of the Baha'i
 faith; within a week they had reportedly all been released.
 The press reported in June that the State Security Prosecutor
 had declined to try the Bahai's because their ostensible
 offense, belonging to an apostate religion, is not a crime
 under Egypt's penal code; instead, he transferred the case to
 another court for prosecution under statutes forbidding the use
 of religion to promote seditious ideas and for the violation of
 a 1960 law outlawing organized activities by Bahai's.
 Subsequently, foreign press reports indicated that Cairo's
 Abdin Court had postponed issuance of a verdict in the case
 until February 3, 1986. In November, following a judicial
 investigation, the authorities deported, in lieu of
 prosecuting, 19 foreigners, some of them American citizens,
 linked to the "Children of God" cult. The deportees were
 accused of using religion to spread socially harmful ideas.
 All faiths can, in principle, establish places of worship, run
 schools, and train numbers of clergy adequate to serve
 believers. Under a law dating back to the Ottoman era,
 non-Muslims must obtain numerous official permits, not required
 of Muslims, to build places of worship. Obtaining
 authorization can take years. In 1985, as in previous years,
 authorities approved permits for several new churches. Permits
 are not required for the restoration of existing churches but
 are needed to enlarge the structures.
 Coptic Christians are the most significant indigenous religious
 minority and constitute an estimated 10 percent of the
 population. Copts work in all career fields, occupying many
 leadership positions in the business and professional
 communities. Copts seem by and large to enjoy equal access
 with Muslims to public employment, although there appear to be
 instances of discrimination. They are sparsely represented at
 the highest levels of Government; two of 33 cabinet ministers
 and 9 of 458 Peoples Assembly deputies are Copts.
 University officials have denied allegatons that general
 admissions procedures were revised in the fall of 1984 in order
 to discriminate against Copts. Nevertheless, allegations
 continue of anti-Copt discrimination in admissions to some
 fields of medical study. Copts and other non-Muslims also are
 not permitted to enroll in Cairo's Muslim religiously oriented
 Al-Azhar University or Al-Azhar's nationwide primary and
 secondary school system. The Government has denied a request
 to establish a Coptic university.
 
 
 EGYPT
 Though many Copts may face prejudice and individual acts of
 discrimination from Muslims, there is no evidence that these
 acts are officially inspired. President Mubarak has emphasized
 publicly the full equality of Copts and other religious
 minorities. The courts' application of Islamic law to family
 matters in the Muslim community (marriage, inheritance,
 personal property)--and the Islamic influences elsewhere in the
 legal system--have not touched the constitutionally guaranteed
 freedoms of Copts and other minorities as well as Muslims
 themselves.
 Since reaching a peak in the period preceding Sadat's
 assassination, reports of persecution and physical attacks on
 Copts by Islamic extremists have diminished sharply, although
 the Government continues to take substantial measures, such as
 posting security forces near Coptic churches, to guard against
 violence from Islamic militants. In an October interview with
 Al-Ahram, Pope Shenouda praised the spirit of national unity
 prevailing among Egyptians and said that "sectarian violence"
 is an expression alien to Egypt. His publicly stated view that
 Muslim-Copt relations have improved greatly appears to be
 widely shared in Coptic circles.
 During 1985 virtually all of the estimated 26 Coptic bishops
 and priests still barred from resuming their former positions
 for fomenting sectarian strife in 1981 were allowed to return
 to their dioceses. An undetermined number of Islamic prayer
 leaders in this category are still barred from the mosques,
 reportedly on instructions of the state security investigations
 agency. Other prayer leaders have been displaced since July by
 a campaign to nationalize private mosques suspected of being
 centers of radical Islamic activity. Among those now affected
 was Hafez Salaama, whose Al-Nur mosque in Cairo was closed by
 the authorities, ostensibly for completion of the half-finished
 structure.
 Political activity along religious lines is forbidden, and
 various Islamic and Coptic societies are legally proscribed.
 Although the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) is technically banned, its
 activities are tolerated so long as they do not threaten state
 security or foster sectarian tensions. In the May 1984
 elections for the People's Assembly, eight MB adherents were
 elected on the New Wafd Party's slate. In May 1985 the courts
 ruled that mere membership in the MB is not a criminal
 offense. The MB has a suit pending in court to seek
 restoration of its legitimacy.
 In July, the Government banned the placing on automobiles of
 religious stickers, both Muslim and Coptic. The stickers had
 been appearing with increasing frequency on autcmobiles,
 allegedly causing sectarian tensions.
 Egyptian law prohibits the use of places of worship to
 criticize the State. The courts have not yet ruled on a
 challenge to the constitutionality of this restriction. In
 May, Sheikh Salah Abu Ismail, an opposition People's Assembly
 deputy, reportedly proposed legislation that would grant Muslim
 prayer leaders immunity from prosecution for antigovernment
 sermons. Although the Government maintains that sermons by
 Islamic and Coptic religious figures are not censored, Muslim
 prayer leaders are occasionally detained and questioned for
 delivering allegedly inflammatory declarations in their mosques.
 
 
 1216
 EGYPT
 Pope Shenouda III, whose recognition as Coptic Orthodox
 Patriarch was revoked by the Government in 1981, remained in
 government-enforced seclusion for over 3 years until his
 release by presidential decree on January 1, 1985. There
 appear to be no conditions attached to his return to public
 life and full papal responsibilities. In April, elections
 postponed by the Pope's seclusion were held for the Coptic
 Melli Council, a 24-member lay body that oversees some church
 administrative matters.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Egyptians are guaranteed freedom of movement except in
 well-defined military districts; additional restricted areas
 apply to travel by foreigners. Except for limitations
 affecting males who have not completed compulsory military
 service, freedom of foreign travel and emigration is also
 guaranteed. Citizens who leave the country have the right to
 return. Some who left for political reasons have returned
 since President Mubarak assumed office. There are no known
 cases of citizenship being revoked for political reasons.
 Egypt has a liberal policy on political asylum, and the
 extradition of political refugees is prohibited by law. In
 September, the Interior Minister testified to People's Assembly
 committees that there were 3,000 political refugees from other
 Arab countries in Egypt.
 Under the state of emergency, the Prime Minister has authority,
 which he may delegate to the Interior Minister, to restrict
 foreign or domestic travel. The opposition has alleged use of
 this emergency authority to prevent suspected Islamic militants
 from leaving the country. In April, the Interior Minister
 announced the restoration of full travel rights to 3,471
 persons, identified as members of the Al-Jihad organization, by
 removing their names from the "black list" of individuals not
 permitted to go abroad. Acording to another ministry official,
 there remained fewer than 500 persons subject to travel
 restriction (in contrast to 45,000 in the Nasser era), all by
 judicial order as provided by the penal code and most having
 criminal cases pending. Following his release from detention
 in August, radical Islamic preacher Hafez Salaama was permitted
 to leave the country for the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Egypt's political system is characterized by a strong
 presidency. The President heads the National Democratic Party
 (NDP), which wields a substantial majority in the People's
 Assembly, but opposition parties organize, publish their
 views, and, in some cases, represent their followers in the
 People's Assembly and on the local level.
 The largest and most influential of the five legally
 constituted opposition parties is the New Wafd, a revival of
 the Wafd, one of the major political parties before the 1952
 revolution. The New Wafd resumed activity in 1983, following
 court decisions that restored the leaders' political rights and
 affirmed the party's legal status.
 Restrictions on the formation of new parties are embodied in a
 1977 law which prohibits the formation of parties based on
 religious or class lines, as well as new parties whose
 
 
 1217
 EGYPT
 platforms duplicate those of existing ones or include
 opposition to the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. The law also
 established the so-called "Parties Committee," whose approval
 is required to form a new party. When the Committee rejects an
 application to form a new party, the applicants are entitled to
 challenge the decision in court. In 1985, the sponsors of a
 proposed Nasserist party filed suit when the Committee turned
 down their application. In its May ruling on the suit, the
 Administrative Court referred the case to the Supreme
 Constitutional Court, where it remained pending. The Court
 also stated that provisions of the 1977 parties law may be
 unconstitutional because of contradictions with citizens'
 political rights and freedom of expression.
 The People's Assembly comprises 458 members, of whom 10 are
 appointed by the President. Half of the elected seats are
 reserved for worker and peasant representatives, and 31 for
 women. Following the most recent elections in 1984, the NDP
 controls the People's Assembly with 395 seats.- The New Wafd
 has 58 seats (including 8 from the Muslim Brotherhood) and
 other parties have 5 (all appointed), giving the opposition
 greater representation than in the previous Assembly. Both NDP
 and opposition deputies can and do strongly criticize the
 Government. Cabinet Ministers appear before critical assembly
 committees. Assembly members call for parliamentary
 investigations into government actions or policies, requiring
 testimony of government officials. In voting, there is some
 crossing of party lines.
 An electoral commission drawn from the judiciary is designed to
 insure that voting is conducted fairly and legally. It
 supervises parliamentary elections and is present in each
 district on voting day. Election voting can be invalidated if
 irregularities are found. Each party in the election may have
 observers at the polling places.
 In the hard-fought 1984 campaign, the NDP and the four
 participating opposition parties together fielded over 2,000
 candidates. The elections, in which 43 percent of Egypt's
 approximately 12 million voters cast ballots, are regarded as
 the freest and most competitive since the 1952 revolution. A
 number of losing opposition candidates filed court cases, still
 pending, challenging the election results. The indications are
 that the improprieties were random occurrences and that there
 was no systematic effort to rig the elections.
 A major opposition complaint centered on the July 1983
 electoral law which had replaced the previous system of
 single-member constituencies with a party list system. In each
 of the 48 electoral districts, assembly seats were awarded in
 proportion to the number of votes for each party's list,
 subject to the requirement that a party receive at least 8
 percent of the total vote. The opposition parties criticized
 this "8 percent" proviso on the grounds that it was excessively
 high and they have filed court suits challenging the
 constitutionality of the law on the grounds that it infringes
 upon equal rights provisions of the Constitution.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Egypt has signed the Organization of African Unity's African
 Human Rights Charter and has reaffirmed its commitment to the
 
 
 1218
 EGYPT
 U.N. Human Rights Declaration and respect for related
 international conventions. The Government is responsive to
 queries from Amnesty International and other international
 groups about human rights concerns, including requests for
 visits. Within the Government, primary responsibility for
 international human rights matters rests with the Foreign
 Ministry's Legal Office and Office of International
 Organization Affairs.
 Human rights groups in Egypt are increasingly active in
 promoting domestic and foreign human rights issues. Their
 activities cover such areas as prisoners' welfare and women's
 rights; some groups are also trying to mobilize public support
 on certain political issues. In May the medical syndicate
 reportedly formed a committee to investigate physicians
 involved in torture incidents. Women's rights groups actively
 lobbied for the passage of the new family status bill enacted
 by the People's Assembly in July. The Government does not
 appear to interfere with these organizations.
 In its 1985 Report, Amnesty International expressed concern
 about prolonged pretrial confinement of accused persons in
 political cases, curbs on defendants' right of appeal in state
 security courts, inadequate safeguards against torture and
 ill-treatment, and the now-ended restrictions on Pope
 Shenouda. Freedom House rated Egypt as "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Egypt's population of about 49-million is growing at an annual
 rate of 3 percent, and its per capita gross national product
 was $700 in 1983.
 Egypt enforces strict laws limiting the size of landholdings in
 an attempt to guarantee equitable income and production
 opportunities in rural areas, The limit in "settled lands"
 (the Nile Valley and Delta) is 100 feddans (one feddan equals
 1.04 acres) per family. Larger holdings are permitted and
 encouraged in "new lands," the desert areas being brought under
 cultivation through irrigation. Despite these policies, an
 expanding population living on a limited natural resource base
 has contributed to restricted growth of per capita income.
 Most of the Government's massive subsidy program goes to
 subsidize bread, rice, tea, edible oil, butane gas, meat, and
 corn. As a result of this program, caloric intake for the
 average Egyptian exceeds minimal nutritional requirements. It
 also assures ample supplies of basic necessities at fixed and
 affordable prices. Aware of the strain on the budget and the
 distortions this system introduces into supply-and-demand
 relationships, the Government is moving to reform it through
 such measures as raising prices for bread and other
 commodities, stiffening eligibility requirements for subsidized
 items, and raising some energy tariffs. To meet the acute
 housing shortage, the 5-year development plan, currently in its
 fourth year, includes an ambitious program of public housing.
 Education and health services are free and available to the
 majority of Egyptians. Infant mortality is estimated at about
 105 per 1,000 live births, and life expectancy is 58 years. As
 of 1980, 88 percent of the urban population and 64 percent of
 rural residents had access to safe water. About 44 percent of
 adults are literate; 86 percent of male youth attend primary
 school, but only 62 percent of school age females are
 
 
 1219
 EGYPT
 enrolled. In rural areas, owing to tradition and economic
 circumstances, some children are kept from school to work on
 family farms. University education is free to anyone who
 passes the secondary school completion exam. Assignment to
 faculties is based on score rather than a student's own choice,
 except for those with top scores.
 Employers are required by law to provide acceptable terms and
 conditions of employment for their workers; the minimum wage is
 approximately $22 a month, and the regular workweek is fixed at
 48 hours for factory workers. Employers are legally required
 to meet worker safety and health norms, which are modeled on
 the ILO's suggested standards. There are special provisions
 for female workers. Employers who violate wage, hour, and
 safety and health provisions face civil and criminal penalties,
 and independent sources confirm that the courts occasionally
 impose fines on offending companies.
 The minimum age for full-time employment is 12, which is also
 the minimum school-leaving age. However, there is evidence
 that the traditional practice of using underage children to
 perform full-time jobs continues. In the latest survey (1981)
 of the labor force, the Government's central statistics agency
 reported that over half a million children aged 6 to 12 were
 regularly employed, a majority in the agricultural sector.
 By law, and in many respects in practice, there is equality of
 the sexes. Women vote, work outside the home, and can serve in
 the military. Women are represented in medicine, law, and
 education and serve in the People's Assembly and the Cabinet.
 They are generally free to travel, though a married woman must
 have her husband's permission to obtain her initial passport.
 A husband may subsequently rescind his permission and request
 that his wife's passport be canceled, though such cases are
 rare. Under Islamic law, female heirs are entitled to one-half
 the amount of inheritance that male heirs can receive. In
 rural areas and within more traditional communities, prevailing
 cultural values make it more difficult for women to pursue
 careers outside the home. In such households, by custom and
 tradition, women occupy a subordinate and dependent role.
 Reinforcing the legal basis for equality of the sexes is the
 new family status law enacted in July 1985. The statute
 preserved largely intact women's right to divorce and divorced
 women's child custody and property rights spelled out in the
 1979 act it replaced. The latter had been declared
 unconstitutional in May on narrow technical grounds by the
 Supreme Constitutional Court. Although the 1979 statute
 provided that a husband's second marriage was automatically
 grounds for the first wife to obtain a divorce, the new version
 states she must prove that the second marriage has caused her
 material or psychological harm. On the other hand, the new law
 also requires the husband to declare second and subsequent
 marriages, with failure to do so constituting grounds for
 divorce by the first wife. The successor law retains the
 controversial provision that, in case of divorce, the woman has
 the option of retaining possession of the family residence or
 of receiving financial compensation.
