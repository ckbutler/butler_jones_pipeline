 GERMANY
 The Federal Republic of Germany is a constitutional parliamentary democracy
 with an independent judiciary; citizens periodically choose their representatives in
 free and fair multiparty elections. The head of the Federal Government, the Chan-
 cellor, is elected by the lower house of Parliament. The powers of the Chancellor
 and of the Parliament are set forth in the Basic Law (Constitution). The 16 states
 enjoy significant autonomy, especially as concerns law enforcement and the courts,
 education, the environment, and social assistance.
 Law enforcement is primarily a responsibility of state governments, and the police
 are organized at the state level. The jurisdiction of the Federal Criminal Office is
 limited to international organized crime, especially narcotics trafficking weapons
 smuggling, and currency counterfeiting. Police forces in general are wel trained,
 discipn    and mindful of citizens' rights, although there were occasional instances
 of police abuse.
 Germany's highly advanced economy affords its residents a high standard of liv-
 ing. The economy has had difficulty pulling out of its 1993-94 recession, which fol-
 lowed a reunification boom in the ear y 1990's. The economy picked up in the second
 half of 1996, but unemployment remains high, as the structural rate of unemploy-
 ment rose again with the most recent recession. In the East, where economic inte-
 gration and growth continued particularly strongly employment has increased more
 noticeably than in the West. Nonetheless, overall unemployment in eastern Ger-
 many remains significantly higher than in the country's western half as the region
 continues to grapple with adjustment to free market conditions. Unemployment in
 the East affects women disproportionately more than men.

 The Government fully respects the human rights of its citizens, and the law and
 judiciary provide effective means of dealing with instances of individual abuse. How-
 ever, there were continued allegations ofpolice abuse of prisoners, especially for-
 eigners. Although violence or harassment directed at foreigners continued to occur
 within society as a whole, the number of incidents declined markedly, as was the
 case in 1995. Rightwing violence against foreigners decreased by nearl 50 percent,
 with 154 cases reported in the first 6 months of 1996, compared wit 313 in the
 same period of 1995. Rightwing extremist violence rose sharply after German unifi-
 cation but peaked in 1992 and has since been declining sharply. Still, there were
 a significant number of attacks on property or persons, and foreigners were dis-
 proportionately the victims.
 Anti-Semitic incidents decreased in the first 6 months of 1996. Most involved graf-
 fiti or distribution of anti-Semitic materials. The overwhelming majority of the per-
 petrators of attacks on foreigners or anti-Semitic acts were frustrated, apolitical
 youths and a small core of neo-Nazis. All the major political parties and all the
 highest officials of the Federal Republic denounced violence against foreigners and
 anti-Semitic acts.
 Women continue to face wage discrimination in the private sector. The Govern-
 ment is taking serious steps to address the problem of violence against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial illling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings by government officials.
 Sene murders occuired among rival factions of Iranians, Kurds, Turks, and other
 foreign nationals. The federal and state authorities sought to find and prosecute the
 perpetrators of such crimes and pressed charges in several trials.
 The trial of Red Army Faction member Birgit Hogefeld, which began in November
 1994, ended on November 5. Hogefeld was sentenced to life imprisonment by the
 State Superior Court in Frankfurt. She was found guilty of participating in a 1993
 bombing of a prison in Weiterstadt, Hessen; participating in a 1988 attack on
 Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer, and participating in the 1985 bomb attack
 at the US. Rhein-Main Air Base.
 Lebanon extradited Yasser Mohammed Shraydi to Berlin in May in connection
 with his alled participation in the April 1986 bombing of the Berlin discotheque
 "La Belle." e attack killed one Turkish and two U.S. citizens, and iinjured 230 per-
 sons. Prosecution is expected to begin in spring 1997. Three further suspects were
 arrested in October. Ali Chanaa, alias Alba; his former wife, Verena Helga Chanaa
 (a German national); and his wife's sister, Andrea Haeusler (also German). Also in
 October, warrants were issued for the arrest of three former Libyan diplomats and
 a former member of the Libyan Security Service who were stationed in East Berlin.
 On September 10, six former East German generals were sentenced to prison for
 terms rangig from 3 years 3 months to 6Y2 years, for ordering the shooting of per-
 sons who fled across the Berlin Wall and the former border between East and West
 Germany. The six included former Deputy Defense Minister Klaus-Dieter
 Baumgarten, who was accused of direct complicity in 11 killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punshment.-
 Torture is not mentioned in the Basic Law, but it is forbidden by law.
 There continue to be serious allegations of police brutality aginst foreigners, but
 fewer than in previous years. No action was taken against individual Hamburg po-
 licemen being investigated since 1995 for possible mistreatment of arrested foreign-
 ers as the witnesses were considered unreliable.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Government
 permits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Basic Law prohibits arbitrary arrest,
 detention, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition. To make an ar-
 rest, police must obtain a judicial warrant. By the day after arrest, police must
 bring the suspect before a judge and lodge a charge. The court must then either
 issue a warrant stating the grounds for detention or order the person's release.
 There is no preventive detention. If there is evidence that the suspect might flee
 the country, police may detain the suspect for up to 24 hours pending a formal
 charge. The right of free access to legal counsel has been restricted only in the cases
 of terrorists suspected of having used contacts with lawyers to continue terrorist ac-
 tivity while in prison. Only judges may decide on the validity of any deprivation of
 liberty. Bail exists but is seldom employed; the usual practice is to release detainees
 unless there is clear danger of flight outside the country.
 
 
 951
 There is no use of forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Basic Law provides for the right to a fair
 trial, and an independent judiciary vigorously enforces this right. The court system
 is highly developed and provides full legal protection and numerous possibilities for
 judicial review. Ordinar courts have jurisdiction in criminal and civil matters.
 There are four levels of such courts (local courts, regional courts, higher regional
 courts, and the Federal Court of Justice), with appeals possible from lower to higher
 levels. In addition there are four types of specialized courts: Admnitrative, labor,
 social, and fiscal courts. These courts are also established on different levels, with
 the possibility for appeal to the next higher level
 Separate from these five branches of jurisdiction is the Federal Constitutional
 Court, which is not only the country's supreme court but an organ of the Constitu-
 tion with special functions defined in the Basic Law. Among other things, it reviews
 laws to ensure their compatibility with the Constitution and ajudicates disputes
 between constitutional organs on questions of comptencies. It also has jurisdiction
 to hear and decide claims based on the infringement of a person's basic constitu-
 tional rights by a public authority. The judiciary provides citizens with a fair and
 efficient audicial process.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correslaondnce.-The
 Basic Law prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these
 prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Rspect for Civil iberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Basic Law provides for freedom of the
 press, and the Government respects this right in practice. There is no official censor-
 ship. An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic po-
 litical system combine to ensure freedom of speech and the press, including aca-
 demic freedom. Propaganda of Nazi and other proscribe organizations is illegal.
 Statements endorsing Nazism are also illegal. Several persons were indicted for
 making statements or distributing materials that were alleged to fall into these cat-
 egories, including a US. citizen, Gary Lauck, who was stenced August 22 to 4
 years' imprisonment for instigating national hatred and dissemination of illegal
 prpaga     a atrials.
 In January the press reported that the authorities pressured a provider of
 Internt on-line service to block access to material-a neo-Nazi World Wide Web
 site--that the Government considers illegal under German law.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for these
 rights, and the Government respects them in practice. The Basic Law permits ban-
 ig political parties found to be "fundamentally antidemocratic.n A 1950's ruling
 by the Federal Constitutional Court outlawed a nec-Nazi and a Communist party.
 State governments may outlaw only organizations that are active solely within their
 state, If a group's activities cross state lines, the Federal Government assumes juris-
 diction.
 Four far-right political groups, not organized as political parties, were banned in
 late 1992. The Kurdistan   orer' tat     KK) along with 35 subsidiary organiza-
 tions, was banned in 1993. Also in 1993 the Ftederal Government asked the Con-
 stitutional Court to ban the far-right Free German Workers' Party; the Court's deci-
 sion was still pending at year's end. Several extremist parties were under observa-
 tion by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BFV, the internal security
 service), although such monitoring ma by law not interfere with the organizations
 continued actities. The BFV reported that 46,100 people belonged to far-right or-
 ganizations in 1994, a decline of 22 percent from the previous year.
 c. Freedom of Relcion.-The Basic Law specifically provides for religious freedom.
 The Government flly supports religious freedom. Most of the population belongs to
 the Catholic or Protestant churches. These denominations ande Jewish commu-
 nity hold a special legal status as corporate bodies under public law, giving them,
 for instance, the right to participate in a state-administered church tax system.
 State governments subsidize church-affiliated schools and provide religious instruc-
 tion in schools and universities for those belonging to the Protestant, Catholic, or
 Jewish faith.
 Groups of a religious character, which are not granted special legal status, do not
 benefit from the privileges granted by the State. A sharp debate surounds the ac-
 titioes of the Church of Sientology, whose members rege both government-con-
 doned and societal harassment, including expulsion from (or denial of permission to
 join) a political party and loss of employment. Business firms whose owners or ex-
 ecutives are Scientologists may face boycotts and discrimination, sometimes with
 
 
 952
 
 government approval. Scientologists continued to take such grievances to the courts.
 Legal rulings hav been mixed.
 During the year, the Church of Scientology came under increasing scrutiny by
 both federal and state officials, who claim that its activities do not fall within the
 legal definition of a religious organization. Several cabinet officials criticized the or-
 ganization. In January Claudia Nolte, the Minister of Family Policy, described the
 Church as "one of the most aggressive groups in our society" and said she would
 oppse the organization "with a  the means at my disposal." The Parliament cre-
 ated a special commission to investigate Scientlogy's activities and social impact.
 The press reported that the federal chancellery and state minister-presidents de-
 cidedon December 19 to create an interministerial group to study Scientology.
 Major political parties exclude Scientologists from membership, arguing that the
 Church is not a religion but a for-profit organization whose goals and principles are
 sntidemocratic and thus inconsistent with those of the political parties. In late sum-
 mer, the governing Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party approved a resolution
 saying that membership "in the Scientology organization is not compatible with em-
 ploent in the pubic servie," and urging that the Church be put under surveil-
 lance. Te resolution also urged the banning of federal funding for cultural and ar-
 tistic events featuring Scientlogists. In December a state organization of the CDU
 confirmed the expulsion of three members for belonging to the Church.
 Various artists have been affected because of their membership in the organiza-
 tion. Artists have been prevented from performing or displaying their works because
 of their membership in the Church. In the summer, the youth wing of the CDU in
 a number of G-erman states urged a boycott of the film "Mission Impossible" because
 the leading actor in this film is a Scientologist. In Bavaria the Minister of Culture
 was criticized by the state parliament for allowing American musician Chick Corea,
 a Sentlogist, to perform at a stat-sponsored jazz festival.
 IndividualdGerman states also took action against members of the organization.
 On November 1, the state of Bavaria began to screen applicants for state civil serv-
 ice positions for Scientology membership. Bavaria also said it would not fund arts-
 related activities in which Scientologists were to appear. It also decreed that private
 companies awarded state contracts in certain "sensitive" fields must sign a state-
 ment that they d not follow the tenets of Scientology.
 The past year has also seen some positive developments. A former Minister of
 Justice editorialized that the Government should be more restrained in its dealings
 with Sientology. I  n October report, the Ministry of Interior concluded that there
 was insufficient evidence to justify surveillance of Sientloy by the Offices for the
 Protection of the Constitution (OPC). In response to the CDU's call for the organiza-
 tion to be placed under OPO observation, the report concluded that 'no concrete
 facts exist currently to substantiate the suspicion of criminal acts." In closing the
 report reminded states requesting a ban on Sientology that "only economic consid-
 erations may be taken into account" when awarding public contracts.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--Citizens are free to move anywhere within the country, to travel
 abroad, to emigrate, and to repatriate, without restrictions that violate human
 'or ethnic Germans entering the country, the Basic Law provides both for citizen-
 ship immediately upon application and for legal residence without restrictions. Per-
 sons not of German ethnicity may acquxire citi zenship (and with it the right of unre-
 stricted residence) if they meet certain requirements, including legal residence for
 at least 10 years (5 if married to a German), renunciation of a l other citizenships,
 and a basic command of the language. Long-term legal residents often opt not to
 apply; they receive the same social benefits as do citizens, and after 10 years of legal
 residency they are entitled to permanent residency. Representatives of the Turkish
 and Rma communities in Germany have criticized the citizenship plicy as unjust
 and discriminatory and have opposed the policy against dual nationality.
 The Basic Law and subsequent legislation provide for the right of foreign victims
 of political persecution to attain asylum an  resettlement. In 1996 Germany re-
 cei':ed 116,367 applications for asylum and had a recognition rate of 12.4 percent
 for the 194,451 cases concluded. Since July 1993, when the criteria for granting ay-
 lum were tightened with an amendment to the asylum law, the overall trend in asy-
 lum applications has continued downward, decreasing by two-thirds from the 1992
 all-time high of 438,191.
 Under the tightened criteria, persons coming directly from any country that offi-
 cials designate as a "safe country of origin" cannot normally claim political asylum
 but may request an administrative review of their applications while in Germany.
 Persons entering via a "safe third country"-any country in the European Union or
 adhering to the Geneva Convention-are also ineligible for asylum
 
 
 953
 The legislated changes also limited legal recourse against denials of asylum appli-
 cations. Critics argue that few countries can assuredly be designated as "safe third
 countries" and that the law unjustly fails to allow applicants to rebut such designa-
 tions. While the law permits appeals against designations of "safe countries of ori-
 gin,* critics protest that the 48-hour period allotted for hearings is too brief.
 However, in May the Constitutional Court upheld the constitutionality of the 1993
 amendment.
 Asylum seekers with applications under review enjoy virtually the full range of
 civil rights except the right to vote. While less than 5 percent of applicants have
 attained political asylum, denial does not automatically result in deportation. Most
 rejected ap plicants are allowed to remain in the country for humanitarian reasons,
 especially those from the former Yugoslavia.
 Applicants who have been conclusively denied asylum are placed in detention
 pending deportation. Some poli dedetention facilities, particularly in Berlin, are
 overcrowded or otherwise seriously substandrd.
 Repatriations of Vietnamese citizens living illegally in Germany have proceeded
 behind the schedule established in the protocols to the agreement signed with Viet-
 nam in July 1995; 7,500 returns were foreseen for 1996, but the actual number of
 returns for the year only reached approximately 1,500.
 Germany concluded two other repatriation agreements during the year. The first,
 signed on October 10 with Serbia-Montenegro, is intended to facilitate the return
 of the estimated 135,000 citizens of Serbia-Montenegro living without legal status
 in Germany. Of that number, it is estimated that two-thirds are ethnic Albanians
 from Kosovo. No returns within the context of this agreement occurred in 1996, but
 Germany has begun the application process to allow for returns in 1997. The second
 agreement, initialed with Bosnia on November 20, is intended to facilitate the repa-
 triation of the estimated 320,000 Bsnian refugees. The Government provides first
 asylum and has granted "temporary protection" (first asylum) to these Bosnian refu-
 gees at an estimated cost of $2.8 billion annually for their support.
 In response to the December 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement, Federal and state In-
 terior Ministers decided in January to terminate the temporary protection regime
 and to begin a phased, compulsory if necessary, return of the Bosnian refugees re-
 siding in Germany. In the first phase (October 1996 to mid-1997), those refugees
 without accompanying minor children are to leave Germany; the Federal Interior
 Ministry estimates the number of people potentially included in the first phase to
 be 80,000. The second phase (mid-1997 onward) foresees the departure of all other
 Bsnian refugees. The starting date for "frst phase" returns was originally July, but
 was postponed until October 1 when it became clear that conditions in Bosnia were
 not conducive to large-sale returns. Most states decided subsequently to delay re-
 turns until the spring of 1997. However, two states with large Bsnian refugee pop-
 ulations, Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttenberg, pursued returns beginning in October,
 deporting fewer than 60 Bosnians by year's end. Many, though not all, of the deport-
 ees were convicted of crimes in Germany, making priority candidates for deporta-
 tion. The decision to proceed with compulsory returns led to disagreement with the
 Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which favored only
 voluntary returns during this period.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 mnent
 The Basic Law provides citizens with the right to change their government peace-
 fully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair elec-
 tions. The Government is elected on the basis of universal suffrage and set baot-
 ing. Members of the Parliament's lower house, the Bundestag, are elected from a
 mixture of i     cnstituency and party-list candidates. The upper house, the Bun-
 desrat, is composed of delegations from state governments.
 The law entitles women to participate fully in political life, and a growing number
 are prominent in the Government and the parties, but women are still underrep
 resented in those ranks. Slightly over 26 percent of the Federal Parliament is fe-
 male, including its President. Women occupy 3 of 16 cabinet positions. One state
 minister-president is a woman. On the Federal Constitutional Court, 4 of the 16
 judges are women, including the Chief Justice. All of the parties have undertaken
 to enlist more women. The Greens/Alliance 90 Party requires that women comprise
 half of the party's elected officials. The Social Democrats have a 40-percent quota
 for women on all party committees and governing bodies.
 
 
 954
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operate without government restriction,
 investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government offi-
 cials are very cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits denial of access to shelter, health care, or education on the
 basis of race, religion, disability, sex, ethnic background, political opinion, or citizen-
 ship. The Government enforces the law effectively.
 Women.-While violence against women occurs and is almost certainly under-
 reported, it is prohibited by laws that are effectively enforced. It is condemned in
 sciety, and legal and medial recourse is available. Police statistics on rape showed
 a slight increase to 6,175 cases in 1995 (latest available data) from 6,095 in 1994.
 The Government has conducted campaigns in the sools and through church
 groups to bring public attention to the existence of such violence and has proposed
 stps to counter it. The Federal Government has supported numerous pilot projects
 thoghout Germany. There are, for example, 330  women's houses" n G-ermany,
 over 100 in the new states in the East, where victims of violence and their children
 can seek shelter, counseling, and legal and polie protection. Germany supported the
 appointment of a special rapporteur on violence against women at the U.N. Human
 Riets Commission.
 W       in women and forced prostitution is also forbidden by law. The laws
 against traficking in women were modified in 1992 to deal more effectively with
 problems stemming from the opening of Germany's eastern borders. In recent years,
 the Federal Ministry for Women and Youth commissioned a number of studies to
 gain information on violence ag t women, sexual harassment, and other matters,
 producing for example a special report on violence against women in 1995.
 Chiodru.-The Government is committed to protection of children's rights, and
 there is no societal pattern of abuse of human rights of children. Public education
 is provided and is mandatory through th    e of 16. The Government recognizes
 that violence against children is a problem requiring its attention. Police figures in-
 dicate that there were 16,013 alleged cases of sexual abuse of children in 1995 (lat-
 est available figures), up slightly from 1994. Officials believe that the numbers of
 unreported cases may be much higher. The Child and Youth Protection Law stresses
 the need for preventive measures, and the Government has taken account of this
 in stepping up its counseling and other assistance.
 The Criminal Code was amended in 1993 to further protect children against por-
 nography and sexual abuse. For possession of child pornography, the maximum sen-
 tence is 1 year's "_mprisnment; the sentence for distribution is 5 years. The amend-
 ment made sexual abuse of children by German citizens abroad punishable even if
 the action is not illegal in the child's own country.
 People With Disabilities.-dThere is no discrimination against the disabled in em-
 ployment, education, or in the provision of other state serviceu. The law mandates
 several special services for disabled persons, and the Government enforces these
 provisions in practice. The disabled are entitled to assistance to avert, eliminate, or
 alleviate the consequences of their disabilities and to secure employment commensu-
 rate with their abilities. The Government offers vocational training and grants for
 employers who hire the disabled. The severely disabled may be granted special ben-
 efits, such as tax breaks, free public transport, special parking facilities, and exemp-
 tion from radio and television fees.
 The Federal Government has established guidelines for attainment of "barrier-
 free" public buildings and for modifications of streets and pedestrian traffic walks
 to accommodate the disabled. While it is up to the individual states to incororate
 these guidelines into building codes, all 16 states now have access facilities for the
 disabled.
 Religious Minorities.Anti-Semitic acts decreased, with 380 incidents reorted in
 the first 6 months of 1996, compared with 634 incidents in the same period in 1995.
 There    e only 17 cases involving the use of force. Over9pcent of these anti-
 Semitic incidents involved graffiti, the distribution of anti-Semitic materials, or the
 display of symbols of banned organizations. The perpetrators     of the 1995
 firebmbing of the Luebeck synagogue were deemed mentally ill and sent for treat-
 ment. There were no anti-Semitic bombings in 1996.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Data from the Federal Office for the Protec-
 tion of the Constitution show the number of violent offenses by rightwing extremists
 against foreigners decreased by nearly 50 percent in the first 6 months of 1996 com-
 pared with the same period in 1995. This continues a significant downtrend since
 
 
 955
 1992. According to police data, all violent acts against foreigners, regardless of the
 political leanings of the perpetrators, also declined by roughly 50 percent. As in pre-
 vious years, most of these offenses were directed against foreign residents. Eight
 American exchange students of Asian descent were attacked an -slightly injured-by
 rightwingers in July 1995 in Merseburg. Charges have been brought in this case,
 but the trial had not convened by year's end.
 Ethnic Turks continue to complain credibly about societal and job-related dis-
 crimination. Isolated firebombing incidents occurred again during the year targeting
 Turkish business establishments. The attacks were largely attributed to intra-Turk-
 ish disputes. There have been no arrests in connection with these firebombings.
 Turkish community leaders have sometimes complained of insufficient security ef-
 forts by German authorities in the face of these bombings.
 In March Turkish Kurd supporters of the P;K held large demonstrations at Ger-
 man border crossing points. During one such demonstration in Elten near the Dutch
 border, two police prsonnel suffered severe head injuries.
 Perpetrators of iightwing violence were predominantly young, male, and low in
 socioeconomic status, often committing such acts while inebriated. As in the past,
 most acts of violence against minority groups were committed spontaneously. There
 continued to be evidence in 1996 that neo-Nazi groups were making efforts to
 achieve greater coordination among themselves.
 In addition to voicing condemnation of the violence, the Government has rec-
 ommended tougher anticrime legislation and law enforcement measures, as well as
 measures aimed at the societal roots of extremist violence and other crime. Eastern
 state governments have also taken efforts to reinvigorate enforcement of laws
 against violence by extremists. For such projects, however, state governments have
 thus far allocated only limited funds in their tight budgets.
 The police in the eastern states continued to become better versed in the federal
 legal system, better trained, and more experienced. They continued to move toward
 reaching the standards of effectiveness characteristic of police in the rest of Ger-
 many. The level of rightwing activity in the new states ontinued to decrease, and
 the police and state officials continued to show greater coordination in moving
 quickly and effectively to prevent illegal rightwing and neo-Nazi gatherings and
 demonstrations. The state of Saxony, or example, has a "Specia Commission on
 Rightwing Extremism," which has been particularly active. Police at the local level
 in the new states are not always so active, however. After police in the Saxon town
 of Wurzen failed to move against local rightwing radicals, the Special Commission
 was forced to take independent action in May without informing the local police in
 advance. In the aftermath of the raid, nine Wurzen police officers were suspended.
 The case is still under investigation, but all the policemen involved have returned
 to regular duty.
 Sinti and Romani leaders expressed satisfaction at the signingby the Government
 of the Council of Europe Convention on Minorities. Germany submitted an interpre-
 tation of the Convention in which Sinti and Roma were explicitly mentioned as eth-
 nic minorities in Germany, providing them the recognition that they had long
 sought.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The right to associate freely, choose representatives,
 determine programs and policies to represent workers' interests, and publicize views
 is recognized and freely exercised. Some 35.5 percent of the total eligible labor force
 belong to unions. The German Trade Union Federation (DGB) represents 85 percent
 of organized workers.
 The law provides for the right to strike, except for civil servants (including teach-
 ers) and personnel in sensitive positions, such as members of the armed forces. In
 the past, the International Labr Organization (ILO) has criticized the Govern-
 ment's definition of "essential services as overly brad. The ILO was responding to
 complaints about sanctions imposed on teachers who struck in the state of Ilesse
 in 1989 and, earlier, the replacement of striking postal workers by civil servants.
 In neither case did permanent job loss result. The ILO continues to seek clarifica-
 tions from the Government on policies and laws governing labor rights of civil serv-
 ants.
 There were several large union-sponsored job actions pretesting efforts to reduce
 fringe benefits. For example, on October 1, over 100,000 workers demonstrated to
 prtest cuts in sick pay by major auto manufacturing companies.
 The DGB participates in various international and European trade union organi-
 zations.
 b. The  Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Basic Law provides for
 the right to organize and bargain collectively, and this right is widely exercised. Due
 
 
 to a well-developed system of autonomous contract negotiations, mediation is un-
 common. Basic wages and working conditions are negotiated at the industry level
 and then are adapted, through local collective bargaining to particular enterprises.
 However, some firms in eastern Germany have refused to join employer associa-
 tions, or have withdrawn from them, and then bargained independently with work-
 ers. Likewise, some large firms in the West withdrew at least part of their work
 force from the jurisdiction of employer associations, complaining of rigidities in the
 industrywide, multicompany negotiating system. They have not,lowever, refused to
 bargain as individual enterprises. The law mandates a system of works councils and
 woer membership on supervisory boards, and thus workers participate in the
 management of the enterprises in which they work. The law thoroughly protects
 workers against antiunion discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Basic Law prohibits forced or
 compulsory labor, and there were no known violations.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Federal law generally prohibits
 employment of children under the age of 15, with a few exceptions: Those 13 or 14
 years of age may do farm work for up to 3 hours per day or may deliver newspapers
 for upto 2 hours per day; those 3 to 14 years of age may take part in cultural per-
 formances, albeit under stringent curbs on the kinds of activity, number of hours,
 and time of day. The Federal Labor Ministry effectively enforces the law through
 its Factory Inspection Bureau.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legislated or administratively de-
 termined minimum wage. Wages and salaries are set either by collective bargaining
 agreements between unions and employer federations or by individual contracts.
 Covering about 90 percent of all wage- and salary-earners, these agreements set
 minimum pay rates and are legally enforceable. These minimums provide an ade-
 quate standard of living for workers and their families. The number of hours of
 work per week is regulated by contracts that directly or indirectly affect 80 percent
 of the working population. The average workweek for industrial workers is 36 hours
 in western Germany and about 39 hours in the eastern states.
 An extensive set of laws and regulations on occupational safety and health incor-
 porates a growing body of European Union standards. These provide for the right

 A comprehensive system of worker insurance carriers enforces safety requirements
 in the workplace. This system now applies in the eastern states, where lax stand-
 ards and conditions under the communist regime created serious problems. The
 Labor Ministry and its counterparts in the states effectively enforce occupational
 safety and health standards through a network of government organs, including the
 Federal Institute for Work Safety. At the local level, professional and trade associa-
 tions-self-governing public corporations with delegates both from the employers
 and from the unions--oversee worker safety.
