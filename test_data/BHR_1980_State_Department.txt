 BAHRAIN
 A crossroads and trading center in the Arabian Gulf since
 Mesopotamian times, Bahrain is governed by an Amir and a 17-
 member Cabinet composed of eight members of the ruling al-
 Khalifa family and nine commoners. Except for the Amir and the
 Prime Minister, each member heads a separate ministry. Of
 the commoners, five are Shia, the branch of Islam to which
 approximately 60 percent of Bahrainis belong. The emirate
 offers full religious freedom to its diverse communities:
 Christians, Jews, and Hindus worship freely as do a variety
 of Islamic sects. A dual system of Sunni and Shia Islamic
 courts operate in the areas of family and customary law.
 Western law is applied in appropriate cases involving
 foreigners.
 Bahrain was the first state in the Gulf to discover oil;
 resulting revenues enabled it to become the first to offer
 broad educational and social services to its population.
 Bahrain has a long tradition of providing a haven for
 refugees.
 The al-Khalifa family has ruled Bahrain for 200 years in
 alliance with prominent Sunni and Shia trading and tribal
 families and religious leaders of both sects. Shaikh Isa
 bin Salman al-Khalifa has been Amir since before Bahrain's
 independence in 1971.
 The constitution adopted in May 1973 provides for an elected
 National Assembly, labor unions, and strict safeguards for
 personal liberties. It also commits the state to advancing
 social welfare.
 In 1975, after a 20-month experiment with the National Assembly,
 the Amir dissolved it during a period of crises over a proposed
 security law. No definite steps to reinstate the Assembly have
 been taken, nor has the constitutional provision permitting the
 formation of trade unions been implemented.
 The revolution in Iran has produced a destabilizing element;
 revolutionaries in Iran exhort ethnic Iranians and other Shia
 in Bahrain to bring Islamic revolution to the island. During
 1980, the situation generally has been calm, but street
 violence in the spring, accompanied by revolutionary sloganeer-
 ing, led to arrests of a few dozen activists, virtually all
 of whom were released after interrogation. For years, police
 have made a practice of detaining known activists during
 fervent religious celebrations.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom
 from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is forbidden by Articles 19 and 20 of the constitution.
 On May 11, 1980, one detainee, arrested for attacking a vehicle
 carrying two members of the ruling family, died while in police
 custody allegedly from injuries inflicted by police interrogators.
 There is no information indicating whether any investigation or
 disciplinary action has been taken. Other allegations of torture,
 cited in hostile broadcasts from Iran, appear to be without
 substance.

 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Amnesty International reports on prison conditions cite solitary
 confinement, beatings, and denial of family visits as ill-
 treatment of prisoners. There were no other reports of cruel,
 inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in 1980.
 c. Disappearances
 There were no reports of disappearances in 1980.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The State Security Act of 1974 permits pre-emptive detention
 when police authorities have evidence of words or deeds
 considered detrimental to the nation's security. In practice,
 this broad provision has been interpreted to mean a serious and
 imminent threat to public order, to members of the ruling family,
 to diplomats, or to high officials. Imprisonment under this
 law requires a court order and may extend up to three years.
 A detainee may appeal his imprisonment to the Supreme Court
 of Appeal after three months in detention. The detainee
 may renew his appeal every six months. The government
 invoked this law four times in 1980. Most detainees are
 released fairly promptly. As of November 18, 1980, 18
 persons reportedly were detained by the government, although
 Amnesty International estimates the number may be upwards
 of fifty. Of the 18 reported, nine are Shia activists (two
 religious leaders, and seven of their followers, believed to
 have incited the populace against the ruling family) and
 another nine are members of illegal leftist organizations.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trials are the practice in Bahrain. The constitu-
 tion provides that defendants in criminal cases shall be
 presumed innocent until proven guilty and shall have the
 right to counsel. Trials related to national security are held
 in secret before the Supreme Court of Appeal. There are no
 reports of such trials in the last three years.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The constitution declares private residences to be inviolable
 "except in cases of dire necessity" as prescribed by law. The
 State Security Law allows homes to be searched in cases where
 the resident or occupant is suspected of posing a serious and
 imminent threat to public order and after a court order has
 been obtained. At times in the past, Bahraini authorities
 entered and searched private residences without a permit. No
 such instances have been reported in the last three years.
 2. Government    Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 Beginning with the first receipt of oil income forty years ago,
 the government adopted generous social policies toward health
 care and education. Free public health treatment is available
 to all citizens and residents of Bahrain, as is education
 through the high school level. The government subsidizes
 basic food prices and provides public housing for low and
 middle income families. Social security programs are
 
 
 944
 extensive and being expanded.
 The government, faced with declining oil resources, receives
 budgetary support and project grants from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
 and the-United Arab Emirates. Per capita income has reached
 $4,967; virtually no taxes are imposed, and public funds are
 equitably distributed. The budget for 1979 was allocated as
 follows: education, 7 percent; health, 6 percent; electricity
 and water, 16 percent; and housing, 4 percent. Roughly one-
 third of the total 1979 budget thus was devoted to those public
 services.
 The right to private property is protected. Public housing
 programs make land available on easy terms to families who
 lack land on which to build a home.
 While the Government of Bahrain seeks to advance (through
 education and training)the right to work with just
 conditions and renumeration, there is both unemployment and
 underemployment. Considerable discrepancy exists between
 the skill pool of the population and job opportunities
 available -- a discrepancy largely resolved by the employ-
 ment of foreigners in both blue collar and managerial posi-
 tions. Approximately 33 percent of the population is
 foreign (1978 data), and foreigners constitute more than half
 of the work force. A scheme to train 10,000 Bahrainis over
 the next ten years is being put into effect. It is designed
 to upgrade Bahraini skills and make practical the
 "Bahrainization" of many positions in private industry and
 government which are now held by non-Bahrainis. 'Skills
 imbalances are increasing because the educational system and
 student preferences in choosing fields of study have
 produced more graduates in arts and literature than the
 country can utilize and not enough technical and engineering
 graduates. In 1979, 85 percent of Bahraini males and 65
 percent of its females between the ages of seven and four-
 teen attended school. Bahrain's literacy rate is 47 percent.
 Rights to a standard of living adequate for health and well-
 being are reasonably well protected, given the extensive public
 health system and universal access to education.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Bahrainis are free to express views critical of the government
 in private, but publication of criticism "directed toward the
 Amir or heads of state of friendly governments, or which would
 tend to undermine public morals or public order" is restricted
 both by the State Security Law and by the 1979 Publications
 Law. The latter requires local journalists to obtain
 professional licenses from the Ministry of Information and
 gives the Ministry far-reaching authority to censor local
 media and to control importation of foreign publications.
 The Publication Law was invoked once in 1980 to suspend the
 local English language daily newspaper, for four days, for
 printing an item which drew into question Bahrain's neutral-
 ity in the Iraq/Iran conflict. The press readily criticizes
 the government's handling of domestic economic and social
 matters.
 
 
 945
 Bahrain has a small Jewish community, and its members play
 accepted roles in the business community. A variety of Islamic
 and Christian sects maintain places of worship and freely
 practice their religion in Bahrain. Freedom of private
 assembly is guaranteed by the constitution, but the government
 prohibits public gatherings which it believes are a threat
 to internal security. A religious procession believed to
 have had political overtones was prohibited in early
 December 1980.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Bahrainis are free to move within the country, to travel abroad
 and to emigrate. The constitution prohibits exile as a form
 of punishment. There is no known impediment to the right of a
 Bahraini citizen abroad to return to Bahrain. Refugees,
 either from Bahrain or seeking to enter Bahrain, have not
 been an issue. Bahrain historically has taken a charitable
 view of the needs of refugees.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 As noted in the introduction, Bahrain's first legislature was
 dissolved in 1975 after a stormy 20-month existence. Citizens
 enjoy relatively easy access to government leaders and to the
 Amir, whose twice-weekly majlis (audience) is open to all
 Bahrainis.
 A delegation of Bahraini women attended the United Nations
 International Women's Decade Conference held in Copenhagen
 in August 1980. Their return to Bahrain marked the
 establishment of a National Women's Committee on which serve
 female representatives of various ministries and a number of
 women's and social welfare organizations. Bahrain is a
 traditional society in which the assumption of male supremacy
 is ingrained for much of the population. Increasing numbers
 of women, however, are pursuing education and some have ga.ined
 respected positions; women work in senior government posts,
 and as attorneys, doctors, and members of other learned
 professions. About seven percent of the work force is female.
 The first Bahraini female electrical engineer will soon
 graduate from university training and is slated for a position
 in the Ministry of Works, Electricity and Water. In other
 areas of society, there remains a need to bring the benefits
 of education and health science to mothers and children.
 Although the constitution of 1973 recognizes the right of
 workers to organize, unions and strikes remain illegal in
 Bahrain. The last round of strikes, touched off by wage
 demands during rapid inflation, was in 1974. Those strikes
 tended to focus on wages and working conditions, but they
 also displayed a political dimension which the government
 considered destabilizing. The government has shown itself
 willing to repress strikers by force; leaders have been
 arrested, jailed, and deported; a few are still in prison.
 The government steadfastly has refused to permit the
 establishment of trade unions, but it has permitted the
 formation of elected "workers' committees" in individual
 industries. Their representatives are empowered to
 bargain with management on wages and working conditions, and
 with unresolved differences arbitrated by the Ministry of
 
 
 946
 Labor and Social Affairs. Only ten-percent of employed
 Bahrainis are enrolled ,in these committees; expatriate workers
 (over fifty percent of the work force) are excluded.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violation of
 Human Rights
 In March 1980, Amnesty International released a statement
 condemning the continued detention, without indictment of trial,
 of fourteen persons arrested in Bahrain during the period 1974-
 1976. The statement noted that the Bahraini authorities
 recently had released certain other detainees on whose behalf
 Amnesty had expressed concern. There are no other known
 international requests for investigations related to human
 rights in Bahrain.
