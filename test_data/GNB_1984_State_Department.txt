 GUINEA-BISSAU
 The Republic of Guinea-Bissau returned to a form of
 constitutional government in 1984. In May, the armed
 forces-dominated Revolutionary Council, which had ruled the
 country since the 1980 coup d'etat, was abolished. Following
 legislative elections controlled by the country's only legal
 political party--the African Party for the Independence of
 Guinea and Cape Verde--the 150-member National Popular Assembly
 reconvened for the first time since 1980. The assembly
 approved a new Constitution, elected General Joao Bernardo
 Vieira to a five-year term as President of the Council of
 State, and chose the 14 other members of that Council. Despite
 these changes, effective political power remains concentrated
 in the hands of the council and President Vieira who currently
 serves as Head of State, Head of Government, Armed Forces
 Commander-in-Chief, and Secretary-General of the party. The
 Council includes seven military men and five former members of
 the now defunct Revolutionary Council. All Council members are
 also members of the party's political and/or central
 committee.
 Opposition political activity is not permitted. Under the May
 1984 Constitution, the patty is "the guiding political force of
 Guinea-Bissau society and the state.' Elections at the
 district, regional, and national level are controlled by the
 party.
 The armed forces remain the dominant element in state
 security. The military's role in the maintenance of internal
 security and public order is specifically mandated in the new
 Constitution. The creation of special tribunals is
 constitutionally prohibited except with respect to military
 courts established to deal with military offenses.
 Guinea-Bissau is one of the world's poorest and least developed
 nations. The colonial heritage and inappropriate past
 economic, financial, and commercial policies have severely
 restricted growth and the exploitation of national resources.
 All economic activity is supervised by the Government through a
 system of state-owned business and commercial entities. There
 is a small private retail sector. Per capita gross national
 product (GNP) is, according to 1982 estimates, approximately
 $170 a year. Direct foreign grant assistance is required to
 cover a large portion of the Government's current operating
 budget. Imports and exports declined in 1984.
 The inherent nature of the one-party state clearly limits the
 political freedom of Guinea-Bissauans. Nevertheless, the May
 1984 Constitution guarantees the equality of all citizens
 before the law, as well as freedom of thought, assembly,
 association, and religion. The integrity of the individual is
 normally respected, except in cases involving alleged national
 security offenses. Efforts continue to reduce the degree of
 arbitrariness in the system, as reflected in the return to
 constitutional government after over three years of provisional
 rule by a revolutionary council and suspension of the previous
 constitution. A number of cabinet ministers were dismissed in
 1984 on charges of malfeasance, and in March the Prime Minister
 was charged with coup plotting. Their cases continue under
 investigation but none is currently under detention.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no cases of government ordered or sanctioned
 assassinations nor have there been any terrorist incidents in
 1984.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of disappearance in 1984.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There were no reported cases of torture in 1984. The May 1984
 Constitution prohibits such treatment. Prison conditions are
 poor and unsanitary. Interrogation methods are at times harsh,
 entailing intimidation and occasionally solitary confinement.
 Medical treatment, medicines, and food for prisoners are in
 short supply. Military security and police officials are
 poorly trained.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There is no published civil or criminal code. Habeas corpus
 (as a carryover from the Portuguese Penal Code) does exist in
 practice in urban areas, but is not generally observed in rural
 areas where a wide variety of traditional law prevails. In
 national security cases, arrests and detentions frequently take
 place without formal safeguards. Bail procedures appear not to
 exist. There were no known cases of government-imposed exile
 in 1984. The new Constitution, however, does recognize the
 state's right to expel and extradite Guinea-Bissauan citizens
 'in some cases.'
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In rural areas, nonpolitical offenders in other than the most
 important criminal and civil cases are often tried outside the
 formal court system, under traditional law. The private
 practice of law is prohibited. Defendants are assigned legal
 assistants from the Ministry of Justice when available. The
 judiciary is not independent. The civilian court system is
 essentially a continuation of that which existed under
 Portuguese colonial rule. The Supreme Court is the highest
 civilian court of appeal. Regional military courts have
 jurisdiction over military, militia, and security personnel on
 military missions. The Supreme Court has jurisdiction over
 more serious crimes such as acts against state security,
 attempts against the lives of party members, treason, and
 piracy. It is also an appeal court for the regional military
 courts. The interval between arrest and trial may be lengthy.
 There are no known political prisoners at this time.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution guarantees the inviolability of domicile,
 person, and correspondence. These guarantees are not always
 respected in the case of serious crimes or matters involving
 
 40-387 o - 85 - 11
 
 
 152
 GUINEA BISSAU
 state security, when the observance of legal protections such
 as the need for search warrants and the definition of who can
 issue and serve them are considered less important than
 results.   Absent an independent judiciary and a published
 criminal code, there is no established or guaranteed protection
 against intrusion by the state into the private lives of
 individuals. International and domestic mail and other forms
 of communication are considered insecure. Opposition to the
 Government and public criticism of government officials are
 prohibited. However, intrusion into the daily life of ordinary
 citizens by the Government is the exception rather than the
 rule--save at times of great political tension or in cases
 involving national security.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The information media in Guinea-Bissau are owned and controlled
 by the Government. Independent reporting or editorial comment
 on domestic or international affairs does not exist. There are
 no independent journals or newspapers. Coverage of food
 shortages and the current economic crisis is, however, common.
 Journalism is considered a function of the state and the
 party. No expression of political opposition to the party or
 the Government is permitted.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 All organizations and associations in Guinea-Bissau are
 integral parts of the state or the party. The national labor
 union is a "mass-action' organ of the party. It claims 20,000
 members. It is forbidden to organize public employees--a
 prohibition dating from colonial days. Strikes, while not
 formally illegal, have not taken place, and the vast majority
 of salaried workers are employees of the state. Opposition to
 government policies is prohibited. There are no non-
 government or non-party associations affiliated with
 international bodies. The national union is a member of the
 Organization of African Trade Union Unity and is affiliated
 with the Communist-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no religious discrimination and religious freedom is
 constitutionally guaranteed. The majority of the population is
 animist, but other religious groups exist and their worship is
 unimpeded. Religious missions operate secular activities
 throughout the country. Parochial schools operate openly.
 Conversion is permitted. The adherence to a particular faith
 appears to be neither an advantage nor a disadvantage to
 individuals in their secular activities. Muslims account for
 approximately 30 percent of the active religious community.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no routine restrictions on movement within the
 country. Exit permits, however, are required for
 Guinea-Bissauan nationals and for many foreign expatriate
 workers traveling abroad. Citizens are not required to obtain
 special permits for internal travel. Travel is restricted when
 interregional smuggling of agricultural products is suspected.
 The principal constraints on foreign travel are economic.
 
 
 153
 GUINEA BISSAU
 There are no known bars to emigration. Since the country's
 borders are not rigidly controlled, there is a considerable
 amount of unauthorized cross-border movement. There are no
 significant refugee groups in Guinea-Bissau. The Government is
 generally sympathetic to the principle of asylum. There were
 no known repatriation problems in 1984.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Guinea-Bissau is governed by a small elite group of party
 leaders and military authorities led by President Joao
 Bernardo Vieira. In terms of the 1984 Constitution, all
 political activity must take place within the party/state
 structure. The 1984 electoral slates at the district,
 regional, and national levels were party-prepared lists.
 Write-in or opposition candidates were not permitted. The
 President, members of the Council of State, and National
 Popular Assembly deputies are elected to five-year terms.
 There are provisions for constitutional revision and national
 referendums. In rural areas, popular criticism of regional
 government authorities has forced the Government to replace
 some officials. No single ethnic group dominates party/
 government positions. The party and Government actively
 encourage the role of women in society, public life, and
 development. The President of the National Assembly and the
 Mayor of Bissau are both women. Foreign nationals residing in
 Guinea-Bissau are generally constitutionally entitled to the
 same rights as citizens except for the right to vote or to hold
 public office.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Guinea-Bissau has not been active in international or regional
 human rights bodies, and there have been no visits by such
 groups in 1984. It has no record of sustained involvement with
 outside bodies concerned with human rights. Amnesty
 International in 1984 and previous reports expressed concern
 about earlier detentions without trial of officials of the
 former administration arrested after the 1980 coup. All of
 these detainees, however, have since been released. Freedom
 House rates Guinea-Bissau as 'not free.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Guinea-Bissau is among the least developed countries in the
 world. According to World Bank statistics, the current
 population is estimated at 842,000 with a population growth
 rate of 1.9 percent. The Government estimates the population
 growth rate to be 2.2. percent, with average family size at 5.3
 persons. Per capita gross national product is estimated at
 $170 a year. Life expectancy at birth is 38 years, and the
 infant mortality rate is approximately 139 per 1,000 live
 births.   The World Bank estimates adult literacy at 19
 percent, but the Government puts overall literacy at not more
 than 15 percent. No more than 12 percent of the population has
 access to safe water. Eighty-seven percent of the population
 lives in communal villages (tabancas), which are the country's
 basic economic and social units. The remaining 13 percent of
 the population is concentrated largely in and around the
 capital city of Bissau. Average population density is 22
 inhabitants per square kilometer. The Government estimates
 
 
 154
 GUINEA BISSAU
 that there is one hospital bed for every 650 inhabitants and
 one doctor per 10,000 inhabitants. Of an active population of
 approximately 450,000, only 25,000 are salaried wage earners.
 Most of these are civil servants.
 Employment and educational opportunities are limited. Primary
 school enrollment is estimated at 71 percent. Although the
 country is extremely fertile, less than one-half of the arable
 land is currently under cultivation. Guinea-Bissau's principal
 natural resources include fish, lumber, some minerals, and
 possibly petroleum. The economy is dominated by the
 traditional subsistence production of agricultural
 commodities. The rural and modern sectors operate, to a large
 extent, independently of one another. Foreign economic
 assistance to Guinea-Bissau is substantial, averaging
 $60-80 million annually.
 There is no government or party discrimination against women.
 The National Women's Movement, a party organization, is active
 nationally. Women hold some senior government and party
 positions. Political activity by women is officially
 encouraged at all levels. By statute, party organizations must
 have a stated proportion of women office holders. Official
 discrimination against women in the modern sector of society
 does not take place. In most rural sectors, however,
 traditional male-dominant sociological practices prevail,
 imposing attendant limitations on women.
