 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 
 Because of the sharply differing politico-social environ-
 ments in Israel and in the Arab territories Israel has occu-
 pied since the 1967 war, discussion of this subject must be
 treated in separate but parallel fashion for the two areas.
 Therefore, for its first three sections, this report is
 divided into separate narratives for Israel and the occupied
 territories.
 Israel is a full-fledged parliamentary democracy whose stan-
 dards and administration of justice within Israel proper are
 comparable to those of the United States and other Western
 democracies. The Israelis judge themselves in accordance
 with these standards.
 Under the military regime that governs ther occupied terri-
 tories, certain of the normal human rights guarantees that
 are taken for granted in Israel proper have been superseded
 on security grounds. This dichotomy poses a dilemma that
 will probably be resolved only in the context of a final
 peace settlement with their neighbors.

 1.   Respec for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 The use of torture in Israel is prohibited by law and is
 virtually unheard of. Amnesty International has in recent
 years raised questions with the Israeli Government concern-
 ing reports in the Israeli press about two possible instances
 of the use of torture. We have no information that would
 corroborate these reports.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 With rare exceptions,this is neither sanctioned nor practiced
 in Israel, and law enforcement is carried out without the
 excessive use of force. Exceptions have occurred on two
 occasions in recent years when force was used to quell
 violent demonstrations by Israeli Arabs protesting land
 expropriations and demolition of unauthorized structures,
 resulting in several deaths and injuries.

 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 In Israel proper, this is not practiced. Writs of habeas
 corpus and other guarantees of due process of. law are em-
 ployed, and defendants are considered innocent until proved
 guilty. Preventive detention is legal during periods of
 emergency but is not usually practiced.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair hearing by an impartial tribunal with
 representation by counsel is observed. With the exception
 of security cases, all trials are open. In security cases,
 Israeli law provides that part or all of a trial may be
 closed, with the burden of justifying in-camera proceedings
 falling on the prosecution. Counsel is always present
 during closed proceedings.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 There are effective legal safeguards against arbitrary in-
 vasion of the home.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital*Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 Israel is a welfare state whose economy is organized along
 the general lines of the Western European mixed economies.
 Income distribution in Israel is relatively egalitarian.
 All Israelis are guaranteed good health caue, and housing
 for the poor is modestly subsidized. Sino   1948, Israel has
 taken in well over one million largely imporerished Jewish
 refugees from Europe, the Middle East, and iorth Africa, and
 has integrated them into its society and eor-nomy. Inte-
 gration of smaller numbers of immigrants coatinues at the
 present time. Because of the wide disparitc in educational
 and cultural backgrounds, there remains a cDnsiderable eco-
 nomic and social gap between the Ashkenazi fEuropean) and
 Sephardi (Middle Eastern) Jewish communitiez, which the
 government is committed to narrowing.
 All Israelis are guaranteed free public eduration through
 the sixth grade and more than half of all secondary students
 receive full scholarships. There are parallel educational
 
 
 363
 systems for Jews and Arabs, conducted in flebrew and Arabic
 respectively.
 Average per capita income among Arabs in Israel is probably
 higher than in any of the surrounding countries and is, in
 fact, higher than that of Jewish Israelis of Sephardi origin.
 The title to most of the land in Israel is held by state
 organizations in trust for the Jewish people. Arabs, many
 of whom are engaged in agriculture, are unable to acquire
 additional land, except through purchase from other Israeli
 Arabs. Moreover, there have been frequent complaints that
 expropriations of Arab land, although subject to legal re-
 view as to purpose and amount of compensation, have not been
 for the benefit of the Arab community, but rather for pro-
 moting Jewish settlement in densely Arab-populated areas.
 The Government has said it plans no more expropriations in
 the foreseeable future.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion, and
 Assembly
 Israelis of all faiths and ethnic groups continue to enjoy
 freedom of religion, expression, and assembly. An anti-
 proselytiiing measure adopted by the Knesset on December 27,
 1977, which outlaws the offering of bribes or material bene-
 fits as an inducement to religious conversions, has caused
 unease among some Christian groups in Israel because of its
 vague wording, but it is too early to judge if there is any
 valid basis for this concern.
 There is full freedom of speech in Israel. Both the Hebrew
 and Arabic press are free and express a wide variety of
 political opinions, although all newspapers-are subject to
 censorship on security and military matters.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 All Israeli citizens enjoy freedom of movement within the
 country and are free to travel abroad or emigrate.
 
 
 364
 
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy, and Israelis enjoy
 the freedom fully to participate in the political process.
 The country underwent an orderly major transition with the
 elections of May 1977, when the party in power since the
 founding of the state was replaced by its traditional
 opposition.
 The organized labor movement functions without hindrance
 and in fact wields great political and economic power. The
 right to strike is exercised frequently and effectively.
 Most workers, Arab as well as Jewish, are members of the
 Histadrut, the general confederation of workers.
 Because of the explicitly Jewish character of the state,
 and the continuing total isolation of Israel by most of
 its Arab neighbors, the Arab minority tends to feel power-
 less and largely alienated from Israeli society. Despite
 some limited governmental and private efforts to bridge the
 gap, there is very little social interaction between Israeli
 Arabs and Jews. Nevertheless, the Arab minority has equal
 rights under the law, and proven instances of discrimination
 in violation of the law are rare. Although subtler forms of
 discrimination, in such areas as employment and appointment
 to government positions, do occur, some Arabs have risen to
 responsible positions in the civil service, and at least
 one has served in the position of deputy minister. Unlike
 Jewish Israelis, Arabs are not subject to the military draft.
 Occupied Territories
 Israel's occupied territories consist of the West Bank of
 the Jordan River, the Gaza Strip, most of the Sinai Penin-
 sula, the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem. The complex
 human rights situation in the occupied territories, partic-
 ularly in the West Bank and Gaza, where virtually all of the
 settled Arab population is located, is largely a result of
 the tensions between the occupying authorities and the
 indigenous population, mostly Palestinian Arabs.
 The occupied territories are under military government, and
 law enforcement and public security are in military rather
 than in civilian hands. Although Israel rejects the view of
 the United Nations (including the U.S.) that the stipulations
 
 
 365
 of the Fourth Geneva Convention concerning the protection of
 civilian populations under military occupation apply to its
 governance of the occupied territories, Israel claims it
 voluntarily observes most of these stipulations. The major
 exceptions are with respect to those provisions prohibiting
 the introduction of civilian settlers from the occupying
 power into occupied territories and the punitive deportation
 of individual inhabitants. In contravention of the gener-
 ally accepted interpretation of the Convention's Article 49,
 Israel has established over 76 nonmilitary settlements in
 the occupied territories, with a total population of about
 8,000 people.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Allegations about the use of torture by- Israeli officials
 during interrogation of Arab security suspects have been
 raised frequently. The most widely publicized allegations
 of this kind were contained in a lengthy report in the
 June 19, 1977 issue of the Sunday Times of London, which
 charged that there was a widespread pattern of officially
 condoned use of torture during interrogations in the occu-
 pied territories. This led to a lengthy series of rebuttals
 and counter-rebuttals, both from official Israeli sources
 and in the press.
 The Government of Israel denied the Sunday Times story,
 pointing out that use of torture is both contrary to official
 policy and prohibited by law and the Sunday Times itself
 later narrowed the scope of its allegations. To reinforce
 this policy, we understand from press reports that Prime
 Minister Begin, shortly after returning from the United
 States in July 1977, reconfirmed existing instructions con-
 cerning humane treatment of prisoners. To deter further
 allegations of mistreatment, Israel recently agreed to allow
 representatives of the International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC)- resident in Israel to visit detainees during the
 period of their interrogation, beginning on the fourteenth
 day after arrest. Previously, ICRC representatives have
 been allowed access to prisoners only after a longer period
 of time.
 
 
 366
 We know of no evidence to support allegations that'Israel
 follows a consistent practice or policy of using torture
 during interrogations. However, there are documented re-
 ports of the use of extreme physical and psychological
 pressures during interrogation, and instances of brutality
 by individual interrogators cannot be ruled out.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There have been instances in which Israeli troops, usually
 inexperienced reservists, used excessive force in quelling
 demonstrations and restoring order. These actions did not
 reflect government policy. The Israeli Government is inves-
 tigating reports of the recent beating of two Arab students
 by military authorities, allegedly for having participated
 in anti-Israeli demonstrations at Bir Zeit University. In
 several instances individuals found guilty of such excesses
 have been disciplined and, in at least one case, sent to jail.
 Steps have also been taken to provide riot-contfol training
 and equipment to special units in an attempt to avoid repe-
 tition of such occurrences.
 In contravention of the Fourth Geneva Convention, occupa-
 tion authorities have selectively expelled residents of the
 West Bank and Gaza suspected of having or known to have
 engaged in terrorism or anti-Israeli political agitation,
 although this practice has declined greatly in recent
 years. Other individuals convicted of or suspected of
 terrorism have had their homes demolished or sealed up and
 their families displaced, thereby inflicting a type of
 collective punishment.
 Overcrowding in prisons where security offenders are held,
 especially at Ashkelon, led to a series of hunger strikes by
 prisoners in early 1977. The ICRC, which does not normally
 speak out publicly, issued a statement noting that, while
 there had been some improvements, some of its recommen-
 dations to the Israeli authorities for improvements in
 medical services, cultural facilities and family contacts
 had not yet been implemented. There have been no recent
 ICRC statements on this subject.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 As of July 1977, there were about 3,100 non-Israeli-citizen
 Arabs under arrest or in prison in Israel proper, most of
 
 
 367
 whom were residents of the occupied territories. It is
 estimated that 75 percent of thesle were being held for
 security offenses, and of that number, about 20 are under
 administrative detention. The remainder of the alleged
 security offenders have either been tried and convicted by
 military courts, are awaiting trial, or are being held tem-
 porarily for investigation.
 Administrative detention is provided for under both Israeli
 law and the Jordanian and British mandatory codes that were
 in force before 1967 in the West Bank and Gaza respectively,
 and which continue in force there. Under the Fourth Geneva
 Convention, this practice is not permissible beyond one year
 from the "general close of military operations." Israel
 maintains that administrative detention is necessary in the
 limited number of cases in which presentation of evidence in
 a court proceeding would compromise sensitive security infor-
 mation. Such information often includes the nature of the
 security offense of which the detainee is suspected. Mili-
 tary commanders arc authorized to order the administrative
 detention without trial of any person on security grounds
 for up to six months. Such detention can be administratively
 extended indefinitely.
 Administrative detainees have three forms of recourse from
 detention orders:
 -- All such orders are reviewed by a committee appoin-
 ted by the regional military commander, which includes the
 regional legal advisor and which can hold hearings regarding
 the case.
 -- They have the right to appeal to an appeals com-
 mittee, headed by a civilian judge on reserve duty; the
 committee reviews each case every six months, whether the
 detainee has appealed or not.
 -- They also have the right to petition the Supreme
 Court of Israel for a writ of habeas corpus.
 In practice, these rights of appeal are rarely exercised and
 appeals have very rarely resulted in a reversal of the deci-
 sion of the military authorities.
 
 
 368
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 As required by the Geneva Convention, Jordanian law (with a
 few Israeli modifications) is still in force in the West Bank
 in civil and criminal matters. Its adjudication has been
 left in the hands of the indigenous judiciary, which carries
 out its duties in an equitable manner. Residents of the oc-
 cupied territories accused of non-security offenses receive
 fair public trials by local civilian courts. Alleged secur-
 ity offenders are, with the few exceptions cited in the above
 section, tried in Israeli military courts by military judges
 trained in law. These proceedings, although not always open
 to the public, are generally in accord with the standards of
 fair trials.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 Under standing emergency regulations, military authorities
 may enter private homes and institutions in pursuit of
 security objectives as they see fit. This has occurred
 frequently, sometimes resulting in damage to property and
 injury to inhabitants.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment'of
 Such Vital'Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 Residents of the occupied territories have complained that
 Israelis deliberately restrict economic development on both
 political and commercial grounds, thereby keeping the West
 Bank/Gaza as a captive market for Israel. Inhabitants of
 the occupied territories have also complained about the fact
 that Israel has applied the value-added tax to their economy,
 in contravention of the Geneva Convention. A further prob-
 lem results from the exploitation of a part of the West
 Bank's limited water resources for the use of Israeli set-
 tlements, which has in some cases caused Arab wells to dry
 up and has had detrimental effects on Arab agriculture.
 Nevertheless, real per-capita income has more than doubled
 under the Israeli occupation, largely because of the thou-
 sands of jobs now held by Palestinian Arab workers who com-
 mute to Israel proper,-and the gap between income levels in
 Israel and the territories has narrowed steadily since 1967.
 The economy of the occupied areas themselves, however, has
 
 
 369
 remained relatively stagnant, and many individdals, espec-
 ially those with higher education, feel compelled foreco-
 nomic reasons to migrate to Arab countries where greater
 economic opportunities exist.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion, and
 Assembly
 Implicit in the concept of military occupation is the propo-
 sition that observance of civil rights and liberties must
 be restricted by perceived security requirements. Freedom
 of religion in the occupied territories is unqualified.
 Freedom of expression and freedom of assembly are restricted
 by Israeli interpretation of security requirements. The West
 Bank press is very outspoken, but is subject to censorship.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Freedom of movement is generally unrestricted in the occu-
 pied territories and thousands of Arabs travel daily to
 Israel for work. Vehicles owned by inhabitants of the occu-
 pied territories are frequently stopped for security inspec-
 tion, particularly in Israel proper. Inhabitants of the
 territories, like Israelis, are required to carry identity
 cards. They are generally free to travel abroad and return,
 and many thousands cross the "open bridges" to Jordan every
 year. However, there are restrictions on the travel of
 individuals for political reasons. Inhabitants of the
 territories crossing from Jordan into the West Bank, as
 well as other Arabs or persons of Arab descent (sometimes
 including U.S. citizens), are subjected to rigorous searches
 of luggageand person for weapons and contraband.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Israel has twice permitted election of mayors and city
 councils on the West Bank. Political activity other than
 campaigning for municipal elections is forbidden, and no
 political parties are permitted. Israel permitted Arab
 
 
 370
 nationalists outspokenly hostile to Israel to run for office
 in the second West Bank election and honored the results of
 those elections.
 Israel and the Occupied Territories
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Allege6
 Violations of Eiunan Rights.
 The ICRC regularly inspects prison conditions Jn the oc-
 cupied territories and has made recommendations :cr or-r:v-
 ment. In 1970, the Israeli Government authorizec. Azne2:v
 International to conduct an investigation into reror:s 2
 ill-treatment of prisoners and detainees. Amnesty issued
 a report'which described accounts of several cases of mis-
 treatment it had received. Its recommendation of a formal
 inquiry with international participation was rejected by
 Israel. In October, 1976, Amnesty renewed its request for
 an investigation. Since then, it has expressed its concern
 about the imprisonment or treatment of a number of indivi-
 dual prisoners, Israeli Jews as well as Arabs, in several
 letters to Israel's Attorney General. According to an Al
 press release in the summer of 1977, none of these letters
 had received a reply.
 For several years, the UN Human Rights Commission and other
 UN bodies have adopted resolutions condemning alleged Is-
 raeli human rights violations in the occupied territories.
 The United States has voted against most of these reso-
 lutions, which we regard as one-sided, politically moti-
 vated, and based on unsubstantiated allegations. Israel.
 has been generally unresponsive to efforts by UN bodies to
 conduct investigations in territories under its jurisdiction,
 although it has made efforts to be forthcoming regarding
 visits by representatives of WHO, ILO and UL:ESCO. In 1576,
 Israel admitted an informal expertse group from '..1O to con-
 duct an investigation of health conditions in the occupied
 territories. When the group produced a report that reflec-
 ted favorably on Israel's administration, the report was
 rejected by the WHO Assembly on political grounds, without
 reference to the merits of the report.
 Because of this an'd other such incidents, Israel has not
 been disposed to respond favorably to requests for inter-
 national investigations. On the other hand, its decision
 to permit ICRC access to prisoners during the interrogation
 period is indicative of a willingness to cooperate with
 international bodies it regards as responsible.
