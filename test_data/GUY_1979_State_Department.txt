 GUYANA
 Since independence in 1966, Guyanese politics have been
 dominated by the Peoples National Congress (PNC) of Prime
 Minister Forbes Burnham. The PNC draws most of its support
 from the Afro-Guyanese who make up 42 percent of the
 population. The PNC sees as its principal task the crea-
 tion of a socialist society. The East Indian community,
 representing about 53 percent of the population, has
 largely backed the main opposi-ion political party, Dr.
 Cheddi Jagan's Peoples Progressive Party (PPP), a Marxist-
 Leninist organization which tends to follow the Moscow
 line. The adherence of the East Indian population to
 the PPP can be explained more by ethnic than by political
 loyalties. In mid-1979, the Working Peoples Alliance
 (WPA) emerged as an announced political party, also dedi-
 cated to socialism. The WPA appears to have a collegial
 leadership, including representatives of both major ethnic
 groups, with several of its members coming from the aca-
 demic world. There are, in addition, a few smaller po-
 litical parties generally representing more conservative
 views. The majority of the political opposition groups
 have accused the Government of manipulating the political
 system to seek authoritarian solutions when unable to
 generate ad.quate popular support for its policies.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by the Constitution. There have
 been no reported instances or allegations of the use
 of torture by the Government.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits such treatment or punishment.
 Members of the political opposition have alleged that
 conditions in some prisons do not meet legally established
 norms. There have been accusations, largely unproven,
 of occasional mistreatment during interrogation. Prisoners
 are permitted visits by family members and lawyers of
 their choice. While prison conditions are spartan, ade-
 quate diet and medical facilities appear to be available.
 Opponents of the Government have charged in the past
 year that arresting officers have used unnecessary force
 and have refused to identify themselves by name, position,
 and number, as required by regulation. The most recent
 instance was that of Working Peoples' Alliance leader
 and lawyer Moses Baghwan, who required medical attention
 after his arrest for participating in an unauthorized
 public meeting. The Guyana Bar Association called a
 one-day strike of the nations lawyers to protest this
 incident. The Government has not responded to these
 charges by the end of 1979.

 There have been no summary executions in Guyana. Although
 the death penalty is the obligatory sentence in convictions
 for murder, it has not been carried out in Guyana for
 a number of years.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The Constitution provides that no person may be deprived
 of personal liberty except as authorized by law. The
 right of habeas corpus exists and is generally respected.
 There have occurred a few cases of individuals arrested
 and held for several hours without charge. In August,
 1979, a prominent labor union leader who was leading
 a small demonstration of his striking members was taken
 into custody and threatened with removal to the interior
 of Guyana. He was released upon the intervention of
 a senior police official.
 The National Security Act, recently renewed, provides
 that persons suspected of crimes under the Act may be
 held up to three months without charges, after which
 they must be released or charged. Although there have
 been several recent arrests under the Act, those concerned
 have been charged promptly. These persons include some
 opposition leaders charged with arson in the aftermath
 of the July 11, 1979 fire which destroyed the Ministry
 of National Development and the PNC headquarters.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The independence of the judiciary and the integrity of
 the judicial process have been fairly well respected.
 The Constitution protects the right of anyone charged
 with a criminal offense to a fair hearing by a court
 established by law, and this right is respected in prac-
 tice. There have been no reports of trials held in camera
 nor have there been special courts established for "po-
 litical" offenses. On occasion allegations circulate
 that decisions, particularly in civil matters, are based
 upon political considerations. There are also allegations
 of unreasonable delays in judicial proceedings, although
 some delays are probably caused in part by personnel
 and material shortages.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The Government generally respects the individual's right
 to privacy at home. A few searches for contraband and
 weapons, however, have reportedly been carried out without
 warrants and in violation of Constitutional guarantees.
 The opposition maintains that some such searches have
 been politically motivated.

 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education:
 The.Government maintains that the fulfillment of vital
 needs takes priority over the observance of "intangible"
 human rights. It has declared that fulfillment of these
 needs is a major reason and justification for the prom-
 ulgation of a new socialist constitution which is currently
 in the consultative stage. The Government's stated goals
 include self-sufficiency in food production, supply of
 food at reasonable prices, adequate shelter for all,
 free health care and free education through the university
 level. The Government has achieved some success in meeting
 these goals despite severe economic problems, particularly
 in providing free primary education. The Government
 also provides subsidized housing for the poor.
 Official corruption is an acknowledged problem. The
 Burnham Administration has decried corruption, and has
 taken legal action in the past year against a group of
 officials and private citizens allegedly guilty of foreign
 exchange fraud.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion, and Assembly
 With the exception of a film censorship board, which
 makes political (e.g., promotion of socialism) as well
 as moral judgements, there is no formal media censorship.
 The Government can control, through import licensing
 and foreign exchange permits, the flow of written material
 into Guyana, which has been minimal due to the shortage
 of foreign exchange. Nevertheless, a few imported publi-
 cations are permitted, such as the weekly "Caribbean
 Contact" published in Barbados, which are highly critical
 of Prime Minister Burnham's Administration.
 During the past year the Government purchased the only
 privately-owned radio station in Guyana, which had become
 insolvent. Thus, both stations operating in Guyana are
 government-owned. The stations are highly selective
 in reporting the activities of opposition groups, and
 both have refused to accept, either as news or paid pro-
 gramming, material critical of the Government and announce-
 ments from the Council of Churches, the Roman Catholic
 Church, and opposition groups. Many, if not most, Guyanese
 listen to foreign radio broadcasts, such as the BBC,
 the VOA, and regional stations which feature news about
 Guyana.
 In September the Government refused to continue to make
 limited amounts of newsprint available to the organ of
 the People's Progressive Party, the Mirror, and refused
 
 
 to permit the Mirror to import newsprint purchased with
 funds held abroad-by the PPP and its supporters. The
 Mirror is now a two-page weekly. As a consequence, the
 only regularly published daily in the country is the
 government-owned Chronicle. (Another government-owned
 daily was suspended, avowedly because of the newsprint
 shortage). The weekly Catholic Standard, published by
 the Roman Catholic Church in Guyana, continues to be
 published in the reduced format initiated in 1978 when
 its use of the government-owned presses was denied.
 The Standard is highly critical of the Government. The
 police also seized the mimeograph machine and supplies
 of a small anti-government party which had put out a
 weekly newsheet.
 There has been no government interference with the rights
 of citizens to practice their religion, although, on
 occasion, some religious groups have had difficulty ob-
 taining permission for priests or pastors to reside in
 remote areas of the country. Some religious groups,
 notably the Guyana Council of Churches and the Roman
 Catholic Church, have received crude generalized threats
 in government-controlled media, particularly the weekly
 organ of the ruling PNC. Foreign-born clergy appear
 to be particular targets. The photographer for the Catholic
 Standard, a British-born Jesuit, was attacked and killed
 while photographing an anti-government demonstration
 in July, 1979. The individual charged by police with
 this murder is alleged by opposition groups to have been
 a member of a religious cult they believe to be closely
 associated with the Government.
 Freedom of assembly is guaranteed under the present Consti-
 tution. The Government maintains that police permission
 is required for large public meetings, while the opposition
 groups contend that the law requires them only to inform
 the police of the intention to sponsor a meeting. Oppo-
 sition rallies that have not had police permission have
 been broken up. Opposition meetings have been held with
 the permission of the police, although in September a
 police-sanctioned meeting of the Working Peoples' Alliance
 was broken up by thugs who the opposition claims operated
 under Government direction. One person has been charged
 by the police in this incident.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, and Emigration
 There is freedom to move about Guyana, save for isolated
 areas where the Government has announced its intention
 of protecting American Indian civilizations. Citizens
 may generally travel abroad and emigrate, although travel
 for personal reasons is hampered by strict currency con-
 trols. In late summer of 1979 there were credible reports
 that the Government had confiscated the passports of
 some individuals known to oppose actively the Government.
 The passports were subsequently returned following court
 
 
 338
 action. In another instance, which received wide publicity
 in the regional media, police attempted to remove a Guyanese
 citizen from a departing aircraft, but permitted departure
 after delaying it for several hours. There have been
 no instances in which political opposition leaders were
 denied permission to re-enter Guyana.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Guyana is a constitutional democracy with a parliamentary
 system of government based on the Westminster model.
 Under the Constitution, elections were due before October
 26, 1978. However, in July 1978 the Government held
 a referendum seeking approval for a two-thirds majority
 of the parliament to amend the Constitution. A number
 of opposition groups, including the major opposition
 party (the PPP), called on the electorate to boycott
 the referendum. The Government claimed, nonetheless,
 that 78 percent of those eligible voted, whereas opposition
 groups maintained that less than 15 percent did so.
 With the Government's announcement that an overwhelming
 majority had approved the referendum, the PNC-controlled
 parliament voted to prolong its sitting and institute
 a Constituent Assembly consisting of itself and a few
 selected additional persons who would promulgate a new
 socialist constitution. General elections are to be
 held following the promulgation of the new Constitution.
 The latter was expected to be accomplished by the fall
 of 1979. However, the Government announced in October
 that the Constitution was not yet ready and postponed
 elections until some time in 1980. The Constituent As-
 sembly, although boycotted by the PPP, but not by the
 United Force party which has two seats, continues to
 hold sessions in Georgetown and other parts of the country.
 The initial draft proposal of the ruling PNC for a new
 constitution would create an Executive Presidency to
 be filled by the leader of the majority party.
 All citizens are eligible to participate in the political
 process, and citizenship is not denied on political grounds.
 Active participation in opposition political groups,
 some of which the Government regards as subversive, ap-
 parently led to political reprisals in the fall of 1979.
 Several teachers active in the WPA were transferred to
 schools in remote areas of the country. Some government
 opponents, including a prominent businessman who signed
 (with seventy-odd others) a petition calling for a "broad
 front" government were forbidden to leave the country
 pending re-examination of their tax forms or for other
 reasons. Others are said to have been discriminated
 against in connection with their employment. Prime Min-
 ister Burnham has stated that government employees are
 free to join the opposition without fear of reprisal,
 but that the Government will not permit political activity
 on the job.
 
 
 339
 The Government advocates full equality for women in all
 phases of Guyanese life, and has proposed further safe-
 guards for women's rights for the new constitution (e.g.,
 children born out of wedlock are to have the same rights
 as those born within wedlock). Until her recent resig-
 nation, there was one woman cabinet member, and an increas-
 ing number of women are reaching senior positions in
 government, private enterprise, and politics. while
 in practice women have not yet achieved full equality
 in all aspects of Guyanese society, both government and
 opposition groups are pledged to equality for women.
 Progress is being made.
 There has long been a tradition of active free labor
 unions in Guyana. Rights to organize, strike, bargain
 collectively, and lobby are provided by law and until
 recently by tradition. During the past year, government
 actions have been taken against specific unions. The
 Government has stated that while unions have the right
 to strike for political (as distinct from industrial)
 reasons, in these cases the Government in turn has the
 right to take political action against them. Some eighty
 workers were dismissed under government pressure when
 their unions actively supported a strike of bauxite workers
 in late summer. The unions and the Guyana Trade Union
 Congress maintain that the Government's action violated
 the spirit of the laws and Guyanese labor traditions.
 The Government has been accused of trying to weaken dis-
 sident unions by pressuring their members to switch to
 unions supportive of the Government, and by harassing
 union leaders. The Government has proposed changes in
 union organization and in overall industrial relations
 which purportedly will better reflect the movement toward
 socialism. Eighty percent of the Guyanese economy is
 now owned by the state, and the Government believes that
 relations between workers and management of government-
 owned entities should operate under principles different
 from those between workers and management in the private
 sector. Amnesty International in 1978 expressed concern
 to the Guyanese Government about alleged police harassment
 of workers during a strike.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-government Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights:
 The principal allegation of human rights violations voiced
 by the opposition is that Prime Minister Burnham's PNC
 has consistently rigged elections from 1968 through the
 referendum of July 1978 and that free and fair elections
 are impossible under the present Government. The oppo-
 sition continues to call for investigations and supervision
 of future elections by outside observers. Prime Minister
 Burnham has steadfastly opposed outside observers or
 investigators.
