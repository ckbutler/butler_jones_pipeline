 BAHAMAS
 The Bahamas is a stable, multi-party, parliamentary democracy.
 Its political and legal traditions are similar to those of
 Great Britain and the United States, and emphasize rights of
 the person. The governmental structure is patterned after that
 of Great Britain, with a prime minister, a cabinet, a parlia-
 ment, an independent judiciary, and regular national elections.
 The Bahamas is multi-racial and religiously diverse. There is
 universal adult suffrage and regular elections are held.
 The economy is based on free enterprise but with state owner-
 ship of public utilities, hotels, the broadcasting facility,
 and Bahamas Air. There is a high degree of government
 direction of the economy. Although highly dependent (75
 percent) on tourism and centered on Nassau and Freeport, the
 economy is fairly prosperous. Benefits in health, educa- tion,
 and social welfare programs are distributed on a nondis-
 criminatory basis.
 The country has an excellent record on human rights obser-
 vance. The Constitution protects fundamental rights and
 freedoms without discrimination by reason of race, origin,
 political opinions, color, creed, or sex. The judiciary is
 independent, and the Privy Council in the United Kingdom serves
 as the court of final appeal.
 No major changes have occurred in human rights observance in
 the past year.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There have been no killings for political motives. There are
 no known terrorist groups in the country.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no cases of abduction, secret arrests, or
 clandestine detention.
 c. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by the Constitution and is not practiced.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment is prohib-
 ited by the Constitution. There continue to be occasional
 reports that the police use excessive force when making
 arrests. The judiciary has reprimanded police officers when
 allegations appear to have foundation in fact.
 The downtown Nassau holding cells, where persons can be
 confined 48 hours or more while awaiting preliminary hearing,
 are small, crowded, and unsanitary. The similar women's insti-
 tution appears to be less austere and more modern. Conditions
 at the Fox Hill prison are austere, although the prison has a
 rehabilitation program involving auto mechanics and arts and
 crafts.

 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment
 and requires that a person be charged without undue delay.
 This is observed in practice. There are no political
 prisoners. Habeus Corpus is carefully observed. Charges must
 be placed within 24 hours of an arrest.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are fair and public. The Constitution entitles defen-
 dants to counsel, and access to defendents is freely
 permitted. The judiciary is independent of executive or
 military control, and there is no political interference.
 There are no military courts.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Sanctity of the home is safeguarded by custom, law, and tradi-
 tion and is respected in practice. The Constitution permits
 searches to occur only with a warrant issued by a court.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a.  Freedom of Speech and Press
 There is full freedom of speech and press. There are three
 daily newspapers, one radio stationwith three frequencies, and
 one television station. Some of the newspapers support
 political parties, including the radical left. The television
 station is government-owned and has been accused of biased
 political reporting. There is no political censorship or
 intimidation of journalists.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution protects the right to assemble freely and
 associate with others, and specifically mentions political
 parties and trade unions. Labor unions are independent of
 government and are free to organize, assemble, bargain, and
 strike. Approximately 25 percent of the labor force is unem-
 ployed including government workers. In March 1982, the
 communications workers struck for more pay and organized a
 widely-observed general strike, with no governmental interfer-
 ence. Many unions are affiliated with US counterparts and the
 International Labor Organization.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion. Freedom of conscience is protected
 and discrimination on the basis of creed is prohibited. Church
 groups are active in the society and several US church affili-
 ated organizations operate in the Bahamas.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is full freedom in all of these areas. A particular
 problem of continuing and serious concern for the government is
 that of Haitian refugees. There are an estimated 12,000 to
 20,000 illegal Haitians now residing in the Bahamas (over five
 percent of the population). Although voluntary repatriation is
 acceptable to the Government of Haiti, it has suspended
 repatriation of individuals arrested by the Bahamian Govern-
 ment. This impasse has not been resolved to date.
 
 
 398
 The Bahamas continues to be tested by the arrival of illegal
 aliens, principally Haitians, but has for the most part
 maintained a reasonable, humane approach while insisting upon
 its sovereign right to repatriate illegals to their country of
 origin. In occasional instances, the Government has felt it
 necessary to employ non-lethal forcible methods in arresting
 Haitians for deportation. This has resulted in a breakdown in
 the Bahamas/Haiti repatriation agreement. Presently, only
 voluntary repatriation of individuals is acceptable to the
 Government of Haiti. The Haitian prisoners still in jail in
 the Bahamas are there because the Haitian Government has
 refused to repatriate them after arrangements had been made by.
 the Catholic church.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Bahamas is a constitutional parliamentary democracy
 governed by a freely elected prime minister and parliament.
 The political process is open to all sectors of the society.
 Notwithstanding the transfer of political power from the white
 elite to a black majority (80 percent), Bahamian whites
 cbntinue to play an active role in the political process, both
 elective and appointive. At the present time, despite their
 minority status, a few white Bahamians hold high-level civil
 service and political posts, and one is a member of parliament.
 Legally and in practice women enjoy equal status. Women serve
 as permanent secretaries in ministries and hold one seat in
 parliament. Women are well represented in the professional and
 private sectors, even serving as president of the Chamber of
 Commerce in 1981/82. Many businesses on Bay Street are
 operated by women. Several of the magistrates are female and
 women serve as uniformed police officers.
 The Bahamas has a dominant political party, the Progressive
 Liberal Party, which won independence for the country in 1973
 without violence. Before independence the same party led the
 country for seven years of internal self-government. It has
 grown stronger over the years and now holds 32 of the 43 seats
 in parliament. The Free National Movement, a party to the
 right of the government party, holds the other eleven seats. A
 minor party, the Vanguard, on the left, has no seats. The
 Progressive Liberal Party has used its authority and power of
 office to strengthen its political position and, conversely, to
 weaken the opposition through selective political appoint-
 ments. There have been accusations of "victimization" or the
 use of its dominant position to punish the opposition in terms
 of jobs and business contracts.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights.
 Participation by the Bahamas in international organizations and
 activities, although limited by its representational resources,
 has increased in 1982. The Bahamas joined the Organization of
 American States and the Rio Treaty. There have been no
 requests to investigate human rights conditions in the Bahamas.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Although the Bahamas is made up of some 700 islands, only ten
 have populations of any size. Of these, New Providence
 (Nassau) and Grand Bahama Island contain over 75 percent of the
 Bahamian population of about 250,000 people. Most economic and
 
 
 399
 cultural activities take place on these two islands. Partly
 due to this, the other islands, particularly those in the
 southern region, have suffered depopulation over the years as
 individuals have moved to the two major centers of activity.
 The Government is seeking through various programs to revi-
 talize the "family islands" (those other than New Providence
 and Grand Bahama) in an attempt to discourage this urban
 drift. Programs emanating from the Ministry of Agriculture
 seek to encourage agriculture and fishing opportunities; the
 Ministry of Tourism is attempting to locate new tourist facili-
 ties in the "family islands" rather than on New Providence and
 Grand Bahama, and the Ministries of Health and Education are
 both seeking to strengthen their programs in these areas. The
 Government is also working out a system of local government
 rather than the present commissioner system which is directed
 from Nassau. Thus far, the Government has been unsuccessful
 and the exodus to Freeport and Nassau continues.
 The Bahamas has a good record of nondiscrimination on sexual,
 racial, or religious grounds. Women participate prominently in
 all levels of business and government. There is no state
 religion, and there are no advantages to belonging to any
 particular religion.
 According to the Bahamian statistics, the Bahamas has seen
 marked iprovement in health conditions during the decade of
 the 1970M's. Life expectancy at birth rose from 65.7 at the
 beginning of the decade to 69.0 by 1979. During the same
 period, the infant mortality rate dropped from 40 per 1,000
 live births to 32. The stillbirth rate dropped from 21.5 in
 1970 to 12.7 in 1980. The annual population growth rate is
 approximately 3.6 percent. World Bank and AID statistics
 indicate that access to safe water remained at 65 percent
 during the 1970's, with 100 percent in urban areas but only 13
 percent for rural areas in 1979. The water system in Nassau is
 old and delapidated and if not renewed soon, the number of
 people having access to safe water could drop. Many families
 drink only bottled water, but that is too expensive for most
 Bahamians. Due to the small, scattered communities in the
 "family islands," the difficulties of providing safe water are
 significant.
 The World Bank statistics show that the percent of calorie
 supply available for consumption relative to nutritional
 requirements was 101 percent in 1970. This was reduced to 96
 percent by 1979. In recognition of this deterioration, the
 Ministry of Education launched a multi-million dollar school
 lunch program. This will ensure that children receive at least
 one hot meal each day.
 In addition to 860 hospital beds and Ministry of Health doctors
 who make regular trips to the "family islands," Bahamians have
 easy access to commercial medical treatment in the United
 States. Many Bahamians take full advantage of this in an
 emergency and when serious surgery is called for. The Govern-
 ment's expenditure on health rose from $1.3 million in 1970 to
 an estimated $4.9 million in 191.
 Restructuring of education is continuing. The Government is
 placing new emphasis on technical and vocational training,
 since some skilled jobs in the economy are performed by
 foreigners due to the lack of sufficient numb rs of Bahamians.
 While literacy rates have remained constant at 93 percent over
 the past decade, shortages of teachers, equipment, and
 supplies, as well as deterioration of many schools have
 
 
 400
 resulted in a weakening of quality education in the public
 school system. The Government has reemphasized education.
 There are a total of 225 schools in the Bahamas of which 62 are
 primary.
 Per capita GNP was estimated by the World Bank at $2,030 in
 1970 and $2,750 in 1979. The World Fact Book estimated per
 capita GNP at $4,650. Since no national accounts are kept,
 these figures are only rough estimates. Inflation in 1981 was
 an estimated 13 percent. Coupled with inflationary pressures
 has been a large increase in the labor force. Estimates now
 put unemployment at approximately 50 percent for the Bahamians
 between 16 and 24 years of age. The social results of the
 unemployment are serious. Some of the unemployed have appar-
 ently turned to crime and to drug smuggling.
 The Government is trying to reduce unemployment. The most
 important effort is to attempt to create new jobs in tourism,
 through both private and public investment.
 In cultural terms, the Bahamas is a vibrant society. There are
 a number of excellent Bahamian musicians, writers, and
 artists. They are heavily influenced by black American and
 African values in addition to the accumulated experiences of
 their own history.
