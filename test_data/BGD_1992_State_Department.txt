 BANGLADESH
 Bangladesh is a parliamentary democracy in which Prime Minister Khaleda Zia's
 Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) enjoys a parliamentary majority. The party at-
 taied a plurality in the February 1991 election and reached a majority through the
 nomination of female members of Parliament to reserved seats and through subse-
 quent by-elections.
 The police and paramilitary forces, which are controlled by the Home Affairs Min-
 istry, bear primary responsibility for maintaining internal security. The army and
 the paramilitary forces play an internal security role in the Chittagong Hill Tracts
 (CHT), where an insurgency by a tribal group, the Shanti Bahini, is entering its
 20th year. The first 7 months of 1992, some of the most violent in recent years, were
 marred by a series of attacks by the insurgents and reprisals by the security forces
 and Bengali settlers. On April 10, a reprisal attack involving security forces oc-
 curred at Logong Village in the CHT. According to the official government report
 on the incident released in October, 13 tribals were killed, 13 injured, and 550 huts
 burned. The report also criticized the security forces for concentrating on areas like
 law enforcement best left to civil authorities. In August the insurgents proclaimed
 a unilateral cease-fire, which lessened tensions and led to the scheduling of talks
 between the insurgents and the Government in the fall. The initial meetings be-
 tween the two sides in November and December were introductory in nature, and
 the two sides were planning to meet again in February 1993. According to the US
 Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, total military expenditures for 1989 were
 $323 million. There is no indication that efforts will be made to reduce these ex-
 penditures in the near future.
 Bangladesh remains one of the world's poorest countries. Agriculture, largely sub-
 sistence farming heavily dependent on monsoonal rainfall, makes up about half of
 the gross domestic product. Jute, garments, and fish are the nation's leading ex-
 ports. The new Government has promised to undertake reforms in the economic sec-
 tor, but so far implementation has been slow and uneven. These reforms face resist-
 ance from many who fear losing de facto monopolies and guaranteed jobs or who
 want protection from foreign competition.
 The human rights situation deteriorated in 1992 compared with the previous
 year. Free and fair elections to local government councils were held, but the Govern-
 ment showed heightened sensitivity to criticism and dissent and increasingly used
 the Special Powers Act (SPA) t- detain citizens without formal charges. There were
 credible reports of custodial abuse and death. A rally of former president Ershad's
 party, the Jatiyo Party (JP), was disrupted by orchestrated attacks by government
 supporters, reportedly with police assistance. The Government's own commission on
 the Logong incident criticized the military for overreacting. Lethal force was used
 on four occasions to quell disturbances among the Rohingya refugees, who fear
 forced repatriation to Burma. Antirep striation refugees attacked both refugees wish-
 ing to return and government officials working in the camps. There were also credi-
 ble reports that the Government used coercion in repatriating a number of refugees.
 Child labor also remains a serious problem, with an estimated 3 million children
 in the work force. There were numerous reports of violence against women in 1992.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing. -Violent confrontations between rival
 student groups, representing different political parties, plagued university and
 lower-level educational institutions throughout 1992. A rash of particularly grue-
 some executions took place at several universities. The year also witnessed an in-
 creased number of politically motivated strikes which resulted in violence. The par-
 ticipants in these clashes were often armed, and their confrontations resulted in in-
 jury and sometimes death. The police and security forces, aware of the political na-
 ture of these disputes, were reluctant to intervene.
 The Union Parishad (local council) elections in January and February resulted in
 approximately 20 deaths (compared to several hundred killed during the previous
 such elections in 1988). There were a number of credible reports of deaths in police
 custody during 1992 (see Section 1.c.). There was no indication that the authorities
 investigated these reported deaths or punished those responsible. However, in an
 
 
 1120
 effort to curb abuse inprisons, the Minister of Home Affairs now requires a mag-
 istrate's investigation of any deaths in police custody.
 For a discussion of killings related to the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) insur-
 gency, see Section 1.g.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no confirmed reports of disappearance resulting
 from official actions in 1992. There were press reports that tribal insurgents in the
 Chittagong Hill Tracts kidnaped an undetermined number of Bengali settlers. Most
 of these settlers were reportedly released after the payment of small ransoms.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the Constitution forbids torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading punish-
 ment, police treatment of accused criminals and other detainees, including those
 held on political charges, is usually rough and can include torture and other abusive
 treatment during interrogations. Sometimes the abuse leads to the death of the pris-
 oner, and in 1992 human rights activists reported that between 5 and 15 persons
 died while in police custody. Although the exact figure of deaths in police custody
 cannot be confirmed, a large proportion of such deaths are believed to occur while
 detainees are held under police remand, the period between arrest and incarceration
 in one of the country's jails. In practice, remand often appears intended to extract
 confessions or other information through the use of physical intimidation. While de-
 tainees are legally entitled to see an attorney during remand, many detainees in
 fact are not allowed to contact legal help, cannot afford it, or are not aware of their
 rights. The Government requires a magistrate's investigation of deaths in detention.
 While there were no reported prosecutions for such deaths in 1992, there were re-
 ports of suspensions pending the outcome of administrative investigations.
 There are three classes of prison facilities. Class "C" cells generally hold common
 criminals, suspected terrorists, and low-level political workers. They often have dirt
 floors, no furnishings, and poor quality food, and the use of handcuffs and fetters
 is common. Prisoners in these cells reportedly suffer the most abuse, such as beat-
 ings and being forced to kneel for long periods. Conditions in "B" and "A" cells are
 markedly better, with the latter reserved for prominent persons.
 Supporters of former President Ershad continue to maintain that his prison condi-
 tions are inhumane. They complain that he is being kept in solitary confinement
 and denied access to medical tests he can only receive outside of prison. In October
 a fact-finding report sponsored by the Supreme Court stated that Ershad receives
 substantially better treatment than other "A" cell prisoners. The Supreme Court has
 not yet rendered judgment on the merits of the case.
 In 1992 there were a number of claims filed with magistrates against police and
 jail officials involved in alleged cases of abuse. However, none of the accused was
 brought up on legal charges, although several police officers were temporarily sus-
 pended pending an administrative inquiry into the beating of a suspect.
 The Government seldom undertakes an investigation or punishes those respon-
 sible for such abuses. The Government does not interfere with human rights groups'
 inquiries into cases of alleged prisoner abuse.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Under the Special Powers Act of 1974
 (SPA), the Government may detain a erson without charye for an initial period of
 30 days to prevent the commission of any prejudicial act, as loosely defined in the
 legislation. The Government is obligated to charge the detainee formally by the end
 of this period or release him if it Tails to file a charge. In practice, prisoners are
 held for longer periods without charge. The person may legally be held until comple-
 tion of an investigation if the Government brings a charge. In practice, though not
 in law, the detainee has 15 days to respond to the specific charge in writing to the
 Home Affairs Ministry, which may grant early release.
 Detentions under the SPA are not subject to judicial review until after 6 months,
 at which time a panel of three officials, including two judges, examines the case to
 ascertain whether there is sufficient reason to continue the detention. Although the
 detainee is legally entitled to see a lawyer at the time he is detained, in practice
 a lawyer is generally not allowed to see the detainee until a specific charge has been
 filed. Detainees are allowed to see visitors and are not held incommunicado.
 Although the Government pledged to repeal the SPA during the 1991 election
 campaign, it now asserts that the SPA is needed to deal with the deteriorating law
 and order situation. The Home Ministry confirmed that over 3,000 people are cur-
 rently being detained under the SPA. Additionally, in the year from Aug st 1991
 until July 1992, out of 1,742 detainees held under the SPA whose cases have been
 examined by the High Court, 1,691 were freed on the grounds that their detention
 was illegal.
 These statistics belie the Government's claim that the SPA is only used against
 those facing legitimate criminal charges. Human rights monitors allege, with some
 
 
 1121
 justification, that the SPA is being used to settle political scores against members
 of the opposition, including members of Ershad's Jatiyo Party.
 In September a new antiterrorism ordinance was promulgated by the Government
 and approved by Parliament in November. The new law, entitled "The Suppression
 of Terroristic Offenses Bill,' provides that special tribunals will be created to try
 various offenses within specified and compressed time frames. The listed offenses
 include: extortion, destruction of propert, hijacking, abduction, and "creating anar-
 chy." No warrants will be required for ;e arrests, and during the initial investiga-
 tory stage of 1 month no bail may be set for the detainee. Following considerable
 controversy after the ordinance was first promulgated, the bill was rewritten to
 allow the Chief Justice (instead of the Government) to select the tribunal judges,
 appeal of all sentences to the High Court, and compensation for those wrongfully
 convicted by the special tribunals. Additionally, the bill will oaly be operative for
 a period of 2 years, unless extended by Parliament. Even with these adjustments,
 opponents of the bill remain concerned tha  t could be applied as indiscriminately
 as the SPA and lead to many more arbitrary detentions.
 There were no reports of persons being exiled in 1992.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL.-The Supreme Court and the High Court division
 are considered to act independently in most cases. Civilian courts hear civil and
 criminal cases in public trials, and the right of counsel is respected but not guaran-
 teed. Criminal courts are considered to be rife with corruption. Civil courts are over-
 burdened and effectively available only to those who can afford representation. The
 time-cnsuming and expensive process of pursuing cases discourages many from
 seeking redress through the courts. There are few legal aid programs to assist liti-
 mants and no public defenders. A shorta e of judges and courts and a backlog of over
 00,000 criminal and civil cases makes rong delays a common occurrence. Addition-
 ally, the appellate courts report a backlog of 47,465 cases. Prominent lawyers be-
 lieve there is little chance these backlogs will be cleared, especially since the Gov-
 ernment has taken no measures to augment the size and efficiency of the judiciary.
 Former President Ersh-,ad, who had earier been convited on charges of illegal
 possession of weapons, was convicted and sentenced in 1992 on the charge of pos-
 sessing wealth beyond his known source of income. He was sentenced to 3 years'
 imprisonment and is currently interned in Dhaka's central prison. Other cases
 against him and members of h is regime for orruption are currently being tried.
 Ershad has been represented by counsel throughout the proceedings. His trials have
 been open to the press and public, and appear to conform to standard Bangladesh
 legal practice.
 The Government claims to hold no political prisoners. Bangladesh human rights
 groups assert, however, that some persons detained under the SPA are political
 prisoners, including individuals arrested for allegedly aiding the CHT tribal insur-
 gency as well as members of Ershad's Jatiyo Party.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family. Home, or Correspondence.-Ban.
 ladesh law ordinarily requires a judicial warrant before authorities may enter a
 Rome, and courts require evidence supporting a reasonable suspicion before issuing
 a warrant. However, the SPA permits authonties to search premises without a war-
 rant under certain circumstances. The Government's civilian and military intel-
 lience services are believed to monitor the opposition by such means as selective
 wretaps and interception of mail.
 g.Use of Excessive Force and "Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 licts.-A Bangladeshi tribal insurgent groupcalled the Shanti Bahini has been en-
 Saged in a low-level conflict with Banggadesh security forces in the Chittagng Hill
 Tracts (CHT) since the early 1970's. The insurgency is sustained by the tribal peo-
 ple's fears that their traditional way of life and special status in the hill areas are
 being und ermined by Bengali settlers.
 The Government is attempting to address tribal grievances by establishing and
 supporting elected district councils and by discouraging further settlement. First es-
 tabBishedn 1990, the couni ls assumed de jure cntrol of local government in June
 1991, subject to tawe military's veto power over any matter that could affect security.
 The councils have not yet been given control over the issues of greatest concern to
 the tribals, including control over land and law and order.
 Since 1985, the Government has tried to discourage Bengali settlement in the Hill
 Tracts, and there has been no further large-scale systematic settlement. Individual
 Bengalis continue to settle in the CHT, however. Although there are no precise fig-
 ures available, the number of Bengalis residing in the Hill Tracts continues to grow
 but not at the same rate as in the 1960's and 1970's. In 1947 only 3 percent of the
 CHT's inhabitants were Bengali. At present, Bengalis make up 45 percent of the
 CHT's population.
 
 
 1122
 
 Both the Shanti Bahini and the Government accuse each other of human rights
 violations. Because access to the Hill Tracts is limited by government travel restric-
 tions, difficult terrain, and the unsafe travel conditions caused by the ongoing insur-
 gency, it is difficult to verify allegations of atrocities. In the past Shanti Bahini at-
 tacks on Bengali settlers have led to reprisal attacks by Bengais on tribal settle-
 ments.
 On April 10, a reprisal attack took place in Logong village in Khagrachari district.
 According to the Government's Inquiry Commission's report issued in October, 13
 tribals were shot and killed and 13 others injured by regional and village security
 forces, while Bengali settlers burned down 550 huts. These actions were taken in
 retaliation for the killing of one Bengali settler by the Shanti Bahini. The Inquiry
 Commission criticized the military for straying from counterinsurgency efforts into
 areas-such as law enforcement and judicial areas-best left to the civil authorities.
 Human rights monitors have asserted that the Inquiry Commission's report
 underestimates the number of tribal casualties, and they continue to claim that any-
 where from several dozen to hundreds died in the attack. The Commission's expla-
 nation of events at Logong is credible, but it is not possible to confirm the number
 of casualties. The Logong incident coincided with an increase in CHT violence which
 began in June 1991 when the Shanti Bahini mounted a number of attacks against
 Bengali settlers and security forces. This was viewed by many observers as an at-
 tempt to disrupt the Government's local autonomy program. In July the Govern-
 ment formed a parliamentary committee to look into the causes of CHT violence and
 assess possible solutions. In Augst, possibly in response to the formation of the
 parliamentary committee, the Shanti Bahini unilaterally announced a 3-month
 cease-fire. On November 5 and December 26, the parliamentary committee met with
 representatives of the Parbattya Chattagram Jana Sanphati Samity (PCJSS), the
 political wing of the Shanti Bahini which includes Shanti Bahini members. The two
 sides agreed to meet again in February 1993, and the PCJSS agreed to extend the
 cease-fire until March 31, 1993.
 In May 1991, the Chittagong Hill Tracts Commission, composed of a group of Eu-
 ropean, Canadian, and Australian nongovernmental organizations, issued the first
 concise report on the human rights situation in the CHT. The report was critical
 of some aspects of past and present Bangladesh government policy in the CHT. In
 particular, the report criticized the militarization of all facets of life in the CHT and
 the destruction of tribal society and culture, as well as its indigenous economy, by
 concentrating the population into cluster villages as part of the counterinsurgency
 strategy. ligong village was itself a cluster village. The Commission also concluded
 that government development and agricultural programs are causing grave ecologi-
 cal damage to the area and destroying the habitat of the tribal peoples. The Com-
 mission noted that all parties to the conflict suffer violence and human rights
 abuses, but it was most critical of the effects of continued Bengali settlement and
 government policies on the indigenous tribal peoples of the CHT. The Government
 disputed many of the report's claims and criticized it as one-sided.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and the press are provided
 for in the Constitution, subject only to "reasonable restrictions." Freedom of speech
 is generally respected, although some entertainers working for the Government re-
 portedly were blacklisted temporarily due to their opinions on the controversy sur-
 rounding Golam Azam, the leader of the fundamentalist Jamaat Islai Party who
 is now in prison. Under the current Government, speech and press rights are re-
 spected to a far greater extent than they were under the Ershad regime, which
 ended in December 1990.
 There are a large number of publications, with a wide variety of editorial views.
 There is no overt censorship but, according to some journalists, self-censorship is a
 routine practice. No newspapers were seized or shut down in 1992. The Prime Min-
 ister is criticized directly by the opposition press, as are government policies, and
 opposition leaders and policies receive ample press coverage. However, .in 1992 two
 monthlies published by tribals in the Chittagong Hill Tracts were banned for alleg-
 edly supporting the cause of tribal insurgents there. Additionally, two other
 monthlies werebanned on the grounds that they contained pornography. The import
 of an Indian journal, Desh, also was banned.
 The Government's control of a significant advertising budget continues to fuel
 charges that the it uses its leverage to pressure editors to moderate their criticisms.
 Government advertising reportedly accounts for as much as 75 percent of advertis-
 ing revenue. All publications are legallyeligible to receive public sector advertising
 if they meet circulation requirements. ditors complain, however, that the placing
 and withholding of advertising, as well as payment for it, are used as a means of
 
 
 1123
 influencing the press and punishing those publications that frequently criticize gov-
 ernment policies.
 Concerns about government advertising policy were heightened in 1992 due to the
 Minister of Information's repeated remarks that the Government would distribute
 advertisements to publications based on their "objectivity." Such a policy would
 mean overturning the present system of giving papers with the highest circulation
 the most advertisements. The Minister's comments were sharply criticized by the
 journalists' union, and no government policy changes had been implemented as of
 the end of the year. The Government continues to provide at least some advertising
 to all papers. Such allotments are not always in direct proportion to circulation,
 however. The opposition Jatiyo Party newspaper Janata receives less advertising
 than its circulation would merit, while the ruling party's newspaper Dinkal has
 more advertisements than this relatively less popular daily would merit.
 The relationship between the press and t e police became heated following a
 widely publicized incident on June 21 when police beat several photorphers, then
 chased a group of journalists into the National Press Club. This incident took place
 during a protest over the imprisonment of Golam  Azam. The incident was substan-
 tially defused when the Government subsequently appointed an inquiry commission
 to investigate the incident. The commission's report has not been released, and no
 police officers have been disciplined.
 The political storm around Golam Azam also led to attacks on several newspaper
 offices by private citizens. During these attacks, a number of journalists were in-
 jured, and several offices were destroyed. The Government was not implicated in
 these attacks, which were reportedly carried out by extremists on both sides of the
 Azam issue.
 Foreign publications are generally available in Bangladesh. However, the Govern-
 ment has sometimes used the Customs Act of 1969 to prevent or delay the importa-
 tion of foreign material. For example, the Government ban on the book "The Satanic
 Verses" remains in effect, and an issue of the Far Eastern Economic Review was
 delayed 1 week due to an article on the Golam Azain matter. However, no foreign
 journalists were arrested, barred from entry, or expelled in 1992. No arrests were
 reported under the 1991 Penal Code which contains a clause prohibiting the publica-
 tion or circulation of any statement "prejudicial to the interest of the security of
 Bangladesh or public order."
 A pledge made by the BNP before the February 1991 elections to  ant autonomy
 to the broadcast media has not been carried out, and they remained under govern-
 ment ownership and editorial control. While both television and radio did cover op-
 position activities in 1992, this coverage was not extensive; the Government consist-
 ently received substantially larger and more favorable coverage. The Government
 also owns BSS, the national news service. The other wire service, the United News
 of Bangladesh, is privately owned.
 Academic liberties, for the most part, are not challenged. Teachers and students
 enjoy free expression, but drama groups are required to obtain official approval to
 perform. An American musical group featuring imitation of current rock stars was
 anned after two performances, apparently because the performances were found
 morally offensive. South African and Israeli films continue to be banned. Films and
 publications are routinely censored for pornography.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution assures every
 citizen the right to form associations, subject to "reasonable restrictions" in the in-
 terest of morality or public order. In practice, individuals are free to join private or-
 ganizations and associations. Permits from a local district magistrate are required
 for public meetings. Sit-ins, marches, and rallies are common forms of political ex-
 pression in Bangladesh. They occasionally lead to violence. The Jatiyo Party of de-
 posed President Ershad attempted to hold a rally in Dhaka on February 29. The
 Government refused permission for the rally to be held in front of the national Par-
 liament building, the usual venue for such demonstrations. The rally was moved to
 a suburban location but was..disrupted by what were reportedly systematic attacks
 by government supporters. The police reportedly did not intervene.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-With the passage of the Eighth Amendment to the Con-
 stitution in 1988, Islam was recognized as the state religion in Bangladesh, where
 87 percent of the population are Muslims. Despite official assurances of freedom of
 religion and equality of treatment, the establishment of Islam as the state religion
 continued to cause concern in 1992 among Hindu, Christian, and Buddhist minori-
 ties. Some minority group members complain that this constitutional change has
 emboldened some Muslims who are hostile to other religions.
 Proselytizing by Bangladeshi citizens is permitted by the Constitution. Although
 conversion is possible, there is strong social resistance to conversion from Islam.
 
 
 1124
 Most proselytizing by Bangladeshi citizens is directed toward such minority groups
 as Hindus and tribal people.
 Government policy continues to permit various religions to establish places 8f wor-
 ship, train clergy, travel for religious purposes, and maintain links with coreligion-
 ists abroad. Foreign missionaries are permitted, but they may not proselytize Mus-
 lims. Some missionaries perceive the various obstacles they face, including lengthy
 delays in obtaining or renewing security clearances and residence and reentry visas,
 as intended to curb Christian influence.
 There are also reports that Christian nongovernmental organizations face bureau-
 cratic obstacles in carrying out their activities, including the threatened withdrawal
 of their government registrations. Appeals to the Government have sometimes been
 successful in removing such obstacles.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Except in designated areas of the CH. Ban ladeshi citizens are free
 to move about within the country. Travel by foreigners is also restricted in the CHT
 and some other border areas. Bangladeshis are generally free to visit and emigrate
 abroad, subject to foreign exchange controls, but civil servants wishing to travel
 abroad must obtain clearance from the Prime Minister's office. In some. instances,
 persons considered to be security risks are barred from traveling abroadf. The right
 of repatriation is observed.
 Since the fall of the Ershad regime, the former President, his family, and several
 senior members of his regime have been barred from leaving the ountry. A leader
 of the small JSD party, Serajul Alam Khan, was arrested at the airport to stop him
 from attending an academic seminar in the United States. In addition, the passports
 of Jatiyo Party Members of Parliament and others associated with the previous re-
 gime have been confiscated by the Government, even though the Supreme Court in
 y1990 declared illegal the seizure in 1986 of a former Member of Parliament's
 passport. Some of those affected by such restrictions have successfully challenged
 them in court. Sme former high-level officials in former President Ershad's Govern-
 ment have been banned from traveling even though they won their passports back
 in the courts; several say they need to travel for medical treatment.
 More than 250,000 non-Bengali Muslims, known as Biharis, remain in Ban-
 gladesh pending resettlement in Pakistan. After independence in 1971, these per-
 sons opted for  akistani citizenship, and Pakistan ageed in principle to accept
 them. he Pakistan Government is now said to be building housing for an unspec-
 ified number of returnees. During Prime Minister Zia's visit to Pakistan in August,
 she received assurances that 3,000 families could be accepted as early as January
 1993. The Biharis, most of whom still reside in 66 camps throughout Bangladesh,
 may seek employment and conduct other activities, but as noncitizens they do not
 vote, hold seats in Parliament, or hold passports. Biharis may apply for Bangladeshi
 citizenship at any time, and those who do are granted full rights of citizenship.
 Since early 1991, approximately 265,000 Rohingyas, Muslims from Burma's
 Arakan province, have crossed into southeastern Bangladesh, fleeing the repression
 of the Burmese security forces. Currently, they are living at 19 sites near Cox's Ba-
 zaar. The internal movement of these refugees has been severely restricted by the
 Bangladesh Government, which is under heavy domestic pressure to repatriate the
 refugees expeditiously. On September 22, 49 Rohingyas were repatriated, according
 to the Bangladesh Government, voluntarily. The United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was not permitted to interview these refugees prior
 to their departure, and consequently it is not possible to verify the Government's
 claim. In two separate repatriations in October, a total of 167 refugees were re-
 turned to Burma after UNUCR representatives had determined that their return
 was voluntary in predeparture interviews. On November 25, amid credible reports
 that the Bangladesh Government was using coercive means to convince some refu-
 gees to return to Burma, 932 refugees were repatriated. There has been chronic un-
 rest in the refugee camps prompted in large part by refugee fears about forced repa-
 triation. To quell this unrest, Bangladesh security forces resorted to lethal force on
 four separate occasions, resulting in over 15 deaths and over 100 wounded. The
 Government claims that the security forces only shoot in self-defense. Refugees op-
 posed to repatriation have attacked both refugees willing to be repatriated and gov-
 ernment officials. Excesses by the security forces in dealing with this situation may
 in some instances have precipitated violence.
 There are varying estimates of the numbers of Bangladeshi tribal refugees resid-
 ing in India. The Government of India claimed there were 50,000 in 1992. The Ban-
 gladesh Government disputed this figure, claiming that there were never more than
 40,000 such refugees. There have been reports that some refugees have already re-
 turned. The number of returnees is difficult to verify, but it is believed that up to
 15,000 may have returned in the last several years. During the Prime Minister's
 
 
 1125
 visit to India in 1992, Bangladesh and India agreed to work toward eventual repa-
 triation of all refugees.
 There are also conflicting claims regarding the treatment of the returned refugees.
 The Government has announced an ambitious rehabilitation program which in-
 cludes subsidies, housing, and job training. Some tribals charge that the military
 is concentrating returnees in camps with little opportunity to work, thus perpetuat-
 ing dependence on the national Government.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Since the change of Government following President Ershad's resignation in De-
 cember 1991, Bangladesh's citizens have enjoyed the right to change their govern-
 ment democratically. Bangladesh has a multiparty parliamentary system in which
 elections by secret ballot are to be held every 5 years on the basis of universal suf-
 frage for all citizens 18 years of age and over. The parliamentary opposition is led
 byeSheikh Hasina Wajed, who heads the Awami League. Ershad's Jatiyo Party and
 fundamentalist Jamaat Islami are the other major opposition parties. The Par-
 liament has 300 elected members and 30 reserved seats for women, who are chosen
 after the election by the seated Parliament. Candidates may contest a maximum of
 five seats in any one election. Bangladesh's President is elected to a 5-year term by
 Parliament. The President's duties are largely ceremonial.
 Under the Ershad regime, Bangladesh citizens had little confidence in their abil-
 ity to change their government through elections. Violence at the polls and ques-
 tions about the impartiality of voting officials led various opposition parties to boy-
 cott elections. The February 1991 parliamentary elections, by contrast, were rel-
 atively free of these impediments. International and domestic observer groups
 praised the holding of the election, calling it the freest and fairest in Bangladesh's
 history. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party emerged from the election with a plural-
 ity of seats and was invited to form a Government. It successfully did so and cur-
 rently holds a slim majority in Parliament.
 In 1992 the only elections of note were the January and February Union Parishad
 (local council) elections. These elections were held on a nonparty basis, with no par-
 tisan political activity allowed. They were largely free of the violence that marred
 the 1988 Union Parishad elections in which several hundred people were killed in
 election-related violence. In comparison, in 1992 only 20 people were believed killed
 in such violence. Overall, the elections were considered free and fair, with only
 minor irregularities reported.
 Tribals in the Chittagong Hill Tracts have full national voting rights, and are rep-
 resented in the Bangladesh Parliament by three members. Tribals by law control
 the majority of seats, including the chairmanship, of the three local district councils
 in the CHT. However, tribals complain that issues such as law and order and land
 rights are not yet within the purview of the councils.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In.
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are a number of local human rights organizations that investigate allega-
 tions of abuse and seek prosecution of human rights violators. Human rights groups
 are also active in promoting awareness of human and legal rights among the coun-
 try's largely uneducated rural majority. Although the Government generally does
 not hamper these groups' activities, it occasionaly reminds them to avoid sensitive
 political issues, such as the CHT issue.
 The Government remains sensitive to international opinion regarding human
 rights issues and in the past has responded to inquiries concerning specified inci-
 dents. In 1992 an Amnesty International team visited Bangladesh and did not re-
 port any interference from the Government. When security conditions permit, the
 vernment has allowed occasional escorted visits to the Chittagong Hill Tracts by
 members of the diplomatic corps or concerned organizations. In part because of criti-
 cism by international and domestic human rights groups, the Government decided
 to appoint a one-person inquiry commission headed by a retired justice to inves-
 tigate the events that led up to the violence in the CHTs Logong village in April
 1992 (see Section 1.g.).
 In August 1991, two members of the independent Bangladesh Human Rights
 Commission were arrested under the SPA for distributing copies of the CHT Com.
 mission report, "Life is Not Ours." The two were soon released; however, they con-
 tinue to claim that 1,000 copies of the report were seized by the Government. The
 Supreme Court has not yet ruled on a legal challenge to the alleged seizure.

 International human rights organizations represented in Bangladesh include the
 International League for Human Rights, the Law Association for Asia and the West-
 ern Pacific, and the International Commission of Jurists.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 By custom and Islamic tradition, women occupy a subordinate place in society.
 The underlying attitudes and social barriers circumscribing the participation of
 women in activities beyond the home are strongly entrenched and show few signs
 of weakening. For the approximately 86 percent of Bangladeshi women who live in
 rural areas, early marriage, high childbearing rates, and long hours of household
 and farm labor leave little opportunity for nonfamily interests or outside employ-
 ment. Even in urban areas and among the affluent, the traditional social system
 makes women economically dependent upon their husbands and other male rel-
 atives. Except in the export-oriented garment industry, women are virtually absent
 from the cash-earning work force.
 Bangladeshi women are also subject to discrimination inherent in Islamic family
 and inheritance law. While women must demonstrate legally specified grounds for
 divorce, men may divorce without grounds. Islamic family law also permits Muslim
 men four wives, and requires a man with more than one wife to treat each of his
 wives equally. In practice, men sometimes favor some wives and abandon others.
 Under Islamic inheritance law, a daughter's share of an inheritance is half that of
 her brother's, although the brother has financial obligations to his mother and sis-
 ter. Property rights in Bangladesh are a matter of civil law, and women are allowed
 to own and enter into contracts concerning land and its uses.
 Although there are no reliable statistics on the extent of violence against women,
 there were hundreds of press reports of such violence: murder, rape and other hys-
 ical abuse, breach of matrimonial contract, denial of inheritance rights, and deser-
 tion. There have also been reports of Bangladeshi women being lured into travel to
 foreign countries, where they are often sold into prostitution.
 Laws to protect women include the Anti-Dowry Prohibition Act of 1980, the Cru-
 elty to Women Act of 1983, the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 1984, and the Illegal
 Trafficking of Women Act of 1988. Enforcement of these laws is lax, however. It is
 a capital offense to traffic in women, to kill a woman in the course of rape, or to
 murder a woman over dowry. Even so, dowry killings, in which the husband or his
 family attack and soemes murder the bride for nonpayment of a supposedly
 promised dowry, are believed to occur frequently in rural areas. Although news-
 papers occasionally print reports of cases in which a husband accused of dowry kill-
 ing is tried and punished, the vast majority of these cases are believed to go unre-
 ported and unpunished.
 The National Advisory Committee Against Repression of Women has established
 local branches in rural areas to address the problem of abused women. Most observ-
 ers agree that this Committee's impact has been negligible in providing recourse for
 victims of crimes within the family or home.
 Members of minority religious groups are disadvantaged in practice, though not
 in the law, and their access to government jobs, incluing in the military, and politi-
 cal office is limited. Selection boards for these jobs are often without minority group
 representation. Despite the fact that minorities make up 13 percent of the popu-
 lation, only 12 members of the Parliament, including one woman, are from minority
 groups.
 In the years immediately following Bangladesh's independence, members of some
 minorities, principally Hindus, lost or had serious difficulty retaining their rop-
 ertieas a result of the prejudicial administration of vested property laws.  ese
 laws permitted the Government to use or even sell property  longing to persons
 who left what is now Bangladesh between 1965 and 1971. Although Pr'esident
 Ershad reaffirmed a 1984 executive order requiring the return of such property to
 the original owners, in practice this order has notaen widely followed, and there
 has been no indication tat the current Government is planning to implement such
 laws.
 Discrimination against the tribal pople in the CHT with respect to property
 rights    been an issue in the past. Until 1985, tribal land, for which there is fre-
 wuentlyno deed, was parceled out by authorities to Bengali Muslim settlers in the
 sh. Tribal people's property rights were also violated by the issuance of false
 deeds, physical attacks, sudden foreclosure following the failure to meet mortgage
 payments, or confiscation by the army in areas where the tribal insurgency was ac-
 tive. There have been no reports of such violations in the past 5 years. Tribals in
 other areas of Bangladesh have also reported that they have lost land to Bengalis
 through legal trickery and other means.
 
 
 1127
 The Government has suspended the transfer of land and taken additional steps
 to grant authority over land allocations and regulation to the tribal-dominated local
 government councils. In July 1991, the councils assumed control over primary edu-
 cation, health, family welfare, and agricultural extension. However, many tribals
 still believe that the Bangladesh security forces have inordinate control over their
 lives and they remain concerned about their ability to retain their distinct culture
 in the face of incessant pressure from the dominant Bengali culture.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Freedom of association and the right to join unions
 are guaranteed in the Bangladesh Constitution. The right to form a union, subject
 to government approval, also is guaranteed. Military, police and state administra-
 tion workers are forbidden to join unions, except workr in te railway, postal, tele-
 gra ph, and telephone depaitments. The constitutional right to join a union does not
 apply in the country's Export Promotion Zone (EPZ), though EPZ workers (as well
 as Bangladeshi civil servants) . have formed associations which perform functions
 similar to labor unions. The Government has stated that labor law restrictions on
 freedom of association and formation of unions in the Chittagong EPZ will be lifted
 in the next 5 years.
 Bangladesh s work force numbers approximately 50 million people, with only
 about 3 million in the industrial sector. Approximately 3 2 percent of the work force
 is unionized. Labor unions remain most powerful in the traditional jute, textile, and
 transportation industries. Under current law, professional and industry-based
 unions are not allowed. Ten to 15 percent of Bangladesh's apprximatel 4,200 labor
 unions are affiliated with 23 National Trade Union (NTU) centers. There are no
 legal restrictions on political activities by labor unions. Unions in Bangladesh are
 highly7 politicized, and virtually all the rU centers are affiliated with political par-
 ties, includin  one with the ruling BNP. Some unions are militant and engage in
 extortion an other strong-arm activities. The large numbers and politicization of
 Bangladesh's labor unions cause dissension within the labor force. At Adamjee jute
 mill, for example, clashes between rival labor groups resulted in numerous injuries
 and several deaths in 1992.
 To obtain and maintain its registration, 30 percent employee participation in a
 union is required. Workers are eligible for membership on the unions' executive
 staff, the size of which is set by law in proportion to the number of union members.
 Registration of a union may only be canceled by the Registrar of Trade Unions with
 the concurrence of the Labor Court, but no such actions were known to have been
 taken in 1992. There are no restrictions on affliation with international labor orga-
 nizations, and Banladeshi unions and federations maintain a wide variety of such
 links. Trade unionts are required to obtain government clearancet tetravel to
 international labor organization meetings. However, no clearances were denied in
 1992.
 The right to strike is not specifically rcognized in the law but is an accepted form
 of protest. There were a number of strikes in 1992. Early in 1992, primary and high
 school teachers struck for wage increases and other benefits. Other sectors affected
 by agitation at that time were power, chemical, steel, sugar, and the national air-
 lines. Though the teachers received some concessions, the other actions were largely
 unsuccessful. In June and July, there were a number of "illegal" (i.e., without proper
 notification) strikes over the Government's failure to honor a memorandum of un-
 derstanding (MOU) signed in 1991 with textile and jute workers in which it agreed
 to establish a tripartite commission to address grievances, including over minimum
 wages. The strike actions resulted in another, similar MOU being signed. The coun-
 try has also been subject to a number of "hartal" (general strike) actions. These po-
 litically motivated strikes had the effect of shutting down industry for a day or half-
 day and keeping workers at home.
 The Essential Services Ordinance permits the Government to bar strikes for 3
 months in any sector deemed "essential," and the Government occasionally has ap-
 plied this authority to sect not usually considered essential. In cases of public
 utilities, the Government is empowered to prohibit a strike or lockout at any time
 before or after the strike or lockout begins and refer the dispute to the Labor Court.
 Public utility swevices include electric power generation andsupply, sanitation, hos-
 pital and ambulance services, fire fighting, railroad, air transport security services,
 and communications.
 Mechanisms for conciliation, arbitration, and Labor Court dispute resolutions
 were established under the Industrial Relations Ordinance of 1969. Workers have
 the right to strike in the event of a failure to achieve a bipartite settlement. If a
 strike lasts 30 days or longer, the Government may prohibit the strike and refer
 the diset the Labor Court for adjudication.

 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Free collective bargaining is
 legal only or private sector workers in Bangladesh, on condition that the workers
 are represented by unons legall registered as collective ba a    nts by the
 Registrar of Trade Unions. Public sector industries workerpa  evels and other
 benefits are recommended by the National Pay and Wages Commission. The Com-
 mission's recommendations are binding and may not be disputed except on the issue
 of implementation.
 Under the Industrial Relations Ordinance, there is considerable leeway for dis-
 crimination against union members and organizers by employers. For example, the
 Ordinance allows arbitrary transfer of workers suspected of union activities. dom-
 plaints that employers routinely flout ordinance rules against antiunion discrimina-
 tion are particularly high in the garment industry. The Registrar of Trade Unions
 disposes of discrimination complaints. There have been a number of cases in which
 the court has ordered the reinstatement of workers fired for union activities. How-
 ever, the Labor Court's overall effectiveness is damaged by a serious case backlog,
 and there have also been allegations that some of its deli erations have been cor-
 ru p ted by employers.
 As noted in Section 6.a., no collective bargaining takes place in the Chittagong
 EPZ.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Lobor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor. The Factories Act and Shops and Establishment Act, 1965, set
 up inspection mechanisms to enforce laws against forced labor, but resources for en-
 forement are slim, and the laws are not rigorously enforced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Chridren.-Bangladesh has laws that osten-
 sibly prohibit labor by children, with legal working ages determined by type of in-
 dustry. For example, children between the ages of 15 and 17 are allowed to work,
 but not for more than 9 hours a day, inclusive of a 2-hour break for rest. They are
 not allowed to work between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. Children under 12 are forbidden
 employment in such industries as railroads, garments, construction, rickshaw pull-
 ing, and street trading.
 In reality, however, enforcement of these roles is lax. The United Nations has es-
 timated that fully 32 percent of Bangladesh's population under the age of 18 is
 working. The widespread prevalence of child labor is a onsequence of Bangladesh's
 condition of extreme poverty, one of the worst in the world. In January 1990, in an
 attempt to curb child labor, the Bangladesh Government began implementing,  a
 compulsory education bill. Under the law, each child must attend school through the
 5th grade. However, the Government maintains that it does not have the resources
 to implement this law immediately in the entire country. The initial program has
 concentrated in only a few areas; to be effective, it must be expanded considerably.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage. Instead,
 the Minimum Wage Commission sets wages industry-by-industry. In most cases,
 private sector employers ignore this wage structure with apparently little fear of
 prosecution.
 The law sets a standard 48-hour workweek with 1 rest day mandated. However,
 a 60-hour workweek, inclusive of a maximum 12 hours of overtime, is allowed. The
 law is poorly enforced in industries such as hosiery and ready-made garments.
 elative to the average standard of living iBagladesh, the average monthly wage
 could be described as a living wage but not by any means a decent wage for a fam-
 ily.
 The Factories Act of 1965 provides occupational health and safety standards. The
 law is comprehensive but is largely ignored by most Bangladeshi employers. En-
 forcement by the Labor Ministry's Industrial Inspectrate is weak in terms of per-
 sonnel and logistical support. Workers may also resort to legal action for enforce-
 ment of the law's provisions, but few cases are actually prosecuted.
