 Denmark is a constitutional monarchy with a strong tradition
 of democratic parliamentary rule. Queen Margrethe II as
 titular Head of State has a mainly symbolic role. A cabinet
 led by the Prime Minister and accontable to the unicameral
 Folketing (parliament) leads the Government. A minority
 coalition government led by the Conservative Party has ruled
 since 1982.
 Denmark has a unified national police force. A small
 intelligence service operates as a section of the police. Its
 director is a civil service lawyer, and it is subject to an
 intelligence oversight committee of the Folketing.
 An advanced industrial state, Denmark has a mixed economy
 combining private and public ownership. The Government is
 seeking ways to reduce the public sector's share of the
 economy. Personal freedoms and the right to pursue private
 interests and to hold private property are protected by law
 and respected in practice.
 Deeply-rooted democratic principles, an egalitarian tradition,
 a lively press, and highly developed educational and social
 welfare systems have made Denmark a leading defender of human
 rights in the world. This continued in 1989. The
 Constitution establishes the Folketing's "Ombudsman," to whom
 any citizen may protest if he or she feels wrongly or
 unreasonably treated by any national or municipal authority.
 Denmark participates actively in a number of international
 commissions concerned with the protection and preservation of
 human rights. It will host in 1990 the second meeting of the
 Conference on the Human Dimension of the Conference on
 Security and Cooperation in Europe.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no political or extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no abductions, disappearances, secret arrests, or
 clandestine detentions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There was no torture or inhuman treatment. An innovative
 Center for Torture Victims, supported by the Foreign Ministry
 and located at Copenhagen's municipal hospital, treats
 patients in the refugee community, assists torture victims,
 and contributes to hindering the use of torture worldwide.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 No person in Denmark may be deprived of personal liberty
 without due process of law. Arrestees must appear before a
 judge within 24 hours. They may be held indefinitely in
 preventive detention, frequently in isolation, although a
 judge must periodically review and approve such detention.
 Bail is permitted. There are no exiles.
 
 
 1089
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Danish legal system consists of a series of courts, local
 and regional, up to the Supreme Court. Trials ake usually
 public; judges may make exceptions to this rule in a few
 circumstances, such as paternity and divorce trials. In
 criminal cases, trials are only closed when necessary to
 protect a victim's privacy, such as in rape or child
 molestation cases or when a witness' identity must be
 protected.
 The rights of the accused are carefully protected. Defendants
 have the right to be present, to confront witnesses, and to
 present evidence. They enjoy the presumption of innocence.
 Indigent defendants have the right to an attorney at
 government expense and may also change this attorney. The
 judiciary is fully independent. There are no political
 prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 A constitutional prohibition against searching homes, seizing
 and examining papers, and breaching secrecy of communications
 without a judicial order is respected in practice.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a
 functioning democratic political system combine to ensure
 freedom of speech and press. There is no censorship.
 Criticism of the Government is not a punishable offense.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 There is one large state-owned radio and television company.
 Editorial control is exercised by a board independent of the
 Government. A second channel, one-third government
 subsidized, opened in 1988. Programs critical of the
 Government appear on both channels.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Danes may freely assemble and form associations. Public
 meetings require permits, which are routinely given. Police
 may by law be present at any event which may endanger the
 peace. Any organization may affiliate with international
 bodies in its field.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c,' Freedom of Religion
 Under the Constitution, the Evangelical Lutheran Church is the
 state church and receives a large subsidy. However, religious
 freedom is guaranteed to all. No religion is banned or
 discouraged; conversion is unrestricted. No one may be
 discriminated against for religious beliefs. Missionaries are
 freely given entry but are restricted in practice from staying
 more than 2 years. A-number of foreign clergy serve
 expatriate and Danish congregations.
 
 
 1090
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Danes have full freedom of travel and movement. Refugees are
 never repatriated against their will.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Danes have the right to change their government. The Prime
 Minister is appointed by the monarch after consultation with
 the parties in the Folketing. The Folketing's 179 members are
 elected in free and open elections under a complex system of
 proportional representation designed to help small parties and
 to reflect the popular vote. In the 1988 election, 12 parties
 competed, of which 8, representing a wide range of political
 beliefs, achieved more than the 2 percent of the vote needed
 to obtain representation in the Folketing. The current
 Government is a three-party minority coalition.
 Danes over 18 years of age may vote. Resident foreigners may
 vote and run in local elections. Elections occur at least
 every 4 years, or by a decision of the Prime Minister, a
 parliamentary vote of no confidence, or the Government's
 resignation.
 The territories of Greenland and the Faroe Islands have
 democratically elected home-rule governments with broad powers
 encompassing all but foreign and security affairs. They each
 have two seats in the Folketing. Greenlanders and Faroese are
 full Danish citizens and enjoy the same level of human rights
 as in Denmark.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Denmark is party to various international human rights
 conventions that promote and protect human rights. Human
 rights organizations operate freely. The Danish Center of
 Human Rights is a private government-funded institution for
 conducting research and providing information on human rights
 issues.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Denmark provides food, shelter, health care, and education to
 all inhabitants regardless of race, religion, sex, ethnic
 background, or political opinion. However, the inflow of
 ethnically dissimilar refugees (mostly Iranians, Palestinians,
 Lebanese, and Sri Lankans) who require public assistance has
 provoked tensions between native Danes and immigrants. These
 tensions worsened perceptibly during 1989. A December 1988
 poll sponsored by the European Community (EC) showed Danes in
 first place among EC countries for their support of racist
 movements, tied for first place in their support for
 restricting the rights of foreigners, and in second place in
 their opposition to immigrants. A group called "Stop
 Immigration" contested the 1989 Copenhagen city council
 elections but won no seats. A Pakistani woman was nominated
 by a leftwing party to run for a safe seat on the city council
 and should become its first elected immigrant member.
 
 
 1091
 Denmark has eliminated laws containing sex discrimination
 provisions. Women hold positions of authority throughout
 society though they are much less represented at the top of
 the business world.
 There is no tolerance, in law or in practice, of violence or
 abuse against women. Crimes against women are considered
 serious and are investigated with increasing vigor. However,
 .independent expertsestimate that less than 2 percent of all
 cases of domestic violence are reported to authorities.
 Denn~ark has no rape and domestic violence prevention
 programs. There are, however, 30 special crisis centers
 nationwide for counseling and housing of victims which are
 supported by municipal governments and voluntary workers and
 donations.
 In 1989 Denmark became the first nation ever to grant
 homosexual partnerships legal standing and to give homosexual
 partners many of the same-legal rights as heterosexuals.
 Also, a 1922 law requiring mentally ill and retarded persons
 to obtain special permission in order to marry was repealed.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a;- The Right of Association
 All workers, including military personnel and the police, have
 the right.to._associate freely in unions of their choosing.
 Somq 90 pprcent of Danish wage earners belong to unions.
 Unions are independent of the Government and may freely
 affiliate with international organizations. All but civil
 servants have the right to strike, and this right is
 frequently exercised-
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 -Workers and employers acknowledge each other's right to
 organize. Collective bargaining is widespread. Salaries,
 benefits, and working conditions are agreed upon in
 quadrennial negotiations between the Employers Association and
 the Confederation of Labor Unions, which has 1.4 million
 members (half of Denmark's labor force), and are used as
 guidelines by the rest of the labor market. In case of
 disagreement, an issue may be referred to a labor court made
 up of management and labor representatives and an independent
 member. The decisions of the court are binding.
 The conditions -surrounding the establishment of a Danish
 Internatonal Ship's Register in 1988 were the subject of a
 complaint to the International Labor Organization (ILO). The
 ILO's Committee on Freedom of Association in 1989 urged the
 Government to enact legislation which would ensure that full
 and voluntary collective bargaining is open to all seafarers,
 including foreign nationals, employed, on Danish-flag ships.
 There are no export processing zones in Denmark or its
 territories.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited and does not exist.

 DEMARK
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for full-time employment is 15. The law
 describes detailed specific limitations to work which may be
 one by those aged 15 to 18. The law is rigorously enforced.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Danish law prescribes acceptable conditions of work, including
 safety and health; the duties of employers, supervisors, and
 employees; work performance; rest periods and days off; and
 medical examinations. It also establishes a labor inspection
 service which ensures compliance with labor legislation.
 There is no minimum wage, but the lowest hourly wage set in
 any national labor agreement is $9, which is adequate to
 ensure a tamily a decent living. Danes are guaranteed 5
 weeks' paid vacation a year and a 38-hour workweek.
 Similarly, work conditions are negotiated by means of
 collective bargaining in Greenland with some variations from
 the pattern in Denmark due to different levels of
 development. A major issue in collective bargaining
 negotiations in Greenland is the wage differential between
 indigenous and temporary Danish workers which arises because
 of the need to attract skilled workers from Denmark. This
 caused a major long-term strike by government workers in
 1989. All parties in the Greenlandic Parliament have agreed
 to discontinue the differential soon. Another major
 difference is that no unemployment compensation is paid in
 Greenland unless a collective bargaining agreement
 specifically includes it. The Greenlandic tradition of
 spending part of a year hunting and fishing has slowed the
 evolution of a concept of unemployment. Because of this
 phenomenon and the lack of resources, Greenland has postponed
 establishing a legislatively mandated unemployment
 compensation system.
