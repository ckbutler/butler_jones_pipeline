 BURKINA FASO
 President Blaise Compaore continued to dominate the Government of the Fourth
 Republic, assisted by members of his party, the Organization for Popular Democ-
 racy/Labor Movement (ODP/MT). In spite of the existence of more than 60 political
 parties, there is little viable opposition to the President and his Government, which
 includes one representative from a small self-described opposition party. The ODP/
 MT controls the National Assembly with 79 of the 107 seats. Several opposition par-
 ties have modest representation. In December the Government opened the constitu-
 tionally mandated, though purely consultative, second chamber of the National As-
 sembly.
 The security apparatus consists of the armed forces, the paramilitary gendar-
 merie, controlled by the Ministry of Defense, and the police, controlled by the Min-
 istry of Territorial Administration. The 1995 shooting deaths of two high school
 demonstrators by the gendarmerie in the town of Garango led to a human rights
 in 'ry.
 Over 80 percent of the population of 9.5 million engage in subsistence agriculture,
 which is highly vulnerable to rainfall variation. Frequent drought limited commu-
 nications and transportation infrastructure, in addition to a low literacy rate, are
 longstanding problems. The 1994 50-percent devaluation of the CFA franc added to
 the existing economic hardship of a structural adjustment program under way since
 1991. That program seeks to limit government spending, especially on salaries and
 transfers, and open the economy to market forces, including privatization and reduc-
 tion in the size of many inefficient state companies. Per capita annual income is
 about $150 per year, in post-devaluation terms.
 On balance, 1995 reflected continuing progress in the move towards greater de-
 mocratization and decentralization. In this regard, the peaceful holding of the first
 multiparty municipal elections since independence in 1960 was a major step. With
 
 
 18
 minor exceptions, balloting was considered free and fair by the local human rights
 organizations that monitored the contest. However, serious human rights abuses
 persisted.
 The extrajudicial killings of two student demonstrators by the gendarmerie and
 a general climate of impunity fostered by failure to prosecute previous abusers tar-
 nished the move to greater democratization. Torture and mistreatment of detainees,
 and vigilante killings remained a problem. A libel suit brought by the President
 against a political oe for particularly harsh public criticism left some in the press
 apprehensive about a resurgence of pressure for self-censorship. Discrimination and
 violence against women continued to be problems. The most egregious instances of
 gender-based violence involved female genital mutilation, although women continue
 to campaign against this practice as well as against other forms of discrimination.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-In May members of the gendarmerie
 forces stationed in the town of Garango shot two unarmed high school students to
 death when demonstrators pelted their building with stones. The main human
 rights organization, the Burkinabe Movement for Human Rights (MBDHP), issued
 a condemnation of these extrajudicial killings and called for an inquiry which is cur-
 rently underway. This incident marred an otherwise improving record regarding se-
 curity forces. For example, the Government ceased security sweep-type operations
 carried out against resurgent urban and rural bandits the previous year. At the
 same time, however, it announced plans to establish new "crime-fighting brigades."
 The major problem with law enforcement is a general climate of impunity for
 human rights abusers fostered by the habitual failure of the Government's inves-
 tigations to lead to guilty findings and/or appropriate sanctions. Inquiries tend to
 drag on until they are overshadowed by subsequent incidents, and then they are
 quietly shelved. Appeals by human rights organizations generally go unanswered.
 This failure to prosecute previous abuses remains a major hindrance to further
 human rights progress.
 A police investigation into the July 1994 savage beating of two prisoners, who
 later died at the Maco Prison in Ouagadougou, ended without calling for the punish-
 ment of those responsible. Nor were there further developments regarding the July
 1994 corruption scandal which led to the death of two suspects under suspicious cir-
 cumstances. The case involved Youssouf Sawadogo, an influential businessman who
 allegedly shot himself when the police arrived to question him. Several days later,
 a suspect in the case, Cisse Ousseni, died in police custody, allegedly of a heart at-
 tack. Both an internal police investigation and one by the Attorney General's office
 cleared the police of any wrongdoing. Human rights monitors from the MBDHP
 maintain the autopsy performed on Ousseni indicates that he died from abuse.
 Although international and local human rights groups pressured the official com-
 mission investigating the 1991 assassination of Clement Ouedraog, a prominent op-
 position leader, to submit a report of preliminary findings to the Prime Minister,
 the report has not been made public. The case remains open, as do the 1989 "dis-
 appearance. of Professor Guillaume Sessouma, detained for allegedly participating
 in a coup plot, and of medical student Dabo Boukary in 1990, detained following
 student demonstrations. Credible reports indicated that security forces tortured and
 killed both. The Government continued to make no real effort to investigate the fate
 of a Ghanaian detainee, reportedly killed in 1993 while in police custody. To date,
 the authorities have provided no explanation of the 1994 death of Doin Redan, who
 was found dead 1 day after being detained by police.
 Another disturbing trend was the increase in reported cases of vigilante killings
 by the public. There were numerous documented incidents of summary mob justice
 meted out to thieves caught by the citizenry, mostly in urban centers.
 b. Disappearance.-There have been no reports of politically motivated disappear-
 ances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 While legally prohibited, torture and mistreatment of detainees, often to extract con-
 fessions, have been documented for a number of years. There are credible reports
 that officials at Maco Prison continue to employ torture and degrading treatment,
 including beatings, cold showers, exposure to hot sun, and forcing persons to eat
 their own feces, as occurred in the case of the two internees cited in Section L.a.
 The Government is not known to have taken any disciplinary action against those
 responsible.
 Prison conditions are harsh, overcrowded, and can be life-threatening. The federal
 prison in Bobo-Dioulasso, built in 1947, housed about 1,000 prisoners, although de-
 
 
 19
 signed to hold less than half that number. The prison diet is poor, and inmates must
 often rely on supplemental food from relatives.
 In 1994 police trainee commissioner Roger Zango, in an address at the Police
 Academy, strongly criticized abuse of detainees. However, the climate of impunity
 created by government failure to prosecute abusers remains the largest obstacle to
 ending torture and other abuses.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides that the Su-
 preme Court is the highest court in the country. Beneath it are two courts of appeal
 and ten provincial courts ("de grande instance"). The Constitution also provides for
 a High Court of Justice, with jurisdiction to try the President and senior govern-
 ment officials for treason and other serious crimes, but it has not yet been estab-
 lished. According to the Constitution, the judiciary is independent of the executive.
 The judiciary is very gradually becoming more independent in practice, but it re-
 mains susceptible to manipulation by the executive branch.
 In practice, the President has extensive appointment and other influence over the
 judiciary. The National Assembly passed legislation reforming the military court
 system, which had been susceptible to considerable executive manipulation. This
 system was staffed in 1995.
 The Constitution provides for the right to expeditious arraignment and access to
 legal counsel, and the law limits detention for investigative purposes without charge
 to a maximum of 72 hours, renewable for a single 48-hour period. In practice, how-
 ever, police rarely observe these provisions. The average time of detention without
 charge is one week.
 A few intellectuals, military officers, and former government officials remain in
 self-imposed exile abroad following the overthrow and assassination of former
 Burkinabe president Thomas Sankara in October 1987, but most desiring to do so
 have repatriated themselves.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-In 1995 the Government announced the creation
 of the Office of Ombudsman, called "Mediateur du Faso." Retired General Marc
 Garango was appointed to the position which is responsible for mediating disputes
 between the state and its citizens. In addition to the formal judiciary, customary or
 traditional courts, presided over by village chiefs, handle many neighborhood and
 village-level problems, such as divorce and inheritance disputes. These decisions are
 generally respected by the population, but citizens may also take the case to a for-
 mal court.
 The Constitution provides for the right to public trial, access to counsel and has
 prvisions for bail and appeal. While these rights are generally respected, the ability
 of citizens to obtain a fair trial remains circumscribed by ignorance of the law (70
 percent of the population is illiterate) and by a continuing shortage of magistrates.
 The Penal Code, based on the French model instituted in 1877, is still in force. A
 review of the code, aimed at making it more relevant to modern requirements, is
 currently under way.
 At year's end, the only person whom local human rights organizations considered
 a political prisoner was the leader of a leftist party who was tried for slandering
 the President. The accused, however, was accorded due process and the verdict is
 currently under appeal (see Section 2.a.).
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for these rights, and, in practice, the authorities generally do
 not interfere in the daily lives of ordinary citizens. In national security cases, how-
 ever, the law permits surveillance, searches, and monitoring of telephones and pri-
 vate correspondence without a warrant. Under normal circumstances, by law, homes
 may be searched only with the authority of a warrant issued by the Minister of Jus-
 tice except in certain cases, such as houses of prostitution and gambling dens. Such
 warrants must be executed during "legal hours," defined as between 6 a.m. and 9
 p.m.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The 1990 Information Code provides for free-
 dom of speech andpress. In practice, these freedoms still remain circumscribed by
 a certain degree of self-censorship. The President and his Government remain sen-
 sitive to criticism. However, provisions in the Code granting the Government the
 ability to intimidate the press through a broad interpretation of defamation were
 removed in December 1993. As a result, journalists now charged with libel may de-
 fend themselves in court by presenting evidence in support of their allegations. Per-
 haps as a consequence, the independent press continued to exercise greater freedom
 of expression.
 On August 4, the Bloc Socialiste Burkinabe (BSB) published a party statement
 marking the anniversary of the Sankarist Revolution. It was reported by only one
 
 
 20
 newspaper, the independent Observateur. Authorities charged BSB leader Nongma
 Ernest Ouedraogo with libel for alleging, among other things, that the President is
 corrupt and suggesting that he feeds human flesh to lions he has on his property.
 Ouedraogo was expeditiously tried under the law, in a civil suit, at which he pro-
 vided no evidence for his allegations. He was fined a symbolic 1 franc and sentenced
 to 6 months in jail. His appeal was denied and he served 5 months. Meanwhile, the
 President's lawyer is appealing the conviction. The incident did, however, under-
 score a lingering tendency toward self-censorship.
 The independent press now includes four dailies, a dozen weekly newspapers, and
 a weekly news magazine. Although the official media, including the daily newspaper
 Sidwaya and the national radio, display progovernment bias, the presence of inde-
 pendent competition led it to give more news attention to the political opposition.
 There are a half-dozen thriving radio stations, one with eight branches, and one pri-
 vate television station.
 Academic freedom is recognized.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association. Permits must, however, be obtained from mu-
 nicipal authorities for political marches. Applicants must indicate date, time, dura-
 tion, and itinerary of the march or rally, and authorities may alter or deny requests
 on grounds of public safety. However, denials or modifications may be appealed be-
 fore the courts.
 Since early 1990, political parties have been permitted to organize and hold meet-
 ings and rallies without seeking government permission. The Government did not
 attempt to break up strike action by railway workers in July (see Section 6).
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and
 this is respected in practice. Burkina Faso is a secular state. Islam, Christianity,
 and traditional religions operate freely without government interference. Neither so-
 cial mobility nor access to modern sector jobs are linked to, or restricted by, reli-
 gious affiliation.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Freedom of movement is guaranteed by the Constitution and respected
 in practice. Gendarmes routinely stopped travelers within the country for identity
 and customs checks and the levying of road taxes at police and military checkpoints.
 There is no restriction on foreign travel for business or tourism. Refugees are ac-
 cepted freely. Due to civil unrest in neighboring countries, there are nearly 42,000
 refugees and displaced persons, mostly Tuaregs from Mali and Niger. The Govern-
 ment cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. There were
 no reports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the constitutional right to change their government through
 multiparty elections. In practice, however, they have been unable to exercise that
 right fully. Power remained in the hands of President Compaore and the ODP/MT
 Party, most of whose members also played prominent roles in the ruling National
 Revolutionary Council (1983-87) and Popular Front (1989-91). The Government in-
 cludes a strong Presidency, a Prime Minister, a Council of Ministers presided over
 by the President, a two-chamber National Assembly, and the judiciary. The legisla-
 ture is independent, but it remains susceptible to external influence.
 The first municipal elections took place in 1995. The President's ODP/MT party
 secured over 1,100 of some 1,700 councillor seats being contested. On the whole, the
 balloting, which was monitored by representatives of several local human rights
 groups, proceeded freely and fairly. The next presidential and national legislative
 elections are slated for late 1997 or early 1998.
 In 1994 the Supreme Court ruled that an elected deputy in the National Assembly
 is not bound to the political party under which that person was elected and may
 change party affiliations as a representative in the legislature. This practice has
 been labelled "political nomadism" and is responsible for much of the factionalism
 in opposition parties.
 There are no restrictions in law or practice on the participation of women or mi-
 nority group members in politics. However, there are few women in positions of re-
 sponsibility; 3 of the 23 ministers and 6 of the 107 National Assembly deputies are
 women.
 
 
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government's attitude toward local human rights groups has been mixed. It
 continued to tolerate the activities of the MBDHP, an independent group with rep-
 resentation in all 30 provinces, but criticized it for an erroneous communique issued
 during the Garango incident (see Section l.a.) when it alleged that a third student
 had been killed by security forces in a separate demonstration. The MBDHP later
 retracted the statement. Its president, Halidou Ouedraogo, publicly alleged that he
 had received death threats from a legislator in the Assembly. The latter denied the
 charges. The year also witnessed the creation of a fourth locally based human rights
 organization, the Association in Defense of Democracy in Africa for Grassroots ]e-
 velopment and the Emergence of a Civil Society (ADABA).
 The Government is responsive to investigations by international nongovernmental
 organizations (NGO's). Amnesty International was apprised of the Garango killings.
 It is currently in touch with the MEDHP and awaiting the results of the govern-
 ment inquiry into that accident.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, religion, or ethnic
 origin. Minority ethnc groups, like the majority Mossi, are represented in the inner
 circles of the Government, and government decisions do not favor one group over
 another.
 Women.-Violence against women, especially wife beating, continues to be a prob-
 lem. Cases of wife beating are usually handled through customary law and practice.
 The Government is attempting, using education through the media, to change atti-
 tudes toward women.
 Women face extensive discrimination, and have no constitutional or other legal
 protections. In general, women continue to occupy a subordinate position and experi-
 ence discrimination in such areas as education, jobs, proet  and family rights. In
 the modern sector, however, women make up one-fourth of the government work
 force, although usually in lower paying positions. Women still do much of the sub-
 sistene farming work. According to the law, there is no discrimination in inherit-
 ance or divorce,but practices vary according to the customs of smaller villages.
 Government efforts to improve the situation of women include the launching of
 a fund supported by the U.N. Development Program to make loans to women in vil-
 lages. Many NGO's are actively working to change attitudes toward woman with full
 government cooperation and participation by women's groups.
 Children.-The Constitution nominally protects children's rights. The Govern-
 ment's efforts to revitalize education have raised the literacy rate from 16 percent
 to 23 percent in 4 years. Primary health care has been revitalized through the pri-
 vatization of hospitals, which have greater autonomy in their management.
 Females constitute approximately one-third of the total student population in the
 primary, secondary, and higher educational systems-although the percentage de-
 creases dramatically beyond the primary level. Schools in rural areas have dis-
 proportionately fewer female students than schools in urban areas.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is still widely
 practiced especially in many rural areas, and it is usually performed at an early
 age. According to an independent expert in the field, the percentage of females who
 have undergone this procedure may be as high as 70 percent. The Government has
 made a strong commitment to eradicate FGM through educational efforts, and a
 newly formed national committee with United States Government assistance
 launched a campaign against the practice. Nevertheless, FGM is still widely prac-
 ticed. At year's end, it was evident that the Government had taken an important
 first step via its sensitization campaign regarding the deleterious effects of this
 practice. Another form of mutilation, scarification of the faces of both boys and girls
 of certain ethnic groups, is gradually disappearing.
 People With Disabilities.-While there is a modest program of government sub-
 sidies for workshops for the disabled, there is no government mandate or legislation
 concerning accessibility for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-A new labor code is currently before the National
 Assembly for review. Notwithstanding this pending legislation, workers, including
 civil servants traditionally have enjoyed a legal right to association which is recog-
 nized under the Constitution. There are 6 major labor confederations and 12 autono-
 mous trade unions linked together by the National Confederal Committee. They rep-
 
 
 resent a wide ideological spectrum, of which the largest and most vocal member es-
 pouses a Socialist doctrine. Essential workers--police, fire, and health workers-
 may not join unions.
 The Constitution provides for the right to strike, and workers use strike actions
 to achieve labor goals. The railway workers union went on a major strike in July
 to protest the announced reduction in force of some 500 employees following privat-
 ization of the company. Actions taken to block rail traffic shut down the railroad
 and landlocked Burkina's main export vehicle to the coast. The Government did not
 attempt to break up the strike action. The strike ended with resumption of rail serv-
 ice on August 26.
 Labor unions freely affiliate with international trade union bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have the right to bar-
 gain for wages and other benefits, both directly with employers and with industry
 associations. These negotiations are governed by minimums on wages and other
 benefits contained in the Interprofessional Collective Convention and the Commer-
 cial Sector Collective Convention, which are established with government participa-
 tion. If no agreement is reached, employees may exercise their right to strike. Either
 labor or management may also refer an impasse in negotiations to labor tribunals.
 Appeals may be pursued through the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court, whose
 decision is binding on both parties. Collective bargaining is extensive in the modern
 wage sector but this encompasses only a small percentage of workers.
 The Labor Code prohibits antiunion discrimination. The Labor Ministry handles
 complaints about such discrimination, which the plaintiff may appeal to a Labor Tri-
 bunal. If the Tribunal sustains the appeal, the employer must reinstate the worker.
 Union officials believe that this system functions adequately.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced labor and
 it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code now in effect sets
 the minimum age for employment at 14 years, the average age for completion of
 basic secondary school. However, the Ministry of Employment, Labor, and Social Se-
 curity, which oversees labor standards, lacks the means to enforce this provision
 adequately, even in the small wage sector. Most children actually begin work at an
 earlier age on small, family subsistence farms, in the traditional apprenticeship sys-
 tem, and in the informal sector.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code mandates a minimum monthly
 wage, a standard workweek of 40 hours with at least one 24-hour rest period, and
 establishes safety and health provisions. The current minimum monthly wage in the
 formal sector, about $48 (cfa 25,000), does not apply to subsistence agriculture, em-
 ploying about 85 percent of the population. The Government last set the minimum
 wage in April. It is not adequate for an urban worker to support a family. Wage
 earners usually supplement their income through reliance on the extended family
 and subsistence agriculture.
 A system of government inspections under the Ministry of Labor and the Labor
 Tribunals is responsible for overseeing health and safety standards in the small in-
 dustrial and commercial sectors, but these standards do not apply in the subsistence
 agricultural sector. In December 1993, the Center for Worker Education in
 Ouagadougou reported that since 1991 there were 2,399 recorded workplace acci-
 dents (1,476 in the manufacturing sector, 215 in construction, and 192 in transport
 and communications sectors). Every company is required to have a work safety com-
 mittee. If a workplace has been declared unsafe by the government labor inspection
 office for any reason, workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous
 work without jeopardy to continued employment. In practice there are indications
 that this right is respected, but such declarations are relatively rare.
