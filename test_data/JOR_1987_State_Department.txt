 JORDAN
 Jordan is a hereditary monarchy with a constitution granting
 the King broad powers. The King forms and dissolves
 governments and is the ultimate arbiter of policy. The Prime
 Minister and the Council of Ministers (Cabinet), however,
 exercise considerable responsibility over many issues. The
 Constitution also provides for a bicameral parliament and an
 independent judiciary.
 Martial law has been in effect since the 1967 war, which ended
 with Israel's occupation of the West Bank. Under martial law,
 some detained persons have been denied opportunity to
 communicate with concerned individuals for varying periods,
 usually not exceeding several months.
 Jordan has a mixed economy, with government participation in
 certain sectors, largely in communications, transportation,
 and heavy industry. The Government of Prime Minister Zaid
 Rifa'i, formed in April 1985, has taken a number of steps to
 reduce state involvement in industry and to promote free
 enterprise. Declining foreign assistance and remittances, a
 weak regional economy, and other external economic factors
 have caused Jordan's healthy economic growth of the past
 decade to level off in recent years. While this economic
 adjustment has been difficult, Jordan's economic managers have
 sought to minimize its impact on the population.
 In 1987 persistent press censorship and dissolution of the
 Jordan Writers Association for alleged political affiliations
 marred the human rights situation, which was otherwise
 unchanged. The absence of political parties, the continuance
 of martial law, and the scope of powers exercised by the
 police are areas of concern, but recent trends remain
 favorable. The increased opportunities for women in all areas
 of life, the continued importance given to the rule of law and
 an independent judiciary, and the gradual evolution of the
 Parliament (including the election of two new members, one
 from theEast Bank, by direct election, and another from the
 West Bank, by'parliamentary vote), have contributed to an
 improving human rights picture.
 RESPECT FOR HU4AN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The Government does not sanction political killing. While
 there have been political killings by nongovernmental groups
 in the past, there were none in 1987.
 In January the Government executed Nayef Khalil al Bayed for
 the 1984 assassination of former Hebron Mayor and PLO
 Executive Committee member Fahd Qawasmeh. Such executions are
 rare and p6litically sensitive in Jordan. There were no
 summary executions. Some Palestinians/West Bankers have been
 sentenced to death in Jordan based on a Jordanian law
 permitting trials in absentia for selling West Bank land to
 Israelis, but these sentences have never been carried out.
 b. Disappearance
 No disappearances were reported.

 JORDAN
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There is no evidence that the Government condones or practices
 torture, although there have been reports of ill-treatment of
 detainees by the security authorities. In its 1987 report,
 Amnesty International (AI) said it had received reports of
 torture in Jordan in 1986, including the case of Durcham
 Jiryis, a trade unionist who was reportedly tortured while
 held incommunicado in the General Intelligence Department
 (GID) headquarters in Amman. AI said that he was released
 after it had appealed on his behalf.
 Jordanian law provides for the decent treatment of prisoners,
 and judicial authorities have been known to dismiss cases
 based on apparent mistreatment of prisoners. In May 1985, the
 Director of Public Security established a special office to
 handle any public complaints of abuse by security officers and
 promised to punish offenders. Prison conditions are Spartan
 by Western standards, but not intentionally degrading. They
 are inspected by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Although Jordan has been under martial law since 1967, most
 persons are placed in custody by Jordanian authorities in
 accordance with the criminal code which requires imposition of
 charges within 48 hours. Persons may then be detained pending
 trial for 15 days, or longer if a court approves the
 prosecution's request for an extension. The criminal code is
 generally applied to persons arrested for designated martial
 law crimes, which include espionage, bribery of public
 officials, trafficking in narcotics or weapons, black
 marketing, and security offenses.  In the past, security
 forces have apparently detained incommunicado (or with limited
 outside access) some persons suspected of'cross-border
 infiltration and security crimes.
 The GID can detain a person without trial for varying
 periods. However, under martial law provisions, such arrests
 should be confirmed within a maximum of 15 days by the Prime.
 Minister, or by local administrators serving as military
 governors. Security detainees can be held without charge for
 indeterminate periods or can be formally charged and brought
 before the martial court for trial. In 1987 the GID arrested
 at least two Jordanians for their alleged political
 affiliations. One is still being detained without charge.
 Family visitation of such prisoners is generally permitted.
 In its 1987 report, AI noted that "a pattern of arrest and
 short-term detention without charge of political prisoners
 under emergency legislation" continued in 1986; that the
 arrests were taostly carried out by the GID; and that detained
 political suspects were usually held--some of them
 incommunicado--at the GID headquarters in Amman for a few
 weeks to a few months and interrogated. AI said it had
 learned of the arrest of 53 people on political grounds by the
 GID, 42 of whom were released before the end of 1986 without
 having been charged. They included 22 alleged members of the
 Jordanian Communist Party, outlawed since 1953.
 Military prosecutors known to have conducted improper arrests
 and detentions have been disciplined and transferred to
 positions of lesser responsibility. A petition for judicial
 review of the legality of the arrest of any detained person
 
 
 1202
 JORDAN
 may be brought before the High Court of Justice, but is
 unlikely to be granted for those accused of security offenses.
 Compulsory labor is forbidden by'the Constitution and is not
 practiced. There are no instances of exile, which is also
 prohibited by the Constitution.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 All criminal cases, except martial law crimes and crimes
 committed by military personnel, are tried in civilian
 courts. The legal code and the independent selection of
 judges help to assure a fair trial. Trials are held in open
 court, except in a few cases such as those involving sexual
 offenses. Defendants are presumed innocent until proven
 guilty and have the right to be represented by counsel, to
 prepare a defense, to cross-examine witnesses, and to refrain
 from giving self-incriminating testimony. The court appoints
 a lawyer for those who cannot afford one if the potential
 sentence is execution or life imprisonment. An effective
 appeals process may be utilized by either the defendant or the
 prosecution. Although the courts have recourse to the death
 penalty, in practice its use has been rare.
 Civilian judges must demonstrate legal competence in written
 and oral examinations before selection by a board composed of
 three judges, the Chief Attorney General, and the
 Undersecretary of the Justice Ministry. Judges may be removed
 from office only after serious transgressions of the law,
 i.e., "bad conduct," and after a disciplinary board hearing.
 The disciplinary board is, in fact, the Judicial Council,
 composed of the First Chief, Court of Cassation for all
 Jordan; Second Chief, Court of Cassation for Amman; Chief,
 Court of Cassation for Irbid; Chief Prosecutor for Jordan; and
 a Judicial Inspector (appointed by the Council itself). When
 a judge is brought before the Judicial Council for alleged
 misconduct, the Council hears the matter, examines the
 defendant judge, and imposes a penalty--which can range from
 actual removal to. the imposition of fines.
 Martial law crimes are adjudicated in a military court before
 a panel of three military officers trained in the law. In
 practice, the military court observes the law of criminal
 procedure and defendants are given the same rights as in a
 civilian court. However, AI has expressed concern that trials
 by the martial law court "fell below international standards
 for fair trial." No right of appeal exists from decisions of
 the military court; however, sentences of the court for
 martial law offenses must be ratified by the Prime Minister in
 his capacity as Military Governor. He has authority to
 increase, reduce, or annul the sentences. The cases are
 reviewed for fairness by a legal advisor or the Justice
 Minister before the Prime Minister makes a decision. The
 military court also adjudicates all crimes committed by
 military personnel; In these cases, the Commander-in-Chief of
 the Armed Forces must ratify the sentences.
 Religious courts have jurisdiction over most family matters,
 such as marriage, divorce, child custody, or guardianship.
 The Shari'a (Muslim religious law) applies to Muslims in these
 areas, and a Shari'a court system handles disputes.
 Ecclesiastical courts handle similar matters for members of
 the main Christian sects. The civil courts administer the
 cases of other religious groups. Shari'a law, however, must
 be applied to questions of inheritance for all communities.

 JORDAN
 There have been reports of the detention of persons for
 political reasons under the martial law regime, but there are
 no reliable estimates of the total number.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The inviolability of the home is respected. Police searches
 of homes require warrants, except in rare cases involving
 security or the hot pursuit of fleeing suspects. It is
 believed that security personnel sometimes monitor telephones
 and c6rrespondence, but the practice is evidently not
 widespread.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution safeguards the freedoms of speech and press,
 but permits limited media constraints under martial law.
 Jordanians freely express wide-ranging opinions, including
 criticism of the Government, in informal settings. Public
 debate is less pronounced but still notable in the state-owned
 radio and television networks and in the privately owned (but
 government-influenced) press, where self-censorship persists.
 There are also occasional heated debates in Parliament on
 public policy issues.
 The Government frequently provides editors with guidance on
 key foreign policy and security matters. On other issues,
 government interference is sporadic and critical commentary,
 though tolerated, is limited. In 1987, several journalists
 were prevented from publishing in local newspapers and
 magazines because of their criticism of the Government for its
 handling of the economy, the West Bank development plan, and
 relations with Israel and the PLO. Western correspondents and
 resident Western writers have occasionally expressed concern
 over government interference with freedom of the press, and
 some local editors reportedly have complained that they are
 prevented from covering stories considered "sensitive" by the
 Government. In July, after the English language newspaper
 published an expose on government mismanagement of water
 treatment, all media were prohibited from further reporting or
 commenting on the subject. In the past, there have been
 reports of members of the press being placed under house
 arrest or charged with membership in an illegal organization.
 Currently all journalists must register with the Information
 Ministry and join the Journalists Association.
 Foreign newspapers and magazines are widely available,
 although subject to occasional censorship. Single issues of
 several publications were banned in 1987.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public demonstrations require a permit, rarely granted, from
 the Interior Minister. All organizations require government
 approval and may not have political objectives. Government
 surveillance of public meetings, university activities, and
 organization gatherings is routine.
 Professional associations for doctors, engineers, lawyers,
 pharmacists, and similar professional groups operate freely.
 They maintain influence with the Government in their
 respective areas of interest. On June 17, the Government
 
 
 1204
 JORDAN
 dissolved the Jordan Writers Association, claiming it had
 become a political organization affiliated with proscribed
 groups. The Government reconstituted a writers' union under
 selected leadership.
 Jordanians are free to join labor unions and professional
 associations. These organizations require government licenses
 which are usually granted without difficulty. Unions and
 associations defend the interests of their members, and their
 officers are elected by the membership. Unions engage in
 collective bargaining. Strikes have occurred in the past, but
 none took place in 1987. Strikes are only permitted if the
 Ministry of Labor fails to act to arbitrate a labor dispute
 within 2 weeks after receiving a complaint from a union.
 Strikes are not legal for government employees, who compose
 about half of the labor force.
 About 20 percent of the Jordanian work force is unionized.
 Seventeen unions comprise the Jordan Federation of Trade
 Unions (JFTU). Several other unions do not belong to the
 JFTU. Unions have virtually no political role and confine
 themselves to representing their membership in such areas as
 wages, working conditions, and workers' layoffs. Their
 effectiveness varies widely. The JFTU actively participates
 in international organizations such as the International Labor
 Organization.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam, the state religion, is practiced by well over 90
 percent of Jordanians. However, the constitutional guarantee
 of freedom of worship is adhered to by the Government. There
 appears to be little discrimination against most religious
 minorities, who are well represented at all levels in the
 Government, military, and business community. Laws making
 harassment of religious minorities a crime are enforced. A
 variety of Christian groups, including Catholic, Orthodox,
 Armenian, Protestant, and Seventh-Day Adventist, maintain
 churches, schools, hospitals, and other institutions. A small
 Baha'i community also exists. A few foreign clergymen reside
 in Jordan. Although proselytizing among Muslims is forbidden,
 conversion by Muslims is not a crime.
 The only religious group restricted by the Government is the
 Jehovah's Witnesses. There is no objection to their belief in
 the Witnesses' doctrine but it is illegal for them to organize
 or assemble in Jordan. The Witnesses' religion prohibits them
 from taking oaths of allegiance, saluting flags, or serving in
 the military. These religious restrictions are perceived as
 evidence that Witnesses are unreliable and disloyal. Some
 observers believe that government opposition to the Witnesser
 is motivated by political rather than religious considerations.
 All religious groups must register with the authorities in
 order to obtain official permission to operate in Jordan.
 However,'there are instances wherein denominations have failed
 to register but are nonetheless permitted to meet without
 harassment.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement within Jordan is unrestricted, except in certain
 military zones. With a few exceptions (primarily military
 personnel and reservists who need permission for foreign
 
 
 1205
 JORDAN
 travel), the Government does not restrict emigration or
 foreign travel. A woman must present the written consent of
 her husband, father, or male guardian to obtain a passport and
 may be required to present the same type of permission when
 she wishes to travel abroad without her husband. Children may
 have to present proof of their father's consent to leave
 Jordan.
 Citizens who have left Jordan have the right to return. There
 are no reported cases of revocation of citizenship for
 political reasons. The Parliament recently passed legislation
 allowing Jordanian citizens to have dual nationality. Some
 citizens returning to Jordan, particularly those who have
 traveled to Communist countries, are questioned by the General
 Intelligence Department regarding security matters. The
 Ministry of the Interior formerly required permits for travel
 of Jordanians to Syria, but this provision was revoked in
 1985-1986. There are restrictions on travel to and from the
 West Bank, but the Government has recently taken steps to
 facilitate such travel.
 Jordan has faced a long-term refugee problem from the influx
 of Palestinians made homeless by the 1948 and 1967
 Arab-Israeli wars. According to the most recent statistics,
 Palestinian refugees and their descendants registered with the
 United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) on the East
 Bank total 850,965, including approximately 206,000 living in
 refugee camps. The total includes refugees from the 1948
 Arab-Israeli war and does not include a large but undetermined
 number of other persons from the West Bank, Gaza, and Israel
 who have settled in the East Bank since 1948. Except for some
 refugees from Gaza, all have been granted Jordanian
 citizenship and have the unrestricted right to live, work, and
 own property. In 1987, for the first time, the Government
 issued Jordanian passports to between 26,000 and 27,000 Gazans
 resident on the East Bank who could prove they were displaced
 prior to 1971. The Interior Minister routinely grants permits
 for travel between the East Bank and Israeli-occupied
 territories.
 Jordan has granted asylum even in cases which have strained
 relations with the neighboring states.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Executive and legislative powers are constitutionally vested
 in the King, who rules with the assistance of an appointed
 Council of Ministers. The Constitution may not be amended
 without the approval of the King who, as a practical matter,
 would be unlikely to approve removal of the monarchy.
 Jordanian citizens, though enjoying a wide latitude to freely
 elect members of Parliament, are not ultimately in a position
 to replace their system of constitutional monarchy.
 Parliament, reinstated by the King in 1984, is composed of an
 appointed Senate and an elected lower house. It is
 overshadowed by the executive branch, but has the right to
 ratify treaties, royal decrees, and laws proposed by the
 Council of Ministers. It is gaining in stature and functions
 with increasing effectiveness.
 The lower house is still composed largely of members elected
 in the last national election of 1967, although since then 11
 members for the East Bahk have been elected directly and 15
 
 
 1206
 JORDAN
 members for the West Bank have been elected indirectly. A
 full third of the 30 East Bank members were elected in
 byelectionsoin 1984 and 1986. Since 1972, general elections
 have been deemed impossible because of continued Israeli
 occupation of the West Bank. Vacant East Bank seats have been
 filled through byelections which generally have been
 considered fair and open. A new Electoral Law passed in 1986
 provides for expansion of lower house membership to 142
 members, and also establishes distinct electoral districts on
 the East Bank which will allot seats to refugee camps on the
 East Bank. Vacant West Bank seats are currently filled by
 vote of the other members of Parliament. Parliament also has
 reserved seats for Christians and Circassians.
 A nat-ionwide voter registration campaign in May registered
 912,000 voters, a number thought to represent 80 percent of
 the electorate. Public expectation of elections in 1987 ran
 high in the months following the registration drive, but has
 since abated. King Hussein is now widely expected to exercise
 his constitutional authority to postpone elections for 1 or 2
 years.
 Most municipal and town councils are elected by popular vote.
 The person receiving the highest number of votes is
 traditionally confirmed as mayor by the Minister for Municipal
 Affairs and then by the Prime Minister. Women were
 enfranchised in 1973 and may also run for public office. King
 Hussein appointed a female cabinet minister in 1979 and has
 encouraged the participation of women in the political
 process, although there are no women currently serving in the
 Cabinet or Parliament.
 Organized political parties are not permitted, although
 several.informal political groups operate openly. The
 Communist Party is banned. All persons seek elected office as
 independents.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Although in the past Jordan attracted little attention from
 either private or international human rights organizations,
 this is changing. In 1987 the country received more attention
 and more criticism. The Jordanian Lawyers' Professional
 Association, which has a human rights committee, continues to
 be relatively inactive in this area. Other local
 organizations and ad hoc groups also occasionally issue
 statements and petitions on such human rights concerns as
 Palestinian rights and the ban on political parties. The
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) maintains an
 office in Amman, and its representative regularly visits all
 prisons and detention facilities. He is allowed to meet all
 detainees in accordance with standard ICRC criteria.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The role of women in society has been changing in recent
 years. Women now account for half the student body at the
 elite University of Jordan. At another educational level, a
 newly opened vocational training center in Amman has begun to
 teach women to repair radios, televisions, and office
 machinery. Such changes in educational patterns are similarly
 reflected in the work force. Women today comprise about 20
 
 
 1207
 JORDAN
 percent of the labor force, compared to 4 percent in 1975.
 Women participate generally in subordinate positi6ns and most
 heavily in clerical, teaching, and administrative jobs. There
 has been a significant increase in the number of women in such
 professions as medicine, engineering, banking, and
 architecture. However, professional women and women's
 associations believe that more remains to be done to increase
 female participation in these areas. Womenare also now
 officers in the police, and two female Jordanian pilots now
 fly for Royal Jordanian Airlines. Women increasingly operate
 businesses.
 Equality between men and women is the legal norm. In
 practice, however, certain traditions constrain women's
 freedoms, and entry of women into professional and academic
 realms traditionally the preserve of men can -spark resentment
 and opposition. While thus far the problem is limited, there
 .is public concern over the practice of intrafamily punishment,
 even killing women (or men) for violations of social mores.
 In matters of inheritance and divorce, women are treated
 differently. Under Islamic law, sons inherit twice as much as
 daughters. However, the son is required to use his
 inheritance for the maintenance of his mother and sisters,
 while a female is free to retain her inheritance for herself.
 likewise, a man may obtain a divorce more easily than a woman,
 but he may be required to pay considerable compensation based
 on the marriage contract. A recent divorce reform law
 increased compensation for women suffering from an arbitrary
 divorce. Women may also gain and retain custody of children
 until the children obtain their legal majority, but they may
 lose custody if they remarry.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Jordan's workers are protected by a comprehensive labor code
 enforced by a staff of 30 full-time inspectors of the Ministry
 of Labor. During an intensive enforcement campaign in the
 last several months of 1987, other Ministry of Labor employees
 augmented the inspection staff on a.part-time basis. Children
 under age 16 are not permitted to work except in the case of
 professional apprentices who are allowed to leave the standard
 educational track and begin part-time (6 hours a day, no night
 shifts) training at age 13. The Government prepares and
 adjusts periodically a minimum wage schedule for various
 trades, based on recommendations of an advisory panel composed
 of representatives of workers, employers, and the Government.
 Maximum working hours are 48 hours per week, with the
 exception of hotel, bar, restaurant, and movie theater
 employees, who can work up to 54 hours. Workers are entitled
 to a-weekly day of rest, rest intervals during the workday, 2
 weeks' annual paid leave, 2 weeks' annual sick leave, and
 severance pay.
 The law specifies a number of health and safety requirements,
 including bathrooms, drinking water, safety equipment, and
 first aid equipment for workers. Jordan also has a workers'
 compensation law. The Government appears to administer and
 enforce its labor laws fairly.
 As part of a campaign to improve occupational and public
 safety, the Government has created a committee to recommend
 standards and regulations. The committee held a national
 symposium, has begun a public awareness campaign, and is
 studying international safety practices. In 1987 Jordan's
 
 
 1208
 JORDAN
 social security laws were extended to cover all companies of
 five employees or more. Previously, only companies with 10
 employees qualified for coverage.
