 HONDURAS-
 Honduras is a constitutional democracy with a President and
 bicameral Congress elected every 4 years. Free and fair
 elections held on November 26 resulted in the election of
 National Party candidate Rafael Leonardo Callejas as
 President. His party won 71 seats in the 128-member
 legislature. The institutionalization of democratic reforms
 is still incomplete; in particular, the civilian government
 has yet to demonstrate that'it can ensure the disciplining of
 those members of the military who commit human rights abuses.
 Domestic security is the responsibility of the armed forces,
 including its police branch, the Public Security Force
 (FUSEP). The Armed Forces are constitutionally responsible to
 the President of the Republic but in practice operate with a
 great deal of institutional autonomy. In previous years both
 the police and members of the armed forces were involved in
 human rights abuses; there are allegations that this behavior
 continued to some extent in 1989. However, in 1989 FUSEP
 began to demonstrate a willingness to punish some abusers.
 Other branches of the armed forces appear to have tightened
 internal controls to reduce the possibility of abuse, although
 the military's resistance to making public what punitive
 actions, if any, are taken against human rights offenders
 makes it difficult to evaluate their efforts.
 Honduras is one of the poorest countries in the Western
 Hemisphere. Per capita income was officially estimated at
 $917 in 1988,but'a realistic valuation of the lempira would
 yield a per capita income of about $600. While its
 agricultural-based economy has registered modest increases
 during the last several years, the rapidly growing Honduran
 population has resulted in persistently high levels of
 unemployment and underemployment. The current high fiscal
 deficit, combined with an overvalued exchange rate, has
 inhibited private sector expansion, and the large trade
 deficit has frustrated attempts to service the rapidly growing
 exterhal debt arrears and to attract net inflows of capital.
 The high rates of criminal violence recorded over the past
 several years continued in 1989, due in part to the economic
 problems noted above. As in past years, there are credible
 reports of extrajudicial killings of suspected criminals by
 security forces. Leftwing violence included the probable
 assassinations of four persons, bank robberies, and several
 violent attacks on U.S. military personnel which injured
 several persons. The Anti-Communist Action Alliance (AAA)
 continued a sporadic graffiti campaign and telephone death
 threats directed against leftist leaders, but by year's end
 its activities had all but ceased.
 Principal human rights concerns in 1989 included political and
 other extrajudicial killings by political extremists and
 members of the security forces. The most common human rights
 violations committed by FUSEP continued to be physical abuse
 of detainees and prisoners, and incommunicado detention.
 Individual members of the security forces also were involved
 in killings arising from use of excessive force, sometimes for
 personal motives. However, FUSEP in 1989 demonstrated a new
 sensitivity to public concerns, announcing a number of
 punitive actions taken against agents guilty of human rights
 abuses. Host of those involved-in abuses were turned over for
 hearings before a military tribunal, while others were

 dishonorably discharged and sent for trial in nonmilitary
 courts.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were seven assassinations in 1989 that apparently had
 political motives. Four were likely committed by the armed
 left (three were publicly claimed by leftwing groups).
 Although there was some immediate public speculation that the
 military may have been involved in the remaining three cases,
 these remain unsolved. Conclusive evidence was lacking in all
 three cases.
 On January 7, several unidentified assailants ambushed Adan
 Rugama, a military commander of the Nicaraguan Resistance Army
 (ERN) and aide-de-camp to Enrique Bermudez, ERN
 Commander-in-Chief. Speculation that the highly professional
 assassination was carried out by members of the Cinchonero
 guerrilla organization, in collaboration with the Nicaraguan
 Embassy, has never been confirmed.
 The leftwing Popular Liberation Movement-Cinchoneros claimed
 responsibility for the ambush on January 25 in a residential
 neighborhood of Tegucigalpa in which former Commander-in-Chief
 of the Honduran Armed Forces General Gustavo Alvarez Martinez
 and his chauffeur were killed. Although it is assumed that
 the Cinchonero claim of responsibility is genuine, the
 identities of the individual assailants have never been
 established.
 The fourth victim of an attack presumed to have been committed
 by leftists was Pablo Flores Garcia, a former member of the
 Cinchoneros. Flores Garcia deserted the guerrilla group in
 1986 and provided information to the Armed Forces which
 reportedly led to the deaths of several high-ranking guerrilla
 commanders. Unknown assailants shot and killed Flores Garcia
 on July 22 near his home outside of La Lima, Cortes
 Department, and draped his body with the Cinchonero flag.
 The fifth victim in 1989 of possible politically-motivated
 violence was Edgardo Herrera, an activist in the leftist
 Student Union University Revolutionary Front (FRU)"hnd head of
 his San Pedro Sula Residential Community Organization, who was
 shot to death on July 4 by three unidentified men. There was
 an immediate public suspicion that he had been killed by the
 military in retaliation for his activities in the FRU, but
 there was no evidence to support this contention by year's end.
 On July 6, Salomon Vallecillo, President of the Honduran
 Tobacco Workers Union, while waiting at a bus stop in San
 Pedro Sula was gunned down by two men dressed as private
 security guards. Again, some public speculation centered on
 the military as possibly involved in this assassination, but
 the identity of the assassins and the motive for the murder
 remained unknown at year's end.
 Also on July 6, Jose Danilo Martinez, a union member, was shot
 and killed by a drunken police agent. The agent was given a
 dishonorable discharge and imprisoned pending trial in a
 nonmilitary court.
 
 
 632
 HONDURAS
 With the left organizing demonstrations against the
 assassinations and the Armed Forces denying involvement, a
 third killing occurred on July 11. Roberto Ramon Garay, a
 conservative political activist, an attorney, and the head of
 the Northern Regional University's Extension Program, was shot
 to death by two men as he and his family arrived at their home
 in a San Pedro Sula neighborhood. With the exception of the
 case of Danilo Martinez, no identification was made by year's
 end of any of the people involved in the killings.
 There was also no progress in identifying the perpetrators of
 the double assassination in January 1988 of Miguel Angel Pavon
 and Moises Landaverde. In late 1988 and again in early 1989,
 Fausto Reyes Caballero gave press interviews in the United
 States'in which he claimed to have been a collaborator with
 Battalion 3-16 of the Armed Forces and stated that Battalion
 members carried out the killings. Reyes Caballero said his
 information on the Pavon-Landaverde and other unsolved human
 rights cases was obtained through his own alleged ties to
 Battalion 3-16 and his work as a Honduran transit policeman in
 San Pedro Sula until August 10, 1989. On that day, according
 to Reyes Caballero, he was forced suddenly to flee Honduras
 because of an assassination attempt against him by several of
 his Battalion 3-16 "colleagues."
 An investigation by Honduran and U.S. authorities showed Reyes
 Caballero's testimony was.fabricated. Documents indicate that
 he was dishonorably discharged from the Honduran police in
 March 1984 on charges of theft and corruption, that he had
 departed Honduras for the United States in June 1984, and that
 he had lived and worked illegally in Miami since that time,
 returning to Honduras only for two brief visits.
 There was a definite increase in 1989 in the number of violent
 and unsolved deaths. As of December 17, 263 such cases had
 been reported in the press, compared to 185 for all of 1988.
 Of those cases reported through that date, the vast majority
 appear to have been cases of common crime. Fourteen deaths,
 however, were possible or probable cases of extrajudicial
 killings of criminals by the police. Three victims of almost
 certain extrajudicial killings were Pompilio Cruz Cuevas,
 Gloria Espinal Godoy, and Olga Marina Ventura Salgado. Cruz
 Cuevas was an oft-convicted criminal and the latter two were
 convicted prostitutes. All were reportedly detained by agents
 of the National Department of Investigation (DNI) on the night
 of June 20. The following day, their bodies were found on the
 outskirts of Tegucigalpa, each having been shot. In the
 remaining cases, the possibility of police involvement is far
 less substantial, most often resting only on the fact that the
 victim had or was believed to have had a criminal record.
 The police publicly accepted responsibility for another five
 killings--one a case of mistaken identity. In four cases, the
 police attempted to justify the killings by asserting that the
 victims had attempted to escape from custody. The lack of
 credibility of those claims was best illustrated in the case
 of Luis Norberto Flores, accused of heading a gang of
 thieves. Flores was arrested by the DNI on March 31. For
 several days, his wife brought him food, although she
 apparently did not see him personally. On April 3, she was
 told that Flores was not and never had been held at the jail.
 Earlier that day, Flores had been taken from his cell and into
 the city, shot four times, and left for dead. Flores managed
 to get to a hospital, but the following day two DNI
 lieutenants arrived and removed him by force. Flores' body
 
 
 633
 HONDURAS
 was later found, now with twelve bullet wounds, on a city
 street. In response to public pressure, the police finally
 admitted having killed Flores, but offered the improbable
 story that on both occasions he was leading police to his
 colleagues in crime when he tried to escape. In this, as in
 other cases involving the killings of criminals, no known
 action was taken against the police agents involved. In a
 case in which the police accepted responsibility for the
 killing of the "wrong" suspected subversive, the five agents
 involved were imprisoned pending trial before a military
 tribunal. At year's end they were still awaiting trial.
 In contrast to the apparently tacit official approval of the
 killing of repeat offenders, other agents involved in wrongful
 deaths or deaths under questionable circumstances were dealt
 with more severely. The majority of such cases related to
 deliberate and unjustified use of lethal force, negligent
 homicide, or killing for personal motives by individual
 members of the police. In many instances of such killings,
 perpetrators could not be identified by witnesses or the
 suspected assailants had fled to avoid arrest. Police agents
 identified as having been involved in 15 of approximately 22
 cases in which killings were personally motivated,
 unjustified, or due to negligence were either arrested and
 bound over for trials or hearings, or-were the subjects of
 arrest warrants. In one case a FUSEP soldier was
 surreptitiously photographed when he shot and killed an
 unarmed suspect. He was dishonorably discharged and was
 awaiting trial at year's end. In the remaining seven cases,
 it is unknown what, if any, action was taken against those
 responsible.
 The willingness of FUSEP to punish abusers and to publicize
 such punishment first became apparent in April, after which
 the agents involved in controversial cases were almost without
 exception bound over for trial or hearings. While the
 majority of such officials continue to be held under military
 jurisdiction, those responsible in a number of the more
 egregious cases were dishonorably discharged and imprisoned
 pending trials in ordinary criminal courts.
 In July FUSEP announced that 16 agents, 3 sergeants, and a
 corporal had been turned over to the courts charged with
 abuses, and that 43 soldiers and 3 officers had been dealt
 with similarly. Unlike FUSEP, the other military branches
 continue to resist making public what punitive actions, if
 any, are taken against human rights offenders. One of the few
 exceptions during the year was a highly controversial case in
 which two youths were shot and killed near a military base.
 Following a public outcry against the killings, the Armed
 Forces announced the names of the three soldiers involved and
 said that all had been charged with murder and were being held
 for trial before a military tribunal. Altogether, proceedings
 were begun between January 1 and October 11 against 28 members
 of the military charged with murder, with another 9 members
 awaiting trial for other abuses leading to injury.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances
 in 1989. The disappearance of Jose Leonel Suazo Castillo,
 while not politically motivated, appears to have been a
 deliberate criminal act of vengeance by a member of the
 military with the concurrence of his superiors. Suazo was a
 member of the Conservative National Party, although not
 
 
 634
 HONDURAS
 politically active. According to his mother, Suazo had gotten
 into a fistfight with a police official at a bar in the early
 morning hours of January 29 and the official had threatened
 him. Men identifying themselves is agents of "military
 intelligence" began an active search for Suazo. On the night
 of February 2,' Suazo told a friend that a car appeared to be
 following them. Initial press reports were that Suazo
 "disappeared" after leaving his companion. However, the
 victim's mother subsequently received information that her son
 was actually detained and handcuffed in view of eyewitnesses
 and taken away in the car that had been following him. On May
 2, during her second visit to query authorities at the seventh
 region FUSEP headquarters, Suazo's mother claims to have
 glimpsed her son in the courtyard of what she later learned
 was a FUSEP intelligence detention facility. It appeared he
 was being taken under escort from the building housing the
 cells to a vehicle. 'Since that time, Mrs. Suazo alleges, she
 has received detailed information from highly credible sources
 confirming-her son's detention. Nevertheless, police
 authorities continue to deny any knowledge of Suazo's
 whereabouts..
 The Honduran commission responsible for oversight of the
 demarcation of the Honduran-Salvadoran border reported in 1989
 that three Honduran farmers were kidnaped by Salvadoran
 guerrillas and never seen again.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading,
 Treatment or Punishment
 The use of torture is prohibited under the Constitution, and
 FUSEP has officially adopted a United Nations-approved code of
 conduct for law enforcempnt agencies which reiterates that
 prohibition and commits the police force actively to oppose
 violations. Nonetheless, the physical abuse of detainees and
 prisoners continues to be common. The most routine form of
 abuse is beating, sometimes severe, although accusations of
 more sophisticated forms of torture occasionally arise.
 Several persons in prison for arms trafficking to the
 Salvadoran guerrillas, for example, claim to have been
 subjected to electric shocks and to have been beaten on the
 soles of the feet during incommunicado detention, prior to
 being turned over to the courts.
 Abuse of prisoners appears to be fairly routine, but it is
 difficult to assess the extent to which torture occurs. Under
 the law, a confession obtained under torture is null and void;
 as a result, most prisoners brought before the courts
 automatically claim such torture and their own innocence.
 However, the Supreme Court's Department of Forensic Medicine
 is required to provide physical examinations of persons
 claiming to have been tortured in order to determine the
 validity of the charge. The Department's detailed
 documentation indicates that, of the 142 persons examined
 between Janiuary and mid-September, 39 showed evidence of abuse
 other than bruising from handcuffs or that sustained on the
 arms at the time of arrest. The most common abuse claimed by
 the prisoners was kicking and blows from various blunt
 instruments such as billy clubs, rifle butts, and sticks.
 There were three claims (one confirmed) of electric shock and
 one unconfirmed claim of burning by cigarettes. Six confirmed
 cases involved gunshot wounds and one involved sodomy. The
 Department's statistics hold DNI agents responsible in 30 of
 the 39 confirmed cases of abuse. FUSEP agents, other members
 
 
 635
 HONDURAS
 of the military, penitentiary guards, and private security
 guards were involved in the remaining confirmed cases. It is
 not known what, if any, punishment was given to those
 responsible.
 Beatings of detainees or prisoners resulted in two deaths in
 1989. Jose Martinez Mendez, a prisoner at the La Ceiba Penal
 Farm, died August 31 of injuries sustained in a beating
 administered after a failed escape attempt several days
 earlier. There has been no information released concerning
 action taken against the responsible prison guards. Melvin
 Efren Mata Garcia died the day after DNI agents, on September
 29, detained him on suspicion of selling fraudulent passports
 and beat him severely. On October 4, FUSEP announced that the
 two responsible agents had been dishonorably discharged and
 were being held in the Central Penitentiary pending trial in a
 nonmilitary court.
 The total number of security agents held for trial on charges
 of physical abuse of detainees or prisoners is unavailable.
 Press reports, however, reveal that at least some offenders
 are being held. Two FUSEP sergeants accused of torture of
 civilian detainees in Olancho Department were both turned over
 for hearings before the Military Tribunal, and the superior
 officer of one of the offenders was also disciplined for
 failure to supervise the actions of his subordinates. In
 another case, a special forces officer, who shot and injured a
 civilian for refusing to take off military trousers he was
 wearing, was given a dishonorable discharge and turned over
 for trial in a nonmilitary court. There were other similar
 cases reported throughout the year. Approximately 20 police
 agents are currently serving sentences in the Central
 Penitentiary for human rights abuses.
 After the military took over administration of the Central
 Penitentiary in February, a move prompted by charges of
 massive corruption and organized criminal activity involving
 both prison officials and inmates, there were many charges of
 torture. Many believe that the complaints of torture came
 essentially from those whose interests were compromised by the
 change in the prison's management. In May, in response to
 continuing controversy, the Government turned the penitentiary
 back to civilian control, leading to an immediate cessation in
 accusations of torture.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under the law, a person may be arrested only with specific
 court authorization in the form of an Order of Arrest and must
 be informed clearly of the grounds of arrest. The suspect may
 be held no longer than 24 hours by security forces before
 being turned over to the court, where evidence supporting
 legal processing is reviewed. Within 6 days, the court is
 obligated to order either the release of the detainee or his
 remission to a penal center pending trial. Bail is both
 available and widely used.
 Despite these legal provisions, the police and other elements
 of the security forces carried out an undetermined number of
 detentions without judicial order in 1989. In addition, the
 police appear frequently to violate the 24-hour rule, often
 holding detainees for questioning well beyond the legal
 period. Other than cases involving terrorism and/or
 subversion, generally handled by the military, most of the
 violations of the laws and regulations governing arrest and
 
 
 636
 HONDURAS
 detention are committed by agents of FUSEP and, most
 particularly, of the DNI. The length of incommunicado
 detention varied from several hours to several weeks.
 Detainees, in many instances, are'simply released at the end
 of their illegal detention, rather than turned over to the
 courts.
 Continuing violations of the laws of detention and arrest have
 raised understandable concerns about other related abuses,
 including possible extrajudicial killing of suspected
 criminals. According to press reports, the DNI arrested
 Miguel Antonio Ramos on May 25 and his two colleagues, Felipe
 Amador and Juan Ramon Avila, on June 5, on suspicion of
 murder. The families have reportedly been unable to determine
 their ghereabouts.
 Although incommunicado detention and failure to comply with
 writs of habeas corpus do not seem to be widespread, there
 continue to be credible reports of such violations.
 Compliance with writs of habeas corpus is occasionally evaded
 by the transfer-of detainees from one detention facility to
 another.
 There have been no cases of forced exile. With regard to
 forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 All nonmilitary trials in Honduras are public; there are
 neither secret tribunals nor political prisoners. The law
 provides for a fair trial of accused persons. Persons accused
 of a crime have -the right to an initial hearing by a judge to
 assess the merits of the charges, to bail, and to an attorney,
 provided by the State if necessary. The defendant also has
 the right to an appeal and is considered innocent until proven
 guilty. The Armed Fdrces maintains a separate judicial system
 of military tribunals for cases involving military personnel.
 Proceedings in these forums are not open to the public.
 Despite legal guarantees of fair trial, in practice this right
 is often abridged. Acute shortages of both human and material
 resources has impeded improvements, and the judiciary remains
 the least effective branch of government in Honduras.
 The most serious inequity of the judiciary has been the
 absence of a public defender system to handle cases of
 indigent persons, most of whom consequently have failed to
 receive a timely adjudication of their cases. A 1987 '
 government order for the courts to provide state-hired-
 attorneys for the poor was not implemented in 1988 for lack of
 funding, although private organizations volunteered some legal
 services for the indigent. In May, with assistance from the
 U.S. Agency for International Development (A.I.D.), the
 Government established a Public Defendants Office (PDO). As
 of September 30, the PDO had 240 cases in its dockets, in
 which 58 defendants were at the plenary stage and 30 had been
 sentenced or set free.
 In January 1989, the Government announced that 84 percent of
 the country's prisoners had not been sentenced. That figure
 represented only a slight improvement over the 85 percent
 figure given in mid-1988 and the 88 percent cited in
 mid-1987. Records indicated that, regardless of the court, a
 prison stay of 2 or 3 years pending sentencing is by no means
 uncommon. Much of the delay in sentencing was attributable to
 
 
 637
 HONDURAS
 backlogs in judicial processing, understaffing in the courts,
 or the poor quality of judges in the lower courts. For
 example, a judge in El Progreso, Yoro, issued only two
 decisions in the 126 cases pending at the start of the year.
 Another factor that has contributed to the backlog, according
 to many judges, is the lack of a judicial investigative system
 that would assist in and expedite decisions. The judicial
 branch has yet to receive resources equal to the
 constitutionally mandated 3 percent of the total annual budget
 of the Honduran Government. .Under an A.I.D.-funded program,
 justices of the peace are gradually being replaced with
 legally qualified personnel chosen on the basis of merit.
 Twenty-seven law school graduates were chosen in 1968 and 27
 more in 1989 through a competitive examination to fill
 vacancies in the same number of courts. This merit system
 will continue until all justices of the peace are both
 educationally qualified and proven competent in practice. In
 addition to upgrading the quality of judicial services, the
 new system offers the nominees unlimited tenure, with removal
 permitted only for due cause, a major step toward curtailing
 political influence in judicial decisions.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government respects the constitutionally protected rights
 to personal and family privacy and the inviolability of the
 home and private communications. Telephonic and written
 correspondence is generally free from monitoring, although, as
 provided by law, official review of such communications may be
 authorized by judicial order for specific purposes, such as
 criminal investigations, or national security. Similarly,
 private homes may be searched only on the basis of a judicial
 order, with the exception of "urgent cases" in order to
 "impede the commission of crimes or avoid grave harm to
 persons or property." There were no known violations of these
 rights during 1989.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and press, and
 those rights are normally respected in practice. A wide range
 of political opinions are carried in the print media as well
 as in television and radio broadcasting. With the exception
 of one government-owned radio station, all of the
 communications media--newspapers, over 100 radio, and 4
 television stations--are privately owned. Criticism of the
 Government and the Armed Forces is routine. Despite
 occasional sharp exchanges between the media and government
 authorities, there are normally no efforts by the authorities
 to suppress expression of opinion. However, the Armed Forces
 did begin legal proceedings in January against the editor of a
 major daily newspaper for two editorials considered defamatory
 to the military. The suit was subsequently allowed to lapse
 in the courts.
 Academic freedom is respected in Honduras. Academic and
 political organizations abound in the university and secondary
 schools, and many are well to the left-of-center or affiliated
 with radical left groups. On-campus discipline of these
 sometimes violent groups was left to academic administrators
 in 1989.
 
 
 638
 HONDURAS
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right to peaceful assembly for political, religious, or
 other purposes is clearly provided-for by the Constitution.
 No prior authorization or permit is necessary, although
 open-air assemblies may require a permit for "the sole purpose
 of guaranteeiftg public order." Antigovernment and other
 demonstrations were carried out on a routine basis without
 impediment throughout the year.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although predominantly Roman Catholic, Honduras has no state
 religion. All forms of religious expression are
 constitutionally protected, and foreign missionaries operate
 in many parts of the country. The Constitution contains an
 express provision that no clergyman of any religion may hold
 public office or engage in political propaganda based on
 religious motives or beliefs. There is no attempt to control
 or impede the free expression of religious beliefs or
 proselytization in Honduras.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens are normally unimpeded in entry into or exit from
 Honduras, and travel freely within the country's national
 borders. In locations near the border with El Salvador,
 security concerns related to the movement of Salvadoran
 guerrillas have led to the imposition of a 9:00 p.m. curfew.
 There are also limited security-related travel restrictions
 along the Nicaraguan border. There are no permanent travel
 restrictions for Hondurans or resident foreigners, although
 national security concerns have led to increased police checks
 for personal identification. Exit visas are required to leave
 Honduras but are not denied on political grounds.
 Hondurans returning from Communist or Arab nations have been
 questioned at length about their travels, and citizens of all
 Communist and most Arab nations need special permission to
 enter Honduras.
 Although not a party to the U.N. Convention on Refugees,
 Honduras has maintained a generous policy with regard to
 refugees from neighboring countries. Despite increased
 popular resentment of the refugees and the perceived costs for
 Honduran citizens, the policy has remained unchanged to date.
 There were few new additions to the officially documented,
 refugee population during 1989, with the exception of the
 Nicaraguan camps, which added between 100 and 150 new entries
 per month. Most of the new entrants arrived directly from
 Nicaragua, h change from 1988 when the new arrivals came
 largely from unofficial refugee settlements within the
 country. At the end of October, the U.N. High Commissioner
 for Refugees (UNHCR) was caring for 12,137 Salvadorans, 23,636
 Nicaraguans (9,000 of those Miskito and Sumo Indians), and 441
 Guatemalans.
 Refugee repatriations began in earnest in 1988 and continued
 in 1989. Through the end of October 1,441 Salvadorans, 5
 Guatemalans, 480 Nicaraguan Ladinos, and 1,479 Nicaraguan
 
 
 639
 HONDURAS
 Indians had taken advantage of voluntary repatriation.
 Repatriations from the Salvadoran camps were suspended by the
 Government of El Salvador for a short time in September to
 allow the newly installed Government to review repatriation
 procedures. By the end of the year, however, several
 large-scale repatriations had taken place, including the
 orderly departure of 1,180 refugees from-the Mesa Grande
 camp. Scheduled repatriations from Colomonagua and San
 Antonio camps in November and December, however, were called
 off when approximately 1,200 refugees from Colomoncagua staged
 an unauthorized walkout of the camp on November 18. The
 'spontaneous* repatriation (apparently pre-arranged to
 coincide with the FMLN offensive in El Salvador) violated an
 agreement between the refugees and the Government of El
 Salvador that all those returning would cooperate with
 documentation prior to departure from the camps. The
 returnees entered El Salvador at the Las Flores border post,
 in territory that is under control of the Salvadoran
 guerrillas. On December 9, the Colomoncagua refugees staged a
 second, similar repatriation in which approximately 500
 persons participated. Those repatriations brought the
 officially documented dalvadoran refugee population in
 Honduras down to 10,437 by mid-December. However, the refusal
 to cooperate with the Salvadoran authorities in documentation
 prevented the expected and much larger repatriation of some
 10,000 Salvadoran refugees by early 1990. The UNHCR provided
 no assistance in these unilateral repatriations undertaken
 without the consent of the country-of-origin Government.
 Fewer problems of refugee abuse were reported than in 1988.
 The repressive control exercised by guerrilla-affiliated camp
 coordinators in the Salvadoran settlements was responsible for
 much of the outflow of refugees from Colomoncagua and Mesa
 Grande camps in the first half of 1989. Refugees took
 advantage of UNHCR offers of third-country resettlement to
 leave the'camps, despite the objections of coordinating
 com mittees. Once outside of the camps, these refugees offered
 first-hand details of serious abuses committed against
 "dissidents" by the coordinating committees. In addition, the
 female official of an international organization was forcibly
 stripped at the orders of camp coordinators at San Antonio in
 retaliation for having delivered mail to refugees against the
 wishes of the coordinators.
 Honduran handling of Nicaraguan refugees was less positive
 than in the past. There were credible reports of cases of
 forced repatriation as well as incidents of arbitrary
 detention of officially documented refugees, who were removed
 from the camls and held for sometimes lengthy periods.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Changd Their Government
 Hondurans have and exercise the right to change their
 government through democratic means. National and municipal
 governments are chosen by free, secret, direct, and obligatory
 balloting every 4 years. A president may serve only one term;
 any vice president (there are three) who serves, even on an
 interim basis, as acting president is prohibited from running
 for the office of president. All Honduran-born citizens have
 the right to hold office, except for members of the clergy and
 the Armed Forces.
 All four legal political parties paticipated in the third
 consecutive national election that took place on November 26,

 HONDURAS
 1989 in which the President, all members of the National.
 Congress, and all elected officials at the municipal level
 were selected. The two major parties, the National and the
 Liberal, received 94 percent of the votes cast. Rafael
 Leonardo Callejas of the opposition National Party won the
 presidential election with 51 percent of the vote to 43
 percent for Carlos Flores Facusse of the ruling Liberal
 Party. The National Party also won a majority of the seats in
 the unicameral legislature (71 seats to 55 seats for the
 Liberals and 2 seats for the PINU-Social Democrats).
 Complaints from-the then-ruling party that the National
 Elections Tribunal and the National Registry of Persons were
 manipulated to its detriment led to calls for major reforms of
 both those bodies.
 Organizers of a new party must present a'petition of 10.000
 signatures of members to obtain legal status.  If a party
 fails to gain that same minimum number of votes in any
 election in which it participates, it loses legal status.
 Given the deep historical affiliations with the two major
 parties, it hasiproven very difficult for new parties to gain
 sufficient popular support to qualify for legal status.
 There were complaints during the pre-election period that the
 major parties had manipulated electoral laws and mechanict to
 block the inscription of an independent candidate. The
 leaders of the two smaller parties complained that such action
 has denied them equal advantage under the electoral system.
 Each of the small parties received less than 2 percent of the
 total national vote in the elotion.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government cooperates with local and international human
 rights organizations, and the President frequently met with
 visiting delegations of human rights monitors and activists
 from abroad. The governmental Inter-Institutional Commission
 on Human Rights handles both domestic and international
 inquiries concerning human rights and has been responsive to
 inquiries.*
 Honduras was condemned in 1988 in the first two cases of
 disappearance ever tried in the Inter-American Human Rights
 Court (IAHRC) in San Jose,, Costa Rica. The Court ordered
 Honduras to pay an undetermined indemnity to the families
 involved, the sums of which were to be negotiated between the
 relatives of the victims and the Government. When the
 negotiations reached an impasse in 1989 the Court itself
 established a sum per family equivalent to approximately
 $200,000 at the actual, as opposed to the official, rate of
 exchange. The Government of Honduras took strong exception to
 the court ruling, arguing that it violated an agreement
 reached p.reviously with court representatives concerning the
 factors tobe used in arriving at a fair settlement. In late
 1989 the President sent to the Congress draft legislation
 authorizing payment, but the Congress failed to approve the
 legislation before recessing in December.
 In the fAnal case before the.IAHRC, the Court found
 insufficient evidence to find Honduras responsible for the
 disappearances of two Costa Ricans in 1981.
 
 
 HONDURAS
 In September 1989, a representative of the U.N. Commission on
 Human Rights visited Honduras at the invitation of the
 Government. The main purpose of the visit was to investigate
 the use of torture. To that end, the U.N. representative was
 given full liberty to inspect courts and prisons, speak with
 inmates, and meet with any groups and persons of interest. He
 issued no findings prior to his departure, but indicated a
 full report would be issued following his return to Geneva.
 The best-known of the nongovernmental human rights
 organizations is the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights
 in Honduras (CODEH) and its Central American-wide affiliate,
 CODEHUCA. Despite a number of genuine efforts on behalf of
 human rights, CODEH's charges frequently have been exaggerated
 and ill-documented, and in some cases false. Many observers
 in Honduras consider the group to be highly politicized and
 partisan. Although CODEH in the past routinely published its
 findings in the Honduran press, allowing a detailed study of
 its claims, no CODEH reports were so issued in 1989.
 Nevertheless, CODEH presented various statistics during the
 year, and a comparison of those documents revealed serious
 discrepancies.
 A new human rights organization, the Authentic Committee for
 the Defense of Human Rights in Honduras (CODEH-A), was
 established in 1989. The group was founded by Hector Orlando
 Vasquez, whose public dispute with CODEH President Ramon
 Custodio allegedly led to threats against Vasquez' life.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution expressly prohibits discrimination on the
 basis of sex, race, class, or any other basis. Education is
 equally available to both males and females, but in practice
 women are limited in some careers because of strongly held
 cultural values and attitudes, despite the absence of any
 overt impediment. Ethnic minorities, while enjoying full
 equality under the law, continue to be the object of some
 social discrimination.
 Physical abuse of women, particularly in the home, is a common
 feature of life in Honduras, and reflects the country's
 male-dominant culture. Although Honduran law offers remedy to
 the victims, few women avail themselves of the legal process.
 There are credible reports that women held in the country's
 jails are sometimes raped or pressured into providing sexual
 favors in return for their release, but charges of such abuse
 have been brought to court in only a few instances.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers are free to organize themselves into labor unions.
 Labor unions have been active in Honduras over the past 36
 years and continue to exert considerable influence, both
 economically and politically.
 The right to strike, along with a wide range of other basic
 labor rights, is provided for by the Constitution and honored
 in practice. Even though the civil service code stipulates
 that public workers do not have the right to strike, neither
 public nor privte sector strikes were not declared illegal in
 1989. There were several major strikes, including a 9-day
 
 
 642
 HONDURAS
 walkout by health workers. The longest strike in Honduran
 history, the 81-day walkout of the Teachers' Pension Fund,
 ended when the President agreed that workers' wages lost
 during the strike Would be paid.
 Honduras' trade union m6vement maintains close ties with
 international trade union organizations. Th6 largest union
 group, the Confederation of Honduran Workers, is an affiliate
 of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
 (ICFTU). The second largest, the General Workers Central, is
 affiliated with'the 1korld Confederation of Labor. The third
 major organization, the Unitary Federation of Honduran
 Workers, is affiliated with the Communist-controlled World
 Federation of Trade Unions. The three labor organizations
 claim to represent about 20 percent of all Honduran workers,
 including a substantial number of peasants and rural laborers.
 A number of private firms have instituted labor/management
 "solidarity* associations. Organized labor, including the
 American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial
 Organizations (AFL-CIO) and thd ICFTU, expressed strong
 opposition to these associations on the grounds that they do
 not permit strikes and have inadequate grievance procedures.
 Nevertheless, the membership of such associations has
 increased in the last few years from 2,000 to approximately
 10,000. Solidarity organizations are not formally recognized
 by the Ministry of Labor.
 In its 1989 report, the ILO Committee of Experts (COE) renewed
 its request to the Goverlnent to bring certain provisions of
 its legislation into conformance with Convention 87 on Freedom
 of Association, including provisions which: place a numerical
 restriction on the right to organize; limit to one the number
 of unions per enterprise; require that union officers must be
 engaged in the work of the workers they represent; require
 that two-thirds of the membership present must approve a
 strike action; grant the Government broad powers to prohibit,
 or require lengthy procedures for, strikes in certain
 industries. Also in 1989, the ILO Committee on Freedom of
 Association (CFA) expressed satisfaction with the Goveriment's
 action granting legal recognition to union federation.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to organize and to bargain collectively are
 protected by law and observed in practice. Retribution by
 employers for trade union activity is not uncommon, in spite
 of a specific provision in the labor code against such
 activity. There were two killings of trade unionists, one of
 which may have been politically motivated (see Section l.a.).
 On November 15 unidentified persons exploded a bomb at a
 residence occupied by the leader of the electrical workers'
 union. There were no personal injuries and no group has
 claimed responsibility for the incident. However, these
 rights and guarantees are jealously guarded by the powerful
 union movement which does not hesitate to make use of the
 legal system to enforce their observance. The prevalence of
 unionized labor in the workplace and its political influence
 act as a further defense against antiunion discrimination or
 pressures. The free trade zones are governed by the same
 labor regulations as the rest of private industry, and
 conditions in these export processing plants is generally
 considered to be superior to the national average.

 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced or compulsory labor in Honduras; such
 practices are prohibited by law and by the Constitution.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Constitution and the Labor Code prohibit the employment of
 children under the age of 16 years. Violations of the labor
 code frequently occur in rural areas or in small companies.
 High unemployment and underemployment have resulted in many
 children supplementing the family income by working in small
 family farms or as street vendors. The Government does not
 have the capability to enforce child labor laws in these
 situations.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Constitution and the labor code require that all labor be
 fairly paid; minimum wages, working hours, vacations, and
 occupational safety are all regulated by law. The minimum
 wage, revised as of January 1, 1990, varies by occupation and
 ranges from $3 to.$5 dollars per day. It is doubtful that the
 new minimum wage is sufficient to provide a decent standard of
 living. Many households will need to pool family members'
 salaries to survive. The minimum wage is expected to be
 raised again in the near future.
 The standard workday is 8 hours; a standard workweek is 44
 hours. The Labor Code provides for a paid vacation of 10.
 workdays after 1 year, and 20 workdays after 4 years. The
 regulations are frequently ignored in practice as a result of
 the high level of unemployment and underemployment.
 An ILO technical expert investigated allegations by labor of
 improper use of pesticides in the banana industry. A
 U.S.-owned company agreed to make the recommended changes in
 production, but small independent banana producers reportedly
 disregard safety in the use of pesticide. There have also
 been verified instances where Miskito scuba divers have died
 or suffered injuries by improper diving procedures in the
 unregulated lobster fishing industry. In December the
 Government prohibited the use of scuba divers in the
 lobster-fishing industry. Boat owners and Miskito Indians
 protested the prohibition because of lost income to the large
 number of divers and the lobster fishing industry. A motion
 to cancel the prohibition was pending before the courts at
 year's end.
