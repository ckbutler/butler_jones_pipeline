 SWITZERLAND
 Switzerland is a constitutional democracy with a federal
 structure of government which gives individual cantons a
 considerable degree of autonomy. Federal legislative power is
 vested in a bicameral legislature elected by universal
 suffrage every 4 years. In spite of linguistic and religious
 diversity, Switzerland has built up a political system based
 on consensus in which all citizens have the right and the
 opportunity to express their opinions and yet work together
 toward common objectives.
 Switzerland, a country with long and respected democratic
 traditions and institutions, has over the years built an
 admirable record with regard to human rights. Although under
 the Swiss Federal system cantons are directly involved in many
 human rights matters, this involvement is controlled and
 limited by Federal legislative and constitutional guarantees.
 All those who feel that their rights have been violated at the
 cantonal level can appeal for redress to the Federal courts.
 Switzerland has traditionally provided facilities to many
 international organizations concerned with humanitarian
 affairs as well as extended support to refugees from around
 the world. Nine international trade secretariats are
 headquartered in Switzerland, as is the International Labor
 Organization.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 No such occurrences have taken place in Switzerland. However,
 a group apparently seeking the separation of the francophone
 portion of canton Bern claimed responsibility for a bomb
 explosion in front of the district courthouse in Moutier in
 September. There were no casualties.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no reports of abduction, secret arrests, or
 clandestine detention.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution provides freedom from all of the above, and
 there have been no allegations of any violations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile is
 guaranteed by law. A detained person may not be held longer
 than 24 hours without a warrant of arrest issued by the judge
 conducting the preliminary investigation. Once the warrant is
 issued, the individual may be detained as long as necessary
 until the investigation is completed. However, the length of
 investigative detention is always reviewed by higher judicial
 authority and, traditionally, investigations are completed
 within a very brief period. A suspect must immediately be
 shown the warrant under which he or she is being held, and he
 or she has a right to contact legal counsel as soon as an

 SWITZERLAND
 arrest warrant is issued. Bail, or release on personal
 recognizance, is traditionally granted, unless the examining
 magistrate believes the individual is a danger to society or
 will not appear for trial.
 There is no forced or compulsory labor in Switzerland.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution guarantees public trials. Minor cases are
 tried by a single judge; difficult cases by a panel of judges;
 and murder or other serious crimes by public jury. According
 to longstanding tradition, even the most serious cases are
 usually brought to trial within several weeks, or, at the
 most, a few months.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There have been no allegations of violations in this area by
 Swiss authorities.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There are no restrictions of freedom of speech and press in
 Switzerland except in cases involving groups or associations
 considered a potential threat to the State. However, no
 groups or associations are so designated at the present time.
 A peripheral issue involves the linguistic minorities,
 specifically the Italian and Romansch linguistic groups.
 Occasionally, these groups have expressed their fear that the
 limited resources made available to them by the Government
 endanger the continued intellectual vitality of these
 languages and amount to a deprivation of freedom of speech.
 The Government is fully aware of these concerns and has taken
 steps to meet them.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The only restriction Switzerland places on peaceful assembly
 and association is the requirement to obtain permits from
 police authorities before holding public meetings. These
 permits are rarely refused except in cases where the
 authorities have reason to believe that the meeting will lead
 to violence. Occasionally, demonstrations, mostly involving
 youth, have become violent, and there have been complaints of
 police overreaction. In the rare instances when this has
 happened, public opinion and the media have strongly reacted
 to abuses of authority and asked that steps be taken to avoid
 repetition of similar incidents.
 Labor unions enjoy full freedom to organize, strike, and
 influence political decisions. Swiss labor relations have
 been characterized by industrial peace, and strikes and other
 labor unrest are practically unknown.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Switzerland enjoys religious freedom. One area which, over
 the years, has caused difficulties, however, is the issue of
 universal military service by Swiss men. Swiss law provides
 
 
 1103
 SWITZERLAND
 no exemption for conscientious objectors, who are nearly
 always convicted for their refusal to serve. Efforts have
 been made to modify the Constitution in order to provide
 alternative service for those who wish to claim exemption for
 reasons of conscience. These efforts, so far unsuccessful,
 continue,
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Swiss citizens have freedom to travel in or outside the
 country and can emigrate without difficulty. Switzerland has
 traditionally been a haven for refugees from many countries.
 Currently about 32,000 Swiss residents, the vast majority from
 Eastern Europe, Africa, and Asia, have permanent refugee
 status. In addition, over 22,000 persons have pending
 applications for political asylum. In recent years the
 traditional welcome to refugees has been tempered by the
 growing influx of asylum-seekers, whose presence has placed
 significant strains on public-supported social services.
 Overall, however, the Swiss people remain prepared to provide
 shelter and assistance to refugees, as reflected in Federal
 and cantonal governments' actions. Applicants who fail to
 meet the criteria for political asylum are required to depart
 Switzerland. On November 3, 1985, 59 Africans were expelled
 from Switzerland and flown to Kinshasa. Swiss authorities
 stated that it was impossible to determine their nationality
 with certainty since they carried false identity papers. Most
 were believed to be from Zaire.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Switzerland is a highly developed, constitutional democracy.
 Popular initiatives and referendums afford an effective
 instrument to the citizen, as well as the group, to pursue
 significant changes in policies through direct action. One of
 the 26 Swiss cantons still excludes female suffrage at the
 cantonal and local levels.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There were no requests during 1985 for outside investigations
 of the human rights situation. Switzerland cooperates with
 international and nongovernmental groups in all areas of human
 rights, and Swiss nationals play a prominent role in the
 International Committee of the Red Cross and other
 humanitarian nongovernmental organizations.
 In its 1985 Report, Amnesty International continued to express
 concern over the imprisonment of conscientious objectors to
 military service and the lack of any alternative civilian
 service. Freedom House rated Switzerland "free".
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Switzerland has a total population of nearly 6.5 million with
 a growth rate of 0.1 percent. Per capita gross national
 product in 1983 was $16,290. Unemployment, which until 1982
 was practically nonexistent, has again fallen below I percent
 but remains a cause of concern.

 SWITZERLAND
 Health services are available and good. The infant mortality
 rate stands at 7.2 per 1,000 live births, andilife expectancy
 at birth is 79.1 years (1985).. Education is of high quality
 and free through university level. Access to universities,
 however, is closely controlled through tough entrance
 examinations. A recurrent complaint-of the.Italian-speaking
 minority is the lack of an Italian-language university in
 Switzerland. In 1985, plans were-announced.for the
 establishment in Lugano of an Italophone Technical-Institute,
 which would offer university-level training but not-grant
 degrees. The adult literacy rate is 99,percent.
 The minimum age for.the employment of children is 15 years,
 except that children.zover.the age of 13-may be employed for
 light duties, such as helping-in retail stores. In th{s case,
 they are limited to 9 hours of work per week during the school
 year and 15 hours otherwise. Strict regulations govern the
 employment of young people between the.ages of 15 and 20. For
 examplei they may.not work-at-night or onSundays, or under
 .hazardous or dangerous conditions.
 There is no national minimum wage. Wages in industry are
 freely negotiated between employers and employees as part of
 the collectivebargaining process-between employer
 associations and labor unions. The Labor Act sets maximum
 hours of work at 45.hours for blue- and white-collar workers
 in industry, offices,,,and the retail trade, and 50 hours for
 all other workers..-Currently the workweek for blue-collar
 workers in most-.industriesis 43 hours, and for white-collar
 workers obetweenAO and 43 hours. -Overtime is restricted by
 law to 220 hours annually.
 Both the Labor Act and the Federal Code of Obligations contain
 extensive regulations to protect the health and safety of
 workers. Special provisions exist for female workers, who may
 not be employed for dangerous work or, in most cases, at night.
 About 15 -percent of the population is made up of foreign
 workers and their families. The Government has taken steps in
 recent years to limit the number of foreign workers coming
 into Switzerland or obtaining residence permits. Real estate
 acquisition by foreigners is strictly controlled and has at
 times been the object of concern. The Government and cantonal
 authorities have also started to look into the need to
 integrate foreign workers and their families into Swiss social
 services programs. In times of economic difficulties and
 unemployment, Swiss nationals in some areas of the country
 resent any additional..facilities provided to foreign workers.
 Women:.still are subject to some legal disabilities, reflecting
 their traditionally subordinate role in Swiss society;
 however, recent years have seen steady progress toward
 political equality.
 Women's limited involvement in the Swiss political and
 business worlds is expanding slowly. The 25 women elected to
 the Federal Parliament in 1983 represent 10 percent of that
 body, while women constitute 51 percent of the population.
 Since 1984, a woman has served on the seven-member Federal
 Council,-the nation's governing executive body.
 A~major advance-in 1985-was ratification by referendum of a
 new Marriage Law, -which grants wives equal legal status and
 property rights. On the other hand, Swiss women are still
 
 
 1105
 SWITZERLAND
 paid less than men for equal work and remain underrepresented
 in senior positions in industry, banking, and government.
 The Federal Government has been careful in the apportionment
 of funds to try to ensure that all linguistic groups have
 commensurate facilities and means to carry out cultural
 activities in their own language. However, the small (50,000)
 Romansch-speaking minority in 1985 issued a call for greater
 support, particularly in the areas of education and mass
 communications, in order to reverse a persistent historical
 decline in Romansch usage.
