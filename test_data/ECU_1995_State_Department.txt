 ECUADOR
 Ecuador is a constitutional republic with a president and a 77-member unicam-
 eral legislature chosen in free elections. President Sixto Duran Ballen's governing
 coalition controls only nine seats in the Congess. Congress has .sweeping powers
 to question and censure cabinet ministers; such censure results in automatic dismis-
 sal of the minister in question. This is often used as a political tool by opposition
 political parties. The Duran Ballen administration was targeted for censure when
 ongres threatened the Vice President, Alberto Dahik, with impeachment for ob-
 struction ofjustice. Dahik fled the country, leaving Eduardo Pena as his successor.
 Members of the Supreme Court preside over a judiciary that is constitutionally inde-
 pendent but in practice is susceptible to outside pressure.
 The Ecuadorian military enjoys substantial autonomy, reinforced by guaranteed
 revenues from the nation's oil exports, as well as from civil aviation, shipping, and
 other economic sectors. The military has maintained a low profile in domestic poli-
 tics since the return to constitutional rule in 1979. The National Police, responsible
 for domestic law enforcement and maintenance of internal order, falls under the ci-
 vilian Ministry of Government and Police. There continued to be credible allegations
 
 
 of human rights abuses by the police and, in some isolated cases, members of the
 military.
 The economy is based on private enterprise, although there continued to be heavy
 government involvement in key sectors such as petroleum, utilities, and aviation.
 The gross domestic product at $1,570 per capita, provides most of the population
 with a low standard of living. The inflation rate for the year ending in November
 was 22 percent. The principal exports are oil, bananas, and shrimp, which are the
 country's leading sources of foreign exchange. Manufacturing for regional export
 markets is of growing importance. Most Ecuadorians are employed in the urban in-
 formal sector or as rural agricultural workers; rural poverty is extensive, and
 underemployment is high.
 The most fundamental human rights abuse stems from shortcomings in the politi-
 cized and inefficient legal and judicial system. People are subject to arbitrary arrest;
 once incarcerated, they may wait years before coming to trial unless they resort to
 paying bribes. Other human     rights abuses included isolated instances of
 extrajudicial killings; torture and other mistreatment of prisoners and detainees by
 the police; poor prison conditions; government failure to prosecute and punish
 human rights abusers; and violence and pervasive discrimination against women,
 Afro-Ecuadorians, and indigenous people. In the wake of renewed border hostilities
 with Peru in January, a number of Peruvian nationals were arrested by security
 forces on charges of espionage, and were not released until several months after
 armed hostilities had ceased in March. The Government made progress toward pros-
 ecuting those responsible for two longstanding human rights cases in 1995, although
 the escape from military custody of the highest ranking defendant in one case re-
 newed questions about the impunity of senior military officials.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings. There continued to be credible reports of police involvement in
 extrajudicial killings, although the number of such reports continued to decline. The
 police often acted with impunity in such cases, because disciplinary action is the re-
 sponsibility of the police itself. Although special police courts usually try cases in-
 volving police officers as defendants, the Government in some cases revoked this
 right and tried officers in civil courts.
 The Catholic Church-based Ecumenical Committee for Human Rights (CEDHU)
 reported a total of eight extrajudicial killings. Four of these involved the death of
 individuals in police or military custody, while two others appear to be the result
 of personal fights between victims and a policeman in one case and a soldier in an-
 other. One case involved the death of a high school student who was hit by a stray
 bullet during student protests in January. Forensic experts determined that the bul-
 let, presumably fired by the poie, had hit a hard surfae before ricocheting and
 hitting the victim. Four other students were injured by tear gas canisters fired by
 police in the same incident. During student protests in November, a bystander was
 killed when police fired tear gas canisters into a crowd.
 While most of the abuses were committed by the police, CEDHU reported that the
 military was responsible for the death in custody of Luis Enriquez Mera in June.
 Sailors from the navy base at San Lorenzo, in the province of Esmeraldas, detained
 Enriquez during an unsuccessful search for his brother, who was accused of killing
 a marine sergeant, and took him to the base for questioning. Four days later, mili-
 tary authorities gave his dead body, which bore signs of torture, back to the family
 saying that he had died of heart failure. Four enlisted men were detained and face
 criminal charges in this case. There were other credible allegations of abuses com-
 mitted by army and navy units participating in anticrime activities in the province
 of Esmeraldas, which has Ecuador's highest crime rate.
 There was progress toward prosecution of those responsible for two of the prin-
 cipal human rights cases in Ecuador-the 1988 disappearance and presumed deaths
 of the Restrepo brothers and the 1985 disappearance and murder of Consuelo
 Benavides. In the case of the Restrepo brothers, the Supreme Court dismissed an
 appeal by the police officers implicated in the case and ratified their sentences. The
 sentences varied in length from 16 years for those who murdered the brothers to
 2 years for those who covered up the crime. The former police commander, General
 Gilberto Molina, was among those convicted of participation in the coverup. He had
 escaped from police custody in 1992, but turned himself in to authorities in July
 to serve the remaining 11 months of his sentence.
 The Supreme Court ruled in March that there was sufficient evidence to try Navy
 Commander Fausto Morales and Sergeant Sagnay Leon in the case of Consuelo
 
 
 401
 Benavides, a school teacher who was murdered in 1985 for alleged participation in
 a guerrilla organization. Both defendants were in preventive detention, pending a
 ruling by the court. Three days after the ruling, Morales escaped from the brig and
 has not been recaptured. Three other navy officers were subsequently indicted by
 the court for their alleged role in the disappearance and murder of Benavides. Two
 were found guilty of illegal arrest and were sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment. The
 President of the Supreme Court expedited the case against the three defendants in
 custody and concluded the appeal process only days before the expiration of statute
 of limitations. Sergeant Sagnay was sentenced to 8 years in prison for his role in
 Benavides' murder. Other suspects in the case, including Captain Fausto Morales,
 remain at large.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although the law prohibits torture and similar forms of intimidation and punish-
 ment, police continued to physically mistreat suspects and prisoners, usually with
 impunity. CEDHU regularly published detailed reports on suspects who charged the
 bolice with torture. In these reports CEDHU frequently named police officials al-
 leged to be responsible, and often included photographs of the victims with their
 wounds. In most cases, the police appeared to have abused such persons during in-
 vestigations of ordinary street crime. According to CEDHU, the victims reported
 that the police beat them, burned them with cigarettes, or threatened them psycho-
 lo "cally.
 ugst four Colombian nationals were detained by the army on suspicion that
 they planned to assassinate Colombian President Ernesto Samper during a visit to
 Quito. The detainees, who were eventually released 6 weeks after their detention
 following President Samper's departure, told reporters that they had been tortured
 while in army custody. A police doctor who examined the detainees certified that
 all had bruises from apparently recent beatings. One had to have restorative sur-
 gery to his left eye.
 The CEDHU reports have not prompted a reply from the Government.
 The law permits police or military courts to try police officers and military defend-
 ants in closed sessions, in accordance with the respective military and police court
 martial manuals. The police court in particular does not announce verdicts or pun-
 ishments, if any, creating the strong impression that the police are immune from
 p rosecution. Cases involving flag rank officers can only be tried by the Supreme
 Court (as in the Benavides and Restrepo cases noted in Section L.a.).
 Conditions in Ecuador's detention centers generally continued to be poor. Prisons
 in the tropical coastal areas tend to be worse than those in the temperate highlands.
 Overcrowding is a chronic problem, although conditions are notably better in the
 women's prison in Quito than in other facilities. There are no separate facilities for
 hard-core or dangerous criminals, nor are there effective rehabilitation programs.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution and the Penal Code
 provide that no one may be deprived of liberty without a written order from a gov-
 ernmental authority, but the authorities often violated these legal protections
 against arbitrary arrest or detention. By law the authorities must issue specific
 written orders within 24 hours of detention-even in cases in which a suspect is
 caught in the act of committing a crime-and must charge the suspect with a s'e-
 cific criminal offense within 48 hours of arrest. All detained persons may have the
 legality of their detention reviewed within 48 hours of their arrest. This review is
 supposed to be conducted by the senior elected official (usually the mayor) of the
 locality in which the suspect is held. Regardless of the legality of a detention, a pris-
 oner may only be released by court order. In some cases, detainees who are unaware
 of this, or who do not have the funds to hire a lawyer, may remain in prison for
 an extended period before being released. Bail is not generally available. Families
 of detainees sometimes intervene in an attempt to secure the prisoners' freedom
 through illegal means.
 Human rights organizations reported occasional cases of incommunicado deten-
 tion, although the law prohibits this practice. Despite prvisions of the Penal Code,
 the police often detained suspects without the required written order. Even when
 an order was obtained, those charged with determining the validity of detention
 often allowed frivolous charges to be brought, either because they were overworked
 or because the accuser bribed them. In many instances, the system was used as a
 means of harassment in civil cases in which one party sought to have the other ar-
 rested on criminal charges. The authorities frequently detained suspects longer than
 24 hours before court orders were signed and often failed to bring charges against
 suspects within 48 hours of arrest. Preventive detention up to and including trial
 is legal under certain circumstances.
 
 
 402
 
 In the wake of hostilities with Peru in January and February, a number of Peru-
 vian nationals were arrested by the military and the police on charges of espionage
 and detained for several months beyond the end of hostilities. The weak evidence
 presented against them left the Government open to charges that they were being
 detained arbitrarily. By July all had been released.
 In December 1993, the army arrested 11 alleged supporters of the Revolutionary
 Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in a sweep along the Putumayo River following
 an ambush in which 11 soldiers and police officers died. In August 1994, four of
 those arrested were released for lack of evidence, and a fifth was released in July.
 The remaining six are still in jail despite claims by local human rights groups that
 they are innocent and were detained arbitrarily.
 The government does not use exile as a method of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The regular court system tries most nonmilitary
 defendants, although some indigenous groups try members independently for viola-
 tions of tribal rules. Despite efforts begun in 1992 to depoliticize and modernize the
 court system, the judiciary continues to operate slowly and inconsistently. Judges
 reportedly rendered decisions more quickly or more slowly depending on political
 pressure or the payment of bribes. However, the norm is for lengthy periods before
 cases come to the courts.
 The law provides for internationally accepted due process rights for criminal de-
 fendants, but the authorities often did not observe these rights in practice. By law,
 the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty, and defendants have the right
 to a public trial, defense attorneys, and appeal. They may present evidence but have
 the right not to testify against themselves, and they may confront and cross-exam-
 ine witnesses. Although a public defender system exists, in practice there are rel-
 atively few attorneys available to defend the large number of indigent suspects.
 A reform to the Constitution which was passed by the legislature in early 1995
 and signed into law after the end of the year establishes that no testimony taken
 from a prisoner can be used as evidence in court unless the individual's lawyer was
 present at the taking of testimony. This is expected to cut down on the large num-
 ber of confessions extracted from prisoners often by unlawful means.
 Trial is supposed to begin within 15 to 60 days of the initial arrest, but in prac-
 tice, initiation of the trial phase can take years. A mid-year census of the peniten-
 tiary system found that only 37 percent of the 10,312 prisoners had been convicted
 of a crime. Indigenous people and other minorities are disproportionately affected
 by these delays as they are more likely to be poor and unable to buy their way out
 opretrial detention. However, there was no evidence of a systematic effort to dis-
 criminate against women or minorities.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibi-
 tions, and violations are the subject of effective legal sanctions.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech,
 and the authorities generally respected this provision in practice, but with some no-
 table exceptions. In October an independent congressman, Fernando Larrea, gave
 an interview on a provincial radio station in which he ridiculed the president of the
 Supreme Court and the commander of the army. He spoke derisively of the role the
 army commander had played in the recent border hostilities with Peru. While not
 releasing the tape or transcript of Larrea's intemperate remarks, the military pro-
 ceeded to charge Larrea with treason under the National Emergency Decree then
 in force and initiated proceedings against him in a military court. The Supreme
 Court has yet to determine if the military court has jurisdiction in this case.
 All of the major media organs-television, newspapers, and radio-are in local
 private hands except for two government-owned radio stations. Foreign investment
 in broadcast media is limited by law. However, using a law (promulgated by the last
 military regime) that requires the media to give the Government free space or air
 time, the Government can and does require television and radio to broadcast govern-
 ment-produced programs featuring the President and other top administration offi-
 cials. The Government used this authority broadly during the armed border con-
 frontation with Peru during January-February. The media and opposition political
 figures often criticized the Government for using the media for its own political
 ends.
 The media represent a wide range of political views and often criticize the Gov-
 ernment. However, some degree of self-censorship in the print media occurs, par-
 ticularly with respect to politically sensitive issues or stories about the military and
 its related industries. The media also willingly censored issues considered to be in
 
 
 the realm of national security when the Government so requested. During the bor-
 der conflict at the beginning of the year, press support for President Duran Ballen's
 positions was uncharacteristically unanimous. An opposition politician made unsub-
 stantiated charges that the Government paid large sums of money to journalists to
 re t favorably on its handling of the war and ensuing peace negotiations.
 The Government does not interfere in issues involving academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the rights of free assembly and association for peaceful purposes, and the Govern-
 ment generally respected these rights in practice. Public rallies require prior govern-
 ment permits, which are generally granted, although exceptions occur. Numerous
 political demonstrations took place in the capital and the outlying regions, including
 a major national protest by labor and peasant gups and large scale student dem-
 onstrations in Quito. In general the security forces intervened in demonstrations
 only when there was violence against bystanders or property. Although the authori-
 ties usually showed restraint in the use of force, two students were killed by police
 during separate demonstrations, and police shot three peasants blocking a road dur-
 ing a national peasant protest, seriously injuring them.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. Numerous foreign religious orders and
 missionary groups are active.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights  and the Government re-
 spects them in practice. The Government cooperates with the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refu-
 gees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage. Since' the return to civilian rule
 in 1979, citizens have actively exercised their right to change their national and
 local governments. Free and fair elections resulted in the peaceful transfer of power
 to parties of opposing views in presidential elections every 4 years. There are 14
 legally registered political parties spanning the ideological spectrum, 12 of which
 are represented in Congress. The 1992 national elections resulted in the peaceful
 transfer of power from a center-left government to a center-right government, and
 a corresponding realignment of power within the legislature.
 Voting is mandatory for literate citizens over 18 year of age and voluntary for
 illiterate citizens. By law, active duty members of the military are not allowed to
 vote. The Constitution bars members of the clergy and active duty military person-
 nel from election to Congrss, the Presidency, or Vice Presidency.
 Traditional elites tend to be self-perpetuating. Consequently, very few women,
 Afro-Ecuadorians, and indigenous people are found in high positions in government,
 although no specific laws or policies prevent women or minorities from attaining
 leadership positions. Grassroots community groups, particularly among the indige-
 nous population, were increasingly successful in pressuring the central Government
 to assist them.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups, both domestic and international, operate with-
 out restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases.
 Domestic human rights groups, such as CEDHU and the Regional Latin American
 Human Rights Association (ALDHU), were outspoken in their criticism of the Gov-
 ernment's record on specific cases. Nevertheless, the Government contracted with
 ALDHU to provide human rights training to the military and the police.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, religion, sex, or social
 status. However, women, Afro-Ecuadorians, and indigenous people face significant
 discrimination.
 Women.-Although the law prohibits violence against women, including within
 marriage, it is a widespread practice. Many rapes go unreported because of the vic-
 tim;' reluctance to confront the perpetrators. omen may only file complaints
 against a rapist, or an abusive spouse or companion if they produce a witness. While
 some communities have established their own centers for counseling and legal sup-
 port of abused women, the Government only began to address this question seri-
 
 
 404
 ously with the formation of the "Comisaria de Ia Mujer," or Women's Bureau, in
 1994. However, although the Comisaria can accept complaints about abuse of
 women it has no authority to act on them.
 On November 29 President Duran Ballen signed a law against violence affecting
 women and children. The legislation, which was drafted by a coalition of women's
 organizations, criminalizes spousal abuse for the first time, including physical, sex-
 ual, and psychological abuse. It also creates family courts and reforms the Penal
 Code to include legislation giving courts the power to separate an abusive spouse
 from the home. Congress approved the law in record time.
 Discrimination against women is pervasive in Ecuadorian society, particularly
 with respect to educational and economic opportunities for those in the lower eco-
 nomic strata. The increasingly active women s movement blames culture and tradi-
 tion for inhibiting achievement of full equality for women. There are fewer women
 in the professions and skilled trades than men, and pay discrimination against
 women is common.
 Children.-The Government is committed in principle to the welfare of children
 but has not taken effective steps to promote it. There is no pattern of societal abuse
 against children. Government resources to assist children have traditionally been
 limited, although it instituted a program to care for the children of the working poor
 called "Operation Child Rescue. Several private organizations are very active m
 programs to assist street children, and the U.N. Children's Fund also runs a pro-
 gram in conjunction with the Central Bank. Especially in urban areas the children
 of the poor often experience severe hardships. It is common to see children as young
 as 5 or 6 years of age selling newspapers or candy on the street to support them-
 selves or to augment the family income. There also are instances of prostitution by
 girls under 18 years of age in urban areas. In rural areas, young children often
 must leave school at an early age to help out on the family's plot of land.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no official discrimination against disabled per-
 sons in employment, education or the provision of other state services. However,
 there are no laws to guarantee disabled people access to public buildings or services,
 nor are they provided any other special government assistance.
 Indigenous People.-While at least 85 percent of all Ecuadorians claim some in-
 digenous heritage, culturally indigenous people make up about 25 to 30 percent of
 the total population. The vast majority of these people live in rural areas and most
 live in varying degrees of poverty. Land is scarce in the more heavily populated
 highland areas where high infant mortality, malnutrition, and epidemic disease are
 also common. In addition, electricity and potable water are often unavailable. The
 rural education system is seriously deficient.
 Indigenous people enjoy the same civil and political rights as other citizens and
 also have several special privileges designed to allow them to manage their own af-
 fairs within their own commumties. This is particularly true in the Amazon area
 where indigenous groups have claim to specific tracts of land. These groups also
 have begun to play an active role in decision making with respect to the use of their
 lands for oil exploration and production, by lobbying the Government and enlisting
 the help of foreign nongovernmental organizations. Many indigenous groups partici-
 pated actively with the Ministry of Education in the development of the bilingual
 education program used in rural public schools.
 During the January-February border conflict with Peru, some Shuar-Achuar in-
 digenous people were displaced, either by hostile actions or by their anticipation of
 hostile actions, to areas further north in Morona Santiago province. Estimates of the
 number of displaced Shuar-Achuar range from a few hundred to several thousand,
 depending on the source. The continued presence of landmines planted during the
 conflict has impeded the return of some of the indigenous peoples. However, others
 reportedly decided not to return to the sites of their original villages. The Shuar-
 Achuar Federation and Salesian Missionaries assist those indigenous people who
 opt to resettle.
 Indigenous leaders argue that the Government does not take their interests into
 consideration when making national policy and that the only way to get attention
 is through active protests. In one such action in May to express opposition to the
 Government's privatization program, indigenous and peasant groups blocked roads
 in the highland region of the country, isolating cities from other regions and from
 food-producing areas. In confrontations during the protest police shot and seriously
 wounded three demonstrators and arrested 13 others. Indigenous groups defended
 their political interests through the democratic political process in November by or-
 ganizing to oppose a constitutional referendum which indigenous leaders claimed
 undermined the interests of the indigenous population. The reforms were over-
 whelmingly voted down in part due to the significant "no" vote in provinces where
 indigenous groups make up a large sector of the population.
 
 
 405
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The population of the rural, northern coastal
 area includes large numbers of Afro-Ecuadorian citizens. They suffer widespread
 poverty and pervasive discrimination, particularly with regard to educational and
 economic opportunity. There were no special government efforts to address these
 problems.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and Labor Code provide most
 workers with the right to form trade unions. Members of the police and the military,
 and public sector employees in nonrevenue producing entities are not free to form
 trade unions. The 1991 Labor Code reforms raised the number of workers required
 for an establishment to be unionized from 15 to 30, which the International Labor
 Organization's Committee on Freedom of Association considered too stringent a limi-
 tation at the plant workers' council level.
 While employees of stated-owned organizations enjoy rights similar to those of the
 private sector, the law technically prevents the majority of public sector employees
 from joining unions or exercising collective bargaining rights. Nevertheless, most
 public employees maintain membership in some labor organization, and there are
 frequent "illegal" strikes. Despite official threats, the Government rarely takes ac-
 tion against striking public workers. Although the five umbrella organizations are
 politically independent, the two largest single labor unions, the Teachers' Union and
 the Union of Social Security Workers, are allied with the Movimento Politico
 Democratico, the far-left socialist party.
 Approximately 12 percent of the work force is organized. There are four large
 labor centrals or confederations, three of which maintain international affiliation.
 None of the main labor centrals is firmly connected to any one political party, and
 there are no ties between the Government and any labor union.
 There are few restrictions on the right of workers to strike, although a 20-day
 cooling-off period is required before a strike is declared. The 1991 Labor Code revi-
 sions limit solidarity strikes or boycotts to 3 days, provided that they are approved
 by the Labor Ministry. In a legal strike, workers may take possession of the factory
 or workplace, thus ending production at the site, and receive police protection dur-
 ing the takeover. The employer must pay all salaries and benefits during a legal
 strike; the Labor Code protects strikers and their leaders from retaliation. The only
 significant striker were by public sector employees such as teachers and medical
 workers. None of the strikes resulted in violence.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain CoUectively.-Ecuador has a highly seg-
 mented labor market with a minority of workers in skilled, usually unionized, posi-
 tions in state-run enterprises or in medium to large industries. Most of the economi-
 cally active population is employed in either the agricultural sector or the urban in-
 formal sector, the vast majority of these workers are not organized. The Labor Code
 requires that all private employers with 30 or more workers belonging to a union
 must negotiate collectively when the union so requests. Although approximately 12
 percent of the workforce is organized, only 188,779 workers (roughly 3 percent of
 the workforce) were covered by collective bargaining agreements in 1995, according
 to the Ministry of Labor.
 The new Labor Law streamlined the bargaining process in state enterprises by
 requiring workers to be represented by one labor union only. It prohibits discrimina-
 tion against unions and requires that employers provide space for union activities
 upon the union's request. The law does not permit employers to dismiss a worker
 without the express permission of the Ministry of Labor, rulings which are not sub-
 ject to judicial review, If the Ministry of Labor rules that a dismissal is unjustified,
 it can require the employer to pay large indemnities or separation payments to the
 worker, although the reforms set a cap on such payments. The Labor Code provides
 for resolution of labor conflicts through an arbitration and conciliation board com-
 prising one representative of the Ministry of Labor, two from the union, and two
 representatives of management.
 The Maquila (in bond) Law passed in 1990 permits the hiring of temporary work-
 ers for the maquila industries only. While there is no express prohibition on associa-
 tion rights in the Maquila Law, in practice it is difficult to organize temporary em-
 ployees on short-term contracts. Since temporary workers are not recognized by the
 abor Law they do not enjoy the same level of protection offered to other workers.
 The maquila system allows a company and its property to become an export process-
 ing zone wherever it is located. Many such "zones" have thus been established; most
 are dedicated to textles and fish processing  .
 c. Prohibition of Forced or  o                      nstitution and the Labor
 Code prohibit ompulsory labor and the   er ee no reports of it.
 
 
 406
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Constitution establishes that
 children must attend school until the equivalent of 14 years of age. However, be-
 cause of the lack of schools in many rural communities and the need for children
 to work, this provision is rarely enforced. The law prohibits persons less than 14
 years old from working, except in special circumstances such as apprenticeships. It
 requires those between the ages of 14 and 18 years to have the permission of their
 parent or guardian to work. The law prohibits children between the ages of 15 and
 18 years from working more than 7 hours per day or 35 hours per week, and it re-
 stricts children below the age of 15 years to a maximum of 6 hours per day and
 30 hours per week. In practice, the Ministry of Labor fails to enforce child labor
 laws. In rural areas many children attend school only sporadically after about 10
 years of age in order to contribute to household income as farm laborers. In the city
 many children under 14 years of age work in family-owned "businesses" in the infor-
 mal sector, shining shoes, collecting and recling garbage, or as street peddlers.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Ministry of Labor has the principal role
 in enforcing labor laws and carries this out through a corps of labor inspectors who
 are active in all 21 provinces. The Labor Code provides for a 40-hour workweek, a
 15-day annual vacation, a minimum wage, and other employer-provided benefits,
 such as uniforms and training opportunities.
 The Ministry of Labor sets the minimum wage every 6 months in consultation
 with the Commission on Salaries, but Congress may also adjust it. The statutory
 minimum wage is not adequate to provide a decent standard of living for a worker
 and family. As of September, the minimum wage plus mandated bonuses provided
 a gross monthly compensation of approximately $143 (S/375,583). Most organized
 workers in state industries and formal sector private enterprises earned substan-
 tially more than the minimum wage and also received significant other benefits
 through collective bargaining agreements. The majority of workers, however, work
 in the large informal and rural sector without recourse to the minimum wage or le-
 glly mandated benefits.
 The Labor Code also provides for general protection of workers' health and safety
 on the job. A worker may not leave the workplace of his own volition, even if there
 is a hazardous situation. The worker is allowed to request that an inspector from
 the Ministry of Labor come to the work place and confirm the hazard; that inspector
 may then close down the workplce. The Governmentenforces health and safety
 standards and regulations through the Social Security Institute. In the formal sec-
 tor, occupational health and safety is not a major problem However, there are no
 specific regulations governing health and safety standards in the agricultural sector
 and, in practice, there is no enforcement of safety rules in the small mines which
 make up the vast majority of the mining sector.
