 MALAYSIA
 Malaysia is a federation of 13 states with a parliamentary  aem of government
 based on periodic multiparty elections. The ruling National Front has held power
 since 1957. However, there is political competition within the United Malays Na-
 tional Organization (UMNO), the major partner in the coalition; opposition parties
 actively contest elections and currently control two state governments.
 The Government justifies internal security laws allowing preventive detention
 (and arrests under such laws) by citing a long-defunct Communist insurgency as
 well as longstanding racial tensions and endemic narcotics tra icking problems. The
 Government applies these laws very broadly, however, admitting that it uses them
 to detain persons when available evidence is insufficient to bring formal charges
 under the Criminal Code. The Government has also used these laws to detain and
 inhibit political opponents. The Royal Malaysian Police is the lead agency for inter-
 nal security matters and reports ultimately to the Minister of Home Affairs. Prime
 Minister Mahathir also holds the Home Affairs portfolio. Credible reports of mis-
 treatment of prisoners and detainees by the police and prison officials continued in
 1992.
 A free market economy, abundant natural resources, and a relatively small popu-
 lation have helped Malaysia become one of the developing world's most prosperous
 countries. Strong economic performance since 1988 has resulted in reduced poverty
 a rising standard of living, and more equal income distribution, leading to reduced
 tensions between the races.
 Malaysia's human rights record continued to be mixed in 1992. Although in the
 main there is an effective system of justice based on common law principles, in some
 cases the Government arbitrarily arrests and detains its citizens without trial, lim-
 its judicial independence, and restricts freedom of association and of the press.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings by the Government or by any other political organization.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearance attributable to the
 Government or to the opposition.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 In the recent past, there have been allegations of cruel, inhuman or degrading
 treatment or punishment. Some credible allegations of abuses by police officers in-
 terrogating criminal suspects were made during 1992. These abucs did not have
 government sanction and do not apear to represent a pattern of government-ap-
 proved mistreatment of prisoners. None of the alleged perpetrators, however, has
 
 
 609
 been punished. In addition, an East Malaysian tribal rights advocate who was de-
 tained under the Emergency (Security Cases) Ordinance during 1992 claims he was
 threatened with torture during a proonged interrogation.
 Malaysian criminal law prescribes whippi.  as an additional punishment to im-
 prisonment for those convicted of crimes SUh as narcotics possession. Judges rou-
 tinely include whipping in sentencing those convicted of such crimes as kidnaping,
 rape and robbery. The whipping, which is normally carried out with a  -inch thick
 wooden cane, commonly causes welts and scarring
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Threeaws parmit the Government to de-
 tain suspects without judicial review or filing formal charges: the 1960 Internal Se-
 curity Act (ISA), the Emergency (Essential Powers) Ordinance of 1969, and the Dan-
 gerous Drugs Act of 1985. The Government continued to use long-term detentions
 without trial in cases alleged to involve national security, as well as in narcotics
 trafficking and other cases.
 According to the Government, the goal of the ISA is to control internal subversion.
 Passed more than 30 years ag when there was an active Communist insurgency,
 this act empowers the police to hold any person who may act "in a manner preju-
 dicial to the security of Malaysia" for up to 60 days. Security authorities sometimes
 wait several days after a detention before informing the detainee's family. The Min-
 ister of Home Affairs may authorize, in writing, further detention for periods up to
 2 years. Even when there are no formal charges, the authorities must inform detain-
 ees of the accusations against them and permit them to appeal to an advisory board
 for review every 6 months. Advisory board decisions and recommendations, however,
 are not binding on the Home Minister, are not made public, and are often not shown
 to the detainee. A number of ISA detainees have refused to participate in the review
 process under these circumstances.
 The Emergency (Essential Powers) Ordinance was instituted after intercommunal
 riots in 1969. Although Parliament regained its legislative power in 1971, the state
 of emergency declared at the time of the riots has never been lifted. According to
 figures released by the Home Ministry, 114 persons were in detention under the
 Emergency Ordinance at the end of April 1992 compared with a total of 189 persons
 in detention under this ordinance in 1991.
 Drug suspects are now detained under provisions of the 1985 amendments to the
 Dangerous Drugs Act, which give the Government specific power to detain suspected
 drug traffickers. Many of these detainees are suspected members of organized crime
 gangs or secret societies. Suspects may be held without charge for successive 2-year
 intervals, with periodic review by an advisory board, whose opinion is binding on
 the Home Minister. However the review process contains none of the due process
 rights that a defendant would have in a court proceeding. At the end of September,
 approximately 533 drug suspects detained since January 1 under this statute re-
 mained under detention or under restrictions equivalent to house arrest.
 Suspected narcotics traffickers and firearms offenders are frequently rearrested
 under the preventive measures clauses of the Dangerous Drugs Act or the ISA after
 an acquittal in court on formal charges under separate provisions of those acts.
 The Government generally does not publish statistics or make available authori-
 tative information on the number of ISA detainees. In response to a question from
 an opposition parliamentarian, however, the Home Ministry reported in December
 that there were 128 detainees at the end of November 1992. The Ministry said 77
 persons were detained for Communist activities, 6 for involvement in a secession
 plot in Sabah, 5 for espionage, and 40 for forgery. In an April response to a similar
 inquiry, the Ministry said 40 detainees had been released in 1990, 54 in 1991, and
 17 from January to the end of April 1992. Most of these ISA detainees were released
 subject to conditions limiting their rights to freedom of speech, association, and trav-
 el outside the country. The December figure represents a decrease from the 149 de-
 tainees the Ministry acknowledged in its April res nse.
 A 1989 peace agreement allows members of te Communist Party of Malaysia
 (CPM) to return to Malaysia. According to the Government, the agreement stipu-
 lates that they satisfy certain conditions, including taking a loyalty oath "to King
 and country" and renouncing the CPM in writing. Since 1989, approximately 608
 former CPM members have applied for return to Malaysia under the agreement.
 Sixty-six subsequently withdrew their applications because they objected to the con-
 ditions on their repatriation imposed by the Government. An unknown number of
 those applying to return repatriated and turned themselves over to Malaysian secu-
 rity authorities for "rehabilitation." A credible report indicates that this "rehabilita-
 tion" consists of detention without trial under the ISA at the Kamunting Detention
 Center in Perak State. In addition, "rehabilitated" former CPM members who have
 reintegrated into Malaysian society are watched carefully by security authorities for
 up to 6 years. Government officials said publicly during 1992 that these "rehabili-
 
 
 610
 tated" persons cannot resume full participation in Malaysia's political life until this
 period of surveillance demonstrates that they have abandoned their former ideology.
 rin  1991 the Government detained three Malaysians from the East Malaysian
 State of Sabah under the ISA, including the brother of the Chief Minister. It re-
 leased one in March 1991 upon expiration of the initial order, and a second person
 remains in detention after a 2-year order was signed in March 1991. The Chief Min-
 ister's brother, Jeffrey Pairin Kitingan, was detained in May 1991 for alleged in-
 volvement in a secessionist plot, and remained in detention during 1992. A credible
 report, which the Government has not confirmed, said that an ISA review board rec-
 ommended his release in mid-1992. The Government did not act on this rec-
 ommendation.
 Amendments to the ISA severely limit judicial review of detentions, contravening
 recognized standards of due process. During 1992 opposition leaders and human
 rights organizations called on the Government to repeal the ISA and other legisla-
 tion which deprives individuals of the right to defend themselves in a court proceed-
 ing. A senior government official responded that the ISA continues to be necessary
 to preserve peace and harmony in a multiracial society.
 e. Denial   Fair Public Tria.-Ordinary civil and criminal cases are tried under
 a fair and open judicial system derived from the British model. The accused must
 be brought before a judge within 24 hours of arrest, and charges must be levied
 within 14 days. Defendants have the right to counsel, bail is available, and strict
 rules of evidence apply in court. Defendants may appeal court decisions to higher
 courts and, in criminal cases, may also appeal for clemency to the King or local state
 rulers as appropriate. Criminal trials are heard by a single judge without a jury,
 except in murder trials where juries are the norm. The defense in beth ordinary
 criminal cases and the special security cases described above is not entitled to a
 statement of evidence before the trial.
 The right to a fair trial is restricted in criminal cases where the Attorney General
 invokes the Essential (Security Cases) Regulations of 1975. These regulations gov-
 erning trial procedure normaly aply only in firearms cases. In cases tried under
 these regulations, the standards or accepting self-incriminating statements by de-
 fendants as evidence are less stringent than in normal criminal cases. Also, the au-
 thorities may hold the accused for unspecified periods of time before making formal
 charges. The Attorney General also has the authority to invoke these regulations
 in other criminal cases if the Government determines the crime to involve national
 security considerations, but such cases are rare.
 The public and the legal community have long regarded the Malaysian judiciary
 as committed to the rule of law. The judicial system traditionally exhibited a hi
 degree of independence, seldom hesitating to rule against the Government in crimi-
 nal, civil, or occasionally even politically sensitive cases. For example, the High
 Court ruled in February 1988 that the dominant party in the government coalition
 was illegally constituted. However, the Government s dismissal of the Supreme
 Court Lord President and two other justices in 1988, along with a constitutional
 amendment and legislation restricting judicial review, resulted in less judicial inde-
 pendence and stronger executive influence over the judiciary. These developments
 created the possibility that Malaysians who might otherwise seek legal remedies
 against government actions would be reluctant to do so. The 1988 changes have also
 resulted in less willingness by the courts to challenge the Governments legal inter-
 pretations in politically sensitive cases.
 The Government, following criticism of some of its policies by the Malaysian Bar
 Council, announced in late 1991 and early 1992 that it was studying proposals to
 give it greater controi over the council. The strong tone of Government statements
 raised concerns among local and international observers that the Bar Council's free-
 dom of expression and independence were being threatened. After a controversial
 attempt by some Bar Council leaders and members of the Malaysian Bar to bridge
 differences with the Government failed in February, the Prime Minister declared
 that the Government would take no further steps to amend the Legal Professions
 Act or to assert greater control over the country's legal profession. Government criti-
 cism of the Bar Council ebbed thereafter.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-These
 rights are normally respected and protected by law. Provisions in the security legis-
 lation (See Section 1.d.) however, allow the police to enter and search without a
 warrant the homes of persons suspected of threatening national security. Police may
 also confiscate evidence under these acts. In a limited number of cases each year,
 police have used this legal authority to search homes and offices, seize books and
 raoers, monitor conversations, and take People into custody without a warrant.
 
 
 611
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Presa,-Although the Constitution provides for freedom
 of speech and press, some important limitations exist. For example the Constitution
 provides that freedom of speech may be restricted by legislation "in the interest of
 security * * * (or) public order. Thus, the Sedition Act Amendments of 1970 pro-
 hibit public comment on issues defined as sensitive, such as citizenship rights for
 non-Malays and the special position of Malay. in society. The Government has not
 brought charges under the Sedition Act since 1986, when a trial court acquitted a
 ormer president of the Bar Council.
 Press freedom is subject to important limitations under the Printing Presses and
 Publications Act of 1984, under which domestic and foreign publications must apply
 annually to the Government for a permit. The act was amended in 1987 to make
 the publication of *malicious news" a punishable offense, expand the Government's
 power to ban or restrict publications, and prohibit court challenges to suspension
 or revocation of publication permits.
 In practice, press freedom is restricted by the fact that the Government or compa-
 nies controlled by the leading political parties in the ruin  coalition own all the
 major newspapers and all radio and television stations. The government-linked
 mass media provide generally laudatory, noncritical coverage of government officials
 and government policies, and give only limited and selective coverage to opposition
 political views. Editorial opinion in governmnent-linked mass media frequently re-
 flects government positions on domestic and international issues.
 Because they can be read only by a minority of Malaysians (chiefly ethnic Chi-
 nese), Chinese-.language newspapers are penerafl mre free in reporting and com-
 mentng on sensitive political and social issues. During 1992, however, government
 offcia publicly criticized the Chinese-language press for publicizing a controversial
 incident with racial overtones in which the Government razed a portion of a Chinese
 temple wall in Johor State. Senior government officials warned all Malaysian news
 media to avoid crying news reports that might bring about racial tension, and de-
 cared that the Government would not hesitate to suspend or close any publication
 deemed to be fanning racial resentments. Descnibing such news reports as abuse of
 press freedom, the officials justified the threat to close publications or suspend li-
 censes by arguing that unity and stability are important national interests which
 outweigi press freedom.
 Despite Government control of major publications, small-circulation publications
 of opposition parties, social action groups, unions, and other private groups actively
 cover opposition parties and frequently print views critical of government policies.
 The Government exerts significant influence over these publications by requiring
 annual renewal of publishing permits. During 1992 the Government acted to revoke
 the publication permits of at least two newspapers. In one case, credible allegations
 suggest that the newspaper's permit was revoked for printing articles critical of the
 Prime Minister and government policies. In the other case, a tabloid weekly's permit
 was revoked evidently for publishing embarrassing gossip about members of several
 of Malaysia's royal families. In addition, a newspaper editor in the East Malaysian
 State of Sabah was charged with printing "malicious news," about an alleged ISA
 detention of a Roman Catholic clergyman. The editor is challenging the charges on
 constitutional grounds.
 In 1991 the Government warned two newspapers published by opposition parties
 that the terms of their licenses limited distribution to party members only. A legal
 challenge to quash enforcement of the license limitation failed, resulting in limited
 circulation of these publications during 1992.
 In June 1990, Parliament enacted legislation making the Malaysian News Agency
 (Bernama) the sole distributor of foreign news in Malaysia, formalizing previous
 practice. The parliamentary opposition opposed the bill, arguing that it would in-
 crease government control over foreign news. Although the Government has not to
 date used this law to restrict foreign news coverage or availability, under separate
 legislation, the Government banned two editions o a prominent international week-
 ly newsmagazine evidently for publishing feature stones considered critical of Islam
 by Malaysian censors.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the rights of freedom of peaceful assembly and association, but there are significant
 restrictions. These rights can be limited in the interest of security and public order,
 and the 1967 Police Act requires police permits for all public assemblies with the
 exception of workers on picket lines. In February an opposition member of Par-
 liament, a state assemblyman, and a university lecturer were among 20 persons ar-
 rested in Kuala LImpur for 'staging an illegal assembly." All were subsequently re-
 leased.
 
 
 612
 In the aftermath of the intercommunal riots in 1969, the Government banned po-
 litical rallies. While the formal ban has not been rescinded, both government and
 opposition parties have held large indoor political gatheri  dub    "discussion
 sessions." Government and oppsion candidates campaign a ively. There are, how-
 ever, some restrictions on freedom of assembly during cam pa ign. During the actual
 campaign period, political parties submit lists of times and paes for their 'discus-
 sion groups;" no police permit is required. Outside of the campaign period, a permit
 is required, with most applications routinely approved. In past campaigns, however,
 some opposition discussion group meetings have been canceled for lack of a police
 permit.
 Other statutes limit the right of association, such as the Societies Act of 1966,
 under which any association of seven or more members must register with the Gov-
 ernment as a society. The Government may refuse to register a new society, and
 has the power to revoke the registration of an existing society although this power
 is rarely employed. The threat of possible deregistration under the Societies Act,
 however, may inhibit political activism by public or special interest organizations.
 In January a group seeking to form a local chapter of a prominent international
 human rights organization appealed a government rejection of their application
 under the Societies Act. The Government has not responded to their appeal. An-
 other law affecting freedom of association is the Universities and University Col-
 leges Act; it mandates government approval for student associations and prohibits
 student associations, as well as faculty members, from engaging in political activity.
 Campus demonstrations must be approved by a university vice-chancellor. Although
 spontaneous demonstrations have occurred periodically in the past without permis-
 sion, there were no reports of any unapproved demonstrations in 1992.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the official religion. Ethnic Malaya are leg~ally
 bound in some civil matters, such as family relations and diet, by Islamic religious
 laws administered by state authorities through Islamic courts. An Islamic religious
 establishment is supported with government funds, and it is official policy to 'infuse
 Islamic values" into the administration of Malaysia. At the same time, the Constitu-
 tion provides for freedom of religion, and the Government has refused to accede to
 pressures for the imposition of Islamic religious law beyond the Muslim community.
 Religious minorities, which include large Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, and Christian com-
 munities, are permitted to worship freely.
 The Government opposes what it considers extremist or deviant interpretations
 of Islam; in October 1991, it imposed restrictions on the proselytizing activities of
 the Islamic sect Darnl Arqam. These included enforcement of a prohibition on using
 government facilities for religious activities.
 There are persistent allegations that some state governments are slow in approv-
 ing building permits for non-Muslim places of worship. The Government has limited
 the circulation of a popular Malay-languag translation of the Bible, and some
 states restrict the use of Christian terms in the Malay language.
 Conversion to religions other than Islam is permitted but not encouraged. Pros-
 elytizing of Muslims has long been proscribed by law in some states and strongly
 discouraged in other parts of the country. In a March 1990 decision the Supreme
 Court upheld the primacy of the Constitution over inconsistent state laws by ruling
 that parents have the right to determine the religion of their minor children under
 the age of 18. The decision eased fears of the non-Muslim community over state
 laws which in religious conversion cases set the age of majority at puberty based
 on Islamic law.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Malaysians generally have the right to travel within the country and
 live and work where they please, but the Government restricts these rights in some
 circumstances. The states of Sabah and Sarawak have the independent right to con-
 trol immigration into their territories; Malaysians from peninsular West Malaysia
 and foreigners are required to present passports for entry. This power to regulate
 internal movement has sometimes been exercised arbitrarily for political purposes,
 but there were no reported cases in 1992.
 The Government does not restrict emigration. Although in some cases the Govern-
 ment has refused to issue passprts on security grounds, Malaysians generally are
 free to travel abroad, except to Israel. Former restrictions on travel to South Africa
 and to several Communist countries, including China, were eliminated in 1990 and
 1991. In 1992 the Government began confiscating the passports of returning Malay-
 sians who had overstayed their visitors' visas when abroad, on the grounds that vio-
 lating the immigration laws of foreign countries is an embarrassment to Malaysia.
 Thousands of illegal workers from Indonesia arrive in Malaysia each year to fill
 low-skill jobs in the plantation and construction sectors of the economy. Although
 some ultimately are able to regularize their immigration status, others depart vol-
 
 
 613
 untarily after a few months, while some are formally deported as illegal migrants.
 During 1992 the Government began a registration program designed to regularize
 the immigration status of illegal workers from Indonesia and elsewhere. On July 1
 after the registration program ended, however, the Government launched combined
 police and military operations to enforce immigration and  poassprt laws. At least
 1,000 persons deemed to be illegal foreign workers were detained during these oper-
 ations.
 In 1991 and 1992, separate groups of asylum seekers from the Indonesian prov-
 ince of Aceh (totaling approximately 300) arrived in Northwestern Malasia, alleg-
 edly fleeing violence stemming from a separatist rebellion in Indonesia. These asy-
 lum seekers requested refugee status. Despite expressions of concern by local and
 international human rights organizations and foreign governments, the Government
 denied their requests, ru"ing that the asylum seekers were 'illegal immigrants sub-
 jet to deportation. Acording to government sources, apprximately 10 Acehnese
 asylum seekers had re   d home as of late March 1992. Others remain in official
 custody, but the Government has taken no steps to deport them or repatriate them
 against their will Government officials continued to stress during 1992 that Malay-
 sia would not force Acehnes asylum seekers to return against their will, but would
 encourage them to repatriate voluntarily. In June a group of 43 asylum seekers
 claiming to be Acehnese took refuge in the compound outside the United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees' (UNHR) offices in Kuala Lumpur, demanding
 refugee status. Although regaig this group as illegal immigrants, the Govern-
 ment declared its readiness to assist in their repatriation to Indonesia if they wish
 to return and said the Indonesian Government had provided assurances that the
 group would face no government oppression if they chose to return home.
 Having provided first asylum to more than 250,000 Vietnamese refugees since
 1975, the Government began to deny first asylum to virtually all arriving Vietnam-
 ese in May 1989 in contravention of its commitments under the Comprehensive
 Plan of Action (CPA) on Indochinese Refup es signed in 1989. Since May 1989
 10,473 have been denied first asylum. No Vietnamese were granted first asylum in
 1992.
 Credible reports indicate that Malaysian authorities put back to sea about 110 Vi-
 etnamese asylum seekers from 4 vessels during 1991, and redirected 1 vessel bear-
 ing 12 Vietnamese asylum seekers in May 1992. There were no reports of new land-
 ings after late May 1992. Mala~rsian authorities allow Vietnamese boats to land, and
 normally hold asylum seekers n temporary camps closed to observers. The Govern-
 ment provides life jackets, bats, and essential sup pies to asylum seekers put back
 to sea. Government authorities have not rponded positively to concerns that this
 "redirection" of boat people places them in additional danger. There have been some
 credible reports in the past of abuses in the temporary camps, as well as instances
 in which Malaysian authorities provided inadequate boats to asylum seekers put
 back to sea. Interviews with asylum seekers indicate that the Government takes
 positive steps to safeguard the fves and welfare of those denied first asylum and
 disciplines personnel involved in abusive behavior.
 In accordance with the CPA, Malaysia continued to screen Vietnamese boat people
 in its first-asylum camps. Malaysian military offiers do the sreening, with legal
 consultants from the UNC   present during each interview.
 The Malaysian screeners and UNHCR consultants make every effort to develop
 the asylum seekers' claims to refugee status. The Government discusses all disputed
 cases with the UNHCR before announcing a decision. An administrative appeal is
 available to denied cases. United Nations refugee officials have praised the Govern-
 ment's treatment of Vietnamese asylum seekers in Malaysia under provisions of the
 CPA.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change their Govern-
 ment
 By law Malaysians have the right to change theirgvernment through periodic
 elections. Malaysian elections are procedurally froe an  air,.with votes cast secretly
 and recorded accurately. However, electoral irregularities dtract from the overall
 fairness of the electoralproces. Legal restrictions on campaing and government
 control of the media have contributed to UMNO's continuing political dominance.
 Malaysia has a Westminster-style parliamentary system of government. National
 elections, required at least every 5 years, have been held regulary since indepnd-
 ence in 1957. Through the United Malaye National Organization (UMNO), Malay
 dominate the ruling  ational Front coalition of ethnic-based parties which has con-
 trolled Parliament since independence. Within UMNO there is active political de-
 bate. The government coalition currently controls 11 of 13 states.
 
 
 Non-Malays fill a number of cabinet posts, and atp resent ethnic Chinese leaders
 of a member party of the government coalition holdexecutive power in the State
 of Penang. In Sabah the party in power is controlled by Sabah's predominant indige-
 nous ethnic group and headed by a Christian. In theory indigenous groups and indi-
 viduals are accorded the same constitutional protection of their civil and political
 rights, along with the same limitations. In practice federal laws pertaining to indig-
 enous people vest almost total power in the Minister of Rural Development to pro-
 tect, control, and otherwise decide issues concerning indigenous peoples.
 Women and minorities face no de jure limits on participation in government and
 politics. Women are well represented in senior leadership positions in the Govern-
 ment and political parties. Ethnic minorities are also well represented in cabinet-
 level positions in government, as well as senior civil service positions. Nevertheless,
 the political dominance of the Malay majority means in practice that the most pow-
 erful senior leadership positions in government will be held by ethnic Malays.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 After a 2-year struggle for registration, The National Human Rights Association,
 a local human rights society of prominent Malaysians, began operating in 1991. A
 number of other organizations, including the Bar Council and public interest groups,
 devote attention to human rights activities. The Government tolerates their activi-
 ties but rarely responds to their inquiries or occasional press statements.
 The Government has not acceded to any of the major international covenants on
 human rights, generally maintaining that such issues are internal matters. It re-
 jects criticism of its human rights record by international human rights organiza-
 tions and foreign governments. In public speeches and informal remarks, govern-
 ment officials stress the Government's view that social and economic rights are as
 important as civil and political rights, and that Western nations must not be al-
 lowed to impose their values on developing nations. Malaysian officials criticize local
 groups for collaborating with international human rights organizations, representa-
 tives of which have visited and traveled in Malaysia but rarely had access to govern-
 ment officials. Foreign government officials have discussed human rights with their
 Malaysian counterparts, and private groups occasionally have done so.
 During 1992 the Prime Minister and other Cabinet officials were vocal advocates
 of human rights with respect to Serbian atrocities in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the
 plight of the Rohingyas in Burma.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The Government implements extensive programs designed to boost the economic
 position of the ethnic Malay majority, which remains poorer, on average, than other
 aysians despite its political dominance. By favoring one segment ofsociety, these
 government programs and policies limit, in varying degrees, opportunities for non-
 a     in higher education, government employment, business permits and licenses,
 and ownership of newly developed agriculturallands. There are no laws or regula-
 tions restricting the economic rights of women. Government policy supports women's
 full and equal participation  government, education, and the work force. Women
 hold high-level political positions and judgeships and are well represented in the
 professions. Literacy rates for women are lower than for men, with a female literacy
 rate of 55 percent compard to a rate of 78 percent for the total adult population.
 The cultural and religious traditions of Malaysia's major ethnic groups heavily in-
 fluence the condition of women in Malaysian society. In family and religious mat-
 ters, Muslim women are subject to Islamic law. Polyyny is allowed and practiced,
 and inheritance law favors male offspring and relatives. The Islamic Family Law
 was revised in 1989 to provide better protection for the property' rights of married
 Muslim women and to make more equitable a Muslim womants right to divorce.
 Non-Muslim women are subject to civil law. Changes in the civil Marriage and Di-
 vorce Act in the early 1980's increased protection of married women's rights, espe-
 cially those married under customr rites.
 Statistics on domestic violence in Malaysia are sketchy, but both the Government
 and women's organizations age that theproblem is growing. Ther   ae no specific
 laws in force on domestic violence; cases of wife beating or child abuse normally are
 tried under provisions of the Penal Code governing assault and battery, which carry
 penalties of 3 months to 1 year in prison and fines up to $750. Parliament passed
 a Children's Protection Act in 1990. The Attorney General is preparing regations
 implementing it but these were not complete at year's end. In 1992 public attention
 and debate on child abuse and wife beating increased significantly. Malaysian news
 media featured regular reports, commentary, and graphic public service announce-
 ments on these social sroblems, and public smposga sponsored by social and pDliti-
 
 
 615
 cal organizations discussed their policy implications. Women's groups continued to
 urge the Government to enact a long-debated act on domestic violence. The proposed
 law was under review by the Attorney General's office at year's end. Women s issues
 were the subject of a number of public seminars during 1992.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-By law workers have the right to engage in trade
 union activity, and many workers in both the public and private sector are members
 of trade unions. Within certain limitations, unions may organize workplaces, bar-
 gain collectively with employers, and form federations. The Industrial Relations Act
 specifically prohibits interfering with, restraining, or coercing a worker in the exer-
 cise of the right to form trade unions or participate in lawful trade union activities.
 The Trade Unions Act, administered by the Director General of Trade Unions
 (DGTU), sets rules for organization of unions, union recogr tion at the workplace,
 the content of union constitutions, election of officers, and fnancial reporting. Hlow.
 ever, the Act's definition of a trade union restricts a union to representing workers
 in a 'particular establishment, trade, occupation, or industry or within any similar
 trades, occupations, or industries," contrary to International Labor Organization
 (ILO) gudelmes.
 TheDGTU may refuse to register a trade union. In some circumstances, he also
 has the power to withdraw registration of a trade union. When registration has been
 refused, withdrawn, or canceled, a trade union is considered an unlawful associa-
 tion.
 Dominated by American and Japanese firms, Malaysia's electronic components in-
 dustry has been the focus of unsuccessful union registration efforts since the late
 1970's. The Government has used its power to prevent the Electrical Industry Work-
 ers Union from organizing unions in the electronics industry. The Government per-
 mits "in-house" unions in the electronics industry. Six such unions have been reg-
 istered in the electronics industry; three have been recognized by the companies in-
 volved. All of the members of one of these unions were dismissed in 1990 following
 reorganization of the company's structure. The union charged the company with
 union-busting and wrongful dismissal. The case was fled in September 1990 and
 is still beinhe. Malaysia's restrictions on association in the electronics industry
 have long eon a subject of complaints in the International Labor Organization
 (11.0). At the 1992 ILO Conferene, the International Metaiworkers Federation un-
 successfully petitioned to have the conference reject the Malaysian government dele-
 gates because of the Government's refusal to permit a national electronics union.
 Unions maintain independence both from the Government and from the political
 parties. Individual union members may belong to political parties. While union offi-
 cers are forbidden to hold principal offices in political parties, individual trade union
 leaders have served and currently serve in Parliament. Malaysian trade unions are
 free to associate with international labor bodies and actively do so.
 Although strikes are legal and a number of them occurred in 1992, the right to
 strike is severely restricted in practice. Malaysian law contains a list of 'essential
 services' in which unions must give advance notice of any industrial action. The list
 includes sectors that do not normally qualify as "essential" under ILO definitions.
 The Industrial Relations Act of 1967 requires the parties to notify the Ministry of
 Human Resources that a dispute exists before any industrial action (strike or lock-
 out) may be taken. The Ministry's Industrial Relations Department may then be-
 come actively involved in conciliation efforts. If conciliation fails to achieve a settle-
 ment, the Minister has the power to refer the dispute to the Industrial Court. The
 result, in effect, is compulsory arbitration. A strike or lockout is prohibited while
 the dispute is before the Industrial Court.
 By law federations of trade unions may cover only a single trade or industry or
 similar trades or industries. Only three national labor federations are currently reg-
 istered: one for public servants, one for teachers, and one consisting of state-based
 textile and garment workers unions. The Malaysian Trades Union Congress
 (MTUC), the main labor body in the country, is registered as a society under the
 Societies Act, rather than under the Trade Unions Act. The Malaysian Labor Orga-
 nization (MLO), a rival labor center to the MTUC, is also registered as a society.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Malaysian workers have the
 legal right to organize and bargain collectively. Collective bargaining is widespread
 in those sectors where labor is organized. Designed to curb disruptive strikes,
 amendments in 1980 to Malaysia's Labor Law contain provisions which the MTUC
 believes erode the basic rights of workers, restrict union activities, and result in gov-
 ernment and employer interference in the internal administration of unions. Despite
 subsequent amendments, the MTUC believes the Labor Law is still deficient by ILO
 
 
 616
 standards. Many union leaders also believe that the creation of the Industrial Court
 further weakened their collective bargaining rights.
 Malaysian law prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers against union
 members and organizers. Cornlaints of discrimination are filed with the Ministry
 of Human Resources or the Industrial Court. If Ministry conciliation efforts fail, ad-
 judication of complaints in the Industrial Court can be slow.
 Labor standards in free trade zones (FTZ's) are identical to those in the rest of
 Malaysia. Workers at many companies located in the FTZ's are unionized, especially
 in the textile and electrical products sectors. Enterprises granted "pioneer status"
 (regardless of location) are protected from union demands for terms of employment
 exceeding those specified in the Employment Act of 1955 during the period of their
 "pioneer status" (normally 5 years). The restriction does not a pply to wages or bene-
 fits covered by the Employment Act (see Section 6.e.). The IL has asked the Gov-
 ernment to remove legal restrictions on the right to bargain in pioneer industries,
 in the public sector, and on dismissals without notice. In addition to the pioneer in-
 dustries issue, the ILO in 1992 criticized other legal restrictions on collective bar-
 gaining.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Malaysian laws allow the use of
 imprisonment with compulsory labor as a punishment or persons expressing views
 opposed to the established order or participating in strikee. The Government main-
 tains that these laws have no force, because of the constitutional prohibition on
 forced or compulsory labor. There is no indication that forced or compulsory labor
 is practiced in Malaysia or that foreign workers in Malaysia are subject to coerced
 labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Children and Young Persons
 (Employment) Act of 1966 stipulates that no child under the age of 14 may be en-
 gaged in any employment except light work in a family enterprise, in public enter-
 tainment, in work performed for the Government in a school or training institution,
 or in employment as an approved apprentice. Children may not work more than 6
 hours daily, more than 6 days weekly, or at night. Inspections by the Ministry of
 Human Resources effectively provide enforcement of this law.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Malaysia lacks a national minimum wage, al-
 though the Wage Councils Act provides for a minimum wage in those sectors and
 regions of the country where it is perceived to be most needed. Under the law, work-
 ers in an industry who believe they need the protection of a minimum wage may
 ask for the establishment of a wage council. The Act assumes that workers in indus-
 tries where unionization is widespread can bargain for wages directly with employ-
 ers and do not need the protection of a minimum wage. A pproximately 140,000
 workers in the over 7-million-member labor force are covered by minimum wages
 set by wage councils. Minimum wages set by wage councils have not been revised
 for many years and do not, in general, provide a decent standard of living for a
 worker and his family. However, prevailing wages in Malaysia, even in the sectors
 covered by wage councils, are higher than the minimum wages set by the wage
 councils and do provide a decent living.
 The Employment Act of 1955 sets working hours not to exceed 8 hours daily or
 44 hours weekly (5V2 days) including one 24-hour rest period. This act sets overtime
 rates and mandates public holidays, annual leave, sick leave, and maternity allow-
 ances. Labor standards are effectively enforced by the Labor Department of the Min-
 istry of Human Resources. Minimum standards of occupational health and safety
 are patterned after the British Factory Act, and enforced by a unit of the Ministry
 of Human Resources. All factories are supposed to be inspected at least once every
 15 months, but insufficient personnel precludes strict enforcement.
 Many contract workers, including numerous illegal immigrants from Indonesia,
 perform plantation work. Working conditions for these workers often are signifi-
 cantly below those of direct hire plantation workers, many of whom belon to the
 National Union of Plantation Workers. Additionally, many immigrant workers in
 construction and other sectors, particularly illegal ones, may not have access to Ma-
 laysia's system of labor adjudication. The Government has investigated this problem
 and has taken a number of steps to eliminate the abuse of contract labor. For exam-
 ple, it expanded its programs legalizing immigrant workers; it investigates com-
 plaints of abuses; it endeavors to inform workers of their rights, encourages workers
 to come forward with their complaints, and warns employers to end abuses. Labor
 contractors, like other employers in Malaysia, are subject to prosecution for violat-
 ing Malaysia's labor laws. Actions have been taken against labor contractors who
 violate the law and fines have been assessed. In serious cases violators can be jailed,
 but this is rare.
