 KAZAKSTAN
 Kazakstan is a constitutional republic with a strong presidency. In March, follow-
 ing a Constitutional Court decision that found the March 1994 parliamentary elec-
 tions unconstitutional, the Parliament was dissolved. Throughout most of 1995,
 Kazakstan had no legislature; the country was governed through decree by the
 President and Cabinet of Ministers. President Nursultan Nazarbayev remained the
 country's central political figure, and his term was extended by referendum until the
 year 2000. A new Constitution was adopted, also by referendum, that concentrates
 power in the presidency, permitting it to dominate legislative and judicial institu-
 tions. International observers judged the conduct of the December parliamentary
 elections to have been an improvement over the March 1994 elections. However, the
 powers of the new Parliament are more limited than those of its predecessor. The
 Constitution does not provide adequately for some rights. The problem of corruption
 also hindered progress toward democracy and a free-market economy.
 The Ministry of Internal Affairs supervises the criminal police, who are poorly
 paid and widely believed to be corrupt. The Committee for National Security (KNE,
 
 
 908
 successor to the Soviet KGB) sought to legitimize its role by focusing on efforts to
 combat terrorism, organized crime, and official corruption. Attempts to build a
 small, modern army were impeded by severe financial problems, the flight of ethnic
 Russian officers, widespread draft-dodging, and the brutal hazing of conscripts.
 There were reports of human rights abuses by members of the security forces, in-
 cluding surveillance, break-ins, and the beating of an opposition figur.
 Kazakstan is rich in natural resources, chiefly petroleum an  minerals, but its
 state-dominated economy continued to decline in 1995. Although the Government
 achieved notable success (beginning in the latter half of 1994) in stabilizing the local
 currency (tenge) and slowing inflation, structural reforms lagged. Both the agricul-
 tural sector, traditionally accounting for over a third of national employment and
 production, and large-scale industrial complexes have been slow to privatize. The
 per capita gross domestic product was abeut $900.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens. In its fourth
 year of independence, despite a number of challenges, Kazakstan has in lace im-
 portant elements of participatory democracy. Citizens enjoy basic rights of freedom
 of religion, speech and assembly. Nonetheless, the establishment of democratic insti-
 tutions suffered a number of setbacks. The legal structure, including the Constitu-
 tion adopted in August, does not fully safeguard human rights. The judiciary re-
 mains under the control of the Predident and the executive branch, and corruption
 is deeply rooted. The right of citizens to change their Government was infringed.
 Members of the security forces sometimes beat or otherwise abused detainees, and
 prison conditions were harsh and continued to deteriorate. The Government gen-
 erally respected freedom of speech and the press, although the media practiced self-
 censorship, and the Government maintained control of printing facilities and sup-
 plies. Freedom of assembly is sometimes restricted, and freedom of association and
 religion, while generally respected, were sometimes hindered by complicated reg-
 istration requirements for organizations and political parties. The authorities some-
 times infringed citizens' right to privacy. The Government practiced some positive
 discrimination in favor of ethnic Kazaks. Domestic violence against women re-
 mained a problem. There was some discrimination against women and the disabled.
 The Government tried to limit the influence of independent trade unions, both di-
 rectly and through its support for state-sponsored unions.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 kilis-r                                                    " di
 b.   ppearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution adopted in August states that "no one must be subject to torture,
 violence, or other treatment or punishment that is cruel or humiliating to human
 dignity." However, there were credible reports that police beat or treated detainees
 abusively to obtain confessions. Training standards for police are very low, and indi-
 vidual law enforcement officials are often poorly supervised. Even President
 Nazarbayev noted during a September speech to the Government anticrime task
 force that "in people's minds, the word 'police' is associated with cruelty, arbitrari-
 ness, and bribery. Human rights monitors alleged that a former parliamentary dep-
 uty (and prominent human rights activist) was badly beaten by security forces in
 April during the runup to the presidential referendum, and again in August, after
 he participated in a demonstration against the new Constitution.
 Prison conditions were harsh and continued to deteriorate, due to diminishing re-
 sources and an increase in the number of persons imprisoned. The Kazakstan-Amer-
 ican Human Rights Bureau, an independent local human rights group, estimated
 that there were 91,000 prisoners in facilities designed for 60,000. This overcrowding,
 combined with an inadequate prison diet and a lack of medical supplies and person-
 nel, contributed to the outbreak of tuberculosis, hepatitis, and other diseases. Elev-
 en thousand prisoners are believed to suffer from major illnesses. There were press
 reports about the death of several prisoners in the north of Kazakstan due to ex-
 treme summer heat. Prison guards, who are poorly paid, steal food and medicines
 intended for prisoners. Violent crime among prisoners is routine.
 Prisoners are allowed only one visit every 6 months, but additional visits may be
 granted in emergency situations. Juveniles are kept in separate facilities. The Gov-
 ernment permits monitoring of prison conditions by local media and human rights
 groups.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Government was in the process of
 reforming the legal system throughout 1995. Much of the old Soviet legal system
 
 
 909
 remained in force while new laws were being prepared to bring the legal system into
 accord with the Constitution adopted in August. The law sanctions pretrial deten-
 tion. According to the Constitution, police may hold a detainee for 72 hours before
 bringing charges. After 72 hours, police may continue to hold the detainee for 10
 days with the approval of a prosecutor. In practice, police routinely hold detainees,
 with the sanction of a prosecutor, for weeks or even months without bringing
 charges.
 There is no legal provision for bail; defendants remain in detention until trial. The
 maximum length of pretrial detention is 1 year. According to the Constitution, per-
 sons detained, arrested, or accused of committing a crime have the right to the as-
 sistance of a defense lawyer from the moment of detention, arrest, or accusation-
 a right generally respected in practice. Detainees may also appeal the legality of de-
 tention or arrest to the prosecutor before trial. If defendants cannot afford an attor-
 ney, the Constitution stipulates that the State will provide one free of charge. Al-
 though some lawyers are reluctant to defend clients unpopular with the Govern-
 ment, there were no reports of Government reprisals against attorneys.
 The Government does not employ forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public T-ial.--Government interferene and pressure com-
 promised the court system's independene throughout 1995--a situation codified in
 the new Constitutions creation ofa judiiry under the control of the President and
 the executive branch. At year's end, the judicial system was in the process of being
 restructured to bring it into line with provisions of the Constitution. In December
 the President issued a decree, with the force of constitutional law, "On Courts and
 the Status of Judges in the Republic of Kazakstan."
 There are three levels in the court system: the local level, the oblast (provincial)
 level, and the Supreme Court. According to the Constitution, the President proposes
 to the upper house of Parliament (the Senate) nominees for the Supreme Court (rec-
 ommended by the "Highest Judicial Council," a body chaired by the President,
 which includes the chairperson of the Constitutional Council, the chairperson of the
 Supreme Court, the Procurator General, the Minister of Justice, senators, judges
 and other persons appointed by the President). The President appoints oblast judges
 (nominated by the Highest Judicial Council) and local level judges from a list pre-
 sented by the Ministry of Justice, based on recommendations from the "Qualification
 Collegium of Justice," an autonomous institution made up of deputies from the
 lower house of Parliament (the Majiis), judges, public prosecutors, and others ap-
 pointed by the President. Judges are appointed for 10-year terms. The Constitution
 abolished the Constitutional Court and established a Constitutional Councl-three
 of its seven members, including the chairman, are directly appointed by the Presi-
 dent. The council rules on election and referendum challenges, interprets the Con-
 stitution, and determines the onstitutionality of laws adopted by Parliament.
 Local courts try less serious crimes, such as petty theft and vandalism. Oblast
 courts handle more serious crimes, such as murder, grand theft, and organized
 criminal activities. The oblast courts may also handle cases in rural areas where
 no local courts are organized. Judgments of the local courts may be appealed to the
 oblast-level courts, while those of the oblast courts may be appealed to the Supreme
 Court. A special Arbitration Court handles disputes between state enterprises.
 There is also a military court. According to the December decree, specialized and
 extraordinary courts can also be created-for example, economic, taxation, family,
 juvenile, and administrative courts--which have the status of oblast and local
 courts. The Constitution and existing law establish the necessary procedures for a
 fair trial. Trials are public, with the exception of instances in which an open hearing
 could result in secrets being divulged or when the private life or personal family
 .ecrets of a citizen have to be protected.
 According to the Constitution, defendants have the right to be present, the right
 to ounsel (at pubic expense if needed), and the right to be hear in ourt and call
 witnesses for the defense. Defendants enjoy a p resumption of innocene, are pro-
 tected from self-incrimination, and have the right to appeal a decision to a higher
 court. According to the December decree, legal proceedings are to be conducted in
 the state language, Kazak, although Russian can also be used officially in the
 courts. Proceedings can also be held in the language of the majority of the popu-
 lation in a particular area.
 However, the problem of corruption is evident at every stage and level of the judi-
 cial process. Judges are poorly paid; the Government has not made a vigorous effort
 to root out orruption in the judiciay. Anecdotal evidence stemming from individual
 cases suggests that judges solicit bribes from participants in trials and rule accord-
 ingly.
 There was one known political prisoner. In Petropavlosk in May, journalist Boris
 Suprynuk, a Russian citizen, was sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment for "insulting"
 
 
 910
 a public prosecutor. The alleged "insulting" and "use of bad language" occurred dur-
 ing a previous trial in which Suprynuk was sentenced to 2 years$ imprisonment for
 inciting interethnic hostility, a decision later overturned by the Supreme Court.
 Suprynauk appealed the verdict and the sentence and is imprisoned in Kokshetau.
 f.Arbitrary Interference with Privacy Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution guarantees that everyone has the right to "confidentiality of personal
 deposits and savings, correspondence, telephone conversations, postal, telegraph,
 and other messages." Limitation of this right is allowed "only in the cases and ac-
 cording to the procedure directly established by law." However, the KNB and Min-
 istry of Internal Affairs, with the concurrence of the procuracy, can and do arbitrar-
 ly interfere with privacyt, family, home, and correspondence. The law requires crimi-
 nal police, who remain part of the internal security structure, to obtain a search
 warrant from a prosecutor before conducting a search, but they sometimes search
 without a warrant. The KNB has the right to monitor telephone calls and mal, but
 under the law it must inform the procuracy within 24 hours of such activity.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution and the 1991 Press Law pro-
 vide for freedom of the press. The Government continued to own and control print-
 ing and distribution facilities and to subsidize periodicals, including many which
 were supposedly independent. The potential for government control, as well as re-
 parts of specific instances of government officials making suggestions about what a
 journalist should and should not cover, resulted in widespread media self-censor-
 d ne such instance involved Karavan, the most independent newspaper in
 Kazakstan. The Karavan Publishing Corporation owns a printing press and runs its
 own distribution network. In March, after Karavan ran critical stories about the dis-
 solution of Parliament, a Karavan-owned warehouse burned down, destroying 1 mil-
 lion dollars worth of newsprint. The official investigation of the fire blamed a drunk-
 en welder, but Karavan's independent investigation found evidence of arson. After
 the fire, Karavan gradually reduced its coverage of political topics.
 Despite occasional heavyhandedness, the press was generally permitted to criti-
 cize government decisions. For example, many newspapers ran critical analyses of
 the draft Constitution during the officially-designated "discussion period" in July.
 During the run-up to the December parliamentary elections, the press also ues-
 tioned the value of establishing a new Parliament with only limited powers. Offiial
 coruption remained an acceptable topic for critical coverage.
 Most political opposition groups freely issued their own publications. One such
 pa per, the Kazak nationalist Kazakhskaya Pravda, was shut down by the General
 Prosecutor's office in April under the charge of "inciting ethnic tension." By Septem-
 ber, according to the Minijster of Press and Mass Media, the paper was allowed to
 resume publication. Several indepndent newspapers emerged as new voices for the
 opposition, particularly Delovaya Nedelya (Business Week) and Novoye Pokoleniye
 (New Generation).
 There are many radio and television companies, both public and private, but the
 Government controls all broadcasting facilities. An association of independent brad-
 casters of Central Asia exists. However, government officials and representatives of
 the state television corporation continued to call for a state-sponsored union of inde-
 pendent television stations. In the fall, a government decision to reduce the number
 of hours of television broadcasting from Russia was criticized by human rights activ-
 ists, especially in the majority Russian-speaking regions of northern Kazakstan. The
 Government reversed its decision, and by the end ol the year, much of the television
 broadcasting from Russia had been restored.
 The law against insulting the President and other officials remained on the books,
 and the new Constitution provides for the protection of the dignity of the President.
 Russian journalist Boris Suprynuk was convicted of insulting a public prosecutor
 and sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment (see Section i.e.) in May.
 Several laws controlling advertising in the mass media were passed. One law re-
 stricts alcohol and tobacco advertising on television, as well as "pornography" and
 "violence" during prime viewing hours. Another law, whose interpretation was still
 in question, restricted the amount of advertising in newspapers to 20 percent of
 each issue. k'he Minister of Justice and the Minister of Press and Mass Media inter-
 preted this law as restricting paid articles, not commercial advertisements.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 peaeful assembl and association, but there are significant restrictions. According
 to a law issued by the President in March, organizations must apply to the local
 authorities for a permit to hold a demonstration or public meeting at least 10 days
 in advance, or the activity will be considered illegal.hn August, on the grounds that
 
 
 911
 it was an illegal assembly, Almaty authorities broke up a demonstration organized
 to oppose adoption of a new constitution by referendum. Nineteen participants were
 arrested and fined for demonstrating without a proper permit. In most cases, local
 officials routinely issued necessary permits. However, Tuman rights activists com-
 plained that omplicated proedures and the 10 day notie period have made it more
 difficult to organize public meetings. There have been complaints that local authori-
 ties have insisted on approving the slogans on banners before allowing demonstra-
 tions to take place. In addition, one human rights activist complained that local au-
 thorities agreed to issue a permit for a demonstration only if the activity was held
 in a remote location, far from the center of town.
 To participate in elections, a political party must register with the Government.
 There were no major changes regarding the registration of political parties in a new
 electoral code issued prior to the December parliamentary elections. Under current
 law, a party must submit a list of at least 3,000 members from a minimum of 11
 (out of 19) oblasts. The list must provide personal information about the members,
 including date and place of birth, address, and place of employment. For many citi-
 zens, submitting such personal data to the Government recalls KGB tactics and in-
 hibits them from joining parties. The nationalist Alash Party and the Social Demo-
 cratic Party have refused to register on the principle that they should not have to
 submit personal information about their members to the Government. Under cur-
 rent law, members of unregistered parties may run for elected office as individuals
 but not as party members.
 Organizations or movements that conduct public activities, hold public meetings,
 participate in conferences, or have bank accounts must also register with the Gov-
 ernment. Registration on the local level requires a minimum of 10 members and on
 the national level, a minimum of 10 members in each of at least 11 oblasts. In addi-
 tion, a registration fee is required, which many groups consider to be a deterrent
 to registration. Parties established on a religious basis are prohibited by the Con-
 stitution. Government decisions not to register ethnic-based parties have been based
 on the grounds that their activities could spark ethnic violence. The Constitution
 bans "public associations"--including political parties-whose "goals or actions are
 directed at a violent change of the constitutional system, violation of the integrity
 of the Republic, undermining of the security of the State (and), fanning of social,
 racial, national, religious, class and tribal enmity." Unregistered parties and move-
 ments are, nonetheless, able to hold meetings and publish newspapers. However, in
 October the Prosecutor General took steps against an unregistered ethnic Uighyr or-
 ganization for "illegal organizational and publishing activity." All of the major reli-
 gious and ethnic groups n Kazakstan have independently functioning cultural cen-
 In  October Nikolai Gunkin, the "chieftain" of the Semirechie (Southern
 Kazakstan) Cossacks, was detained by Almaty police. According to the Government,
 Gunkin had been convicted of organizing two illegal demonstrations and was sen-
 tenced in January by a local court to 6 months in prison. Gunkin reportedly fled
 to Russia after the sentence was handed down by the court. In November Gunkin
 was sentenced to an additional 3 months in a correctional labor colony for organiz-
 ing these unauthorized rallies. Human rights monitors argued that the prison sen-
 tences were excessive for the offense of organizing illegal demonstrations (described
 by some Gunkin supporters as Orthodox prayer meetings). Activists also alleged
 that Gunkin was taken into custody because he was considering registering as a
 candidate for a seat in the lower house of Parliament.
 The Constitution prohibits foreign political parties and foreign trade unions from
 operating in Kazakstan. In addition, the Constitution prohibits the financing of po-
 litical parties and trade unions by foreign legal entities and citizens, foreign states,
 or international organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. Various denominations worship without
 government interference. However, the Constitution also requires that the appoint-
 ment by foreign religious centers of the heads of religious associations must be car-
 ried out "in coordination with the Government," as must the activities of foreign re-
 ligious associations. Foreign missionaries, unwelcome to some Orthodox and Muslim
 Kazakstanis, have complained of occasional harassment by low-level government bu-
 reaucrats.
 In April the main Orthodox church in Almaty, during Soviet times a museum of
 atheism, was returned to the Russian Orthodox Church and again holds regular
 services. The Islamic mufti and the Russian Orthodox archbishop have appeared to-
 gether publicly to promote religious and ethnic harmony.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for the right to emigrate and the right of re-
 
 
 912
 patriation; both are respected in practice. Kazakstanis have the right to change
 their citizenship, but are not permitted to hold dual citizenship.
 According to the Constitution, everyone who is legally present on the territory of
 the Republic of Kazakstan has the right to move freely on its territory and freely
 choose a place of residence except in cases stipulated by law. This provision formally
 abolishes the "propiska" system of residence permits, a holdover from the Soviet era.
 However, in the absence of a law to bring legal practice into line with the Constitu-
 tion, citizens were still required to have a propiska" in order to prove legal resi-
 dence and obtain city services. Obtaining a "propiska" for most of the country was
 generally routine. However, according to human rights activists, a bribery market
 in "propiskas" to live in Almaty continued to exist, because of Almaty's greater afflu-
 ence.
 There were numerous reports of government efforts to restrict the movement of
 foreigners around the country.
 An exit visa is required for travel abroad, although refusals are exceptional. There
 have been reports of some officials demanding bribes for exit visas. The Government
 accords special treatment to ethnic Kazaks and their families who fled Kazakstan
 during Stalin's time and wish to return. Kazaks in this category are entitled to citi-
 zenship and a host of other privileges. Anyone else, including ethnic Kazaks who
 are not considered refugees from the Stalin era of political repression, such as the
 descendants of Kazaks who moved to Mongolia during the previous century, must
 apply for permission to return.
 The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and
 other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees, especially with the resettle-
 ment in Kazakstan of ethnic Kazaks from Afghanistan now living as refugees in
 Iran. There were no reports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refu-
 gee status.
 In January 1995, Kazakstan and Russia initialed agreements that established
 broad legal rights for the citizens of one country living on the territory of the other
 and provided for expeditious naturalization for citizens of one country who moved
 to the other. These agreements still require ratification by both Governments.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Although both Constitutions in force in 1995 provided for a democratic govern-
 ment, in practice the Government infringed the right of citizens to change their Gov-
 ernnent. The Government operated for most of the year without a legislature; it ex-
 tended the term of the President by referendum, without an open presidential elec-
 tion; and it promulgated a new Constitution, also by referendum, that concentrates
 power in the presidency, permitting it to dominate legislative and judicial institu-
 tions.
 In March, following a Constitutional Court decision that found the March 1994
 parliamentary elections unconstitutional, the Parliament was dissolved. Governing
 by decree in the absence of a parliament, President Nazarbayev called a referendum
 in April to extend his term of office to the year 2000 without a contested presi-
 dential election (which, according to the Constitution then in force, should have
 been held in 1996). The referendum was easily approved. Government officials and
 institutions campaigned openly for the extension of President Nazarbayev's term-
 voting instructions showed voters only how to vote "yes," and officials manipulated
 election returns to indicate massive (more than 90 percent) voter turnout and a
 massively favorable (more than 93 percent) vote.
 The President then drew up a new constitution for approval by referendum. While
 theoretically open to changes during a 80-day period of public discussion, the final
 draft did not reflect the su gestions of democracy and human rights advocates. The
 new Constitution, approved overwhelmingly in August-again with voting turnout
 and results exaggerated by the Government--concentrates power in the presidency,
 allowing the President considerable control over the legislature, the judiciary, and
 local government.
 There was no legislature after Parliament was dissolved in March until elections
 took place in December for a new, bicameral legislature, which took office in Janu-
 ary 1996. The lower house (the Majilis), consisting of 67 members, was elected di-
 rectly. The upper house (the Senate), with 47 members, was elected indirectly, by
 members of oblast and city parliaments, with 7 of its members appointed directly
 by the President. The election law required candidates for both houses to meet mini-
 mum age and education requirements, and to pay a nonrefundable fee of 30,000
 tenge, 50 times the minimum monthly wage or about $500. The new election law
 did not require Majilis candidates to collect a certain number of signatures in order
 to be placed on the ballot. Senate candidates were required to obtain signatures
 
 
 from 10 percent of the members of their local assemblies in order to be placed on
 the ballot. The Central Election Commission registered 49 candidates for the Senate
 and 285 candidates for the Majilis. Some activists considered the election require-
 ments to be a barrier to participation.
 A number of candidate registrations were canceled during the weeks prior to the
 elections, either at the request of candidates or for specific campaign violations. One
 candidate, an ethnic Russian, was removed from the ballot after her electoral plat-
 form was judged to contain planks "inciting ethnic hatred."
 Prior to the election, the Central Election Commission accepted foreign technical
 electoral assistance, welcomed international monitors, and agreed to modify the
 election law to allow nonpartisan domestic observers to serve as monitors. Observers
 noted that some technical improvements had been made since the March 1994 par-
 liamentary elections. In many districts, officials and citizens made sincere and con-
 scieatious efforts to carry out fair and transparent elections. Observers nonetheless
 pointed to flaws in the conduct of the December 9 election. Concern was expressed
 about possible inflation of official voter turnout figures; "family voting" (the practice
 of one individual casting multiple ballots on behalf of family members), which vio-
 lates the law; and isolated problems of access for observers.
 Unless the Parliament can become an active, autonomous institution in
 Kazakstani politits, the elections will have formed a national legislature that exer-
 cises only limited meaningful power. The Constitution does not empower the legisla-
 ture to control the budget, initiate changes in the Constitution, or exercise oversight
 of the executive branch. For instance, should the Parliament fail to pass within 30
 days an "urgent" bill brought by the President, the President may issue the bill by
 decree. While the President has broad powers to dissolve the Parliament, Par-
 liament can only remove the President for disability or high treason, and only with
 the consent of the Constitutional Council, which is largely controlled by the Presi-
 dent.
 The Constitution significantly constrains the independence of the judiciary. The
 Constitutional Court has been abolished and replaced by a Constitutional Council.
 Three of its seven members, including its chairman, are directly appointed by the
 President. A two-thirds majority of the Council is required to overrule a presidential
 veto of its decisions.
 The governors of oblasts (the "akims") are selected by the Prime Minister but
 serve at the discretion of the President, who may also annul their decisions. All
 male and female adult citizens have the right to vote. Membership in political par-
 ties or trade unions is forbidden to members of the military, employees of national
 security and law enforcement organizations, and judges.
 There are no legal restrictions on the participation of women in politics, but the
 persistence of traditional attitudes means that few women hold high office or play
 active parts in political life. Of 45 Senate members, 3 are women, and of 67 Majlis
 members, 9 are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Helsinki Watcb/Almaty and the Kazakstan-American Human Rights Association
 are the most active of several local human rights organizations. The two cooperate
 on human rights issues. Although thee groups operated largely without govern-
 ment interference, they were subject to restrictions on assembly, and limited finan-
 cial means hampered their ability to monitor and report human rights violations.
 Some human rights observers complained that the Government monitored their
 movements and telephone calls. During the presidential and constitutional referen-
 dums, local election monitors were often denied access to polling places. Observers
 also reported some isolated problems with access during the December parliamen-
 tary elections.
 The Government tended to deny or ignore charges of specific human rights
 abuses, such as the beating of an opposition figure during the presidential and con-
 stitutional referendum campaigns.
 The Government permitted international and foreign nongovernmental organiza-
 tions (NGO's) dealing with human rights issues to visit Kazakstan and meet with
 local human rights groups as well as government officials. However, the Constitu-
 tion forbids "the financing of political parties and trade unions by foreign legal enti-
 ties and citizens, foreign states and international organizations. Further, thou h
 a civil code introduced this year allowed the registration of NGO's, requirements for
 registration were burdensome and changed frequently. As a result, few NGO's were
 registered, leaving them without legal standing. Some government officials contin-
 ued to assert that foreign NGO's promote instability.
 
 
 914
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that "everyone is equal before law and court. No one may
 be subjected to any discrimination for reasons of origin, social position, occupation,
 property status, sex, race, nationality, language, attitude to religion, convictions,
 place of residence, or any other circumstances."However, the Government has prac-
 ticed positive discrimination in favor of ethnic Kazaks in government employment
 and according to many citizens, in the economic privatization process.
 Women.-According to human rights groups, there is considerable domestic vio-
 lence against women. Police are often reluctant to intervene in cases of spousal
 abuse, considering it to be the family's business, unless they believe the abuse is
 life threatening. The maximum sentence for wife beating is 3 years, but few such
 cases are prosecuted. The Government has not specifically addressed the problem.
 Law enforcement authorities reported 5,829 cases of rape in 1995, about 9 percent
 of all crimes reported. The punishment Ir rape can range from 4 to 15 years. There
 is very little coverage of rape in the press, and it is generally believed that rapes
 often go unreported.
 There is no legal discrimination against women, but women are severely
 underrepresented in higher positions in state enterprises and overrepresented in
 low-paying and some menial jobs. Women generally have unrestricted access to
 higher education.
 Children.-The Government is committed in principle to children's rights, but, as
 in many other areas, budget stringencies and other priorities severely limit its effec-
 tiveness in dealing with children a issues. Although the law provides for free edu-
 cation and medical care for children, the lack of government resources means that
 many do not receive adequate medical care, and educational institutes do not have
 the money needed to pay teacher salaries and obtain necessary supplies. There is
 no established pattern of governmental or societal abuse against children. Rural
 children normally work during harvests (see Section 6.d.).
 People With Disabilities.--Citizens with disablities are entitled by law to assist-
 ance ]from the State. There is no legal discrimination against people with disabil-
 ities, but in practie, employers do not give them equal onsideration. Laws man-
 date the prvision of accessibility to public buildings and ommercial establishments
 for the disabled, but these laws are not enforced. Disabled persons are a low priority
 for the Government.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Kazakstan's population of about 17 million
 consists of approximately 44 percent Kazaks and 36 percent Russians, with many
 other ethnic groups represented.
 The Government continued to discriminate in favor of ethnic Kazaks in govern-
 ment employment where ethnic Kazaks predominate, as well as in education, hous-
 ing, and other areas. However, the Government has continued to back away from
 its "Kazakification" campaign of the first year of independence. President
 Nazarbayev has publicly emphasized that all nationalities are welcome in
 Kazakstan, but many non-Kazaks are anxious about what they perceive as expand-
 ing preferences for ethnic Kazaks. Many ethnic Kazaks, however, believe affirmative
 action is needed to reverse 200 years of Russian domination.
 Most of the population speaks Russian; only about half of ethnic Kazaks speak
 Kazak fluently. The Constitution adopted in August states that the Kazak language
 is the state language of the republic. According to the Constitution, the Russian lan-
 guage is officially used on a basis equal with that of the Kazak language in organi-
 zations and bodies of local self-administration. This slight increase in the status of
 the Russian language (from its previous status as the republic's "language of
 interethnic communication') did not satisfy some ethnic Russian Kazakstanis who
 had hoped that Russian would be designated as a second state language. An article
 in the first draft of the Constitution (which was later dropped) prohibited limiting
 the rights and freedoms of citizens on account of not knowing the state or any other
 language. The Government is encouraging more education of children in the Kazak
 language, but has done little to provide Kazak-language education for adults.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and the current Labor Code (the
 Ministry of Labor is drafting a new labor code, with input from labor) provide for
 basic workers' rights, including the right to organize and the right to strike.
 Kazakstan joined the International Labor Organization (ILO) in 1993, but the pre-
 vious Parliament did not ratify any ILO conventions.
 Most workers remained members of state-sponsored trade unions established dur-
 ing the Soviet period. Membership was obligatory. At most enterprises, the state-
 sponsored unions continued to deduct 1 percent of each worker's wage as dues. In
 
 
 addition, the government pension fund withholds 30.2 percent of each worker's
 wage, and the state unions, which have the authority to allocate funds for disability
 and sick pay, housing, and the use of vacation retreats, take 7.3 percent. The state
 unions under the Communist system were, and for the most part still are, organs
 of the Government and work with management to enforce labor discipline and to
 discourage workers from forming or joining independent unions.
 The law gives workers the right to join or form unions of their own choosing and
 to stop the automatic dues deductions for the state unions. However, enterprises
 often continue to withhold dues for the state-sponsored union in spite of requests
 from individual workers to atep the deduction. The Indepndent Trade Union Center
 of Kazakstan claims membership of about 500,000 out of a total work force of about
 5,600,000; however, the actual number of Independent Trade Union members is es-
 timated to be closer to 70,000. To obtain legal status, an independent union must
 apply for registration with the local judicial authority at the oblast level and with
 the Ministry of Justice. Registration is generally lengthy, difficult, and expensive.
 The decision to register a union appears to be arbitrary, with no published criteria.
 Judicial authorities and the Ministry of Justice have the authority to cancel a
 union's registration.
 The law does not provide mechanisms to protect workers who join independent
 unions from threats or harassment by enterprise management or state-run unions.
 Members of independent unions have been dismissed, transferred to lower paying
 or lower status jobs, threatened, and intimidated. According to union leaders, state
 unions work closely withmhat independent trade umon mem-
 bers are the first fired in times of economic downturn. In one factory, management
 allegedly fostered the creation of a "state union" to challenge an independent union
 which had organized the majority of the work force.
 A tripartite ageement between labor, management, and the Government was con-
 cluded in May, b ut has had little success in resolving labor problems. Within a few
 months of signing the tripartite agreement, management representatives no longer
 attended the meetings of the tripartite commission.
 Unions and individual workers exercised their right to strike in 1995, primarily
 in s'n effort to recover back wages owed to workers. VMiners' strikes in the coal min-
 ing region of Karaganda continued throughout the year.
 M~any enterprises ontinued to pay wages mn scrip rather than in cash, a practice
 at odds with Article 3 of ILO Convention 95 on the protection of wages other than
 in the legal currency without the express consent of the workers. Enterprise direc-
 tors claimed that the enterprises were not being paid in cash by their traditional
 trading partners in other parts of the former Soviet Union, which were also experi-
 encing cash flow difficulties as a result of the general econoinc crisis. The scrip was
 often not accepted at stres or was accepted only at devalued levels.
 By law, umons may freely join federations or confederations" and affiliate with
 international bodies. Most independent trade unions in Kazakstan belong to the
 Independent Trade Union Center (ITUC) headquartered in Almaty. The Independ-
 ent Miners' Federation of Kazakstan, along with the State Miners' Union of
 Karaganda, are members of the Miners' International Federation. The unions be-
 longing to the ITUJC are not members of international federations but do maintain
 contacts with European and U.S. trade union federations. Independent unions were
 particularly concerned about a provision in the Constitution which forbids the fi-
 nancing of trade unions by foreign legal entities and citizens, foreign states, and
 international organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There are significant limits
 on the right to organize and bargasm cllectively. Most industry remained state
 owned and was subject to the Stateas production orders. Although collective bargain-
 ing rights are not spelled out in the current law, in some instances unions success-
 fully negotiated agreements with management. If a union's demands are not accept-
 able to management, it may present those demands to an arbitration commission
 comprised of management, union officials, and independent technical experts. There
 is no legal protection against antiunion discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones. Several free economic zones enjoy all the
 prviegsof export processing zones, as well as other tax privileges and aalements,
 onthlaor onditions there appear to be no different than elsewhere in Kazakstan.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor except "at the sentence of the court or in the conditions of a state of emergency
 or martiallaw. However, some persons were required to provide labor or the use
 of privately owned equipment wit no, or very low, compensation to help gather the
 annual grain harvest.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 is 16. A child under age 16 may work only with the permission of the local adminis-
 
 
 916
 tration and the trade union in the enterprise in which the child would work. Such
 permission is rarely granted. Abuse of child labor is generally not a problem, al-
 though child labor is routinely used in agricultural areas, especially during harvest
 season.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The official minimum wage was set by the
 Government at approximately $5.00 (300 tenge) per month effective in October. It
 is far from sufficient to provide a decent living for a worker and family.
 The legal maximum workweek is 48 hours, although most enterprises maintain
 a 40-hour workweek, with at least a 24-hour rest period. The Constitution states
 that labor agreements will stipulate the length of working time, vacation days, holi-
 days, and paid annual leave for each worker.
 Although the Constitution provides for the right to "safe and hygienic working
 conditions," working and safety conditions in the industrial sector are substandard.
 Safety consciousness is low. Workers in factories usually do not wear protective
 clothing, such as goggles and hard hats, and work in conditions of poor visibility
 and ventilation. Management largely igores regulations concerning occupational
 health and safety, enforceable by the Ministry of Labor and the state-sponsored
 unions. Workers, including miners, have no legal right to remove themselves from
 dangerous work situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
