 GREECE
 Greece is a constitutional republic and multipt pariamentary democracy. In
 1993 parliamentary elections, the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) won a
 comfortable majority, and its leader, Andreas Papandreu, became Prime Minister.
 The defeated New Democracy Party assumed the role of the main opposition.
 Police and security services are subject to a broad variety of legal and constitu-
 tional restraints. The Greek Parliament, a vigorous free press, the judiciary, com-
 mittees and deputies of the European Parliament, and Greek and international
 human rights organizations monitor their activities. These institutions and groups
 brought to light cases of improper activities and pressed the Government to halt
 such activities. Nevertheless, credible reports indicated that police continued to mis-
 treat suspcts during interrogation in some drug and other criminal investigations.
 Greece has a mixed capitalist economy in which the entrepreneurial system is
 overlaid by a large public sector which accounts for about 60 percent of gross domes-
 tic product. Low growth, a high inflation rate, a lare budget deficit, and a 10-per-
 cent unemployment rate characterize the economy. To promote further economic de-
 velopment, Greece relies heavily on the European Union (EU) for subsidies and
 loans.
 The Constitution provides for, and, with some exceptions in the cases of ethnic
 Turks and individuals who identify themselves as Macedanians, the authorities gen-
 erally respect, fundamental human rights. There continued to be credible reports
 that Greek police and miliary personnel abused Albanian illegal aliens. Albanian
 authorities formally pro tested the mid-
 August-November roundup and expulsion of over 115,000 illegal Albanian mi-
 grants from Greece, wbich they claimed resulted in the deaths oT 6 to 8 persons.
 The Government continued to use Article 19 of the Citizenship Code to revoke the
 citizenship of Greek citizens who are not etbnicaliy Greek, despite public assurances
 bysenior government officials in 1991 that it would repeal Article i9.
 Government officials harassed and placed under surveillance international and
 domestic human rights monitors. In May the courts accepted a lawsuit initiated by
 a private citizen and joined by the Public Prosecutor ainst Christos Sideropoulos
 under Article 191 of the Criminal Code for statements Sideropoulos allegedly made
 at a Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CS)press conference in
 Copenhagen in 1990. The trial was postponed in Octoer for I year because the
 plaintiff, a lawyer from Piraeus, failed to sow up on the appointed date.
 The Government recognizes oniy one minority, the Muslim minority referred to
 in the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, and refuses to acknowledge the existence of any
 other national (i.e., non-Greek) minority. It does not deny the existence of Greeks
 of Turkish, Pomak, Vlach, Arvenite, or Roma ethnic background, or of various lin-
 guistic or religious communities. The Government denies, however, members of the
 Slavophone community the right to declare themselves a Macedonian minority (see
 Section 2.b.).
 Responding to a Council of E urope (COE) team of international monitors which
 issued a report on its visits to police stations, prisons, and psychiatric hospitals, the
 Government took corrective action to relieve severe overcrowding and harsh living
 conditions in some prisons. Almost all pending cases restricting freedom of expres-
 sion have been dropped since the repeal in December 1993 of a law against "insult-
 
 
 828
 ing authority," with the exception of two. Several religious minorities report a dimi-
 nution in discrimination an religious persecution. One instance of prosecution for
 religious proselytizing was reported in 1994.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killing, but there were several reports of persons killed while in official custody.
 The Albanian Government twice protested kilgs by Greek police or military per-
 sonnel of six to eight Albanians who had illegally entered Greece. In the first case,
 the Albanian Government in March described the Greek shooting while in custody
 of an apprehended illegal Albanian alien, Alfred Abas Muco, 21 years old. After a
 military investigation, the Greek Government replied that Muco's killing was acci-
 dental. In the second case, on August 22 the Alban  Ministry of Foreign Affairs
 protested the killing of Ormen Gjoka and maiming of Ali Red (broken back) while
 in Greek custody during the Greeks' forcible expulsion of Albanians. Greece re-
 turned Gjoka's body and Red to Albania on August 23 without publicity or expla-
 nation.
 The Albanian Government also protested the deaths of six unnamed Albanians
 during the Greek roundup and expulsion of Albanian aliens in August-September.
 Of the six, one was reportedly a 19-year-old woman shot in the head; another was
 a 21-year-old man, shot in the back. Two others of the six reportedly drowned in
 a river during flight from pursng Greek police. It was not known whether the six
 dead referecto include Ormen Gjoka, mentioned above. The Greek Ministry of For-
 eign Affairs states that it requested but did not receive identifying information
 about the six from the Albanian Government to aid investigation of the cases, and
 it is not known if any investigation was conducted.
 The Government has not provided any further information on the army's inves-
 tigation of the Febrary 27, 1993, incident in which a Greek soldier shot an Alba-
 an. Af~tr a request by the German Embassy in Athens for a followup investigation
 into the death of Ramon Joachim Schulz, the Government reaffirmed the conclusion
 of the original investigation, that Schulz died of a heart attack, despite evidence to
 the contrary.
 Greek terrorists attacked and killed three persons in 1994-a Turkish diplomat,
 a prominent Greek banker, and a Greek policeman. There hav been no arrests
 made in these cases.
 h. Disappearance.-No cases of disapearanes were reported in 1994. The case
 of two ethnic Greeks of Albanian citizenship who disappeared on March 4, 1993, re-
 mained unsolved. The Government claimedthat the two were not in custody when
 they disappeared, although Amnesty International reported that they were seen
 being arrested by an armed policeman, and initially the police confirmed they were
 holding them.
 cTorture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punshment.-
 The Constitution specifically forbids torture, and a 1984 law made the use of torture
 an offense punishale by a sentence of from 3 years to life imprisonment. However,
 this law has never been invoked, even though there were credible reports that police
 and military personnel beat and otherwise ni-treated illegal Albanian aliens in the
 process of deporting them in August and September. The Government denied such
 A December 1993 report by the COE's Committee for the Prevention of Torture
 and  In um a n or  Degrading                       rem ent or  Pnis hment  (,PT)  c ncluded  that  certain
 ca te g o ri es  o  p e rso n s  e a e d o r   a rre ste d  y   te   p o ice ,  p a r icum a r y   p e rso ns   a r-
 rested for drug-related offenses or for serious crimes such as murder, rape, or rob-
 bery, run a significant risk of being if-treated and are occasionally subjected to se-
 vere bee-treatment or torture. The report stressed that the Government should exam-
 ine diligently all allegations of rl-treatment and prosecute and punish offenders. It
 also emphasized the need for additional education for police on human rights ques-
 tions; better trainiing modern investigation techniques; and the acquisition and
 development of interpersonal ommunication skills h   police  officers. Finally, it
 stressed the need to strengthen formal safeguards against the ill-treatment of per-
 sons detained by the police, including the right to access to a lawyer from the outset
 of detention.
 The COE report stated that allegations of illtreatment included kicks punches,
 slaps, stamping on feet, as well as blows with the butt of a pistol or wooden sticks.
 The report also noted allegations of an even more serious kind, in particular of
 falaka (beating on the soles of the feet) and the administration of electric shocks;
 it indicated that the Athens and Thessaloniki police had inflicted such treatment
 
 
 829
 
 at police headquarters. The COE team's medical personnel confirmed that physical
 evidence from the victims was consistent with their allegations. In addition, the
 COE team observed a variety of unlabeled wooden sticks and batons at the
 Thessaloniki police headquarters as well as a hand-held device for delivering elec-
 tric shocks which was discovered in the personal locker of a police officer attached
 to the Thessaloniki police headquarters.
 The Government conducted its own internal review of these charges and reported
 in August on the status of 33 lawsuits filed against policemen in the period 1989-
 1993 for abuse, torture, and ill-treatment. Twenty cases were still pending in court
 or under investigation; in three cases, the police officers were found innocent; one
 police offcer was sentenced to 2 years in prison for slapping a prisoner in the face;
 and in nine cases the charges were dropped. The Government refused to accept the
 Committee's observations concerning investigation methods, tortuare, and ifl-treat-
 ment, dismissing them as without foundation.
 The COB report described conditions of detention in police establishments visited
 as vaiying from adequate to extremely poor and in one case as inhuman. It noted
 prmpt compliance with a recommendation to close cells in two police stations im-
 mediately.
 There were few reports of physical abuse from most prisons, although the COE
 report cited rll-treatment of prisoners by prison staff at the Larissa prison as an ex-
 ception. According to another credible repot two Albanian prisoners who attempted
 to escape in 1993 from a prison on the islan of Kos were beaten severely after their
 recapture. An investigation by the Ministry of Justice resulted in bringing charges
 in September against three prison guards for "dangerous bodily harm" and against
 another for_"simple bodily harm." In April the Ministry issued strict instructions to
 prison wardens to prevent physical abuse of the incarcerated. The Minister of Jus-
 tice personally condud followup investigations and visited prisons. The wardens
 of two prisons were fired for misconduct and failing to follow or enforce proper
 guidelines for treatment of prisoners. The Ministry has announced a training pro-
 gram for prison guards to prevent abuse of prisoners, but it has not yet begun.
 Prison overrowding, particularly at the Korydallos prison near Athens, was re-
 lieved in 1994 as a result of a new law which permits parole after a prisoner has
 served two-fifths (versus the previous three-fifths) of a prison term. Implementation
 of this law resulted in the release of 1,200 prisoners by July, roughly 1 out of every
 6 of the totalpsn population. The Justice Ministry also implemented special pris-
 on programs for ah tratment of drug addicts and a pilot vocational tr"aining, legal,
 and mental health counseling program for juveniles. A new detention and court cen-
 ter was opned in Thessalonki; the old center had been cited in the CO report
 as particularly inadequate.
 Prsnconditions for conscientious objectors improved somewhat in 1994, as a re-
 sult of government action to reduce overcrowding. In addition, the Government
 began renovations to the Kassandra prison, which was notorious for its poor living,
 health, and sanitary conditions.
 The COe team provided an independent monitor of prison, police station, and psy-
 chiatric hAspital conditions. Such independent monitoring, however, was not regu-
 larly scheduled.
 d* Arbitr y Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution requires judicial war-
 rants for all arrests, except during the actual commission of a crime, and the law
 prohibits arbitrary arrest orders. The police do not always respect these safeguards
 (see below). Police must, by law, bring a person arrested opthe basis of a warrant
 or while committing a crime before an examining magistrate within 24 hours. The
 magistrate must issue a detention warrant or order the release of the detainee with-
 in 3 days, unless special circumstances require a 2-day extension of this time limit.
 Defendants brought to court before the end of the day following the commission
 of a charged offense may be tried immediately, under a "speedy procedure." Al-
 though legal safeguards, including representation by counsel, apply in speedy proce-
 dure cases,f he sor po   ofttime may inhibit the defendants ability to present
 an adequate defense. Defendants may ask for a delay to provide time to prepare
 their defense, but the court is not obliged to grant it. The speedy procedure was
 used in less than 10 percent of misdemeanor cases. It was not used at all for felo-
 Des peite these legal safeguards, the police sometimes violate them For example,
 both the COB team and Greek defense lawyers stated that the police, durin inves-
 tigation of serious crimes, occasionally interrogated suspects as "witnesses, alleg-
 edy because witnesses do not have the right to legal representation during police
 questioning. Statements made to the police in these circumstances may be used
 against these persons in court if they are later charged and brought to trial. Wit-
 nesses do not have the legal right to remain silent, although no one is required to
 
 
 830
 testify against himself. In such cases access to a lawyer may be effectively denied
 until after interrogation, which in some cases has resulted in torture or ill-treat-
 ment and the subsequent signing of a statement. These circumstances were report-
 edly most likely to occur in the case of serious crimes, including drug offenses, in
 which the police did not have sufficient evidence to convict without a confession. The
 Government did not prosecute and punish any officials for such misconduct during
 the year.
 The effective maximum duration of pretrial detention was 18 months for felonies
 and 9 months for misdemeanors. A panel of judges may grant release pending trial,
 with or without bail. A person convicted of a misdemeanor and sentenced to 2 years
 or less may, at the court's discretion, pay a fine in lieu of being imprisoned. The
 percentage of the incarcerated population comprised of pretrial detainees was 33
 percent, according to government sources.
 There were no reports of incommunicado detention.
 Exile is unconstitutional, and no cases have been reported since the restoration
 of democracy in 1974. However, Greek citizens not of ethnic Greek origin who travel
 outside the country may be deprived of their citizenship and refused readmittance
 to the country under Article 19 of the Citizenship Code. Article 20 of the Code per-
 mits the Government to strip citizenship from those who "commit acts contrary to
 the interests of Greece for the benefit of a foreign state." (See Section 2.d. for more
 information on the application of these articles.)
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial-The judicial system includes three levels of courts,
 appointed judges, an examining magistrate system, trial by judicial panel, and the
 right of appeal by both prosecution and defense. The Constitution provides for the
 independence of the judiciary but there are credible charges that judges sometimes
 allow political criteria, including the desire to obtain promotion, to influence their
 judgments.
 Judges are not appointed for life. Mandatory retirement ages vary with the type
 of court. Some judges expressed concern that the change in the way judges are se-
 lected might affect the independence of the judiciary. Previously, they were elected
 by their peers, but under the new law they are chosen by their superiors.
 The Government has taken Christos Sideropoulos to trial five times in 4 years for
 speaking publicly about the existence and rights of what he identifies as a Macedo-
 nian minority. A case brought by a private citizen was accepted and joined by the
 prosecutor in May despite the fact that the allegedly offensive statements were
 made at a CSCE conference in Denmark in 1990. Under Article 6 of the Criminal
 Code, Greek citizens may be prosecuted for actions committed abroad only if those
 actions are punishable under the laws of that country. Sideroupoulos's alleged state-
 ments do not constitute an offense under Danish law, but Greek courts and the
 Greek Government permitted the case to go to trial; in September, the scheduled
 trial was postponed for I year.
 The Constitution provides for public trials, and trial court sessions are open to
 the public, unless the court decides that privacy is required to protect victims and
 witnesses or national security matters. According to defense attorneys, the latter
 provision has not been invoked since the restoration of democracy in 1974. The de-
 fendant enjoys the presumption of innocence, the standard of proof of guilt beyond
 a reasonable doubt, the right to present evidence and witnesses, the right of access
 to the prosecution's evidence, the right to cross-examine witnesses, and the right to
 counsel. Lawyers are provided to defendants (in felony cases, only) who are not able
 to afford legal counsel
 The legal system does not discriminate against women or minorities, with one
 clear exception: Article 19 of the Citizenship Code (see Section 2.d.) applies only to
 Greek citizens who are not ethnically Greek.
 As noted above, the courts continue to permit prosecutions of minority activists
 who violated laws that limit freedom of expression (see Section 2.a.). However, no
 one was imprisoned as a result of such charges in the last 5 years. Those convicted
 have been allowed to convert their convictions to a fine of about $4.00 a day.-
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Al-
 though the Constitution prohibits invasion of privacy and searches without war-
 rants, and the law permits monitoring personal communications only under strict
 judicial controls, the variety of persons and groups subjected to government surveil-
 lance in recent years raises questions about safeguards. Targets included human
 rights monitors, non-Orthodox religious groups, and activist members of minority
 groups.
 In June a parliamentary investigation committee recommended indictment of
 former Prime Minister Mitsotakis and 30 persons from the former Mitsotakis ad-
 ministration on charges of wiretapping political opponents from 1989 to 1991. In
 
 
 831
 January 1995, the Parliament voted to drop all charges against Mitsotakis. The oth-
 ers will be tried in criminal courts in 1995.
 The security services continued to monitor human rights and minority group rep -
 resentatives and foreign diplomats who met with such individuals. Human rights
 monitors also reported the continuation of suspicious openings and diversions of
 mail, some of which was never delivered but was subsequently published in news-
 papers with apparent links to Greek security services. So far as is known, the Gov-
 ernment took no steps to stop such practices or to prosecute those involved.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and press is provided for in
 the Constitution and generally respected in practice, but with some significant ex-
 ceptions. Some legal restrictions on free speech remain in force and were invoked
 in one case in 1994 concerning the right of an individual to identify himself as a
 member of a Macedonian minority in Greece. The charges in this case were based
 on what the individual said, not on violent acts or criminal behavior. On matters
 other than those involving the question of ethnic minorities, Greece enjoys a tradi-
 tion of outspoken public discourse and a vigorous free press. Satirical and opposition
 newspapers do not hesitate to attack the highest state authorities. According to
 journalists, self-censorship was practiced on national security and Greek national
 identity issues.
 The Constitution allows for seizure (though not prior restraint), by order of the
 public prosecutor, of publications that insult the President, offend religious beliefs,
 contain obscene articles, advocate violent overthrow of the political system, or dis-
 close military and defense information. Seizures have been rare, however, and did
 not occur in 1994.
 In December 1993, the Government repealed a law which forbade "insulting au-
 thority" and outlawed prosecution of otherwise actionable "offenses committed by or
 through the press." As a result of these changes, a number of trials involving re-
 strictions on freedom of speech initiated under the previous government, including
 the cases of five Trotskyites and two journalists, were terminated. With the Decem-
 ber 1993 repeal of an antiterrorism law, the Government lifted restrictions on the
 publishing of the communications of terrorist groups; this provided a forum for the
 publication of the proclamations of Greek terrorist groups during a period of
 stepped-up terrorist activity.
 Several other articles of the Penal Code which were used in the past to restrict
 free speech and press remain in force. (Article 141 of the Penal Code forbids "expos-
 ing the friendly relations of the Greek State with foreign states to danger of disturb-
 ance;." Article 191 of the Code prohibits "spreading false information and rumors lia-
 ble to create concern and fear among citizens and cause disturbances in the coun-
 trys international relations and inciting citizens to rivalry and division, leading to
 disturbance of the peace.") The Government continues to use laws to charge individ-
 uals who raise politically sensitive topics, such as relations with the Former Yugo-
 slav Republic of Macedonia and the assertion of ethnic minority identification. An
 example is the case of Christos Sideropoulos, who described himself as a Macedo-
 nian activist (see Section .e.). Two other freedom of expression cases from previous
 years are scheduled to be heard by appeals courts in 1995.
 On April 14, charges were dropped against Sadik Ahmet Sadik for an article he
 published in 1989 in which he alleged discrimination and repression against ethnic
 Turks in Greece. Sadik also appealed to the Supreme Court a February 1 conviction
 by the First Appeal Court in Thessaloniki for falsifying signatures on a petition he
 circulated among the Muslims of Thrace. Two other cases pending against Sadik in-
 volve charges oftheft, unlawful entry in public buildings, and inciting violence dur-
 ing altercations with the authorities in Thrace about new textboks distributed by
 the Greek Government in 1992. These two cases have been postponed.
 The 1975 Constitution provides that the State exercise "immediate control" over
 radio and television. An independent, government-appointed body with the authority
 to enact rules governing private broadcasting established procedural regulations for
 radio several years ago. In 1993 it did so for television as well, issuing licenses to
 six private stations. Many other private television stations operated without li-
 censes, however. State-run stations tended to emphasize the Goverment's views
 and positions but also reported objectively on other parties' programs and positions.
 Throughout much of western Thrace, Turkish-language satellite television broad-
 casts are widely available. The mayors of two cities in the region set up satellite
 ground stations for their Turkish-speaking constituents. Eleven Turkish-language
 publications-eight weekly news papers and three monthly magazines--are pub-
 Iished and circulated in Thrace. Newspapers and other periodicals from Turkey are
 distributed in small numbers when brought in by taxis and travelers.
 
 
 Academic freedoms are respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly. Police permits were routinely issued for public demonstrations,
 and there were no reports that the permit requirement was abused.
 The Constitution provides for the right of association, which was generally re-
 spected, except in cases involving ethic minorities. In 1994 the Supreme Court
 upheld the 1991 decision of lower courts to deny registration to the "'Macedonian
 Cultural Center" in Florina, organized by Greeks who consider themselves of Slavic
 descent. The 1991 ruling held that the true goal of the society *** in to afirm
 the idea of the existence of a Macedonman minority in Greece, which contradicts
 (Greece's) national interests and the law.? The organizers planned to appeal the de-
 cision to the European Court of Human Rights.
 Greek authorities, while recognizing a Muslim minority, di.'d not recogiz"e the ex-
 istence of other minorities based on ethnic grounds (see Secton 5). This is contrary
 to the 1990 Copenhagen document of the CSCE to which the Government is a part,
 which asserts that "to belong to a national minority is a matter of a person's indi-
 vidual choice.b
 c. Freedom of Religio1.-The Constitution establishes the Greek Orthodox Church,
 to which perhaps 95 percent of the population at least nominally adhere, as the pre-
 vailing religion but prohibits discrimination against religious .minori'ties. The G rek
 Orthodox Church wields sicant influenc through its relationship with the Min-
 istry of Education and Religon. Religious training is mandatory in Grek public
 schools for Greek Orthodox pupils. Non-Orthodox students are exempt from this re-
 quirement. However, there are reports from Helsinki Monitor (Greece) that some
 schoolteachers force Jehovah's Witnesses students to attend Orthodox services. The
 Constitution nmits religious practice by prohibiting proselytizing. In contrast to past
 years, in 1994 only one arrest for proselytizing by other faiths was reported.
 In January plice in Thessaloniki arrested two members of the Church of Latter-
 day Saints (Mormons) for violating immigration law and jailed them overnight.
 After a 10-day trial, they were acquitted. The Church complained in September of
 harassment by local thugs in Piraeus but at the same time reported a generally im-
 proved relationship with local police.
 Traditionally, Jehovah's Witnesses ministers were not  rted the exem-ption
 from military service accorded under Greek law to ciergy of "known religions and
 thus served prison sentences for refusing military service. Since 1990-91, the Coun-
 cil of State, the highest court dealing with civil and administrative matters whose
 opinions are binding on the Government, has ruled that the Jehovah's Witnesses
 were a "known religion" and has ordered the release of ministers who had refused
 induction. However, the recruiting service of the armed forces regarded these rul-
 ings as applying only to individual appellants, not as binding precedents for subse-
 quent Jehovah's Witnesses ministers who were called up. It thus continued to rely,
 in the first instance, on the opinion of the Ministry of Education and Religion, which
 in turn accepted the view of the Greek Orthodox Church that the Jehovah's Wit-
 nesses are not a "known religion. As a consequence, for the past few yeare min-
 isters of the Jehovah's Witnesses have been called up for military service andres-
 ecuted for refusal; only after conviction could they appeal to the Council of State
 for exemptions as ministers of a "kown religion." In practice, these ministers have
 spent periods of a few months to over a year in jail whie appealing their cases to
 the Council of State. In contrast topast years, in 1994 only one arrest for proselytiz-
 ing by other faiths was reported. A Jehovah Witnesses canvasser was arrested in
 Volos on October 14, and the local public prosecutor charged him with proselytizing.
 He was subsquently released pending hearing of the case in 1995.
 To open an      l ope rats a house of worship in Greece requires approval by the Min-
 istry of Education and Religion. The Ministry bases its decision on the advisory
 opinion of the local Orthodox bishop. In recent years, it has not been uncommon for
 such permission to be delayed or even, at times, withheld, though some denomina-
 tions have been able to open and operate churches in the guise of cultural centers.
 Several denominations report diffcnlties getting residence permits for forein
 members of their faiths who come to Greece to perform missionary or charity work
 Although such problems continued in 1994, these denominations reported overall
 better relatin on wt  inmiran authorities and routine approval of extensions of
 tourist visas for these  rsons for up to 9 months.
 Moqes and other nuslim religious institutions operate freely in western Thrace
 and inRhodes, where most Greek citizens of the Muslm faith reside. Some Muslims
 claimed that Greek law weakens the financial autonomy of the "Wakfs, community
 funds used for maintaining mosques, schools, and for charitable works, by placin
 the Wakfs under the a    ntration of appointed "mutis (Islamic judges and reMi-
 
 
 833
 ous leaders) and their representatives. Those who object to this system say it vio-
 lates the terms of the Treaty of Lausanne.
 In accordance with a 1990 presidential decree, the State appointed the two muftis
 in Greece, both resident in western Thrace, based on the recommendations of a com-
 mittee of local Muslim scholars, religious authorities, and community leaders. The
 Government argued that it must appoint muftis because, in addition to their reli-
 gious duties, they perform judicial functions in many civil and domestic matters, for
 which the State pays them. The Muslim minority remains divided on the muflti se-
 lection issue. Some Muslims accept the authority of the appointed muftis; others
 elect muftis to serve their communities.
 The Government denied entry to two Turkish theologians invited to Thrace for
 Ramadan and in July refused to admit a delegation of six religious leaders from
 Turkey to enter Greece on the grounds that they intended to engage in political, not
 religious, activities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution calls for freedom of movement within and outside the
 country, and the right to return. However, Article 19 of the Citizenship Code distin-
 guishes between Greek citizens who are ethnic Greeks and those who are not. Most
 Article 19 cases involve ethnic Turks from western Thrace, since only the "Muslim
 minoity" is recognized as having non-Greek ethnicity. Greek citizens who are not
 ethnic Greeks may be deprived of their citizenship if it is determined that they left
 Greece with the apparent intention not to return. However, immigrants who are
 ethnic Greeks are normally recognized as Greek citizens and accorded full rights,
 despite years or even generations of absence from Greece.
 The Interior Ministry initiates proceedin  under Article 19 on the basis of re-
 ports by local authorities in Greece or by G-reek embassies or consulates abroad. It
 holds hearings at which the affected person is neither present nor notified of the
 hearing. Those who lose Greek citizenship as a result of such hearings sometimes
 learn of this loss only when they seek to reenter Greece. According to the Foreign
 Ministry, 42 persons lost Greek citizenship under Article 19 in 1994 as of October
 (down from 123 in 1993).
 Persons who lose their Greek citizenship under Article 19 have the right of "ad-
 ministrative appeal" to the Interior Ministry and may also apeal to the Greek
 Council of State and to the Council of Europe. Leaders of the  kish-origin Greek
 community complain that the time and expense involved tends to discourage such
 appeals. Three persons who lost Greek citizenship in 1993 and three persons who
 lost citizenship in 1994 have filed administrative appeals which are pending. Six de-
 cisions on appeals from previous years were taken in 1993: three denied and three
 upheld the appeals, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
 Another section of the Citizenship Code, Article 20, permits the Government to
 strip citizenship from those who "commit acts contrary to the interests of Greece for
 thebenefit of a foreign state." While the law as written applies equally to all Greeks
 regardless of their ethnic background, according to activists who support minority
 causes, it is exercised pnipaly against those who speak out against government
 policy on national issues, including at least three activists who call themselves Mac-
 edonian.
 Some Greek citizens, particularly those of Slavic descent, credibly reported that
 they were subject to extensive searches and questioning at the border when travel-
 intbetween Greece and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
 Greece maintains restricted military zones along its borders, including along its
 northern border with Bulgaria, an area where many Pomaks (Muslims who speak
 a Bulgarian dialect) reside. Since entry into the zone is strictly controlled, even for
 local inhabitants, some residents of the area complain that their freedom of move-
 ment is restricted. Foreign diplomats are allowed into the zone only under escort
 and with special authorization.
 Greece frequently offers temporary asylum, though rarely permanent resettle-
 ment, to a growing number of refugees from Turkey, aq, and Iran. Permanent re-
 settlement in Greece is not usually available for nonethnic Greek refugees. There
 are 3,482 cases of asylum seekers in Greece with apparently legitimate claims to
 refugee status that are under review by the Government in cooperation with the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
 In Auust and September, the Government rounded up and expelled over 50,000
 illegal Abanian migrants from Greece. There were credible allegations by Albanians
 andby international human rights observers of abuse of some deportees, especially
 at border crossings on the Greek-Albanian border. The roundup coincided with
 sharply worsened relations between the Governments of Greece and Albania, result-
 ing from the trial of five ethnic Greek leaders in Tirana on treason and weapons
 charges.
 
 
 834
 Ethnic Greek immigrants, including those who came from the former Soviet
 Union since 1986 and those rescued from the civil war in Georgia, normally quali-
 fied promptly for citizenship and special assistance from the Government. The re-
 turnees have been settled initially on government-owned land in western Thrace,
 where government programs to get them to remain have met with limited success.
 Most move to Athens, Thessaloniki, or other cities where job prospects are better.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Greece is a multiparty democracy in which the Constitution calls for full political
 rights for all citizens and for the peaceful change of governments and of the Con-
 stitution. However, the Government limits the right of some individuals to speak
 publicly and associate freely on the basis of their self-proclaimed ethnic identity and
 thus impinges on the political rights of such persons. It also combined voting dis-
 tricts in Thrace, making it impossible for ethnic Turks to be elected there (see
 below). Additionally, Roma representatives report that local authorities sometimes
 deprive Roma of the right to vote by refusing to register them. Members of the uni-
 cameral 300-seat Parliament are elected to maximum 4-year terms by secret ballot.
 The Government headed by Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou of the Pan-
 hellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) won in free and fair elections in October 1993.
 Parliament elects the President for a 5-year term. Universal suffrage applies to
 those over age 18 and enforced by fines and administrative penalties. Opposition
 parties function freely and have broad access to the media.
 Under a 1990 electoral law, no candidate may be elected whose party does not
 receive 3 percent or more of the nationwide vote. This law also applies to independ-
 ent candidates. As a result neither of Greece's former independent Muslim mem-
 bers of Parliament, both of whom proclaim their Turkish ethnic identity, was re-
 elected to Parliament in 1993. In the June election to the European Parliament,
 candidates identifying themselves as Macedonian running under the European-wide
 "Rainbow Coalition" banner received 5.5 percent of the vote in Florina, a heavily
 Slavophone province in northern Greece, and a total of over 7,000 votes nationwide.
 The Supreme Court invalidated the list of Rainbow Coalition candidates but then
 reversed its decision 2 weeks before the election. Rainbow candidates had little time
 to campaign officially, and were not allowed to take part in government-sponsored
 television and radio programs which included all other candidates. In addition, some
 polling stations did not receive lists needed for supporters to vote for Rainbow can-
 didates. One of the same activists ran without incident for governor of Florina pre-
 fecture in the local elections in October he won 3.3 percent of the vote.
 In October Greece held elections at he local leveL, including, for the first time (as
 a result of a new election law), elections for governors and prefectural councils. One
 month prior to the elections, Parliament passed legislation combining electoral dis-
 tricts in Athens and Thrace. The prefecture of Roopi, about half of whose citizens
 are ethnic Turks or Pomaks, was united with Evros, which is approximately 5-per-
 cent Muslim. Xanthi prefecture, which is approximately 40-percent ethnic Turkish
 and Pomak, was united with two other prefectures which had virtually no Muslim
 population. Ethnic Turks complained correctly that the law as it was applied to
 Thrace was intended to eliminate any possibility that an ethnic Turk could be elect-
 ed governor of either of the prefectures.
 In June unknown persons fired shots at Anastassios Boulis, a Macedonian activist
 who was a candidate for the European Parliament. Boulis charged that, although
 local police knew who the perpetrators were, they never investigated. The Govern-
 ment claimed a police investigation produced no corroborating evidence or wit-
 nesses.
 Although there are no legal restrictions on the participation of women or minori-
 ties in government or politics, women's representation at the higher levels of politi-
 cal life remain low. The head of the Communist Party is a woman. Women hold no
 ministerial positions in the Government and only 3 of 26 deputy ministerial posi-
 tions. Eleven of the 300 members of Parliament are women. Women are
 underrepresented in the leadership of the two largest parties.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government allows domestic human rights organizations to operate but may
 or may not cooperate with them. In principle, it respects the right of foreign dip-
 lomats to meet with officials and other citizens, including critics of official policy,
 though it is clear that the security services observe contacts of human rights mon-
 itors, including listening in on conversations held between those monitors and
 human rights investigators and diplomats. The security services' surveillance of
 
 
 835
 
 such meetings is often blatant, and some such meetings are treated tendentiously
 in the press. Monitors view this activity as a form of intimidation and say that it
 deters others from meeting with investigators.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Rac, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equality before the law and the full protection of
 individual life, honor, and freedom irrespective of nationality, race, language, or reli-
 gious or political belief.
 Violence against homosexuals is not common in Greece. However, police occasion-
 ally harass gay bar owners and gay men, including detaining them at police stations
 overnight and sometimes physically mistreating them. Homosexuals discovered in
 the military service are dismissed for reasons of "mental illness," and would-be
 draftees are exempted from compulsory military service for the same reason. De-
 clared homosexuals exempted from military service for that reason are ineligible for
 public sector jobs.
 Women.-There are broad constitutional and legal protections for women, includ-
 ing equal pay for equal work, but the General Secretariat for Equality of the Sexes
 (GSES), an independent government agency, maintains that these laws are not con-
 sistently enforced, and as a consequence women generally receive lower salaries
 than men for similar jobs. A GSES report states that in 1993 average women's sala-
 ries in retail trade were 79.4 percent of those of men in comparable positions.
 Although there are still relatively few women in senior positions, in recent years
 women have entered traditionally male-dominated occupations in large numbers.
 The incidence of reported physical violence against women is low; however, the
 GSES asserts that police tend to discourage women from pursuing domestic violence
 charges and instead undertake reconciliation efforts, though they are neither quali-
 fied for nor charged with this task. The GSES also claims that the courts are lenient
 when dealing with domestic violence cases; it hopes that attitude will change as
 more women enter the judiciary.
 As a result of pressure from women's groups, a center for battered women was
 established in Athens in 1988, and a residential facility for battered women and
 their children opened in 1993. These centers provide legal advice, psychological
 counseling, information on social services, and temporary residence for battered
 women and their children. They received approximately 250 women in 1994.
 The Government lists progress on women's issues as a high priority and estab-
 lished a new position of Deputy Minister for Women's Affairs in the Office of the
 Prime Minister. This Office and the GSES coordinate efforts to remove barriers.
 Children.-Legislation enacted in 1992 prohibits and provides penalties for all
 forms of maltreatment of children perpetrated by parents or others. The State pro-
 vides preventive and treatment programs for abused children and for children de-
 prived of their family environment, seeking to ensure that alternative family care
 or institutional placement is made available to them.
 However, children's rights advocacy groups claim that protection of high-risk chil-
 dren in state residential care centers is inadequate and of low quality. They cite
 lack of coordination between welfare services and the courts, inadequate funding of
 the welfare system, and poor manning of residential care centers as systemic weak-
 nesses in child abuse prevention and treatment efforts. Societal abuse of children
 in the form of prostitution, pornography, and child labor is rare in Greece.
 In recent years, Greece has experienced a dramatic rise in the population of street
 children, mainly from Albania, who panhandle or peddle at city intersections on be-
 half of adult family members or for organized crime. Police occasionally take these
 children into custody and bring them to state or charitable institutions which care
 for wayward children. Parents can reclaim their children from these institutions,
 but risk deportation if they are illegal immigrants. The number of Albanian street
 children has been greatly       he since the expulsion of illegal Albanians in Au-
 gust-September 1994. Roma children are still in evidence on Athens streets, how-
 ever. Few children are available for adoption by childless couples. As a result, occa-
 sional cases of prosecution against the selling of Greek babies to childless couples
 are reported.
 Usage of public health facilities by Roma is low because of the low rate of integra-
 tion of Roma communities within Greek society and social security systems. Ninety
 percent of Roma are not insured by any of the government socialscurity systems
 because they are self-employed or work in off-the-boks jbs that do not make con-
 tributions to the social security system. The fact that health facilities are not located
 close to the camps in which the Roma live also contributes to their low rate of ac-
 cess.

 National/Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-There are communities in Greece which
 identify themselves as Turks, Pomaks, Vlachs, Roma, and Macedonians. Many are
 fully integrated into Greek society. The only minority Greece formally recognizes is
 a "Muslim minority," which is referred to in the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. The Gov-
 ernment insists on the use of this rubric to refer to several different ethnic commu-
 nities, most of which adhere to the Muslim faith. The Muslim minority is comprised
 primarily of ethnic Turks or Turkish speakers in western Thrace, which the Govern-
 ment estimates at roughly 120,000 persons. In addition to people of Turkish origin,
 it includes Pomaks (Muslims who speak a lan  age skin to Bulgarian) and Roma.
 Many Greek Muslims, including Polmks, identify themselves as Turks and say that
 the Muslim minority as a whole has a Turkish cultural consciousness. The use of
 the word "tourkoe' ("Turk") is prohibited in titles of organizations, though individ-
 uals may legally call themselves "tourkos. To most Greeks, the word "tourkos' con-
 notes Turkish identity or loyalties, and many object to its use by Greek citizens of
 Turkish origin. Use of a similar adjective, "tourkoyennis" (of Turkish descent/alli-
 ation/ethnicity), however, is allowed (see also Section 2.b.).
 Northern Greece is home to an indeterminate number (estimates range from
 under 10,000 to 50,000 or more) of Greek citizens who are descended from Slavs or
 Slavophones. Some still speak a Slavic dialect, particularly in the Florina district.
 A small number of them consider themselves to be members of a distinct ethnic
 Tup which they identify as Macedonian and assert their right to minority status.
 e Government continues to harass and intimidate some of these people, including
 putting one person on trial for asserting the existence of a Macedonian minority (see
 Section 2.a.), denying their right to association (see Section 2.b.), monitoring activ-
 ists' meetings with human rights investigators (see Section 2.d.), and accusing activ-
 ists publicly of being agents of a foreign government. These activists say that, as
 a result, some Greeks who consider themselves Macedonian do not declare them-
 selves openly for fear of losing their jobs or other sanctions.
 A 1994 report by Human Rights Watch/Helsinki entitled "Denying Ethnic Iden-
 tity-the Macedonians of Greece" charged, inter alia, that an ethnc Macedonian mi-
 nority with its own language and culture exists in northern Greece and that the
 Greek Government's denial of that minority is in violation of international human
 rights laws and agreements. They also state that the Greek Government discrimi-
 nates against this minority in violation of international law or agreements to which
 it is a party. In responding to these charges, the Government says that it recog-
 nizes, under the Copenhagen CSCE document, the right of people to identify them-
 selves as members of ethnic minorities. However, it states that such self-identifica-
 tion does not require government recognition of such a minority or entitle its mem-
 bers to any privileges under CSCE or other instruments. As noted, however, the
 Government continues to deny the rights of free speech and association to some who
 have tried peacefully to assert what they consider to be their minority rights.
 Government officials and Greek courts deny requests by individuals and groups
 to identify themselves using the ancient term Macedonian, since some 2.2 million
 ethnic (and linguistically) Greek citizens already use the term to identify them-
 selves. The Greek Government does not define the dialect spoken by some thou-
 sands of northern Greeks as Macedonian, and government officials deny that it is
 a language at all. The officials also noted that Greece regulates the establishment
 of all commercial language academies, and questioned whether advocates of "Mac-
 edonian" language schools meet the relevant requirements. They added that the
 Government would not interfere with the holding of informal language classes with-
 in the Slavophone community.
 The Secretariat for Adult Education (a government agency) in 1994 revised up-
 ward its estimate of the number of Roma in Greece to approximately 300,000. Al-
 most half of the Roma population is permanently settled, mainly in the Athens area.
 The other half is mobile, working mainly as agricultural workers, peddlers, and mu-
 sicians throughout the oun try. Government policy is to encourage assimilation of
 Roma. Poverty, illiteracy, and social prejudice continue to plague large parts of the
 Roma population. The Secretariat for Adult Education conducted education pro-
 grams targeting the Roma population, including the use of mobile schools. Some
 1,200 Roma children attended the mobile school program during the last school
 year.
 The rate of employment of Muslims in the public sector and in state-owned indus-
 tries and corporations is much lower than the Muslim percentage of the population.
 In Xanthi, where Muslims hold seats on the town council, there are no Muslims
 among the approximately 130 regular employees of the prefecture. Ethnic Turks and
 other Muslims in Thrace claim they are hired only for lower level, part-time work.
 The Government says lack of fluency in written and spoken Greek and the need for
 
 
 837
 
 university degrees for high-level positions limits the number of Muslims eligible for
 government jobs.
 Public offices in Thrace do their business in Greek; the courts provided inter-
 preters as needed. In the Komotini district in Thrace, where many ethnic Turks live,
 the office of the district governor ("nomarch") has Turkish-language interpreters
 available.
 While discriminatory treatment against Muslims regarding licenses to operate a
 business, own a tractor, or construct property diminished greatly in recent years,
 basic services provided to Muslim-popuiated neighborhoods and villages (electricity,
 telephones, paved roads) in many cases continue to lag far behind those provided
 to non-Muslim neighborhoods.
 The Treaty of Lausanne provides that the Muslim minority has the right to Turk-
 ish-language education, with a reciprocal entitlement for the Greek minority in Is-
 tanbul. Western Thrace has both Koranic and secular Turkish-language Schools.
 Government disputes with Turkey over teachers and textbooks caused these secular
 schools serious problems in obtaining sufficient numbers and quality of faculty and
 teaching materials. Over 9,000 Muslim children attended Turkish-language primary
 schools. Around 650 attended Turkish-language secondary schools anil approxi-
 mately 1,000 attended Greek-language secondary schools. Many Muslims reportedly
 went to high school in Turkey due to the limited number of places in the Turkish-
 language secondary schools, which are assigned by lottery. In 1994 no Greek Mus-
 lims succeeded in passing the entrance examinations to attend a Greek university.
 Ethnic Turks found it difficult to obtain permission to bring in teachers from Tur-
 key or to hire Turkish-speaking teachers locally, particularly for the secular Turk-
 ish-language middle schools in Xnthi and Komotini. Under a 1952 educational pro-
 tocol, Greece and Turkey may annually exchange 35 teachers on a reciprocal basis.
 Each group serves in Istanbul and western Thrace, respectively, but in recent years
 the Greek side limited the exchanges to 16 teachers per country due to the dwin-
 dling needs of the small and aging Greek population in Turkey. According to the
 Government, during the 1993-94 school year, Greece and Turkey did not exchange
 any teachers due to an ongoing dispute over reductions of Greek instruction for
 Greek students in Turkey, and the nonissuance of diplomas to some Greek students
 there. The teacher exchange was, however, effected during the 1994-95 school year;,
 16 teachers were exchanged by each country on November 1, 1994.
 During the January 1994 visit of a group of Turkish parliamentarians to western
 Thrace, a group of Christian extremists hurled stones at the bus in which the dele-
 gation was traveling. There were no injuries, and no arrests were made.
 Reigious Minorities.--Several reigious denominations, including the Roman
 Catholic Church, reported difficulties mn dealing with Greek authorities on a variety
 of administrative matters. Privileges and legal prergatives granted the Greek Or-
 thodox Church were not rutinely extended to other recognized religions. Rather,
 the non-Orthodox must make separate and lengthy applications to government au-
 thorities on such matters as arranging appointments to meet with Ministry of Edu-
 cation and Religion officials and gaining permission to move places of worship to
 larger quarters.
 Leaders of various non-Orthodox religious groups assert that their members face
 discrimination in reaching the senior ranks m government service; furthermore, it
 appears that only those of the Orthodox faith can become officers in the Greek mili-
 tary. They allege that to avoid this restriction some members of their faiths resort
 to declaring themselves Orthodox. Senior government officials, when questioned
 about such allegations of discrimination, deny that it exists and point out certain
 persons not of the Orthodox faith who have successful careers in government serv-
 ice. There appear to be no statistics to support either side.
 Teachers who are Jehovah's Witnesses have faced difficulties in gaining or keep-
 ing employment in recent years in public or private schools. As a result of such dif-
 ficulties, six Jehovah's Witnesses have appeals on employment discrimination pend-
 ing with the Council of State, some dating back as far as 1989.
 Greek law requires that Greek citizens declare their religion on their bilingual
 identity cards that, if and when issued, would allow Greeks to travel freely within
 the EU instead of using passports. The law has caused particular concern among
 the Catholic and Jewish religious communities in Greece and abroad and has drawn
 strong criticism from the European Parliament. The Government declined in 1994
 to act either to change the law mandating the declaration of religion on the cards
 or to issue the new EU cards. Instead, the old Greek identity cards, which normally
 list religion but which allow the bearer the option not to do so, are still being issued
 Leaders of the Jewish community in Greece have lobbied the Government for sev-
 eral years to change five anti-Semitic references in Greek public school textbooks.
 In 1994 the Ministry of Education deleted two of the five passages.
 
 
 838
 
 The Government allowed Turkish Prime Minister Ciller's counselor Mustafa
 Kahramanyol to visit Thrace in early June, but denied a visa to the Turkish Direc-
 tor General of Religious Affairs, who wanted to visit a few weeks later.
 People With Disabilities.-Legislation mandates the hiring of disabled persons in
 public and private enterprises employing more than 50 persons. However, the law
 is poorly enforced, particularly in the private sector. The law states that disabled
 persons should comprise 3 percent of staff in private enterprises. In the civil service,
 5 percent of administrative staff and 80 percent of telephone operator positions are
 reserved for disabled persons. Persons with disabilities have been appointed to im-
 portant positions in the civil service, including secretary general of the Ministry of
 Welfare.
 The Construction Code mandates physical access for disabled persons to private
 and public buildings, but again the law is poorly enforced. In the past 2 years,
 ramps and special curbs for the disabled have been constructed on Athens streets
 and at public buildings, and sound signals have been installed at some city street
 crossings. In 1993 the Government started replacing old city buses with new ones
 with stairs specially designed for the disabled; the accessible buses numbered 500
 in 1994. The new Athens subway lines under construction will provide full access
 for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitu~tion and subsequent legislation provide
 for the right of association All workers, with the exception of the military and the
 police, have the right to form or join unions.
 Approximately 30 percent of Greek workers (neariy 1 million persons) were orga-
 nized in unions in 1994. Unions receive most of their funding from a Ministry of
 Labor organization, the Workers' Hearth, which distributes mandatory contributions
 from employees and employers. Only the five most powerful public sector unions
 have dues-withholding provisions in their contracts, in addition to receiving Work-
 ers' Hearth subsidies. Following the recommendation of the International Labor Or-
 ganization (ILO), the Government in 1990 enacted a law ending its financial in-
 volvement in trade union affairs and the collection of union dues. Strong union reac-
 tion, however, led to new legislation in 1994 which allowed unions to continue to
 receive Workers' Hearth funds.
 Over 4,000 unions are grouped into regional and sectoral federations and two um-
 brella confederations, one for civil servants and one, the General Confederation of
 Greek Workers (GSEE), for private sector employees. Unions are highly politicized,
 and there are party-affiliated factions within the labor confederations, but day-to-
 day operations are not controlled by political parties or the Government. There are
 no restrictions on who may serve as a union official. Unions maintain a variety of
 international affiliations and are free to join international associations.
 Legislation passed in 1994 mandates a skeleton staff during strikes affecting pub-
 lic services, such as electricity, transportation, communications, and banking. Dur-
 ing strikes in June and July, skeleton staffs did not ensure that essential services
 continued uninterrupted; however, there were no legal repercussions for the unions.
 Legal restrictions on strikes include a mandatory period of notice, which is 4 days
 for public utilities and 24 hours for the private sector. Public utility companies,
 state-owned banks, the postal service, Olympic Airways, and the railroads are also
 required to maintain a skeleton staff during strikes.
 The courts have the power to declare strikes illegal, although such decisions are
 seldom enforced. Unions complain, however, that this judicial power serves as a de-
 terrent to some of their membership from participating in strikes. In 1994 the
 courts declared a majority of strikes illegal for a variety of reasons, but no striking
 workers were prosecuted. The Government may also declare "civil mobilization" of
 workers in the event of danger to national security, life, property, or the social and
 economic life of the country. It threatened to do so when air traffic controllers
 staged a work slowdown in August-September. The ILO Committee of Experts has
 criticized this power as violating the standards of ILO Convention 29 on forced
 labor. The Government resorted to civil mobilization in December 1993 to resolve
 a bus owners' strike in opposition to government efforts to deprivatize the Athens
 bus system.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Legislation passed in 1955
 and amended in 1990 ensured the right to organize and bargain collectively in the
 private sector and in public corporations. These rights were respected in practice.
 There were no restrictions on collective bargaining for private sector employees. The
 Union of Civil Servants negotiates with the Office of the Minister to the Prime Min-
 ister.
 
 
 In 1993 the Government passed a decree setting limits to wage and salary in-
 creases for public enterprises employees. A complaint to the ILO by the General
 Confederation of Greek Workers led the ILO Committee of Experts to request that
 the Government stop intervening in the collective bargaining process by setting
 maximum wage levels.
 In response to union complaints that most labor disputes ended in compulsory ar-
 bitration, legislative remedies were enacted in 1989 providing for mediation proce-
 dures, with compulsory arbitration as a last resort. The legislation establishing a
 national mediation, reconciliation, and arbitration organization went into effect in
 January 1992 and applies to the public sector and public corporations (the military
 and civil service excluded).
 Antiunion discrimination is prohibited. The Labor Inspectorate or the courts in-
 vestigates complaints of discrimination against union members or organizers. Court
 rulings have mandated the reinstatement of improperly fired union organizers.
 Greece has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and the Ministry of Justice enforces this prohibition.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 in the industrial sector is 15, with higher limits for certain activities. The minimum
 age is 12 in family businesses, theaters, and the cinema. These age limits are en-
 forced by occasional Labor Inspectorate spot checks and. are generally respected.
 However, families engaged in agriculture, food service, or merhandising often have
 younger family members assisting them, at least part-time. Education is free and
 compulsory for all children through the ninth grade.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work._Collective bargaining between the GSEE and
 the Employers' Association determines a nationwide minimum wage. The Ministry
 of Labor routinely ratifies this minimum wage, which has the force of law and ap-
 plies to all Greek workers. The minimum wage ($21 daily and $463 monthly) was
 sufficient for a decent standard of living for a worker and family.
 The maximum legal workweek is 40 hours in the private sector and 37  hours
 in the public sector. A law that took effect in 1992 significantly extended legal oper-
 ating hours for retail establishments, provided that the average workweek did not
 exceed the legal maximum over a period of time. The law provides for at least one
 24-hour rest period per week, mandates paid vacation of 1 month per year, and sets
 limits on overtime.
 Legislation provides for minimum standards of occupational health and safety. Al-
 though the GSEE characterized health and safety legislation as satisfactory, it
 charged that enforcement, the responsibility of the Labor Inspectorate, was inad-
 equate. In 1992 the GSEE cited statistics indicating a high number of job-related
 accidents over the past two decades. Inadequate inspection, failure to enforce regu-
 lations, outdated industrial plant and equipment, and poor safety training of em-
 ployees contributed to the accident rate. Workers did not have the legal right to re-
 move themselves from situations they believed endangered their health. They did
 have the right, however, to lodge a confidential complaint with the Labor
 Inspectorate. Inspectors had the right to close down machfnery or a process for a
 period of up to  days if they saw safety or health hazards which they believe rep-
 resented an imminent danger to the workers.
