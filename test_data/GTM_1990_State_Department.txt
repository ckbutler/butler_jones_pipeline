 GUATEMALA
 The Constitution provides for election by universal suffrage
 of a one-term president, a unicameral congress--increased in
 1990 from 100 to 116 members--and municipal officers; it
 mandates an independent judiciary and a Human Rights
 Ombudsman, responsible to the Congress. Jorge Serrano Elias
 of the Solidarity Action Movement (MAS) party won the second
 round of presidential elections on January 6, with 69 percent
 of the vote, and was sworn in on January 14, 1991. The
 elections were monitored by several hundred international
 observers and journalists and were found to be free, fair, and
 genuine.
 The armed forces have the primary responsibility for national
 security 'and have been fighting an entrenched leftist
 insurgency for almost 30 years. The 43, Qa0-man army includes
 a 3,000-man mobile military police force-that guards key
 facilities and takes part in anticrime operations. The
 National Police (12,900 men1 and the Treasury Police (2,000
 report to the Interior Minister. About 500,000.men in-Civil
 Defense Committees (CVDC) carry out counterinsurgency and
 law-and-order tasks; although service in the CVDC-is supposed
 to be voluntary, in conflictive zones often it is not.
 Real economic growth dropped from4 percent in 1989 to 3.5
 percent in 1990, due in part to erratic. economic policies-. In
 the first part of the year, following the freeing of interest
 rates and the adoption of a floating exchange rate, the
 Government pursued an expansionary monetary policy. In
 September the- Government adopted & program tcr curb monetary
 expansion and cut inflation and the fiscal deficit. By the
 end of the year, however, the Government had reverted to an
 expansionary monetary and fiscal policy and effectively fixed
 the exchange rate. Inflation jumped from 21.8 percent on a
 12-month basis in January to 56.8 percent on a 12-month basis
 by the end of November. This rise, combined with slower
 growth and a continued high.population growth rate, negatively
 affected the growth of per capita income.
 Due primarily to a lack of will, authorities did not stem
 growing violence during 1990. Reliable evidence indicates
 that security forces and civil patrols committed, with almost
 total impunity, a majority of the major human rights abuses.
 These included extrajudicial killings, torture, and
 disappearances of, among others, human rights activists,
 unionists, indigenous people, and street children. Whether
 supported by fact or merely spurious information, the motive
 behind many of the abuses appears to be the belief that the
 victims were-somehow supportive of or sympathetic to the
 guerrillas. The independent office of the Human Rights
 Ombudsman repeatedly denounced the lack of the Government's
 political will to protect human rights. Criticism of
 Guatemala's human rights record by the U.S. Ambassador and the
 U.S. Government drew public and press attention. In March the
 U.S. Ambassador was temporarily recalled to Washington to
 stress the United States' dissatisfaction with the lack of
 progress in investigating cases of human rights abuse. In
 December the United States suspended deliveries of military
 assistance because of evidence that senior levels of the
 Guatemalan military were preventing an effective investigation
 into the June abduction, torture, and murder of resident
 American businessman Michael Devine by a group of men which
 included army enlisted personnel.

 GUATEMALA
 Guerrillas also engaged in acts of violence, including
 extrajudicial killings, indiscriminate use of land mines,
 kidnaping, forced labor and recruitment, and the use of
 children in combat. In May talks were held in Madrid between
 the political leadership of the guerrillas and Guatemalan
 political party representatives. The guerrillas promised to
 halt attacks on economic and civilian targets and not to
 engage in actions that could disrupt the November and-January
 elections. These promises were broken; attacks on economic
 infrastructure continued throughout the year, including during
 the elections. In August guerrillas also attacked and
 destroyed a medical compound operated by an American family in
 the Peten and threatened members of that family with death.
 There was no resolution of past cases in which the United
 States has expressed strong and continuing interest, such as
 the 1985 disappearances of American citizens Blake and Davis,
 the 1988 El Aguacate massacre, the 1989 disappearances of 11
 students at San Carlos University, 6 of whom were later found
 murdered, the 1989 knife attack on Peace Brigade members, and
 the 1990 murders of Hector Oqueli and Gilda Flores and
 anthropologist Myrna Mack Chang. Citing insufficient
 evidence, a court reversed the 1988 conviction of six
 policemen for the 1987 murders of two men in Quetzaltenango--
 the only case in which members of the security forces had ever
 been convicted for a major human rights violation.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Press reports and other credible information showed that the
 murder rate in 1990 was at least three times higher than the
 official rate of 2,000 homicides nationwide. While most
 killings resulted from personal vendettas and criminal
 activities, a number were politically motivated. The Human
 Rights Ombudsman calculated there were 304 politically
 motivated murders in 1990, and that most of the victims were
 killed by the armed forces or persons associated with or
 protected by the army, such as civil defense patrols. Most of
 these killings took place in areas of military-guerrilla
 conflict, where the military often fails to distinguish
 between guerrillas and noncombatants.
 The security forces are virtually never held accountable for
 human rights violations. With few exceptions, the Government
 failed to investigate, detain, and prosecute those
 perpetrators of extrajudicial and politically motivated
 killings who were connected with the security forces. Often
 the police were unwilling to investigate cases aggressively if
 the military was thought to be involved. It is likely that
 military officials also shield lower ranking personnel
 involved in killings. The Government also did not act to
 prevent members of the security forces, in particular certain
 rural military zone officers, from engaging in extrajudicial
 killings. These abuses continued despite attempts by foreign
 governments, some senior Guatemalan military officers, the
 Ombudsman, and the new Police Director to change poor human
 rights attitudes and practices within the security forces.
 During the year, approximately 400 policemen were discharged
 for a variety of abuses, including corruption.
 
 
 GUATEMALA
 A few politicians were killed and many reported receiving
 death threats in the months leading up to the elections. On
 July 25 Centrist Congressman Otto Rolando Ruano and his driver
 were killed 55 miles from Guatemala City. The following month
 Centrist mayoral Candidate Celso Milagro Giron was killed in
 San Pedro Jocopilas, Quiche; he had become a candidate after
 the killing of the prior candidate, Solomon Blanco. More
 violence followed in San Pedro Jocopilas, including the
 violent death in September of Christian Democrat activist
 Sebastian Morales. In August the Christian Democrat Mayor of
 Cuyotenango, Suchitepequez, Roberto Vallejos, was shot near
 his home; he survived. The identity and motives of the
 killers in these cases remained unknown at year's end.
 In Januaiy armed men seized Salvadoran leftist Hector Oqueli
 and Guatemalan attorney Gilda Flores in the capital. Their
 bodies were found hours later near the Salvadoran border. The
 crime led to strong local, U.5. Government, and other
 international demands for a complete investigation- The
 Government condemned the killings-, but did little to conduct a
 thorough investigation. A report issued in Tune-concluded,
 with scant substantfation, that Salvadorans were responsible.
 There were no arrests an7 no further action in the- case as of
 year's end.
 The armed forces and Civil Defense Committees, or civil
 patrols, frequently threatened and sometimes killed human
 rights activists. The Runujel Junam Council of- Ethnic
 Communities (CERJ) is a rural-based human rights organization
 dedicated mainly to opposing service fn the civil patrols. On
 July 2 armed men in pickup trucks apparently seized-CERJ
 member Pedro Tiu Cac in Chajab. His body was found 2 days
 later, reportedly with signs of blows and bullet wounds. On
 March 19 Maria Mejia (whom CONAVIGUA, a local widows'
 association, also claims as a member) was killed in her home
 in Quiche, allegedly by two military commissioners in an
 attack that also badly wounded her husband, Pablo Lastro
 Tojin. Despite Tojin's identification of the men, the army
 denied that they were commissioners. Reportedly, a Quiche
 army officer promised the suspects quick freedom if they
 agreed to be arrested and brought before a judge. Arrested in
 May, both men went free in June for "lack of evidence." On
 April 10 masked gunmen killed CERJ activist Jose Vicente
 Garcia in front of his family; he previously reported to
 authorities that he had received death threats. Reliable
 information indicates that the killers, although not of the
 military, were shielded by army officers.
 In October the CERJ reported that an activist, Sebastian
 Velasquez Mejia, was kidnaped and murdered. After his body
 was found, the police issued a statement that claimed
 Velasquez had not been kidnaped and that he had died of an
 alcohol overdose. No reliable autopsy was performed on the
 victim. A foreign forensic team obtained permission to have
 his body exhumed for the purposes of identification, but the
 team was not allowed to perform an autopsy. The cause of
 death remained unknown at year's end. In December the Mutual
 Support Group (GAM) claimed that one of its members, Diego Ic
 Sui, was shot dead on December 8. His body, with three bullet
 wounds, was found near the main bus terminal of the capital.
 Police reported no leads.
 On March 17, nine people were seized near Malacatan (San
 Marcos) by armed men. The bodies of five later appeared:
 
 
 64
 GUATEMALA
 Teodoro Mejia, Arcadio Mejia, Efrain Ventura, Luis Ventura,
 and Joaquin Ortega. A survivor, a child, was also found.
 While information was inconclusive, local observers blamed the
 army.
 On September 11, Myrna Elizabeth Mack Chang, a Guatemalan
 academic researching issues affecting displaced persons in the
 highlands, was repeatedly stabbed and killed near her office
 in Guatemala City. The Mutual Support Group (GAM), other
 human rights organizations, and university groups denounced
 the killing as politically motivated. Initial indications
 were that the killing could have been the result of a robbery
 attempt since her purse was taken, but, given her research
 work on displaced persons, political motives could not be
 ruled out.
 In July guerrillas in San Rafael Petzal, Huehuetenango, shot
 and killed two unarmed men and wounded eight others
 participating in a civil defense patrol.- Many policemen in
 rural areas were killed during 1990 in ways strongly
 suggesting guerrilla involvement. In November persons
 suspected of being guerrillas kidnaped, tortured, and murdered
 two brothers, Cristobal and Damian Oron Cuc, near Santa Maria
 de Jesus, Sacatepequez. They belonged to a civil defense
 patrol.
 The security forces were probably involved in many vigilante
 killings of criminals or criminal suspects. The media
 reported frequent discoveries of bodies in or near major
 cities, particularly the capital, often with signs of torture
 or postmortem multilation. The criminal backgrounds of many
 of these victims suggests that the killers had access to
 police, court, and prison data.
 Security forces were also involved in the killings of other
 civilians. In June a longtime resident, U.S. citizen Michael
 Devine, was abducted, tortured, and executed near his home in
 Peten department. Subsequent information showed that army
 personnel participated in the killing. In September President
 Cerezo publicly acknowledged the possibility of security force
 involvement and promised a full investigation. The Human
 Rights Ombudsman also indicated he had information showing
 possible military involvement. In September the court in
 Flores, Peten, issued arrest warrants for eight men, including
 several soldiers, for suspicion of involvement in the murder.
 Six men, including five enlisted men, were arrested. Despite
 repeated requests by the United States for quick action,
 including the completion of the two outstanding arrest
 warrants and the formal questioning of former senior officers
 from the local base, no further steps were taken and the case
 stalled. As a result, in December the United States suspended
 military assistance to Guatemala.
 In 1990 there were credible reports that policemen and private
 security guards tortured and killed street children. Amnesty
 International (AI) issued a report in July detailing these
 abuses, and reported threats against witnesses and persons
 working with the street children. Four policemen were
 arrested for the murder of 13-year-old Nahaman Carmona Lopez,
 who was kicked to death; as the year ended, the four policemen
 were on trial. The Police were investigating several other
 reports of torture of street children, including an incident
 in which eight homeless teenagers were kidnaped and brutalized
 before being shot in the head.
 
 
 GUATEMALA
 In the early morning hours of December 2, a large group of
 residents of thetown of Santiago Atitlan gathered in front of
 the.local-army detachment tohprotest incidents of military
 harassment and violence against the townspeople. The soldiers
 of the detachment opened fired and killed 14 people, including
 2 children. The Ombudsman labeled the incident a "genocide"
 against indigenous people. The killings generated numerous
 expressions of condemnation, including from both presidential
 candidates, Jorge Serrano .and Jorge Carpio, and the Congress.
 By year's end-.the-local base had been closed. Two soldiers,
 including an officer, were arrested for having triggered the
 incident.
 The only case on record-in which:members of the security
 forces were convicted for serious human rights abuses was
 reversed in August when an appeals court found insufficient
 evidence" to uphold the 198a convictions of 6 policemen for
 the 1986 abductions and murders of two university-affiliated
 agronomists, Rene Leiva Cayax and Sanilo-Alvarado Mejia. The
 Government appealed the decision and the Director of Police
 said he would not accept the men back into the police force.
 As 1990 ended,'the court had not ruled on the appeal.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no certain figures for 1990 on the number of
 disappeare person.. According to agovernment report
 released early in 1990, authorities knew of 2,588
 disappearances from all causes during the year ending January
 1990. The report stated that the police'resolved 1,763 of
 those: 1,537 people were found safe, 35 were in hospitals,
 and 191 were dead. Of the remaining 825, police claimed that
 198 consisted of false reports and 206 were persons who had
 reappeared but had not been reported as such. The office of
 the Human Rights Ombudsman calculated that Guatemala suffered
 some 233 politically motivated disappearances during 1990.
 The Government failed to- solve any of these disappearances;
 the Ombudsman concluded that security forces were responsibile
 for the majority of them- The Ombudsman's figures and
 conclusions are credible.
 In February two disappearances in the capital drew much
 foreign and local attention, prompting a resolution by
 Guatemala's Congress calling for the victims' release and for
 authorities to prevent and resolve these kinds of incidents.
 Both cases ended, fortunately, in the release of the victims.
 On February 6, San Carlos University law student Armando Oscar
 Piedrasanta was taken by armed men, beaten, and abandoned
 along a highway early on the following day. The authors and
 motives were unknown; the assumption was that Piedrasanta was
 suspected of "subversive activities." He reportedly left
 Guatemala. On February 10, Dr. Carmen Angelica Valenzuela
 Argueta, a pediatrician, was abducted from her car in broad
 daylight in the capital by armed men. The kidnaping led to a
 strong public demand for her release. She was freed February
 18. No reason has ever been determined for her abduction.
 In August military commissioner Sergio Gomez was reportedly
 abducted by seven heavily armed guerrillas in olive green
 uniforms near the conflictive zone of Tajumulco, San Marcos, a
 stronghold of-the Armed Revolutionary Organization of the
 People (ORPA).
 Security forces may be responsible for the disappearances of
 several members of human rights groups. Luis Miguel Solis
 
 
 636
 GUATEMALA
 Pajarito, a member of a displaced persons organization, the
 National Commission on Displaced Guatemalans (CONDEG),
 disappeared May 3 in the capital. His wife, a member of GAM,
 charged that the military were responsible and that her
 husband was being held in one of the capital's military
 facilities. She filed writs of habeas corpus with no result.
 Samuel de la Cruz Gomez, reportedly a member of the Committee
 of Peasant Unity (CUC) as well as CERJ was kidnaped on July 12
 near Zacualpa, Quiche, apparently by an army patrol. A writ
 of habeas corpus was filed, but de la Cruz remained missing as
 of year's end. Four CERJ members who disappeared in April
 1989 in Suchitepequez have never been found and are presumed
 dead.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 During 1990 there continued to be clear evidence and credible
 reports of torture and other mistreatment leading to the
 deaths of persons detained extrajudicially by members of the
 security forces. There were credible accounts of physical
 torture and psychological abuse from persons who escaped from
 or were released by captors apparently linked to the security
 forces. Many bodies found throughout Guatemala bore signs of
 torture or postmortem mutilation. Torture, however, is not
 prima facie evidence that security forces were responsible for
 a crime; criminal gangs and others pursuing personal vendettas
 also use torture.
 There were no verified reports during the year of inhuman or
 cruel treatment of detainees in official police custody.
 There were, however, credible reports of the use of excessive
 force by police at the time of arrest and of abusive treatment
 by army, civil defense patrols, military commissioners, and
 police of persons in rural areas.
 The Human Rights Ombudsman acknowledged that civil patrols are
 responsible for human rights violations, such as death threats
 and possibly even murder (see Section l.a.). In October, in
 Chupol and Parraxtut, civil patrol members assaulted human
 rights monitors, civilians, and, in one instance, Deputy
 Ombudsman Alvarez (see Section 4.). Security forces in these
 areas appear to have instigated these incidents.
 No progress was made in the investigation of the reported
 kidnaping and torture on November 2-3, 1989, of U.S. citizen
 Sister Diana Ortiz. A special delegation from the United
 States visited Guatemala twice, in April and December, to
 press the Guatemalan Government to investigate the case.
 Although President Cerezo agreed to appoint a public
 commission to oversee the investigation, it never met.
 Information on which to pursue the case was limited to a sworn
 affidavit issued by Sister Ortiz in January. Due to the
 trauma she endured, Sister Ortiz was unable to provide
 additional information but indicated, through her counsel,
 that she would do so once she was more fully recovered.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 A court-issued arrest warrant is required unless a person is
 caught in the act of committing a crime. According to the
 Constitution, police may not hold a person for over 6 hours
 without bringing him before a judge. The law provides for
 bail, access to lawyers, and limits to 20 days the time anyone
 may be held for investigation, after which he must be formally
 
 
 637
 GUATEMALA
 charged with the commission of a crime or released.
 Authorities must produce detainees on request. Involuntary
 exile is not used.
 Despite these legal safeguards, there are frequent reports of
 arbitrary arrest or detention by the security forces. There
 were also credible reports of security force "safehouses" used
 to conduct illegal detentions, interrogations, and, at times,
 torture and murder. Writs of habeas corpus are ignored by
 those making illegal arrests.
 On August 17 the daily newspaper El Grafico, owned by National
 Centrist Union (UCN)Y presidential candidate Jorge Carpio,
 reported UCN activist Maximiliano Vasquez was arrested by a
 military Commissioner because of his political activities. In
 a letter the next day, the army spokesman denied the claim,
 stating Vasquez was arrested by police on criminal charges; a
 police source supported that- version.
 In September CERJ charged that 86 persons from in and around
 Amachel, QuIche, had been forcibly transported to, and were-
 being illegally held at, a military installation in Nebaj,
 Quiche. The Ombudsman and the-U.N.-appointed human rights
 representative traveled to Quiche ta investigate this
 allegatiorn. Theywere not able to confirm the allegation of
 mistreatment or illegal detention. It wa& never clear,.
 however, whether the-persons had moved there of their own free
 will. CERJ subsequently charged that a young woman and her
 child were forcibly removed fromNebaj by soldiers-. At year's
 end, this case had not been resolved.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for an independent judiciary
 comprised of a Court of Constitutionality, a Supreme Court,
 appeals courts, and several courts of special jurisdiction.
 Military courts have jurisdiction only over the army,
 including military commissioners. Civilian trials, are public;
 defendants have the right to be present'and to legal
 representation. Convictions are automatically reviewed by an
 appeals court. There were no political prisoners. However,
 despite some efforts at reform, in practice the judiciary
 remained troubled, susceptible to intimidation, and suffering
 corruption, low morale, and poor pay.
 A U.S.-funded model court program run by Harvard University
 ended and was not renewed. Those operating the program
 expressed frustration with the lack of political will on the
 part of the civilian authorities to reform the nation's court
 system and to undertake prosecutions of human rights
 offenders. On the more positive side, the Congress began
 consideration of a radical revision of the penal code designed
 to modernize the justice system and to make it more
 efficient. However, the proposed new code would still be
 bound by a constitutional restriction on trying military
 personnel in civilian courts, thereby limiting the ability of
 those courts to act against human rights abusers in uniform.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for the inviolability of home,
 correspondence, and private documents. While this provision
 was usually respected, there were exceptions. Although the
 Constitution provides for universal military service, the army
 
 
 GUATEMALA
 forcibly recruited soldiers by taking persons off the streets
 or from their homes without a court order.
 The Constitution requires that civil defense patrols be
 voluntary. The Human Rights Ombudsman, responding to a
 request from CERJ, found that while the decree creating the
 Civil Defense Committees and patrols was constitutional,
 forced participation existed in violation of both the decree
 and the Constitution. In March the chairmen of the
 congressional Human Rights and Defense Committees made the
 same argument. In most parts of the country, Self Defense
 Committees and patrols appear to be largely voluntary. As in
 past years, however, the degree of voluntarism in conflictive
 parts of Quiche and Huehuetenango is open to serious question;
 there are scattered reports of forced participation in small
 communities in Solola and Baja Verapaz departments. The army
 denies it pressures, threatens, or persecutes those who
 advocate against the Committees or who refuse to join them.
 There is, however, credible evidence that such persons have
 suffered serious abuses, including murder.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 The 30-year armed internal conflict continued during 1990.
 There were accusations of indiscriminate use of aircraft and
 artillery by the military on civilian targets. The office of
 the Human Rights Ombudsman looked into reports of a major
 aerial attack in late December 1989 on a small community in
 Quiche; a Deputy Ombudsman could find no evidence of bombing.
 Given the small, tightly controlled aerial and artillery
 assets, charges of "carpet" bombing, mass artillery barrages,
 and attacks by helicopter gunships generally do not appear to
 be credible. There was little reliable information in 1990 on
 the fate of captured guerrillas. Information from previous
 years, however, leads to the conclusion that such persons
 often faced torture and death at the hands of their military
 captors. There were some documented cases, however, of
 guerrillas who applied for and received amnesty and were well
 treated.
 The year began with increased guerrilla military activity,
 including attacks on the economic infrastructure, prompting
 the Human Rights Ombudsman to denounce the human rights
 violations of the guerrillas. There is reliable information
 that guerrillas targeted policemen for murder (see Section
 l.a.). In May guerrillas in Huehuetenango ambushed a civilian
 truck transporting sick and injured soldiers in civilian dress
 to a hospital; eight were killed. Guerrillas also killed
 children and other unarmed civilians in attacks on army
 patrols. In August there was a reliable report that a
 guerrilla-laid claymore mine killed two small girls in Quiche.
 On August 31, guerrillas in the Peten deparartment overran and
 destroyed a medical-dental compound operated by the longtime
 resident American Stoltzfuz missionary family. The compound
 was destroyed, medical supplies stolen, and the family held at
 gunpoint and threatened with death unless they left
 Guatemala. A press release from the guerrilla-controlled news
 agency CERIGUA claimed guerrillas carried out the attack in
 retaliation for the family's alleged support of the army,
 i.e., the missionaries had treated seriously wounded
 soldiers. One of the Americans suffered further harassment in
 the capital, apparently at the hands of guerrillas.
 
 
 GUATEMALA
 Despite promises made in the May 1990 peace talks in Madrid
 not to carry out actions which could interfere with the
 elections, guerrillas resumed attacks in September and there
 were credible reports of insurgents' efforts to prevent people
 from taking part in political activity. Guerrilla forces
 maintained tight control over several communities in northern
 Quiche, known as Communities of Resisting P6pulace (CPRs), in
 which they used forced labor and obligated people to join
 guerrilla militia units. Guerrillas used children as young as
 13 years of age in combat.
 In November during a forced village meeting organized by ORPA
 guerrillas in the town of Las Trojes, Amatitlan, the
 guerrillas gunned down a 14 year old child, Victor de Jesus
 Sanchez Hernandez.   Also in November, a claymore mine placed
 by the Guerrilla Army of the Poor (EGP) guerrillas killed Juan
 Luis de la Cruz and seriously injured his brother. In
 December ORPA guerrillas destroyed theMoca bridge in
 Suchitepequez, killing an innocent passer-by, Dr. Edwin
 Salvador Rios, and seriously wounding his driver. The Human
 Rights Ombudsman subsequently issued a report denouncing th3
 querrillas for human rights violations. In a-press
 conference, he also accused the guerrillas of engaging in
 death squad activity-
 During the year, a series of ground-breaking infozmaL taIks
 were held between guerrilla- representatfves and different
 sectors of Guatemalan society aimed at ending the 30-year
 internal conflict. These discussions were sponsored by the
 National ReconciTiation Commission and may lay the- basis for a
 permanent solution to the long conflict.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Includinq:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of expression, and
 during 19-90 there were no indications of officially ordered or
 sanctioned efforts to restrict it. Vocal critics of the
 Government, particularly in this election year, had widespread
 media access. A new daily, Siglo XXI, commenced publication
 and took a line generally critical of the Government, as did
 the other three major papers. Press releases, paid
 advertisements, dnd other antigovernment pronouncements by
 political parties, private sector groups, labor unions, human
 rights organizations, and guerrilla groups ran without
 official interference. Foreign films, television programs,
 books, magazines, and newspapers were widely available,
 limited only by cost.
 There continued to be self-censorship on certain topics.
 Journalists abandoned some themes or watered down conclusions
 rather than test the limits of tolerance of certain groups,
 particularly the security forces. There was no press
 discussion, for example, of corruption in the army, although
 civilian corruption was an electoral issue. Nevertheless,
 there was thorough coverage of charges by the U.S. Embassy
 that an active-duty military advisor to President Cerezo was
 involved in drug trafficking. The press, however, made no
 independent investigation of the case.
 In October two prominent journalists were shot in the
 capital. Victor Humberto Gonzalez Gamarra, owner of several
 radio stations and formerly active in leftist politics, was
 killed in the presence of his minor son by unknown gunmen.
 
 
 GUATEMALA
 Byron Barrera, vice-president of the left-of-center Guatemalan
 Press Association (APG), was shot and severely injured; his
 wife died in the attack. Barrera subsequently left
 Guatemala.
 The universities were relatively calm during 1990. There was
 no repetition of the 1989 kidnapings and murders of several
 students.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution recognizes the right of peaceful assembly and
 association. Parades, rallies, marches, forums, public
 debates, and seminars took place openly and freely throughout
 1990. Organizations require legal association status, a
 cumbersome and expensive procedure which works against
 organizations without good funding or legal counsel. As the
 year ended, for example, CERJ efforts to-become a registered
 organization had still not prospered after 18 months. The
 lack of legal association status, however, did not prevent a
 large number of associations, including CERJ and others with
 international ties, from operating and holding authorized
 rallies and marches.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion. Religious freedom is provided for
 in the Constitution and is respected in practice. While 70
 percent of the populace is nominally Roman Catholic, many
 Indians mix traditional and Catholic beliefs. A large number
 of other faiths operate freely in Guatemala: over 25 percent
 of the population adheres to a variety of Protestant
 denominations, many with international ties. As a rule,
 foreign priests and missionaries worked without official
 interference. Guatemala has small Mormon, Jewish, Baha'i,
 Buddhist, Jehovah's Witnesses, and Islamic communities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government did not restrict foreign travel during the
 year; critics traveled abroad freely and returned. The
 Government does not revoke citizenship for political reasons.
 Movement within Guatemala was generally unhindered except in
 areas of military-guerrilla conflict. The EGP continued to
 maintain tight control over several villages in northern
 Quiche and severely restricted the travel of residents with
 threats of violence and widespread use of land mines. The
 army also restricted movement in some areas.
 Small-scale repatriation of Guatemalan refugees from Mexico
 continued during 1990, with the return of some 750-1,000
 people. Many of the estimated 45,000 refugees still in camps
 in Mexico were awaiting expected changes in their status in
 Mexico as well as the outcome of the elections in Guatemala.
 Many have established roots in Mexico over the years and will
 probably not return. Many refugees also insist on the return
 of lands they considered theirs but to which, in many cases,
 they did not hold title. The Government welcomed those who
 returned, and efforts were made to settle them quickly. By
 year's end, the small Guatemalan refugee camp in Honduras had
 closed, with most of the refugees returning to Guatemala.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Guatemalans have the right to change their government by
 peaceful and democratic means. There is universal suffrage by
 secret ballot; voting age is 18. There are no property or
 literacy requirements. National elections were held on
 November 11 with 20 registered political parties fielding
 numerous presidential, congressional, and municipal
 candidates. A run-off election between the top two
 presidential candidates took place on January 6 with a
 peaceful transfer of power to another civilian government on
 January 14. Participation rates in the two rounds were 56 and
 45 percent, respectively. Candidate debates and congressional
 sessions were widely covered by the local media. Candidates
 had access to the media, and held'rallies and other public
 events without official hindrance. Hundreds of foreign
 observers and journalists monitored the Guatemalan elections
 and found them to be free, fair, and genuine.
 During the-meeting--in Madrid in May between guerrilla
 representatives and those of the legal political parties. both
 sides agreed to hold Constitutional Assembly eXections in
 1991. The new Constitutional Assembly would redraft the
 Constitution so as to allow guesr-illas- t participate in- the-
 political process.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government did not hinder international human rights
 groups visiting and? working in Guatemala- and senior officials
 met representatives of such organizations as Americas Watch,
 the Washington Office on Latin America, Amnesty International,
 the International Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights-, and a
 group looking into the case of Americbn citizen Diana Ortiz
 (see Section I.c.). Representatives of the U.N. and-the
 Organization of American States also-visited Guatemala. Some
 foreign human rights-related groups-Brigadas de GAM, Peace
 Brigades International, and Witnesses for Peace--set up
 permanent offices without official interference. In December
 Congress ratified an agreement signed in September 1989
 between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), allowing the ICRC to open
 an office in Guatemala and to operate throughout the country.
 The Government, however, proved sensitive to outside criticism
 of its human rights record, labeling it as political.
 President Cerezo asserted that U.S. Government criticism was
 driven by a desire "to pay back" Guatemala for its foreign
 policy independence.
 The President's Advisory Commission on Human Rights engaged in
 little activity and seemed more interested in efforts to
 defend the official record at the United Nations than in
 carrying out work in Guatemala.
 The office of the Human Rights Ombudsman, established under
 the Constitution, increased its activities during the year
 under its new head, Ramiro de Leon Carpio, who was appointed
 by Congress. The office established an investigations unit
 and undertook energetic educational campaigns among the public
 and the security forces. The office issued strong statements
 critical of the Government, security forces, and the
 
 
 642
 GUATEMALA
 guerillas. It also reported that it had information
 suggesting involvement by the military in the murder of U.S.
 citizen Michael Devine (see Section l.a.). Deputy Ombudsman
 Alvarez Guadamuz risked his life in March to save CERJ leader
 Amilcar Mendez from an attack by civil patrolmen in Parraxtut;
 Alvarez and Mendez were escorting returning families who fled
 Parraxtut in the wake of the Mejia killing (see Section 1.a.)
 when they were set upon. Mendez managed to flee but Alvarez
 was held and threatened with death. Some days later the
 patrol members apologized to Alvarez; no criminal charges were
 filed against the attackers. The families resumed living in
 Parraxtut, but reportedly not on a full-time basis. As of
 year's end, the office had not yet issued a long-awaited
 report on the 1988 El Aguacate Massacre. In December the
 office sponsored an unprecedented nationally televised human
 rights forum in which both presidential candidates
 participated.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 About one half of the population is culturally indigenous and
 the rest Ladino. Although having equal legal rights,
 indigenous people generally remained outside the national
 culture, language, and economy. Indigenous males continued to
 be much more likely than urban residents to be drafted into
 the army or forcibly recruited into guerrilla groups.
 Indigenous people suffered most of the combat casualties and
 major human rights abuses (see Sections l.a. and b.). There
 were a few indigenous people serving as army officers and in
 the Congress. There is widespread and pervasive social
 discrimination against the indigenous people.
 Women are very active in the nation's work force, particularly
 in agriculture, the growing textile industry, lower paying
 public sector jobs, and in small retail business. Many women
 held prominent political posts during the Cerezo
 administration. Despite legal protection, women faced
 discrimination in the job market. Jobs are often advertised
 on the basis of sex, with women generally selected for lower
 paying ones. There are no national organizations devoted to
 women's issues. One presidential candidate in the 1990
 election, Rene de Leon, selected a woman as his vice-
 presidential running-mate and another, Alfonso Cabrera, made
 *women's issues" a campaign theme.
 Violence against women, including domestic violence such as
 wife beating, remained common but generally received little
 attention from the police or press. Criminal sexual violence
 often went unreported by victims and did not receive a high
 priority from police; few cases of rape came before the
 judicial system.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have the right to join or form unions. About 8
 percent of the work force is organized. The low percentage is
 due in part to a civil code that has stringent requirements
 for organizations to meet in order to obtain legal status.
 While statutes set a limit of a few days for processing
 applications, delays of months or years are not unusual. Much
 of the public sector, however, is organized. Despite these
 hurdles, 29 new legal unions were formed in 1990, with 14 more
 
 
 648
 GUATEMALA
 approved and awaiting official notification. More than 25
 percent of all existing unions were approved under the Cerezo
 administration.
 Unions are required to have a minimum of 20 members, but
 craft unions of skilled workers from several companies are
 permitted. The Social Democratic-oriented confederation CUSG
 formed such a union among municipal workers. It had been
 common for employers to form several entities of less than 20
 workers, in the hope workers would have no possibility of
 organizing. In a victory for unions, a court ruled in 1990
 that an economic unit, Laboratorios Bonin, in the case under
 consideration, must be treated as a whole. The ruling was
 under appeal at year"s end.
 Union leaders must show they have no criminal record, work at
 the company being organized, and can read. They may serve
 only one term in a particular union office- but by rotating
 offices the same persons can stay on the board of directors-
 Although the labor code sets_ restrictions on political
 activity by union leaders, this reflects: provisions in earlier
 Coastitutions: The present Constitutioa provides for the
 right of political-participation for individuals and drops the
 prohibition for unions. Unions played a role in the last two
 elections, and no effort was made to penalize them for their
 activities. Union leaders were candidates- for Congress and
 actively took part in campaigning. One very prominent labor
 leader was elected to Congress with the UCN party, and two
 others are alternate congressmen-.
 A new labor code, drafted with the assistance of the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) experts, is under
 active consideration by the Labor Committee in Congress.
 Among other things, the new code would streamline the
 registration process by limiting the role of government
 officials to certifying that workers had not been coerced into
 joining a union.
 There is a "solidarity" movement which critics- charge Es
 promoted by management to rival genuine trade unions. The
 Labor Ministry, however, has refused tc register these
 organizations as unions.
 The Constitution provides for the right to strike, but
 procedures for a legal strike are cumbersome. Most strikes
 simply occur without permission, and, in. practice, the
 Ministry of Labor makes no effort to determine their
 legality. The first legal strikes in memory occurred in
 1990--all three involved small numbers of workers. A
 dissident group of former union leaders was able to obtain a
 strike vote by employees of the Social Security system, but
 the strike never took place. A major strike involved the
 occupation of the Cavisa Glass Factory, supposedly over the
 issue of job stability. Management refused to bargain until
 workers withdrew from the factory. After 5 months of legal
 wrangles, courts ordered police to remove the workers, some of
 whom claimed they were treated harshly. Management estimated
 $6 million in damages through neglect and pilferage; the
 factory has not yet reopened. The Cavisa union now exists in
 name only.
 Unions may form federations and confederations and join
 international bodies. CUSG is a participant in the
 Inter-American Regional Organization of Workers and through it
 
 
 GUATEMALA
 with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
 (ICFTU); the Social Christian Confederation, CGTG, is active
 in the Latin American Confederation of Workers, the regional
 organization of the World Confederation of Labor. No union
 openly maintains relations with the Communist-controlled World
 Federation Of Trade Unions (WFTU), but some labor leaders in
 exile, who claim to lead unions, represent them in WFTU
 activities.
 Although many local and international groups, including the
 ICFTU, charge that unionists have been "particular targets of
 death squads," available evidence does not establish a pattern
 of systematic attacks on unionists by government officials or
 persons connected with the security forces. Labor violence
 generally involves "thugs" used on an ad hoc basis by
 employers and others opposed to union activities. However,
 there were threats to and violence against unionists by
 members of the security forces.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers have the legal right to engage in organizing
 activities and to bargain collectively but very often are
 confronted by discriminatory antiunion actions by employers.
 Largely discredited labor courts are responsible for enforcing
 laws prohibiting such antiunion discrimination. An example of
 court ineffectiveness was the 1988 decision that Textiles
 Francisco Capuano y Hijos rehire 60 workers and pay back
 wages. Two years later, the courts were still debating the
 company's appeal of the $170 fine for disobeying the order.
 Thirty-six workers remain unemployed; the rest took other
 jobs, losing reemployment rights. Another case involves the
 El Pilar sugar mill in April. Workers were fired in March, 3
 days after obtaining a court injunction to enable them to form
 a union. One worker, Juan Tarach, was killed in a car
 accident and management took no action to allay suspicion that
 violence might be imminent. Eventually, all but two workers
 withdrew their legal claims. When an apparent attempt by
 unknown persons was made to kill the two hold-outs, they
 obtained asylum in Canada. Following a 5-month occupation of
 a brewery distribution center in Retalhuleu, a visiting judge
 ruled in August that the workers had engaged in a legal
 strike. The case, however, was overruled by the Court of
 Appeals, which ordered the presiding labor judge in Retalhuleu
 to reopen the case. The presiding judge then reportedly
 threatened to issue arrest warrants for those strikers asking
 for bail and payment for damages. The workers voted on August
 31 to end the strike and accept severance pay so the
 distributor could close.
 In 1990 the Ministry of Labor concluded a collective
 bargaining agreement with its union, the first such agreement
 for civil servants. The Government, in an election year
 maneuver, attempted to force collective bargaining on the
 private sector through provisions in an incentive pay law and
 in proposed legislation on salary policy; both met strong
 opposition from employers. Most salaries are set unilaterally
 by the employer through individual negotiations, or by minimum
 wage legislation.
 Labor laws and regulations apply uniformly throughout the
 country. The law which authorizes the establishment of export
 processing zones specifies that all labor code provisions will
 apply in them. In some instances there have been de facto
 
 
 645
 GUATEMALA
 restrictions on organizing by textile companies in the export
 sector caused by bureaucratic inefficiency in applying the
 relevant legal penalties.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution prohibits forced labor and the practice
 generally does not exist. There are allegations that civil
 defense patrols have violated the prohibition against forced
 labor. There were credible isolated instances of unpaid
 patrolmen being used for road work, building barracks, or
 cutting firewood. No systematic pattern of such abuse has
 been established.
 d. Minimum Age for the Employment of Children
 The Constitution bars employment of children under the age of
 14 years. In the industrial sector, where labor codes are
 relatively easy to enforce, child labor does not seem common.
 In the informal and agricultural sectors, however, such labor
 is common. It is not unusual to, see children help-ing run
 small-family businesses, begging, and washing or guarding
 cars. A local organization, Casa Alianza, estimates that
 5,000 street children live in city streets, doing whatever
 they can to survive. In rural areas, entire families work.
 The Labor Minister recognizes the difficulty in applying child
 labor laws when poor families need the incomes of all members
 to survive-
 e. Acceptable Conditfons of Work
 The workday is legally 8 hours and the workweek A4 hours, but
 a tradition of longer workdays remains. Third-country owners
 of textile plants reportedly paid minimum wages for a 12-hour
 day, violating both the Constitution and the labor code. The
 Ministry of Labor had complaints of beatings and firings of
 textile employees accused of doing less than the expected
 workload. Labor inspectors,' who report to the labor courts,
 were not diligent in enforcing the 8-hour day, in part because
 third-country textile plants move when they find conditions
 more attractive elsewhere.
 Traditional landowners filed legal challenges to an official
 decree raising rural wages from $0.70 to $2.00 per day. On
 October 1, a government decree set the minimum wage for
 construction workers at approximately $2.00 per day. This is
 the de facto wage in the urban sector. Although there are
 still more than 20 sectors with lower wages, including the
 export processing sector, it is expected that the effective
 wage will reach $2.00 for most productive sectors. Real wages
 have not kept pace with the sharp rise in inflation over the
 year.
