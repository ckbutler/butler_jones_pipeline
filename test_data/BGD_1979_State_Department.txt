 BANGLADESH
 Bangladesh is one of the world's most impoverished and
 densely populated countries. During the four-year rule of
 the late Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (Mujib) immediately following
 independence, the government was administered ineffectively,
 the economic situation deteriorated, and political
 assassination was widespread. President Ziaur Rahman (Zia)
 took power as a martial law administrator in November 1975,
 at the end of a series of coups. There has been a modest
 but broad-based improvement in the quality of public
 administration, the economy and public order. In a
 nationwide election on June 3, 1978, with a 53 percent voter
 turnout, Zia was elected President by a majority of 77
 percent. Parliamentary elections held on February 18, 1979
 produced a voter turn-out of 50 percent; President Zia's
 Bangladesh Nationalist Party won more than two-thirds of the
 seats, but opposition parties secured greater representation
 than in any previous legislative body in Bangladesh or East
 Pakistan.
 During the past year, the number of political prisoners has
 been further reduced. The February Parliamentary election-
 was generally free and fair, despite scattered allegations
 of fraud. Martial law was withdrawn on April 6 and the
 martial law courts were thereby terminated; their procedures
 had caused considerable human rights concern. Restrictions
 on press freedom were relaxed, and some long-banned
 newspapers resumed publication. On November 28, 1979 the
 Proclamation of Emergency, which was originally issued in
 1974, was revoked. As a result, the Emergency Powers Act of
 1975 and Emergency Powers Rules of 1975 are no longer in
 force, and the legal protection of fundamental rights
 guaranteed by the constitution has been restored.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 The Department of State has received no evidence of the use
 of torture in Bangladesh.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 It is a crime in Bangladesh to coerce or intimidate citizens
 or otherwise abuse police powers. Abuses that do occur are
 usually the undisciplined acts of individual policemen. The
 Bangladesh Government is attempting to improve discipline in
 the police force.
 The treatment of prisoners is generally harsh. Prisons are
 overcrowded. Released detainees have complained of
 inadequate nutrition and medical attention. These
 conditions result more from a lack of resources than from
 deliberate neglect. Prisoners are allowed family visits and
 access to attorneys of their choice. In 1978 the Government
 appointed a jail reform commission to study all aspects of
 jail administration. Following a study tour of prisons in a
 number of western, middle eastern and Asian countries, the
 commission submitted an interim report to the Government in
 October 1979, whose recommendations included more humane
 disciplinary measures within the prisons, renovations and
 improvement of physical facilities, and establishment of
 vocational training for prisoner rehabilitation. After
 receiving the report, the Home Minister stated that the
 government was in the process of implementing some of its
 recommendations and would implement others as funds became
 available and after Parliament passes necessary legislation.

 C.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The government of President Zia has released over 16,000
 prisoners since coming to power in 1975. During the first
 nine months of 1979, the press reported the freeing of 603
 prisoners. These releases coincided with significant
 national holidays. In addition to those amnesties, there
 was a steady trickle of releases through habeas corpus
 petitions to the courts. In December 1979, following the
 repeal of the Emergency Proclamation, over 800 prisoners who
 had been detained under the Emergency Powers Rules were
 released, bringing the year's total to over 1400.
 Preventive detention is still authorized under the Special
 Powers Act of 1974. Under that Act, a prisoner may not be
 held for more than 24 hours without the sanction of a
 district magistrate or for more than 30 days without central
 government approval. Detainees must be informed of the
 grounds for their detention, although the authorities are
 not required to reveal any facts or information they
 consider damaging to the public interest. Each detention
 case must be reviewed within 120 days by an advisory
 committee comprised of a senior civil servant and two
 persons "qualified to be judges of the Supreme Court." Each
 detainee also has the right to appear in person, but without
 benefit of counsel, before the advisory committee reviewing
 his case. A foodgrains supply ordinace, promulgated in July
 1979 in response to the drought-induced food shortages,
 authorizes preventive detention for up to three months; as
 of late 1979 few, if any, persons had been detained under
 that ordinance.
 Of the over 16,000 prisoners released since November 1975,
 more than 7000 were prisoners who had been held without
 trial. The Zia government has often described as "political
 prisoners" all such prisoners held without trial, despite
 the range of grounds for detention. Of the more than 1400
 prisoners released in 1979, nearly 1200 were detainees of
 this type, who had been held under the Emergency Powers
 Rules and the Special Powers Act.
 In addition to those detained under the emergency laws, some
 30-40 political figures are imprisoned as a result of
 convictions -- some but not all by martial law courts -- for
 a variety of offenses, ranging from such non-political
 crimes as corruption and illegal use of weapons up to and
 including conspiracy against the state.
 Amnesty International in its 1979 annual report estimated
 that "several thousand" political prisoners remain in
 custody in Bangladesh. To substantiate this estimate
 Amnesty cited a statement made in Parliament by the Home
 Minister in which he said that the number of prisoners
 convicted by martial law courts stood at 2,862 and that 339
 had been detained under the Emergency Act. He added,
 however, that many of these were no longer incarcerated. A
 large but undetermined number of those convicted under
 emergency legislation and martial law regulations were
 charged with common crimes such as murder, smuggling and
 corruption. The Department of State estimates that the
 total number of prisoners being held for political
 activities or views (including those convicted of ostensibly
 non-political offenses) to be no more than 50.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 When Martial Law was withdrawn in April 1979, Martial Law
 courts ceased to function. Most cases now come before the
 civil courts, although special tribunals established in 1974
 
 
 725
 to try offenses (principally those involving sabotage,
 subversion and blackmarketeering) under the Special Powers
 Act also continue to function. However, the judges in the
 special tribunals are drawn from the regular civil court
 system, defendants in the special tribunals enjoy the same
 rights as those under trial in the civil courts, and
 judgments of special tribunals can be appealed to the high
 court.
 In the civil courts, defendants are guaranteed fair and
 public trials, in accordance with Bangladesh's constitution.
 Defendants are entitled to counsel; lawyers have free access
 to defendants and generally experience no difficulty in
 holding consultations in private with defendants. There
 have been no known incidents of harassments of defense
 counsels by the government. Furthermore, defendants are
 made fully aware of the charges against them, and they and
 their lawyers may inform themselves of the evidence on which
 the charges are based.
 The courts are independent of the military. A 1975
 amendment to the constitution which transferred "control
 (including the power of posting, promotion and grant of
 leave) and discipline of persons employed in the judicial
 service and magistrates" from the Supreme Court to the
 President remains in effect. However, the courts generally
 operate free of intereference from the executive branch, and
 the high court in particular has challenged the executive in
 a number of cases.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 At.present Bangladeshi authorities do not engage in
 arbitrary invasion of the home. A judicial warrant is
 required before authorities may enter a home, and courts
 require that there be reasonable basis for suspicion of
 involvement in a crime issuing such a warrant.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 A major goal of the government of Bangladesh is to improve
 the lot of its predominantly rural masses, who are among the
 world's poorest people, with a strategy which emphasizes
 agriculture and rural development rather than urban,
 industrial growth. Through this .approach it also hopes to
 alleviate inequities in distribution of income. These
 inequities reflect the basic structure of Bangladesh
 society: a small urban middle class, a larger group of small
 farmers who earn a modest surplus, and a growing mass of
 marginal farmers and landless laborers. Increased food
 production is central to the government's rural development
 strategy. By making fertilizer, labor-intensive high-yield
 seeds, irrigation and credit more widely available, the
 government hopes to achieve self-sufficiency in foodgrains
 and to generate new labor-intensive growth sectors such as
 small rural industry. Extensive rural public works,
 including food-for-work programs, are another element of
 this policy. The government is also attempting to
 strengthen its family planning efforts. It has initiated a
 major program for a system of rural medics to overcome
 serious deficiencies in rural health care. In order to
 
 
 726
 raise Bangladesh's low (20-25 percent) literacy rate and
 adapt its education system to development needs, the
 government has announced its intention to provide universal
 primary education and to place greater emphasis on technical
 and vocational education. Education is free through sixth
 grade (although students must pay for books); a graduated
 scale of fees applies above that level.
 Despite the stated goal of helping Bangladesh's poor
 majority, the government's resources and administrative
 services are inadequate in the fields of education and
 health care. Serious inequities in the distribution of
 income and resources persist. Corruption, which is
 considered widespread in both the public and private
 sectors, has been difficult to check and continues to divert
 resources from economic development, relief programs, and
 social reform. The government has recently increased the
 powers of its Anti-Corruption Bureau, established an anti-
 corruption committee in each ministry and formed two high-
 level committees to examine causes and cures for corruption;
 the effectiveness of these efforts cannot yet be judged.
 Budget allocations for the industries, higher education,
 urban health, utilities and other services, as well as
 higher wages paid to organized labor and public employees,
 also confer disproportionate benefits on the urban classes.
 Farmers with relatively large holdings have more opportunities
 to obtain fertilizer, credit, water and other production
 inputs than do marginal farmers or sharecroppers. Finally,
 Bangladesh is vulnerable to natural disasters and it has
 often been necessary to divert scarce resources from on-
 going programs to disaster relief efforts.
 In addressing these inequities and the immense needs of the
 poor, the government rejects a policy of rapid
 redistr-lbution of existing wealth. Because of Bangladesh's
 limited resources, weak economic institutions and low
 productivity, there is little wealth to distribute.
 3.  -Respect for Civil Political Liberties:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Although these freedoms are guaranteed by Bangladesh's
 constitution, all except freedom of religion were curtailed
 to some extent during the period of Martial Law.
 Freedom of speech and assembly have been restored, despite
 certain restrictions on the right to form associations which
 remain on the books (see section 3.c below). As noted
 below, political parties and other groups now organize
 public meetings as and when they wish and freely express
 their views in these meetings.
 The government in January 1979 amended the Printing Presses
 and Publications Act, eliminating sections which had
 empowered the government to halt publication of newspapers
 which published material objectionable to the government.
 Following this action, some long-banned newspapers resumed
 publication, and criticism of the government became more
 outspoken in some periodicals. Nevertheless, laws remain on
 the books which give the government potentially broad powers
 to control the press. For instance, the Special Powers Act
 prohibits persons from making, printing, publishing,
 possessing or distributing "any document containing any
 prejudical report", where a "prejudical report" is defined
 as any report that will prejudice the safety of the public
 
 
 727
 or do damage to the state or its relations with any friendly
 power. Violations may be punished by confiscation,
 prohibition of further publication, fines or imprisonment.
 Pre-censorship of certain types of news articles is also
 provided for in the Special Powers Act. Although these
 powers have not been used in recent years, in view of their
 existence and the government's control of the allocation of
 newsprint and of substantial public sector advertising, most
 editors choose to exercise a degree of self-censorship.
 Nevertheless, the press enjoys greater freedom today than it
 has for some years, and many privately owned papers,.
 -including Bangladesh's leading daily, criticize the
 government freely.
 Although secularism has been eliminated from the
 Constitution as a state goal, there have been no indications
 of government infringement of the rights of minority
 religious communities. Senior government officials
 periodically reiterate publicly the government's
 determination to ensure equal treatment and respect for the
 rights of religious minorities.
 b.   Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Bangladeshis, including "Biharis" (non-Bengali, Urdu-
 speaking Muslim minority), are in general free to move
 within Bangladesh. However, again under the Special Powers
 Act, the government retains the right to restrict that
 movement through the declaration of "protected areas" from
 which all non-residents may be banned. All Bangladeshis who
 are regarded as loyal citizens are free to visit or emigrate
 abroad, subject to certain foreign exchange controls and, in
 the case of government servants, the granting of non-
 objection certificates. The Department of State is not
 aware of any arbitrary application of foreign exchange
 regulations to restrict freedom of travel.
 In 1977 Pakistan agreed to accept the remainder of those
 Biharis who had been cleared for "repatriation" to Pakistan
 under the Delhi Agreement of August 1973 but who had not
 been transferred when the airlift ended in 1974. The
 renewed repatriation program commenced in June 1979, and it
 was anticipated that over 9,000 Biharis would be transferred
 to Pakistan by the end of the year. Approximately 250,000
 more Biharis have applied for "repatriation", but Pakistan
 has not agreed to accept them. The Bangladesh Government
 regards these persons as having forfeited their citizenship
 by opting for "repatriation" to Pakistan but the Government
 of Pakistan does not acknowledge their claim to Pakistani
 citizenship.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Government on November 18, 1978 repealed the Political
 Parties Regulation, which had limited the number and
 activities of political parties, and on December 24, 1978
 lifted the application of martial law to politidal
 activities three months prior to the total withdrawal of
 martial law.
 The only current restriction explicitly directed at
 political parties is a 1978 ordinance which outlaws parties
 affiliated with, or funded by foreign parties or governments
 and parties which maintain secret or underground
 organizations. In addition, the Special Powers Act gives
 
 
 728
 the government authority to restrict the activities or
 prohibit the formation of "subversive" associations,
 whenever "there is a danger that the association may act in
 a manner, or be used for purposes, prejudicial to the
 maintenance of public order." This act also authorizes the
 government to prohibit the formation of "any association or
 union which, in the name of or on the basis of any religion,
 has for its object, or pursues, a political purpose."
 Neither the ordinance nor the Special Powers Act has been
 invoked against any party since the repeal of the political
 parties regulation.
 The holding of generally free and fair elections on February
 18, 1979 and the convening of Parliament on April 2 -- as
 well as the uninhibited debate which has characterized its
 sessions -- were practical demonstrations that freedom to
 participate in politics has been restored. There are no
 longer any banned parties. Nearly fifty parties are now
 active, and thirteen parties are represented in Parliament.
 Political parties hold rallies, processions and demonstrations
 without restrictions, and their leaders express themselves
 freely in public and in the press -- although access to
 state-owned radio and TV is more limited. Participation in
 the political system is open to all Bangladeshi citizens.
 The Constitution provides for equal rights for women in all
 spheres of public life. Thirty seats in Parliament are
 reserved for women, and women hold a few senior government
 positions, including two cabinet posts. President Zia
 frequently expresses his support for equal rights and
 opportunities for women in public speeches. In the
 traditional culture of Bangladesh, however, women are
 disadvantaged, play a secondary role to men, and are seldom
 seen in public.
 There is an active trade union movement in Bangladesh.
 Almost 100% of the large scale industrial sector is
 organized. In 1978, the rights to organize freely and
 bargain collectively, both of which had been abridged by the
 Industrial Relations (Regulations) Ordinance (IRRO) of 1975,
 were restored. One restriction on freedom to organize,
 however, continues in force. Under the IRRO, "outsiders" -
 those not employed by the shop being organized - may not
 hold any position in that shop's union. This restriction
 does not apply to positions in national labor fronts.
 Strikes are illegal under both the IRRO and the Emergency
 Powers Act, but are normally tolerated. A notable exception
 to this tolerant attitude was the 1979 jute mill strike in
 Chittagong, during which union leaders were jailed and union
 organizers dismissed from their jobs.
 The government has promised a new labor policy that will
 accord with ILO conventions. It is expected that the new
 policy will permit strikes in all industries except for such
 essential industries as power, water supply, banking and
 telecommunications. Amendments to the Workmen's Compensation
 Act to guarantee higher levels of compensation and in the
 Payment of Wages Act to ensure prompt payment of wages are
 also expected under the new labor policy. A minimum wage of
 400 taka ($27) per month in the nationalized sector and 225
 taka ($17) per month in the private sector is now guaranteed.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights:
 The Bangladesh Government has been willing to allow
 independent outside investigation of alleged human rights
 violations. Amnesty International representatives visited
 Bangladesh in 1977 and received some cooperation from the
 Government.
