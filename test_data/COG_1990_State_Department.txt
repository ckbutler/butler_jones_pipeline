 CONGO
 For most of 1990, the People's Republic of the Congo remained
 a single-party state ruled by the Marxist-modeled Congolese
 Workers Party. (PCT), with power concentrated in the hands of
 President Denis Sassou-Nguesso, his appointed Cabinet, and the
 PCT Political Bureau. Sassou has been Chief of State and Head
 of Government since 1979 and had sought to coopt and placate
 rival ethnic groups with political posts or economic
 concessions. Nevertheless, Northerners from the Cuvette
 region dominated important government institutions, including
 the army and security services. The National Assembly served
 primarily to give advice on and approve legislation rather
 than initiate it.
 The year witnessed potentially significant steps toward a more
 open society. In a series of announcements, President Sassou
 and the ruling Congolese Workers Party (PCT) outlined a
 framework for political liberalization, including abandonment
 of Marxist-Leninist principles, adoption of a multiparty
 system, and legislation guaranteeing most basic human rights
 and liberties. Popular pressure forced acceleration of the
 reform process, and during the latter half of the year the
 Sassou Government suffered an erosion of its traditional
 authority and revised its own reform timetable. On December
 27, the National Assembly approved legislation establishing a
 multiparty system. It is unclear, however, whether the
 liberalizing trends will continue, accelerate, or be reversed;
 and Congo entered 1991 with its human rights picture in flux.
 For most of the year 1990, the State Security Organization
 (DGSE) under the direction of the Presidency investigated and
 neutralized dissident activity that seriously threatened the
 State, the party, or the President. PCT "core groups" were in
 all ministries, labor organizations, and mass organizations
 with the stated goal, not consistently attained, of monitoring
 the activities of workers and neighbors. By the end of the
 year, military forces were no longer used for internal
 security purposes, which have'been turned over to a
 reorganized police.
 The economy is highly dependent on petroleum earnings.
 Declining oil prices since 1985 have forced the Government to
 cut budget expenditures, seek debt relief, and cooperate with
 international financial institutions in formulating a
 structural adjustment program. Long rhetorically hostile to
 capitalism, the Government never forbade private property and
 enterprise. In July 1989, the PCT openly embraced an economic
 policy centered upon private sector initiative, foreign
 investment, and liberalization of markets. Congo's economic
 difficulties have been a major force behind political reform
 efforts.
 Despite the unprecedented changes, human rights in Congo
 remained circumscribed in 1990. Violations included arbitrary
 arrest and mistreatment and torture of detainees in criminal
 cases. There were also restrictions on the freedoms of
 speech, press, association, and assembly, as well as worker
 rights and the right to equal protection for women.
 Generally, however, Congo enjoyed a much more open atmosphere
 for the discussion of human rights issues in 1990. Tangible
 progress came with the abolition of restrictions on foreign
 travel, the creation of independent human rights groups, as
 well as the cessation of political arrests, the release of
 detainees, and grant of amnesty for political offenses.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 The death of Auxence Ickonga in January remained a subject of
 speculation throughout 1990. Appointed in late 1989 to a post
 charged with investigating government corruption, the official
 cause of Ickonga's death was heart failure, but circumstantial
 evidence suggested poisoning. No autopsy was allowed by the
 Government.
 In October, in the towns of Sibiti and Loubomo, government
 forces used excessive force to quell student demonstrations
 which had turned violent, resulting in the death of several
 persons. The students were demonstrating for a more rapid
 move toward democracy and increased support for education.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no cases of disappearance for political motives.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment.
 Detainees and suspects are regularly beaten in the course of
 interrogation at police stations and state security centers.
 The practice continues both because of official indifference
 and the poor training of the police in the rights and proper
 treatment of suspects. Local police do not hesitate to use
 truncheons to control crowds in public areas, notably train
 stations and the port of Brazzaville. The police also
 sometimes allow thieves to be beaten by the public when they
 are caught in the act of stealing. It is likely that in
 recent years torture was used to extract information from
 political detainees (who were normally held incommunicado).
 All political detainees, however, were freed on August 15, and
 there have been no subsequent reports of further political
 detentions. There have been no public admissions,
 investigations, or trials of officials for past abuses.
 Prison conditions are, in general, extremely poor. The
 country's three large prisons, all built during the colonial
 era, are inadequate to house humanely Congo's prison
 population. Female prisoners have frequently been sexually
 assaulted and in some cases given birth in prison. Food and
 proper medical attention is often unavailable to inmates.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile .
 In the past, despite constitutional guarantees to the
 contrary, arbitrary arrest and detention often took place.
 The Code of Penal Procedure requires that a detainee be
 brought before a judge within 3 days and that a prisoner must
 be either charged or released within 6 months. However,
 criminal justice officials did not regularly respect this law,
 and authorities were legally exempt from following these
 procedures in cases involving "state security."
 Although in the past, suspects of political crimes were often
 not formally charged or given access to a lawyer, their place
 of detention was generally known, and their families were
 usually, though not always, allowed to visit them in
 
 
 87
 CONGO
 detention. Such detainees might be kept for any length of
 time without trial or formal charge. The judicial processes
 for those suspected of common crimes have been similarly
 irregular. The time between arrest and trial varies
 enormously from a few weeks to several years, depending on the
 seriousness of the case and the social station of the person
 arrested. There is a system of bail, but it also functions
 irregularly and with arbitrary interference. These abuses
 occur because of both official indifference and insufficient
 resources to employ sufficient judicial personnel.
 On August 15, the Government announced the release and pardon
 of all political detainees. The exact number held at that
 time was unknown, but various lawyers, jurists, and public
 officials estimated the number at between 20 and 50 (a
 moderate decrease from the numbers held over the past several
 years). Amnesty International (AI) reported that some 26
 dissidents were still being held in May 1990 after their
 arrest in July 1987 for alleged participation in the abortive
 Anga coup. Several in this group were army officers
 (including former President Yhombi-Opango), while others were
 civilians belonging to rival ethnic groups. The Government
 claimed the number had been reduced to 14 by the summer, and
 all were released in August. In December the National
 Assembly passed an amnesty for all offenses against state
 security, including those who had not been formally brought to
 trial.
 In July the Government arrested without warrants Celestine
 Nkoua (a former journalist and bookstore owner) and Clement
 Mierassa (a former PCT Central Committee member) for alleged
 conspiracy against the State. They had been signatories of an
 "open letter" to President Sassou calling for more rapid
 political reforms. Neither person was mistreated in
 detention, and both were freed on August 15.
 The Government has never used forced exile as an instrument of
 political control, and it invited voluntary exiles in France
 to return home in the wake of the July announcements on a
 multiparty system.
 e. Denial of a Fair Public Trial
 The Congolese legal system is primarily based on the
 Napoleonic Code but has also been influenced by the "people's
 justice" of the Marxist-Leninist tradition. The regular
 courts modeled on the French judiciary are neither fully
 independent nor a mere instrument of executive power. The
 Supreme Court is subject to considerable executive control,
 while the ordinary courts carry out justice with only
 occasional political interference. In addition, there exists
 a special Revolutionary Court of Justice composed of
 presidentially selected political appointees which handles
 political crimes. The Government has, however, tried no cases
 in this forum since 1986.
 Within the limits of the system's scarce resources, the
 functioning of the criminal justice system is relatively fair
 in nonpolitical cases. Defendants have the right to be
 present, to have a lawyer at public expense in serious cases,
 to confront witnesses and to present evidence, and they enjoy
 the presumption of innocence. Following French practice,
 judges rather than juries sit in judgment of accused
 criminals. There is a right to appeal, and higher courts
 sometimes overturn the decisions of lower courts. One
 
 
 CONGO
 concession to "popular justice" is the constitutional
 provision that nonprofessional judges may be elected to serve
 on lower courts, subject to party approval. According to the
 law, any citizen may become a judge but may adjudicate
 administrative cases only in collaboration with trained judges.
 Congo's traditional courts still handle many local disputes,
 e.g., property, and operate in urban as well as rural areas.
 Many domestic disputes are also adjudicated in traditional
 ways in the context of the extended family.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondance
 The Government rarely interferes with the private lives of
 citizens who are not suspected of activity that implies
 opposition to the Government. It maintains, however, a
 surveillance apparatus, including a network of informers, to
 collect information on those suspected of antigovernment
 activity. In investigating such activity, the Government does
 not hesitate to violate rights of privacy or home or to
 intercept written correspondence or telephone conversations.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.
 The year witnessed considerably greater official tolerance of
 free speech, the exercise of which is constitutionally
 guaranteed but which has been limited in practice. In the
 past, the Government had allowed criticism of policies and
 programs judged not to be politically sensitive (generally
 economic and international issues). It has been less tolerant
 of public challenges to its domestic political authority,
 allowing ordinary citizens to air their opinions, but
 detaining prominent public figures for speaking out publicly
 against government policies.- Since summer, however, Congolese
 citizens have increasingly tested the limits of official
 tolerance for political comment.
 The State owns and operates all of the country's general
 circulation media except for one Catholic newspaper, La
 Semaine Africaine. Broadcasts on Congo's several radio
 stations and one television channel endorse government
 policies, although limited coverage of opposing views is
 allowed. Radio and television have begun to broadcast more
 complete coverage of domestic developments, including the
 activities of government opponents. All published articles
 are reviewed by state censors, who in the past rejected
 articles critical of the Government. Journalists have been
 harassed or imprisoned for articles critical of the Government
 and have had to exercise self-censorship. Over the past year,
 however, the range of acceptable criticism has steadily
 broadened, and since midsummer it has included an increasing
 range of controversial political issues. La Semaine
 Africaine, whose editor has been jailed in the past, has since
 August published several outspoken issues without subsequent
 incident. Mimeographed tracts are a favored mode for
 political expression, and they increased in circulation in the
 latter half of 1990; open distribution of such tracts,
 however, was not permitted.
 Western news clips especially of international events, are
 often used on Congolese television   Foreign newspapers,
 especially from France. are widely available, and foreign
 
 
 CONGO
 journalists generally travel freely if they procure the proper
 authorizations (which are usually granted). In the past,
 however, issues of foreign publications carrying specific
 articles critical of the Government have been prevented from
 sale (and sometimes withdrawn from the mails), and foreign
 journalists have been expelled for examining sensitive topics
 too closely. There were no reported incidents of this nature
 during the latter half of 1990.
 Primary and secondary education in Congo, a state monopoly
 which long emphasized the tenets of "scientific socialism",
 enjoyed a measured liberalization in 1990. The Government now
 permits private schools at all levels, and it introduced
 curriculum changes in state schools, e.g., in addition to
 Marxism, other political-economic approaches can now be
 seriously studied. Congolese university teachers exercise
 academic freedom in their classrooms, unimpeded by either the
 Government or party youth organizations. Unrest in Congolese
 schools in 1990 centered upon employment issues.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.
 Private associations must receive official approval and-hold a
 public general assembly stating their aims and rules, after
 which they may meet freely without permits. Such approvals
 have traditionally been granted unless the group had a serious
 potential to embarrass or threaten the Government. In April
 the Government abruptly canceled thezscheduled general
 assembly of a new human rights organization, apparently
 concerned it might become a threat, but then 4 months later it
 granted permission for the meeting to take place.
 Nonrecognized groups may be harassed, and their meetings
 subject to dispersal at the whim of the Government and police,
 but such intervention became increasingly rare as the year
 progressed.
 Nascent political groups began after midyear to meet in
 private homes without permission, and political parties in
 addition to the PCT were authorized to begin activities in
 January 1991. There were no large public political gatherings
 in 1990. The Government is actively encouraging the creation
 of associations. Many Congolese professional organizations
 are affiliated with international umbrella organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed by law, but the Government
 is officially atheist, and there are serious infringements on
 religious rights. Religious groups must have the same
 official permission to function as any other association.
 Under a 1978 law which recognized only those sects which were
 judged to exercise a social function, members of only seven
 denominations had official permission to assemble and worship
 publicly in 1990: Evangelicals (Protestant), Catholics, The
 Salvation Army, Muslims, Kibangouists, Japanese Shinto
 Tenrikyo, and the Church of Zepherin Lassy. Representatives
 of the first four form a religious council which the
 Government consults as a body it regards as representative of
 religious opinion. Religious groups which, in the
 Government's view, contain tenets that reject temporal
 authority, such as the Jehovah's Witnesses, are specifically
 banned. Other groups worship without official authorization,
 though they have occasionally been disrupted by local
 authorities. A changing government view of religious
 self-expression was evidenced by the allocation in 1989 of
 
 
 90
 CONGO
 National Assembly seats for religious representatives and by
 the high visibility of the symbols of several religious
 groups, including unrecognized organizations, displayed during
 the August 1990 National Day parade
 The Catholic Church, the largest single religious community,
 maintains a seminary for the training of its clergy and has
 missions throughout the country. Foreign missionaries from
 recognized churches are allowed to work in Congo, but those of
 other faiths are not. The recognized churches may maintain
 links with their international structures and some do so.
 There is no evidence that adherence to any faith, officially
 recognized or not, causes a disadvantage to the adherent in
 any secular, civil function.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government exercises limited control over the internal
 movement of its citizens through highway checkpoints outside
 the major towns. Citizens are free to change their place of
 work or residence as they wish. In July the Government
 abolished internal travel visas and eliminated the
 requirements that citizens obtain exit visas to leave the
 country and surrender their passports after they return.
 There are no known cases of Congolese being refused the right
 to return to Congo or of Congolese being denied citizenship.
 Congo hosts several hundred refugees from Burundi, the Central
 African Republic, Chad, and Zaire; and during 1990 there was a
 new influx of refugees from Rwanda and South Africa.
 Political refugees (especially in the case of Zairians) are
 often indistinguishable from those foreigners in Congo engaged
 in economic pursuits. Refugees are subject to surveillance
 and occasional harassment and expulsion, but there have been
 no widespread or systematic forced repatriations, and refugees
 are not generally expelled unless they break Congolese laws.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government.
 Under the 1979 Constitution, the Congolese people did not
 enjoy the right to change their government. The President ef
 the Central Committee of the Congolese Workers Party (PCT) was
 automatically President of the Republic. After coming to
 power in a surprise Central Committee maneuver in 1979, Denis
 Sassou-Nguesso was reelected by regular party congresses in
 1984 and 1989. The President was the most powerful single
 person in government, and his power was only somewhat limited
 by the need to maintain support in the PCT's political bureau
 and Central Committee. The Congolese military has
 traditionally been subservient to the President and indirectly
 to the party, and its officers are integrated into key
 government and party positions. The military, however,
 remained neutral toward internal political developments during
 the year, and members were forbidden to engage in political
 activities after January 1, 1991. The military leadership is
 drawn largely from the same northern ethnic groups as the
 President, but most of the rank and file hail from the south.
 From 1968 through 1990, meaningful participation in government
 was possible only by joining the PCT, the "supreme social and
 political organization" according to the 1979 Constitution.
 Despite expansion over the past few years, its membership is
 less than 13,000 (out of a population of some 2 million). A
 
 
 91
 CONGO
 relatively small part of the PCT made most major decisions.
 In 1990 the PCT began a managed transition to a multiparty
 system. In July, the Central Committee advocated expanded
 party membership and multipartyism, and in September it
 announced that competing political parties will be legalized
 effective January 1991. Over 50 new parties were registered
 by December. The Government in September also sought to meet
 the growing call for rapid political change by promising that
 a transition government headed by a prime minister would be
 named and in place by January 1991 and that a conference of
 parties to tackle wholesale political changes will be held in
 May. In December, in response to continuing popular pressure,
 the Government announced that a national conference would meet
 beginning February 25, 1991.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government's attitude toward human rights organizations
 moderated considerably in 1990. Congo previously had no
 domestic human rights organizations, but three such groups
 received association status in 1990. All have criticized
 aspects of the Goverment's human rights practices. The
 Congolese Association of Women Lawyers, headed by a female
 magistrate and law professor, addresses a wide range of legal
 issues; one of its commissions deals with human rights.
 The National Committee on Human Rights, is headed by Dr.
 Norbert Lamini, who serves as head of the Human Rights
 Department of the Congolese National Commission for UNESCO.
 Its some 200 members are primarily intellectuals holding
 positions in law, journalism, the legal profession, or the
 middle ranks of the civil service. The Committee's declared
 goals include the development and exchange of information on
 human rights, the elimination of all forms of discrimination,
 and the defense of individual rights within Congolese society.
 The Congolese Human Rights League was conceived in July by
 prominent Congolese attorney Martin Mberi. It is pledged to
 fight for women's and youth's rights, as well as the end of
 arbitrary detention, torture, and the death penalty. Mberi
 has also advocated a multiparty system and independence for
 the judiciary and trade unions, and he is considered likely to
 be a contender for political office under the new system.
 The Government traditionally has been uncooperative when faced
 with human rights inquiries and hostile to investigations by
 international human rights organizations. It has expelled
 foreign journalists for investigating human rights issues. At
 year's end, it remained unclear, the extent to which the
 Government in the future would tolerate vigorous investigation
 and criticism of its own human rights policies from
 international and domestic groups.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, and Social Status
 The Constitution provides for equal treatment regardless of
 race, sex, religion, language, or social status, and most
 discrimination in these areas is social rather than official.
 However, the Government's degree of tolerance or intolerance
 of various social practices that may violate human rights
 varies greatly.
 
 
 CONGO
 Northerners exert disproportionate influence in politics and
 the security forces. The only other important ethnic
 distinctions are between Congo's various Bantu peoples and the
 northern Pygmies who number about 7,000, or less than 1
 percent of the population. Bantu villagers occasionally
 harass the Pygmies. Government policy calls for their
 integration into the economy and society, and a roundtable on
 the problem was held in Brazzaville in April. Knowledge of
 French, the official language, is essential for social and
 political advancement, but none of Congo's various language
 groups are otherwise specifically favored or disfavored.
 Women have the same legal rights as men in commerce, politics,
 and society, and they are often the chief decisionmakers among
 some ethnic groups. A few women have attained high official
 status in the country. There is, however, a large disparity
 between the salaries of men and women, and women are often
 relegated to a secondary role both in the modern sectors of
 society and in rural areas. Polygamy is legal and widely
 practiced. The husband, father, or other male head of family
 has considerable legal or actual control over the activities
 of female family members, though this control is often
 moderated by the influence of the extended family.
 Anecdotal evidence suggests that violence against women is not
 widespread in Congo, but there are no studies or statistics
 available. Abortion at state hospitals is illegal, though
 many exceptions are granted. Family violence against women is
 generally handled in the context of the extended family rather
 than in the formal judicial system. Female circumcision is
 not practiced among the Congolese but can be found among West
 Africans resident in Brazzaville or Pointe Noire. The
 Government is ahead of societal norms in its advocacy of
 women's rights, but it has not addressed the issue of violence
 against women. The PCT women's organization has a role in
 educating the public on women's rights, and the new human
 rights organizations have women's sections.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The status of worker rights was in radical transition during
 1990 as the Congolese Trade Union Confederation (CSC) became
 one of the main focal points of political change in Congo.
 The Labor Code adopted in 1975 affirms the right of workers to
 associate. In practice, however, Congolese labor unions have
 been grouped together under the umbrella of the CSC, an
 official state institution under party control and outside of
 which no independent unions were permitted.
 The CSC has had a legal right to strike but never- exercised it
 until July. Wildcat strikes have always occurred with
 relative impunity. In 1990 the CSC spearheaded the drive for
 political reform outside the PCT framework and used strike
 actioin for this purpose. In July the ruling PCT forced the
 CSC to reimpose authority over the Post and Telecommunications
 Workers' Union (FESPOSTEL) which had decided to withdraw from
 the CSC the previous day. The party later postponed the
 imminent scheduled meeting of the CSC congress to September.
 During the September meeting, the possibility that the CSC
 would vote resolutions calling for secret ballots in union
 elections, independence from PCT control, multiple parties,
 and a national convention to discuss political reform led the
 PCT Political Bureau peremptorily to dismiss the congress.
 
 
 93
 CONGO
 The CSC subsequently called a fuccessful 3-day general strike
 forcing the party to reconvene the congress which then elected
 its leaders by secret ballot and passed all the feared
 resolutions. Subsequently, the CSC led a series of strikes
 aimed ostensibly to secure economic gains for its members, but
 which in practice were significant in undermining the
 authority of the Government. Strikes in Brazzaville and
 Pointe Noire practically paralyzed the Government in the fall.
 In 1990 the CSC remained affiliated with the Communist-
 controlled World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) and the
 Organization of African Trade Union Unity.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 At its July meeting the PCT Central Committee abolished the
 "determinant trilogy," which placed representatives of the
 CSC, party, and government on the management boards of all
 ministries and state-owned enterprises and served as Congo's
 form of collective bargaining. The National Assembly repealed
 the appropriate legislation in December. Henceforward, the
 workers' interests will be furthered by the unions alone. The
 CSC has in the past bargained with other state institutions on
 behalf of the workers but without their participation. CSC
 unions have sometimes persuaded the Government to grant
 workers increased wages or benefits. There are no export
 processing zones, and Congolese labor law and practice are
 uniform throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There were no reports of forced or compulsory labor which is
 legally prohibited.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment is 18 years (17 for
 apprentices). Enforcment of child labor laws is vested in the
 Ministry of Labor with respect to government enterprises and
 other major employers, but there is little enforcement outside
 the modern wage sector, especially in small family enterprises
 or family farms in the large subsistence agricultural sector.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The legal minimum monthly wage is $100 for all urban workers
 except domestics, for whom the monthly wage is $86. Outside
 the Government, large corporations, and foreign enterprises,
 these minimums are often ignored. The minimum wage does not
 provide a decent standard of living for a worker and his
 family. Minimum wage earners and many others in the informal
 sector are dependent upon the extended family (including other
 salaried family members), and some subsistence farming (in
 which most of the rural population is still engaged). The
 Labor Code mandates working conditions which include a 40-hour
 workweek (some job categories excepted), at least 1 day of
 rest per week, family and medical benefits, and severance
 pay. In practice, exceptions are made (for example, paying
 the regular wage for overtime in certain categories of private
 sector nonindustrial employment). There is a code of
 occupational safety and health, although it, too, is not
 rigorously enforced.
