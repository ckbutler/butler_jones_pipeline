 GABON
 Gabon has.a single-party political system in which effective
 political power is concentrated in the presidency. That
 office has been held since 1967 by President Omar Bongo, who
 is also head of the party, A March 1983,amendment to the
 party constitution restricts candidacy in future presidential
 elections to the "President-Founder of the Democratic Party of
 Gabon," thus reserving presidential candidacy for President
 Bongo.. He was reelected President on November 9, 1986. In
 practice, presidential power is limited by the complexity of
 the governmental structure and the diffusion of power through
 45 cabinet-level officials led by a prime minister. A
 120-member National Assembly is elected from slates chosen by
 the single party. and meets regularly, but it has little real
 power-...
 Although still a developing country, Gabon has one of the
 highest per capita incomes (about.$3.,000 in 1987) in
 sub-Saharan Africa due to its significant petroleum and
 mineral resources and its small population. While income
 distribution is skewed in favor of the modern urban sector as
 opposed to the traditional agricultural sector, most Gabonese
 have benefited in some measure from the country's strong
 economy.. Nevertheless, the drop.,in world oil prices beginning
 in late 1985 has led to a sharp contraction in the economy
 which will likely continue in.1968. In general, economic
 performance has benefited from longstanding government
 policies supporting private enterprise and encouraging foteign
 investment-,      .
 Ther-ywas, no basic ,change in the human irights .situation in
 1987. The country's 1961 Constitutlon .guarantees protection

 Section 1 Respect.for. the. Integrity-of the Person,.Including
 -  Freedom from: .                             -
 a. Political Killing
 There were.no known political killings or summary executions.
 b., Disappearance
 There-were. n knowncases of abductions-or hostage-taking by
 governmenl r.any- other groups. The-authorities-'are sometimes
 slow to advise the families.of accused crim-inals or'detainees
 who are arrested,-.bVt there has been to-evidence of attempts
 to suppress news.of an arrest.           .
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 In past years:the political opposition group, ;the Movement for
 National Recovery (MORENA), based in Paris, alleged that
 
 
 108
 GABON
 several people detained in the Libreville prison on political
 charges were mistreated or kept in degrading conditions.
 However, family members reported no serious mistreatment, and
 these allegations have not been repeated in the last several
 years. Police are believed to be rough but not brutal in
 their treatment of suspected criminals. Prison conditions are
 harsh.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 In Gabon, "acts against the security of the State" and
 "actions against the Chief of State," which can include
 advocating a multiparty system, are punishable crimes. There
 were no reports in 1987 of detention without trial of persons
 accused of violations of criminal law. Gabonese law, amended
 in September 1983 and ratified by the National Assembly early
 in 1984, provides guarantees against arbitrary detention
 according to clearly articulated judicial procedure which is
 observed in practice. Previously, there was no legal
 protection against arbitrary detention.
 Forced labor is not used as a means of political coercion or
 racial or social discrimination. Some prison sentences for
 serious crimes include hard labor as part of the sentence.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The legal system, based upon French law, customary law, and
 the 1961 Constitution, gives the President a powerful role and
 functions fairly effectively. The right to a fair public
 trial is guaranteed by the Constitution and has generally been
 respected in practice in criminal cases. In
 security/political cases, however, there has been more
 controversy and inconsistency. A 1982 trial of 29 alleged
 members of MORENA took place in public with representatives of
 the international press and Amnesty International present,
 while a 1983 trial of four political dissidents took place in
 secret. The charges leveled against the accused were
 basically the same in both cases, namely, printing and
 distributing antigovernment tracts and encouraging the
 Government of France to use its influence in Gabon to bring
 about a multiparty political system. No known political
 prisoners are currently being held. All those convicted in
 the 1982 trial were granted full pardons by President Bongo on
 June 19, 1986. In 1987 President Bongo continued the practice
 of commuting prison sentences on New Year's day for
 well-behaved first offenders who were not convicted of first
 degree murder or armed robbery. Life terms were reduced to 20
 years, and most other terms were cut in half.
 The Gabonese court system is modeled on the French judicial
 system. Trial courts hear questions of fact and law in civil,
 commercial, social, criminal, and administrative cases. A
 second level of appeals courts is divided into two general
 appellate courts, with a separate appeals court for criminal
 cases. Gabon's highest judicial body, the Supreme Court, is
 divided into four chambers. There are also three exceptional
 courts: a military tribunal which handles all military
 offenses, a state security court, and a special criminal court
 which deals with fraud and embezzlement of public funds by
 officials.
 The judiciary is implicitly susceptible to executive
 influence, since Gabon's Constitution gives the President the
 authority to appoint, transfer, and dismiss judicial officials.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The various police and security units monitor alleged dissident
 political activity, including dissident telephone
 conversations, but interference in the daily life of the
 populace is relat-ively rare.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There are limits on these rights in Gabon. No direct public
 criticism of President Bongo is permitted, and no advocacy of a'
 multiparty political system by the media or individuals is
 tolerated. The country's single daily newspaper, which is
 government owned, regularly prints columns attacking alleged
 inefficiency or corruption in various ï¿½overnment offices.. One
 leading journalist was fired in October 1987 when a scathing
 column reportedly hit too close to home for some senior
 government officials. Foreign magazines and newspapers, which
 sometimes criticize the President, notably French publications
 and magazines printed elsewhere in Africa, are seized
 occasioqally by the police, and a few publications are banned.
 Journalists'are considered to be state employees and are
 expected to expound on themes as directed by the Government.
 The'pol7icie& ofe the Government are occasionally debated in
 public forums. The President sometimes holds press conferences,
 and his ministers have submitted to'lively direct questioning
 on televisi6n on a broad range'bf"domestic policy issues such
 as education, public housing, and transportation.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political activity outside the Democratic Party of Gabon is
 illegal. -he Government does not interfere in the affairs of
 nonpolitical organizations.. In some sectors, for example,
 sports clubs And social.,service organizations ha-'e ,ben formed.
 Labor unions may'organize but must be affiliated with'the
 goyernment-sponsored Labor Confederation of Gabon (COSYGA),
 which is cohsidered a specialized oigari of the Democratic Party
 of Gabon and,the" sole labor federation. 'The Labor Code (1978)
 and'theGeneral Coiveneion of. Labor (1982) govern general  -
 wowkin9condiions and benefits for all sectors. Unions in
 each.sectornegotiate with management over specific pay scales,
 woyking conditions, and benefits applicable to tbeir industry.
 Representatives of libor, management, and government meet
 annually to agree onothe.miAimnum wage, which is determined
 within guidelines pro'Vided by the Government. Under Gabonese
 law, all strikes are illegal which occur before remedies
 prescribed under the Labor Code'have been exhausted. No
 strikes were' reported in 1987, although in previous years
 workers have organized strikes or job actions over wages and
 working conditions. ,The Labor Confederation of Gabon is a
 member6f" the Organization 'of African Trade Union Unity.
 It is estimated that over half of Gabon's 90,000 salaried
 private sector workers are unionized. -Government employees are
 not permitted to belong to unions. Agreements reached between
 labqr and management. ineach sector also apply to nonunion and
 expatriate labor. According to the Labor Code, workers may
 indIviddally'or collectively take complaints of code violations
 to arbitration and may appeal to labor and national courts.
 These provisions are respected in practice.

 c. Freedorp of Religion
 The Constitution guarantees religious freedom and tolerance.
 However, proselytizing has sometimes been discouraged. In 1970
 a presidential decree banned several small syncretistic sects
 and the Jehovah's Witnesses, and declared illegal the practice
 of these "cults." This ban was believed to be the product of
 government suspicions that these religious groups were involved
 in antigovernment activities. The 1970 decree was reiterated
 in 1985. On Christmas Day 1986, security forces in Port
 Gentil, Gabon's second largest city, arrested 24 men for
 attending a Jehovah's Witnesses service, considered a violation
 of the presidential ban on Witnesses' activities. Their trial
 ended January 31, 1987; 21 received suspended sentences, and 3
 were sentenced to 2 months in prison and each fined about
 $300. They are now free. In the aftermath of this incident,
 government officials in the human rights area commenced a
 dialogue with respected Gabonese Jehovah's Witnesses with a
 view to working out a modus vivendi.
 As a general rule, Christian, Muslim, and animist religions all
 flourish in Gabon, and public worship is unrestricted. There
 is no political or economic discrimination because of religious
 preference. A number of different religious groups operate
 schools. In February 1987, President Bongo took the
 extraordinary step of transferring to the Ministry of National
 Education the administration of 150 schools run by the
 Protestant Evangelical Church of Gabon. The Government said
 the move was necessary to minimize the impact on school
 children of a 15-year-old leadership struggle which has torn
 that church apart and compromised its institutions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement within the country and return to Gabon from abroad are
 normally not restricted by the Government. Government
 employees, however, must obtain permission to travel abroad,
 and private citizens must obtain exit permits. Immigration
 laws and presidential decrees promulgated in mid-1986 imposed
 heavy monetary guarantee requirements on non-French expatriates
 working in Gabon and levied $100 exit visa fees for each
 departure from the country. Since mid-1983, the Government has
 slightly tightened restrictions on the entry and resettlement
 of displaced persons, but many persons who have been deemed to
 have a "well-founded fear of persecution" in their country of
 origin have been given permission to stay in Gabon. There have
 been no reported cases of involuntary repatriation. Those
 refugees or displaced persons who wish to repatriate
 voluntarily are allowed to do so.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Gabon is governed by a centralized, single-party regime in
 which President Omar Bongo exercises most political power.
 Citizens are unable to change the one-party political system
 and therefore cannot change the party in power through the
 electoral process. Major political and economic decisions are
 made by the President, usually in consultation with cabinet-
 level officials. This group of 45 includes representatives of
 all the country's major ethnic, geographic, and political
 groups. Through this mechanism, Gabon's varied interest groups
 are heard, given access to political patronage, and consulted
 on national resource distribution. The Fang, an ethnic group
 
 
 iii
 GABON
 comprising about 35 percent of the population, feel themselves
 to be underrepresented. Fear of Fang dominance by the
 remaining 65 percent has contributed to the President's
 political control. The need to maintain the balance of
 interests represents, therefore, the major check on
 presidential power. The very size and complexity of the
 government structure is another significant factor. Opposition
 political parties are not permitted. Membership in the single
 politicalparty isopen to all Gabonese but is not required.
 Elections below the presideifial lev4 are sometimes dontested,
 but all candidates must be approved-by the Democratic-Party of
 Gabon. The Central Committee of the ruling.party was expanded
 in September 1986 and for the first time included .two former
 members of the MORENA opposition group.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 President Bongo has invited representatives of Amnesty
 International and other human rights organizations to visit
 Gabon. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 functions in Gabon under the aegis of the United Nations
 Development Program. Gabon in 1987 nominated a candidate to
 the Africa Human Rights Commission.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 In recent years, women have played an increasing role in the
 economic, political, and cultural life of the country,
 particularly in urban areas. The Government and party have
 promoted women's rights, including formation of the National
 Commission for the Promotion of Women in 1984, which called for
 increased support for health care, nutrition, and literacy
 programs for women. The cabinet reshuffle on January 6, 1987,
 vaulted a woman into full ministerial rank with the naming of
 Sophie Ngwamassana as Minister of Justice. Four other women
 occupy cabinet rank positions as secretaries of state. In
 September 1986, five women became members of the Political
 Bureau of the Democratic Party of Gabon, the first women to
 serve at this level of the party. Women are also represented
 in the judiciary and occupy 17 seats in the National Assembly.
 Nevertheless, in rural Gabon women still fill largely
 traditional roles built around family and village. Onerous
 duties, such as hauling water, are being lightened as piped-in
 water and electricity are gradually introduced in more villages.
 The Government's policy of "regroupment"--encouraging the
 voluntary consolidation of small rural communities into larger
 villages along a road--is designed to enhance delivery of public
 services such as water, electricity, and schooling and has the
 effect of improving living standards for rural women.
 Access to the Government's social programs is open to all
 Gabonese citizens on a nondiscriminatory basis.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Labor legislation provides broad protection to workers. The
 minimum wage for unskilled labor since April 1985 has been
 about $200 per month for Gabonese and about $150 for
 foreigners. Owing to labor shortages, most salaries are much
 higher. There has been little unemployment for Gabonese
 
 
 112
 GABON
 wishing to enter the wage economy, though it is increasing as
 the economy reacts to the drop in oil prices.
 No minor below the age of 16 may work without the authorization
 of the Ministries of Labor, Public Health, and Education. It
 is rarely granted, and few employees in the modern sector are
 below the age of 18. Work over 40 hours per week must be
 compensated with overtime, and the workweek must include a
 minimum rest of 48 consecutive hours. Pregnant women have a
 right to 14 weeks of leave during pregnancy, including 6 weeks
 before delivery. The Labor Code describes enforcement of
 occupational health and safety standards, which are established
 by decree of the Minister of Health. These standards are
 enforced by the Government.
