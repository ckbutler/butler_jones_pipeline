 ARGENTINA
 Argentina is a federal constitutional democracy with an executive branch headed
 by an elected president, a bicameral legislature, and a separate judiciary. The Presi-
 dent, Carlos Saul Menem, was recently reelected to a second term which runs until
 July 1999. His'Justicialist Party won a majority of seats in both houses of Congress.
 The   rsident is the constitutional commander-in-chief, and a civilian Defense
 Minister oversees the armed forces. Since the end of conscription in 1994, the armed
 forces are composed of volunteers only. The responsibility for maintaining law and
 order is shared by several law enforcement agencies. The Federal Police report to
 the Interior Minister and the Border Police and Coast Guard report to the Defense
 Minister. Provincial police report to the individual provincial governors. Provincial
 policemen continued to commit human rights abuses.
 Argentina has a mixed agricultural, industrial,, and service economy that contin-
 ued a dramatic turnaround after decades of mismanagement and decline. An eco-
 nomic reform and structural adjustment program, begun in 1989, led to 3 years of
 high growth with sharply reduced inflation, and spurred competitiveness. An exten-
 sive privatization program, largely completed at the federal level, is now underway
 in the prvinces. However, as a result of privatization and private sector adjust-
 ment, the national rate of unemployment rose to a record 18.6 percent in 1995. The
 high cost of living has affected those on low fixed incomes the most, although the
 entire country benefited from the end of hyperinflation. Poverty has sharply de-
 clined since implementation of the adjustment program.
 The Constitution, revised in 1994, incorporates nine international human rights
 conventions and also provides for a wide range of freedoms and rights which the
 Government generally protected. There continue to be instances of extrajudicial
 killings and physical mistreatment of detainees by local poie. However, provincial
 authorities investigated, tried, and convicted a number of police officials for such
 abuses. The judicial system is subject to inordinate delays, resulting in lengthy pre-
 trial detention. Societal discrimination and violence against women are also prob-
 lems. Revelations of extrajudicial killings by former military officers who served
 under the 1976-83 military government sparked a national debate over a full ac-
 counting for those who disappeared during that period. The debate included an un-
 precedented public acknowledgement by the army commander that the army com-
 mitted grave human rights violations at that time. The Government and the armed
 forces said, however that they have no information about those who disappeared
 beyond that collected by the National Commission on Disappeared Persons in 1984
 and the Interior Ministry's Subsecretariat for Human Rights since then.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated extrajudicial killings.
 However, provincial police were responsible for a number of other extrajudicial
 killings. Under Argentina's federal system, the provincial police are not subject to
 federal government authority. Provincial governments have, however, investigated,
 and in some instances, detained and tried officials. In January in the province of
 Buenos Aires, a local judge ordered the detention of two police officers and one other
 person in the shooting death of a 19-year-old youth who came upon the officers
 while they were stealing a tape player from an automobile. In February a judge
 charged a policeman with manslaughter after he shot a 20-year-old youth fleeing ar-
 rest without giving him the opportunity to surrender. In Villa Mercedes, a judge or-
 dered the preventive arrest of five policemen accused of beating a 22-year-old to
 death while he was in police custody. In another incident in Florencio Varela, a
 judge ruled that the death of a 16-year-old boy was due to resisting arrest and re-
 leased a policeman accused of beating the youth. Police, however, opened an inter-
 nal investigation into the matter. Another youth died from a beating in Batan Pris-
 on in Mar del Plata. The authorities arrested six guards and a prison doctor in that
 incident.
 Several cases from previous years have remained in the public eye. One army offi-
 cer and two noncommissioned officers are standing trial in Neuquen for the 1994
 murder of Omar Carrasco, a young army recruit who was beaten to death during
 a hazing incident. Two other noncommissioned officers are accused of obstruction of
 justice and the investigation has widened to examine the role of higher ranking
 military officers in the case. In January  lice captured an ex-policeman wanted for
 participating in the kidnaping and murer of a Bolivian woman suspected of drug
 trafficking, another former policeman and five others are being held for trial in Bue-
 
 
 315
 nos Aires province. In September the Cordoba policeman accused of killing Miguel
 Rodriguez in 1994 wa3 convicted and sentenced to an 8-year prison term. aen days
 later, a key prosecution witness in the case, Sergio Perez, was killed in a confronta-
 tion with police officers. The police say he was shot in a firefight, but friends of
 Perez who were at the scene say he was deliberately shot in the back at point-blank
 range. A local judge is investigating.
 There were no new developments in the case of the 1994 death of Diego Rodriguez
 Laguens or in the 1987 murder of three teenagers
 b. Dippearance-There were no reports o politically motivated disappearances.
 In February a former navy lieutenant commander disclosed to the press that dur-
 ing the 1976-83 military regime, he and his fellow officers of the Navy Mechanics
 School had participated in drugging political prisoners and throwing them, still
 alive, out of airplanes over the Atlantic Ocean or the Rio de la Plata. Although his
 revelations were not new, he was the first former military officer to publicize the
 story. The resulting storm of controversy led to dmands__by human rights groups
 and relatives of victims of the Dirty War" to demand a full disclosure of the identi-
 ties of all those who disappared at that time. In March a federal court, responding
 to a petition brought by the families of two French nuns who were kidnaped and
 disappeared in 1977, ordered the executive branch, including the three branches of
 the armed forces, to provide lists of those who disappeared. The navy officer con-
 victed in abentia in France for the disappearance of the nuns was forced to request
 early retirement. The Government and the individual branches of the armed forces
 replied that no such lists exist.
 However, on March 31 the Ministry of the Interior did release a list of 290 names
 of persons who disappeared, supplementing the list of 8,961 originally prepared in
 1984 by the National Commission on Disappeared Persons. The names on both lists
 were compiled based on voluntary public testimony from friends, relatives, and
 other witnesses. Nevertheless, human rights groups continued to accuse the Govern-
 ment of failing to produce a complete list of persons who disappeared. In an unprec-
 edented and wide   praised speech on nationwide television in April, army com-
 mander Martin BaiKa acknowledged that the army committed reprehensible crimes
 during the military regime. He stated that no one in the army should be obliged
 to carry out immoral orders, and those who do so should be severely punished.
 Under new legislation passed in 1995, the Subsecretariat for Human Rights began
 to process compensation claims by families of those who disappeared during the
 Dirty War. Those whose claims are validated are eligible for one-time payments of
 $200,000.
 For the first time since the end of military rule a federal judge ordered the deten-
 tion of an ex-navy officer and his wife for the illegal adoption of a baby boy born
 in captivity to a Urguayan couple abducted and killed by security forces in 1977.
 The judge also issued a warrant for the arrest of a police doctor who allegedly ar-
 ranged the delivery of the child to the couple. The doctor, who was a fugitive for
 several months, surrendered to law enforcement authorities in September. This case
 arose from an investigation by the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, a human
 rights group that has been working to reunite the offspring of disappeared cou les
 with their nearest natural next-of-kin. The group is working with the National Com-
 mission on the Right to Identity, and the Interior Ministry's Subsecretariat for
 Human Rights in the search for children of couples who disappeared during the
 military regimes. The grandmothers helped return 2 children to the families of their
 birth parents, bringing the year's total of reunited families to 32.
 In a more recent case, investigators unearthed the remains of Andres Nunez, a
 La Plata youth who disappeared in 1990 after local police arrested him. Seven po-
 licemen are in custody.in this case; four others are fugitives.
 c. Torture and Other Cruet, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and the Criminal Code provides penalties for tor-
 ture which are similar to those for homicide, from 8 to 15 years in prison. Neverthe-
 less, police maltreatment of detainees remains a serious problem. In Entre Rios
 province, a teenager accused local police of severely beating him while in custody
 following his detention in connection with a street brawl. The case was being inves-
 tigated. In another instance of police misconduct, authorities arrested three Entre
 Rios policemen for having abducted and raped a 23-year-old woman. An additional
 10 agents were dismissed from the force, the chief of the unit and his deputy were
 relieved of duty, and 33 other officers were transferred to other assignments as a
 result of the incident. There were no new developments in the investigation of the
 1994 beating of Juan Carbajal.
 In order to reduce such abuses, the Interior Ministry conducted courses designed
 to heighten awareness about human rights issues for public officials, and the Justice
 Ministry attempted to educate the public about the legal rights of detainees. The
 
 
 316
 Interior Ministry's Subsecretariat for Human Rights and the United Nations Center
 for Human Rights sponsored courses to educate and sensitize federal law enforce-
 ment officials. This luman rights training first began in 1994.
 Prison conditions are poor in a number of overcrowded jails where the facilities
 are old and dilapidated. In Buenos Aires province, for example, no new prisons have
 been built for 26 years, and the prisons are ifiled to a level that is 40 percent above
 capacity. Human rights groups say this problem is serious and that some prisons
 are virtual powder ktegs of discontent. To help relieve the overcrowding, the Govern-
 ment has solicited bids for the construction of two new prisons in the province to
 be opened by late 1996 or early 1997. The new prisons'are designed to mcorporate
 modem penal technology; they will be more secure and offer better living conditions
 for inmates.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Penal Code places limits on the ar-
 rest and investigatory power of the police and the judiciary, but provincial police
 often ignored these restrictions as indicated in the cases cited above. Human rights
 groups find it difficult to document such incidents, because victims are reluctant to
 ile cmplaints.
 Police detain teenagers and young adults sometimes overnight, sometimes for an
 entire weekend, without formal charges. They do not always provide such detainees
 the opportunity to call their families or an attorney. These detainees are released
 only upon a complaint from relatives or legal counsel.
 The law provides for the right to bail, and it is utilized in practice. Nonetheless,
 the law allows pretrial detention, and the slow pace of criminal trials results in
 lengthy pretrial detention periods. Many untried prisoners are serving more time
 in prison than they would have served if they had been convicted and had received
 the maximum sentence for the crime for which they were arrested. In 1994 Con-
 gress passed a law that set a 2-year limit on pretrial detention. After 2 years, de-
 tainees would be granted 2 days of credit toward their sentences for every 1 day
 served before sentencing. In 1995 the Supreme Court ruled that the measure ap-
 plies not only to those who had not been sentenced, but also to those whose pretrial
 detentions exceeded the stipulated 2 years prior to their sentencing.
 The law does not permit involuntary exile, and it is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary. While it is nominally independent and impartial, its processes are inefficient,
 complicated, and, at times, subject to political influence. The judicial system is ham-
 pered by inordinate delays, procedural logjams, changes of judges, and incom-
 petence. Allegations of corruption are widely reported, especially in civil cases.
 Trials are public and defendants have the right to legal counsel and defense wit-
 nesses. A panel of judges decides guilt or innocence. In 1992, some federal and pro-
 vincial courts began deciding cases using oral trials in lieu of the practice of written
 submissions. Oral trials are less time consuming, and they have helped to reduce
 the number of prison inmates awaiting trial (see Section 1.d.). A Ministry of Justice
 report indicates that 44 percent of those held in federal prisons have been tried and
 sentenced compared to 38 percent in 1991. Nevertheless, lawyers and judges are
 still struggling to adjust to the new procedures, and substantial elements of the old
 system remain. For example, before the oral part of a trial begins, judges receive
 written documentation regarding the case which, according to prominent legal ex-
 perts, can bias a judge befo  oral testimony is heard.
 Constitutional reforms in 1994 provided for a blue-ribbon Council of Magistrates
 which would have responsibility for federal court administration and the selection
 and removal of judges. However, due to disagreement over the composition of the
 Council, Congress missed the August 1995 deadline for the Council's enabling legis-
 lation.
 International human rights groups have alleged that Fray Antonio Puigane, a
 Capuchin priest, is a prisoner of conscience. Fray Puigane was convicted and sen-
 tenced to prison as a co-conspirator in the 1989 attack on the La Tablada military
 regiment when some 39 individuals were killed.
 There were no other reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits such practices. Government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions, and violations are subject to legal sanction, although in practice,
 local police have the right to stop and search individuals without probable cause.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An independ-
 ent press and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom
 of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.

 There was one reported attack on a journalist: Guillermo Cherashny, a reporter
 for a weekly newspaper, El Nuevo Informador, was shot and wounded near his
 home in Buenos Aires. The case has not been resolved, and the motive for the attack
 is unknown.
 The Government proposed legislation to stiffen libel and slander penalties and
 fines for those convicted of defamation. However, media and political criticism of the
 legislation was so strong that the Government withdrew the proposal. An attempt
 by a Justicialist Party senator to introduce legislation that would have imposed se-
 vere penalties on those convicted of disseminating "secrets of state" met a similar
 fate; the executive branch itself rejected the proposal.
 However, in September a federal judge issued a warrant for the search and sei--
 zure of documents from several leag   entine newspapers, La Nacion, Cronica,
 and La Capital de Mar del Plata to obtain information about journalists' sources in
 a 2-year-old libel case. The Association of Newspaper Organizations (ADEPA) con-
 demned the action as a violation of constitutional guarantees of freedom of the press
 but also noted that it was an exception to the rule of judicial prudence in press free-
 dom cases.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution and law pro-
 vide for these rights and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Mooenent Within the County, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 pairiation.-The Constitution and law provide for these rights, and the Government
 respects them in practice.
 The Government recognizes as refugees those persons who meet the 1951 U.N.
 Convention on Refugees as modified by its 1967 Protocol. The Refugee Eligibility
 Committee is responsible for determining a refugee's status, and a U.N. High Com-
 missioner for Refugees representative can attend and participate in Committee
 hearings but cannot vote.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Since its return to democratic government in 1983, Argentina has held periodic
 free and fair elections to choose federal, provincial, and municipal office holders.
 Universal suffrage for those age 18 and over is obligatory in national elections. Po-
 litical parties of varying ideologies operate freely and openly. The revised Constitu-
 tion provides that all adult citizens shall enjoy full participation in the political
 process, and they do so in practice.
 In May President Carlos Menem was reelected- this time to a 4-year term. His
 Justicialist Party won a majority of seats in the hamber of Deputies and the Sen-
 ate. The election campaign was conducted in a fair and open manner, all political
 parties had full access to the communications media. Representatives from the
 major parties were stationed at polling places to insure an honest vote count.
 A September gubernatorial election in Santa Fe province was marred by technical
 problems, and the leading opposition candidate for the Radical Civic Union Party
 denounced irregularities. The Santa Fe election tribunal thereafter conducted a vote
 count by hand to determine the winners.
 The Constitution stipulates that the internal regulations of political parties and
 party nominations for elections be subject to affirmative action requirements to as-
 sure that women are represented in elective office. A 1993 decree implementing a
 1991 law required that a minimum of 30 percent of all political party lists of can-
 didates be female. As a result, the presence of women officials is increasing. The
 number of women in the Chamber ofDeputies doubled from 34 to 63 when the new
 Chamber was installed in December. Between 1991 and 1995, the number of women
 representatives increased 420 percent (from 15 members to 63). Two women, or 4
 percent, are members of the Senate, which is in the process of adopting direct elec-
 tion procedures under the 1994 Constitution. Women are also assuming positions
 of greater authority in provincial and local governments.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operate without government restriction,
 investigating human rights cases and publishing their findings. Government offi-
 cials are generally cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution and federal law guarantee equality for all citizens. The 1988
 Antidiscrimination Law establishes a series of penalties ranging from 1 month to
 
 
 318
 3 years' imprisonment for anyone who arbitrarily restricts obstructs, or restrains
 a person based on "race, religion, nationality, ideology, political opinion, sex, eco-
 nomic position, social class, or physical characteristics. There is no evidence of any
 systematic effort to abridge these rights by the Government or private groups.
 Women.-Violence and sexual harassment against women is a problem; insensitiv-
 ity among police and judges sometimes discourages women from reporting assaults,
 especially in domestic violence cases. In response, the Congress approved a law
 aimed at helping victims of family violence by, among other things, excluding the
 perpetrator from his home for up to 48 hours. The National Women's Council has
 been working with the enforcement authorities to include material on handling
 cases of violence against women in their police training curriculum. More than 40
 public and 80 private institutions offer educational programs of prevention and pro-
 vide support and treatment for women who have been abused. 'In November 1993,
 President Menem signed a decree against sexual harassment in the Federal Govern-
 ment.
 Women still encounter economic discrimination, a situation that has been aggra-
 vated by the infusion of large numbers of women into the workplace in the last 10
 years. According to a 1994 government report, women occupy a disproportionate
 number of lower paying jobs. Within each job category, women are concentrated in
 the lower ranks and receive the lowest salaries. Often they are paid less than men
 for equal work, even though this is explicitly prohibited by law.-Female labor lead-
 ers pressed their male counterparts for affirmative action programs within the trade
 union movement to counteract this. Women are also found disproportionately in the
 informal sector which effectively denies them work-related economic and social ben-
 efits enjoyed by those in the formal sector.
 The National Women's Council and the Presidential Women's Advisory Cabinet,
 created in 1992 and 1993 respectively, worked on a 3-year government action plan
 (1993-95) to promote equal opportunity and participation of women in society. Pro-
 visions in the revised Constitution have greatly increased women's participation in
 politics.
 Children.-The 1994 Constitution incorporates the U.N. Convention on the Rights
 of the Child. The Ministry of Interior's Human Rights Subsecretariat works with
 United Nations Children's Emergency Fund and other international agencies to pro-
 mote children's rights and well-being.
 Historically, Argentina has had numerous programs to provide public education,
 health protection, and recreational services for all children, regardless of class or
 economic status. Child abuse and prostitution are problems but have not increased
 in recent years, although the National Council on Children and the Family believes
 that those affected tend to be younger than previously. The Council, which the Gov-
 ernment established in 1990, works actively with federal and local agencies to im-
 prove child protection programs. Sixteen out of 24 provinces, the federal capital, and
 the Federal Government have child protection laws on the books.
 People With Disabilities.-A 1994 law aimed at eliminating physical barriers to
 disabled persons regulates standards regarding access to public buildings, parks,
 plazas, stairs, and pedestrian areas. An increasin number of street curbs in Buenos
 Aires have been modified to accommodate wheel cairs. However, few buildings and
 public areas in the capital or other cities offer easy access to persons with disabil-
 ities. Federal law also prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in
 employment. Since the establishment of the National Program Against Discrimina-
 tion in August 1994, the largest single group of complainants has been disabled per-
 sons.
 Indigenous People.-The revised Constitution provides for the right of minorities
 to be represented in government and incorporates international agreements in-
 tended to promote their economic, social, and cultural rights. Estimates of the size
 of the indigenous population vary from 60,000 to 150,000, but the National Statis-
 tical Institute put the figure at below 100,000 as of 1992. Most live in the northern
 and northwestern provinces and in the far south. Their standard of living is consid-
 erably below the average, and they have higher rates of illiteracy, chronic diseases,
 and unemployment. Indigenous groups are sometimes involved in disputes over trib-
 al lands which tend to be prolonged due to an inefficient court system unable to ex-
 pedite conflicting land title claims.
 Religious Minorities.-Although ongoing concerns over anti-Semitism exist, overt
 acts of religious discrimination decreased during the year. The Government extra-
 dited Erich Priebke to Italy to stand trial for crimes committed as a Nazi officer.
 The investigation into the July 1994 bombing of a Jewish cultural center continued.
 In December an investigating judge ordered the arrest of new suspects, including
 some active duty military personnel suspected of connections to an arms and explo-
 sives sales operation.
 
 
 319
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-With the exception of military personnel, all workers
 are free to form unions. Estimates regarding union membership vary widely. Most
 union leaders believe it to be about 40 percent of the work force; government figures
 indicate union membership at 30 percent. Trade unions are independent of the Gov-
 ernment or political parties, although most union leaders are afifliated with Presi-
 dent Menem s Justicialist Party. Unions belong to either the General Confederation
 of Labor, its dissident wing the Movement of Argentine Workers, or the Independent
 Congress of Argentine Workers.
 Unions have the right to strike, and members who participate in strikes are pro-
 tected by law. From ,ust 1994 through July 1995, there were 327 strikes or other
 forms of labor conflict. Approximately 70 percent were in the public sector, most of
 them as a result of delay or nonpayment of salaries by local governments. The Gen-
 eral Confederation of Labor and a number of nonaffiliated unions staged a partial
 general work stoppage and mass rally to protest the record level of unemployment
 (18.6 percent) and the Government's labor and social policies. The Government rec-
 ognized the unions' right to protest and did nothing to interfere.
 Unions are members of international labor associations and international trade
 secretariats and participate actively in their programs.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law prohibits antiunion
 practices, and the Government enforces it. The trend towards bargaining on a com-
 pany level, in contrast to negotiating at the national level on a sectoral basis contin-
 ued, but the adjustment has not been easy for either side. Both the Federal Govern-
 ment and a few highly industrialized provinces are working to create mediation
 services to promote more effective collective bargaining and dispute resolution.
 The Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommenda-
 tions of the International Labor Organization (ILO) asked the Government to com-
 ment on a number of complaints brought by the Union of United Maritime Workers
 and the Congress of Argentine Workers over hiring practices, workers' compensa-
 tion, rest periods, and wage protection.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor and there were no reports that it was practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law prohibits employment of
 children under 14 years of age, except in rare cases where the Ministry of Education
 may authorize a child to work as part of a family unit. A small number of children
 work with their parents harvesting fruits and vegetables. Minors aged 14 to 18 may
 work in a limited number of job categories but not more than 6 hours a day or 35
 hours a week. The law is effectively enforced except in some isolated rural areas
 where government enforcement capabilities are poor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The national monthly minimum wage of $200
 (200 pesos) is insufficient to sustain a family of four.
 Federal labor law sets standards relative to health, safety, and hours of work. The
 maximum workday is 8 hours and workweek 48 hours. As part of its economic re-
 structuring prgram, the Government has enacted into law reforms aimed at giving
 small and medium enterprises greater flexibility in the management of their person-
 nel. The Government is also proposing to modernize the system of worker compensa-
 tion.
 Occupational health and safety standards are well developed, but federal and pro-
 vincial governments lack sufficient resources to fully enforce them. In spite of union
 vigilance, the most egregious cases of inhuman working conditions concern illegal
 immigrants who have little opportunity or sufficient knowledge to seek legal re-
 dress. In March, for example, provincial authorities of Entre Rios province discov-
 ered a cam p of illegal agricultural workers, most of whom were from Paraguay,
 working under deplorable conditions for minimal pay. The authorities provided med-
 ical and other forms of temporary assistane and i ande the illegal camp.
 Workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous or unhealthful work
 situations, after having gone through a claim procedure, without jeopardy to contin-
 ued employment. Nevertheless, work er who leave the workplace before it has been
 proven unsafe run the risk of being fired; in such cases, the worker has the right
 to judicial appeal, but this process can be very lengthy.
