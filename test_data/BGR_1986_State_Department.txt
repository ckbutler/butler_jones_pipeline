 BULGARIA
 Bulgaria is a Marxist-Leninist state ruled by the Bulgarian
 Communist Party. The Communist leadership holds a monopoly of
 power and seeks to control and direct all political, economic,
 social, and cultural activities. A second party, the
 Bulgarian National Agrarian Union, is represented in the
 Government and National Assembly but is totally subservient to
 the Communist Party. No other political parties are
 tolerated. An omnipresent network of state security police
 and militia (uniformed national police) deters or suppresses
 open expressions of opposition to the regime or its policies.
 All production facilities, except for small private
 agricultural plots, are owned by the State. The Government
 controls the trade union movement and uses it as a vehicle for
 mobilizing the work force to achieve the regime's goals.
 The Constitution specifies a number of civil, political, and
 social rights, but in practice these rights are circumscribed
 and cannot be exercised in any way that the Communist Party
 deems unacceptable. Travel out of Bulgaria is contingent on
 government approval and is closely controlled, as is the
 individual's ability to change residence from one city to
 another in Bulgaria.
 Most limitations on and denials of civil and political rights
 apply to all Bulgarians, but the country's Turkish
 minority--about one-tenth of the population--is subject to
 additional restrictions on its cultural identity, including
 bans on the use of the Turkish language, traditional forms of
 dress, and some Islamic religious practices. The forced
 change of Turkish to Bulgarian names carried out in 1984-85
 appears to have been completed. Active resistance to
 government policies appears to have ceased, and reports of
 regime violence to enforce the name change campaign have
 stopped.
 Overall, the human rights situation changed little in Bulgaria
 during 1986. Reports of violence associated with enforcement
 of government controls decreased, but that diminution
 reflected reduced resistance from the Turkish minority rather
 than improved government observance of human rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no known reports of politically motivated killings
 in Bulgaria during 1986. Amnesty International, however,
 reported in April 1986 evidence that Bulgarian security forces
 may have killed over 100 Bulgarian citizens of Turkish origin
 during the 1984-85 name change campaign.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported cases of disappearance at the hands of
 Bulgarian security forces.

 BULGARIA
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 According to credible reports by human rights advocates and
 their families, beatings continued to be a feature of
 imprisonment in Bulgaria. Many persons apprehended while
 attempting to leave Bulgaria without authorization have
 reportedly suffered severe abuse at the hands of border
 guards. Political prisoners, including intellectuals, are
 held together with common criminals and subjected to brutal
 treatment by these elements as well as by their guards. These
 practices are confirmed by veteran inmates from various
 prisons, including Sofia's Central Prison and forced labor
 camps at Devnia, Belene Island, and Debelt. According to a
 dissident former graduate student confined at Debelt, the
 guards there delegate the task of beating political offenders
 to criminal inmates.
 Prison conditions reportedly vary. According to one prisoner,
 cells at Sofia's Central Prison went unheated during the early
 months of 1985, but despite the winter temperatures inmates
 were not issued any additional clothing, On the other hand, a
 penal veteran referred to Stara Zagora Prison as a relative
 "paradise" where a correct regime is followed despite Spartan
 conditions. At the Razvigor Street jail in Sofia, prisoners
 are held two to a cell during pretrial investigations. The
 cells measure one and a half by two paces and are furnished
 only with aplank bed or pallet. Each cell is illuminated
 around the clock by a single naked bulb. The diet is poor.
 There are no exercise or recreation areas, although-detainees
 may remain at .Razvigor for several months. While Razvigor
 inmates endure lengthy interrogation sessions, there are no
 known complaints of beating in this jail.
 Sources claim that conditions are also harsh at camps,
 including the notorious Belene Island facility, for Bulgarians
 detained in the campaign against ethnic Turkish Bulgarians.
 Bulgaria ratified in October, with significant reservations,
 the Convention Against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel,
 Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, signed in June
 1986.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Bulgarian citizens may be detained, tried, and punished for
 many actions which elsewhere are considered political, but not
 criminal, in nature. Police interrogation, detention, or even
 arrest may result from unauthorized demonstrations, public
 expressions critical of the Government, or the mere act of
 entering a Western embassy, although such activities are not,
 strictly speaking, illegal under Bulgarian law.
 Although the principle of a judicial determination of the
 legality of a person's detention exists in Bulgarian law, it
 does not provide effective relief against state action. The
 Bulgarian judiciary is not independent of executive power, nor
 is it able to provide any effective check on executive
 actions. Thus, although preliminary detention is limited
 theoretically to 10 days, and then only when the evidence
 appears sufficient to justify an indictment, several cases are
 known of persons subjected to longer detention without charges
 being filed. Following arraignment, Bulgarian law permits
 detention up to 6 months before indictment. Under the
 
 
 871
 BULGARIA
 Criminal Code, the accused must be informed of the charges
 against him, but sometimes this requirement is not observed.
 Persons may also be subject to a system of administrative
 control short of imprisonment, by which they are detained at
 their place of residence and must appear frequently at the
 local police station. Another form of punishment and control
 is forced change of domicile or internal exile. A person's
 right to remain in his place of residence may be revoked, and
 he may be required to move far from family and familiar
 surroundings. Such banished people are often sent to remote
 villages to perform agricultural labor. Their identity cards
 are stamped to note restriction to a particular locality.
 Should exiles or persons under such administrative controls
 leave despite these prohibitions, they face possible
 imprisonment.
 There were credible reports in 1986 that Bulgarians of Turkish
 ancestry, who had been incarcerated on Belene Island or in
 other Bulgarian prisons for their resistance to the 1984-85
 name change campaign or for other "troublemaking," were being
 resettled after release from prison to areas of Bulgaria with
 small numbers of ethnic Turks. Although some ethnic Turks
 appear to be working involuntarily outside their home regions,
 there is insufficient evidence to establish the existence of a
 broad assimilationist resettlement policy.
 It is not possible to estimate reliably the number of
 arbitrary arrests, other forms of detention, or summary exile
 in 1986. The exact number of detainees from the Turkish name
 change campaign of 1984-85 who may still be incarcerated or in
 internal exile is unknown. However, credible reports,
 including those documented by Amnesty International and
 Helsinki Watch, indicate that many ethnic Turks arrested
 during that campaign may have remained imprisoned in 1986.
 Political offenders are required to do hard labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Bulgarian law and general practice provide for public trial in
 criminal cases. Defendants are entitled to legal counsel but
 only after preliminary investigations and indictment, a
 process that can last many weeks. When defense attorneys are
 provided, they often cooperate with the prosecution.
 Special court procedures apply in cases involving state
 security. Trials in such cases, and in others with political
 implications, are not public. The numbers of such trials, or
 of political prisoners and detainees, are not known, but a
 reasonable estimate would be a figure of several thousand
 political prisoners or detainees, taking into account those
 captured while trying to escape across the country's borders
 and ethnic Turks detained during and since the name change
 campaign.
 The Bulgarian judicial system generally seeks to maintain a
 semblance of observing legal norms, but the courts sometimes
 apply statutes retroactively or extend them to cases of
 dubious applicability. The penal laws are codified,
 published, and readily available for reference, but numerous
 procedural and administrative regulations are not. Such
 regulations are frequently invoked in judicial proceedings,
 and the defendant has little opportunity to question the
 validity or applicability of the regulation in question.
 
 
 872
 BULGARIA
 Despite such irregularities, Bulgarian dissidents have stated
 that they welcome even trials closed to the public as forums
 for defending themselves and voicing criticism of the
 Government. Some defense lawyers enjoy reputations for
 courage and honesty, despite pressures from the security
 apparatus.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government and Communist Party interfere in the private
 lives of citizens in many ways. The party and the security
 apparatus direct an elaborate system of informers, which is
 present in virtually all workplaces, residential areas, and
 social organizations, to monitor the daily lives of Bulgarians
 for signs of dissidence or other unacceptable behavior.
 Citizens assume that security personnel may monitor their
 telephone conversations and read their mail.
 Sanctity of the home is nominally safeguarded by law, and
 police may not legally search property without prior
 permission from a court or prosecutor. However, searches may
 be undertaken in urgent situations before judicial permission
 is given. The authorities are required to issue an itemized
 receipt for property confiscated during a search. In one
 case, a defendant facing trial refused to sign this document,
 charging that it contained falsehoods. In court, the
 defendant reported that his signature was forged on the
 document, but a judge admitted it as evidence over the defense
 lawyer's protest.
 The Government regiments the private lives'of citizens.
 Virtually all citizens are members of "mass" organizations.
 Children and young adults belong to the Pioneers and Komsomol,
 respectively, while their elders belong to the Fatherland
 Front and, in the case of the elite, the Bulgarian Communist
 Party. There are strong pressures on all citizens to become
 nominal members of and pay dues to the mass organizations.
 Those who refuse--an extremely small percentage of the
 population--are likely to come under official scrutiny and to
 be denied advancement at work and other benefits.
 Government policies toward the Turkish minority, which it
 describes as "Bulgarians who were forcibly Islamized under
 Ottoman rule," demonstrate forceful interference into areas
 traditionally regarded as private. Despite official denials,
 numerous reports, including private statements by people
 living in predominantly ethnic Turkish areas, indicate that
 the public use of the Turkish language is banned. The wearing
 of traditional Turkish clothing is also forbidden. The ethnic
 Turkish and Muslim population continues to be required to use
 Bulgarian--usually Christian--names forced on it in the
 1984-85 name change campaign. Education in the Turkish
 language has long been banned.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for certain basic rights, including
 freedom of speech and press. In practice, however, these
 freedoms may not be exercised in any way that might weaken the
 Bulgarian Communist Party's monopoly of power. The regime
 totally controls Bulgaria's press, radio, and television, and
 rarely permits dissemination of alternative views. Laws
 
 
 873
 BULGARIA
 provide severe punishment for anyone convicted of criticizing
 the State or spreading "untruthful remarks which might
 increase distrust of state power or cause confusion in
 society." Unauthorized disclosure of information, such as
 unpublished economic statistics, is illegal and subject to
 serious penalties.
 Although censorship officially does not exist, the media as
 well as writers, artists, and those in academic life operate
 within well-understood party and government guidelines and
 practices. International news coverage is usually limited to
 that provided by the government news agency or official Soviet
 sources, although carefully selected articles from the Western
 press are sometimes published in translation. Forbidden
 topics in the Bulgarian press include unauthorized criticism
 of party and state leaders, of Communist ideology, and of
 other Communist countries, particularly the U.S.S.R.
 In addition to pervasive party control of the media, virtually
 the entire population practices self-censorship. Annual
 congresses of the official Writers Union adopt acceptable
 themes for authors, and those not following directives are
 unlikely to see their works published. Academic journals
 cannot challenge regime policies.
 Ordinary citizens send criticism, suggestions, and complaints
 by letter to newspapers and to National Assembly deputies on a
 broad range of topics, such as inadequate services by public
 agencies and housing shortages. None of the letters
 published, however, exceeds criticism of specific shortcomings
 or failures of lower level administrative officials.
 Occasionally, an issue of social policy may be opened to
 public discussion within prescribed bounds.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association and
 demonstration. In practice, however, the State decides which
 social and political organizations may exist. Private
 associations are unknown, and the law provides punishment for
 anyone "founding an illegal, anti-State organization."
 Freedom of assembly is a right granted only to legally
 constituted organizations, and only for approved purposes.
 Attendance at public demonstrations is a duty assigned by
 schools and enterprises to their members.
 Lawyers, doctors, artists, musicians, writers, and academics
 are also members of professional associations which have the
 party-assigned function of controlling their memberships.
 Their contacts with foreign, especially Western counterparts,
 are restricted; and foreign travel to attend conferences and
 take part in international exchanges is subject to control by
 party organizations.
 The Bulgarian Communist Party organizes and totally controls
 all Bulgarian labor unions. The unions' role is to instill in
 their members devotion to the party, promote patriotism and
 loyalty to the Soviet Union, and prepare working people for
 Communist society. A new labor code, adopted in 1986 and due
 to go into force in 1987, appears designed in large part to
 increase labor productivity and facilitate implementation of
 what the party calls the "scientific-technical revolution."
 Union members are not permitted to strike or negotiate for
 better pay or working conditions, nor may workers organize
 outside the existing unions.
 
 
 874
 BULGARIA
 Trade unions have not defended workers dismissed from jobs for
 .political" transgressions. Such workers are sometimes
 blacklisted by security authorities, effectively barring them
 from further employment. Trade unions are assigned a role
 promoting job safety and the general social welfare of their
 members. Bulgaria is a member of the International Labor
 Organization, and the unions maintain ties with
 Communist-controlled unions and labor confederations abroad.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although the Constitution provides for freedom of worship, the
 authorities espouse atheism and discourage religion. Openly
 expressed religious conviction is incompatible with party
 membership or attainment of responsible government or
 industrial positions. Policy directives adopted at the
 Thirteenth Bulgarian Communist Party Congress in April 1986
 called for increased "ideological work against religious
 anachronisms" and promoting broader acceptance of "the
 Socialist festive and ritual system." Nonetheless, a number
 of faiths are recognized, including various Christian
 denominations, Islam, and Judaism. The Ba'hai faith and the
 Dunovist sect, an indigenous movement which flourished in
 pre-Communist Bulgaria, however, are outlawed. Most forms of
 religious instruction are forbidden in practice. Church-state
 relations are regulated by the Committee for Questions of the
 Bulgarian Orthodox Church and Religious Cults, which is
 organized under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It reviews
 all clerical appointments and in the past has occasionally
 imposed clergy on local congregations despite the opposition
 of the parishioners.
 The Bulgarian Orthodox Church, which was the established
 church before the Communists took power, is the largest and,
 in the Government's view, most acceptable church, given its
 historic role and continuing appeal to ordinary Bulgarians.
 The church receives substantial government financial support
 and echoes government propaganda on such themes as peace and
 disarmament. It is allowed to print a newspaper, distill and
 market some alcoholic beverages, and sell some religious
 articles, such as candles and small jewelry crosses.
 A Bulgarian language Bible, only 2,000 copies of which were
 published in 1982 and distributed domestically, is now out of
 print, and no Bibles may be imported. A Ministry of Interior
 newspaper reported in a September 1986 article on "ideological
 subversion" that customs officials had intercepted on various
 occasions a total of "50 Bibles in Bulgarian intended to be
 distributed here," "2,186 copies of brochures and books with
 religious contents," and other religious materials.
 Although authorities generally do not interfere with older
 worshipers attending services, they try to dissuade young
 people from entering churches and periodically circulate among
 them demanding to see their identity cards. Attendance at
 Easter services at Sofia's Aleksandur Nevsky Cathedral is
 restricted to those granted special "invitations," and police
 barricades keep all others at least a block from the cathedral.
 Ethnic Turks comprise the majority of Bulgaria's Muslims, the
 remainder being Gypsies and Slavic Pomaks. Increased measures
 to discourage Islamic practices have figured prominently in
 the Government's campaign to eradicate the cultural identity
 of the Turkish community in Bulgaria. Muslim believers have
 been inhibited in the practice of their religion by the
 
 
 875
 BULGARIA
 closure of many mosques and by prohibitions against religious
 education of children. Although Sofia's mosque is being
 slowly renovated, many other mosques throughout the country
 have fallen into disrepair or have been converted to other
 uses. Certain architecturally notable mosques, as in Razgrad
 and Shumen, have been preserved as "cultural monuments" but
 are closed to actual worship.
 Copies of the Koran may not be imported and are not generally
 available to Muslims in Bulgaria. Bulgarian citizens were not
 permitted to make pilgrimages to Mecca in 1986. Parents who
 have Muslim rites of circumcision performed on their children
 are heavily fined, and the observance of Muslim holidays is
 discouraged. Many Muslim graveyards have been obliterated,
 and Muslim burial practices are not permitted.
 The Jewish minority numbers about 5,000 people. Historically,
 Jews in Bulgaria have not suffered anti-Semitic persecutions
 as in many other parts of Europe. They have traveled to
 Israel and received visitors from that country, although such
 travel is carefully controlled by the Government. Sofia's
 Sephardic Synagogue has received some government funds for
 refurbishment as an architectural monument, but progress has
 been extremely slow, and religious services continue to be
 held in a small, overcrowded anteroom. The Synagogue's prayer
 books are old, and no replacements are available. No kosher
 meat is available, but Jews are permitted to bake and
 distribute Passover matzoh without hindrance. Sofia's Jewish
 cultural center emphasizes the community's ethnic, not
 religious, identity. It publishes a secular newspaper
 stressing pro-Communist, anti-Zionist themes.
 Roman Catholics are few in number and divided between
 followers of the Latin and Uniate rites. A number of small
 Protestant churches (e.g., Evangelical, Baptist, Methodist,
 Seventh-Day Adventist) also function. In church sermons,
 preachers adhere closely to themes of personal piety and
 commonly avoid social and political themes. No religious
 groups may engage in open proselytizing, and foreign
 missionary activity-is banned. Formal religious education of
 children is prohibited, although some young people attend
 church services with their parents.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government controls where Bulgarians live, work, and
 travel. Citizens are required at all times to carry with them
 personal identity cards stating their legal place of residence
 and work. Without this card, they cannot register at a hotel,
 purchase domestic airline tickets, or seek any kind of social
 service such as medical assistance. Changing one's place of
 residence or work is a complicated process unless it is at the
 Government's initiative or convenience. Moves to Sofia and
 other major cities from smaller settlements are especially
 difficult because of the authorities' desire to control urban
 growth. Travel within the country by Bulgarians is generally
 unrestricted except in border zones. One special case,
 however, is the Kurdzhali district, which has a large ethnic
 Turkish population. Checkpoints at the district border permit
 only Bulgarian citizens bearing special authorizations to
 enter. Foreign travelers often are denied entry to this and
 other nominally open areas.
 
 
 876
 BULGARIA
 Foreign travel by Bulgarian citizens is restricted, although
 less so to Eastern European Communist countries. Bulgarian
 citizens must have a passport for foreign travel and an exit
 visa specifying the destination for each trip. If they go to
 a country not mentioned in the exit permit, they can face
 serious complications upon return home. Applications for exit
 documents are often refused, because the travel is deemed "not
 in the interest of the State" or "not suitable in view of the
 present international situation." Frequently no explanation
 at all is given for passport or visa refusals. Although more
 Bulgarians have been able during 1986 to visit family members
 in the.West, frequently a spouse or minor children must remain
 in Bulgaria during the visit as an inducement for the traveler
 to return to Bulgaria.
 Emigration is possible under Bulgarian law, but it is rarely
 permitted. The Government moved in 1986 to resolve a number
 of divided family cases in accordance with the Helsinki Final
 Act. Nevertheless, the authorities have recently denied
 passports to other applicants seeking either to visit
 relatives or emigrate. The Government imposes an education
 fee on recent college graduates who seek to emigrate without
 first fulfilling a mandatory period of public service; for
 medical doctors, this period is 5 years.
 The Government encourages repatriation of ethnic Bulgarians
 residing abroad, although the right of repatriation is not
 guaranteed. A number of Bulgarian-born foreign residents and
 citizens voluntarily return to Bulgaria each year to live in
 retirement. In September 1986, a retired couple-with American
 citizenship, who had lived in Bulgaria for 3 years, were
 required to leave the country within 3 days when they declined
 to surrender their American passports to local authorities.
 It is Bulgarian policy to return to their home countries
 potential refugees from other Warsaw Pact states who have
 tried to cross the Bulgarian border into Greece, Turkey, or
 Yugoslavia.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Bulgaria is governed by a small elite controlling the
 leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party. Rank-and-file
 members have little opportunity to change the party's
 policies, and nonparty members are effectively denied any role
 in influencing the policies of-the Government. Political
 pluralism and free.participation in the political process do
 not exist.
 Bulgaria does not have free elections. The regime tries to
 maintain the appearance of pluralism through the participation
 of a second political party, the Bulgarian National Agrarian
 Union, in the Govenriment and the National Assembly. However,
 the Agrarian party does not contest the Communist Party for
 seats in the National Assembly, nor has it ever failed to
 endorse regime policy. The Communist and Agrarian Parties,
 together with labor, youth, and other groups, comprise a mass
 organization known as the Fatherland Front, which is wholly
 controlled by the Communist Party. At election time, the
 Fatherland Front alone presents a unified slate of candidates,
 effectively giving voters only one candidate for each office.
 Generally, the Agrarians are allotted about one-quarter of the
 National Assembly seats, but all votes are unanimous. The
 
 
 877
 BULGARIA
 National Assembly, which meets normally only in a few brief
 sessions per year, has no independent role in governing.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No independent domestic organizations to promote human rights
 exist in Bulgaria. In 1986 the National Assembly created a
 new legislative commission with the nominal function of
 defending social interests and citizens' rights. At its
 organizational meeting in October 1986, the new commission's
 chairman stated that its guiding principle would be the
 complete unity of the interests of society, the work
 collective, and the worker.
 The Government regards any criticism of its human rights
 record as inadmissible and part of an "anti-Bulgarian
 campaign." It denounced the April 1986 Amnesty International
 report on Bulgaria's Turkish minority in those terms, and
 government media derided the entire report's credibility,
 claiming that it contained inaccurate information on a few of
 the individuals named in the report. The Government also
 resisted a visit by a commission appointed by the Organization
 of Islamic Countries to investigate the situation of the
 ethnic Turkish Muslim minority. It. has now reportedly agreed
 to a delegation visit, but final agreement over scheduling and
 conditions has not yet been reached.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination against the cultural identity of the ethnic
 Turkish population has been reported above.
 Women are legally guaranteed equal rights with men and do not
 appear to suffer overt discrimination as regards educational
 and professional opportunities. Women continue to be
 underrepresented in policymaking jobs within the party and
 Government, however, and overrepresented in many manual and
 lower-paying occupations.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 A new labor code adopted in 1986 codified and systematized
 much existing legislation. It stipulated 16 as the minimum
 age for all but certain light work. Persons from 16 to 18
 years of age may not be assigned work designated as heavy,
 harmful, or dangerous; their workweek is either five 7-hour
 days or six 6-hour days. The workweek for adults is 42.5
 hours (5 days of 8 1/2 hours) in most professions and
 occupations. The minimum wage is the local currency
 equivalent of about $120 per month at the official exchange
 rate, and the average wage is the local currency equivalent of
 about $210 per month. Especially in families with two working
 spouses, this provides, at best, a modest standard of living.
 Paid vacations range from 14 workdays annually for those who
 have worked less than 10 years to 18 workdays annually for
 those who have worked more than 15 years. Additional paid
 vacation is granted those in certain difficult or dangerous
 occupations. Bulgarian practice appears generally to conform
 to these guidelines, although participation in unpaid
 supplementary "brigades" can lengthen working hours on various
 occasions during the year. A national labor safety program
 exists, but standards of enforcement vary greatly.
