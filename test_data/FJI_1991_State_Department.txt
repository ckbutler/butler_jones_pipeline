 FIJI
 Fiji's system of parliamentary democracy, inherited when the
 country gained independence from Great Britain in 1970, ended
 in October 1987 with the installation of a military regime
 following two bloodless coups. An interim government,
 initially formed in December 1987, remains in office and is
 headed by Prime Minister Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, who held that
 position for 17 years prior to the April 1987 elections. In
 July 1991, Maj. Gen. Sitiveni Rabuka, who had become Fiji
 Military Forces (FMF) commander, resigned from the military and
 accepted a dual appointment in the Cabinet as co-deputy Prime
 Minister and Minister for Home Affairs. A month earlier,
 however, fears of a third coup were widespread when Rabuka
 publicly called on the interim regime to resign, charging the
 Cabinbt with having lost touch with the people. Rabuka
 resigned from the Cabinet on December 1, 1991 following his
 election as President of the new Fijian Political Party (FPP).
 He is an FPP candidate for the general election planned for
 1992 and is considered one of the front-runners to succeed
 Prime Minister Ratu Mara.
 Fiji's multiracial society is about evenly divided between
 indigenous Fijians and ethnic Indians. Indians dominate the
 economy and professions and are well represented in the lower
 and mid-levels of the public service. Ethnic Fijians make up
 the bulk of the nation's military services and control the
 political structures.
 The small but professional FMF include a naval division and an
 air wing. Fiji also has a separate police force. The military
 report to and are under the control of the Minister for Home
 Affairs and, ultimately, the President. Control over the
 police currently rests with the Prime Minister. In 1990 the
 Government also established a new Fiji intelligence service,
 with wide-ranging powers to search people and property, tap
 telephones, and open mail.
 Sugar and tourism constitute the mainstays of the economy,
 accounting for almost half of the nation's foreign exchange
 earnings. The economy has recovered from the effects of a
 severe decline following the 1987 coups, despite a series of
 strikes and other industrial actions which often reflect
 political motives. The Government is promoting light
 manufacturing for export to diversify the economy and lessen
 its dependence on sugar and tourism.
 The Government took two important steps to restore Fiji to
 elected government: completion of the work on defining the new
 electoral boundaries by the Electoral Boundaries Commission and
 the undertaking of voter registration by the Electoral
 Commission, which is expected to lead to a general election by
 mid-1992. Principal human rights problems in 1991 included the
 new Constitution's unequal representation features; several
 incidents of discrimination against ethnic Indians and women;
 inhibitions on freedom of speech and press; continued delays in
 bringing'cases to trial; and the Government's footdragging in
 choosing a president for the Court of Appeal. In December the
 Government finally appointed an Australian judge to head the
 Court of Appeal.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of political killings by the Government
 or any political group.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances in 1991-.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Police sometimes physically abuse detainees; the offending
 officers have been punished in some instances. In September
 the new Police Commissioner announced the creation of a new
 internal affairs unit to expedite the investigation of such
 cases. In November 1990, five members of the military pleaded
 guilty to the abduction and beating of a University of the
 South Pacific (USP) professor (see Section 1.b.). Corporal
 punishment is permitted by law; strokes of the cane are
 administered under medical supervision.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 In Fiji, the law of arrest and detention broadly follows the
 British model. Generally, a person may be arrested only if
 there is a reasonable belief that a breach of the criminal law
 has been or is about to be committed. Arrested persons must be
 brought before a court without "undue delay." This is taken to
 mean within 24 hours, with 48 hours as the exception (such as
 when an arrest is made over the weekend). Rules governing
 detention are designed to insure fair questioning of suspects.
 The writ of habeas corpus obtains in Fiji. In urgent cases,
 application may be made ex-parte to a judge at any time,
 whether he is sitting or not. Incommunicado and arbitrary
 detention are illegal according to Fijian law, and there have
 been no known cases in Fiji since the events of 1987 and the
 subsequent lifting of the Internal Security Decree.
 In 1990 police arrested three journalists in connection with an
 article stating that the USP staff and students would stage a
 repeat burning of the Constitution to protest the abduction and
 beating of a USP professor. The three were charged with the
 "malicious act" of publishing a fabricated story under the
 Public Order Act (POA). Released on bail, they were scheduled
 to appear for trial in January 1991. Several other staffers
 were taken in for questioning and released. However, the
 Department of Public Prosecutions dropped the charges against
 the journalists in August. The case of seven others, including
 five USP lecturers, arrested and charged with sedition and
 unlawful assembly for participating in the constitution-burning
 demonstration in 1990 is still pending. In December the High
 Court turned down an appeal by the seven defendants to have
 their cases heard by that court rather than a lower court,
 which would normally handle such a case. Unlike the High
 Court, cases in the lower courts are decided by a magistrate
 without benefit of a jury.
 Exile is not practiced formally. -The authorities reportedly
 have a short list of Fiji citizens who are deried the right to
 
 
 850
 FIJI
 return to Fiji, but this remains unconfirmed. No Fiji citizens
 were denied reentry in 1991.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judicial structure has been slightly reorganized under the
 1990 Constitution but remains similar to the British system,
 The principal courts in Fiji are the High Court, the Court of
 Appeal, and the Supreme Court, which now becomes the court of
 final appeal because Fiji is no longer a member of the
 Commonwealth of Nations. Hence, appeals to the Privy Council
 in London are no longer available. However, the Court of
 Appeal faces an enormous backlog of cases because it has been
 unable to convene due to the Government's failure to decide on
 the appointment of the president to this court, created under
 the 1990 Constitution. This problem was resolved on December
 19 when the Government announced that an Australian judge will
 head the Court of Appeal from January 2. 1992.
 There are no special courts; military courts try only members
 of the armed forces. Magistrates' courts continue to try the
 large majority of cases. In addition to its jurisdiction in
 serious civil and criminal cases, the High Court is granted
 special interest jurisdiction on behalf of the public and is
 empowered to review alleged violations of individual rights
 guaranteed under the Constitution.
 The judiciary remains independent under the new Constitution.
 Rights of due process are similar to those found under English
 common law. The right to public trial is guaranteed and
 defendants have the right to counsel. In lesser litigation,
 there is a public legal advisor who is concerned mainly with
 assistance to indigents in the domestic or family law court.
 The right of appeal exists despite increasing delays. In 1991
 both the Chief Justice, Sir Timoci Tuivaga, and High Court
 Justice Michael Scott voiced concern, pointing out that justice
 delayed is justice denied. Normal bail procedures mean that
 most defendants do not experience any pretrial detention.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In general, privacy of the home is respected. However, the new
 Fiji Intelligence Service has wide-ranging powers to search
 people and property, open mail, and tap telephones. It is not
 yet clear to what extent these powers will be used.
 Surveillance of persons believed to represent a security threat
 is carried out to some degree. Many political dissidents
 believe their telephones and mail are monitored, but concrete
 evidence is lacking. In 1991 the President promulgated an
 antiterrorism decree giving, inter alia, airport and other
 police special authority to cope with potential threats
 connected with the Gulf War.
 Section 2 Respect For Civil Liberties, Including;
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech has largely-been restored. Political figures
 and private citizens can and do speak out against the
 Government. No arrests for making any kind of public statement
 were reported in 1991. As noted above, several people who
 participated in a constitution-burning protest were arrested in
 1990. At year's end, the police were investigating a 1991
 
 
 851
 FIJI
 repeat burning of the Constitution by some 100 university
 students that took place on November 5, the anniversary of the
 original protest and an Indian holiday. There have been no
 arrests to date, and allegations that police illegally searched
 students' rooms on campus have been refuted by the
 Vice-Chancellor.
 Although there are no legal restrictions on press freedom, the
 Government has broad discretionary powers to impose
 restrictions, and it has sometimes done so. Legislation
 pertaining to the press is contained in the Newspaper
 Registration Act (NRA) and the Press Correction Act (PCA).
 Under the NRA, all newspapers which are sold and published in
 Fiji must be registered with the Government before they can
 begin publishing. The Press Corrections Act gives the Minister
 of Information sole discretionary power to order a newspaper to
 publish a "correcting statement" if, in his opinion, a false or
 distorted article has been published. Should the newspaper
 refuse to publish the Minister's correction, it can be taken to
 court and, if found guilty, fined.$700 (individuil persons
 convicted under the act may be fined $150 and/or imprisoned for
 6 months). .The PCA allows the Government to arrest anyone who.
 publishes "malicious" material. This includes any false news
 which could create or foster public alarm or result in the
 "detriment of the public."
 Privately owned broadcast and print media operate without prior
 censorship but with considerable self-censorship. Newspapers
 usually refrain from printing editorials severely critical of
 the Government and do little investigative reporting.
 Statements about the political situation by opposition figures
 and foreign governments are reported, however. Journals such
 as the Fiji Labor Sentinel are often highly critical of the
 Government. In March 1991, the opposition coalition publicly
 launched the publication of a critique of the 1990 Constitution
 entitled "A Fraud on the Nation" to which two overseas
 academics, Dr. Yash Ghai and Sir Y. K. Pao, contributed. This
 report was freely available in local bookstores. The coalition
 has also promised publication of an alternative constitution.
 The letters column of the two dailies also frequently carry
 political statements from members of the deposed government and
 other persons and from groups which are highly critical of the
 Government, its programs, and the Constitution.
 In August 1991, the Minister for Information revived talk of
 requiring registration and licensing of the press, a plan which
 was supposedly dropped in 1990. This possibility continues to
 have some dampening effect on the press.
 The Government dropped all charges against the three
 .journalists detained and charged in October 1990 for an article
 about a planned protest rally at the university. Several
 foreign journalists were denied visas in 1991, and the Fiji
 office of the Pacific Islands News Service, closed in 1990
 ostensibly for contractual violations, remained closed.
 Prior to the 1987 coups and immediately thereafter, the
 University. of the South Pacific (USP) was a center of
 opposition political activity. The Government has made it
 clear that it objects to the mixing of university employment
 and participation in Fijian domestic politics. In 1991 the USP
 Council issued new rules governing staff involvement in
 politics. Undet the rules, staff members must take leave if
 they run for public office and must resign from their
 university posts if elected; senior staff cannot hold office in
 
 
 852
 FIJI
 political parties; also, senior staff must refrain from public
 involvement in politics. A leading academic and opposition
 politician, Dr. Tupeni Baba, has chosen to relinquish his
 position as head of the Humanities Department in favor of his
 previous position as a Reader in the Education Department.
 This has allowed him to be active in the Fijian Labor Party
 (FLP) and left him free to address public rallies and give
 media interviews. However, he is prevented from holding a
 full-time executive position in the party.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Assembly for political purposes is allowed but subject to
 restriction in the interest of public order. Public gathe ings"
 require permission from the Government's district officers,
 which may obtain prior assessment and advice from the police on
 the anticipated crowd size and the ability of the police to
 ensure public safety. Permits for large outdoor political
 meetings or demonstrations are not always granted. In December
 1991, the Fiji Mine Workers' Union, whose members have been on
 strike since February, were refused permission to march in
 Suva. The union secretary alleged political bias against the
 union as the reason.
 In 1990 the Government invoked the POA to prevent any rally
 from taking place on the USP campus. However, permits were
 issued during 1991 for several rallies organized by political
 parties, .religious groups, and groups opposed to the
 Government. Several new parties were created in 1991. Party
 headquarters, including those of the deposed coalition parties,
 remain open. Political organizations are allowed to operate
 and issue public statements. They have done so repeatedly and
 openly throughout 1991.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution and
 honored in practice. The Preamble to the Constitution declares
 the importance of Christianity to the Fijian people but
 guarantees protection for all religions. After the 1987 coups,
 most commercial and social activities on Sundays were banned.
 The Sunday bans were relaxed substantially in mid-1989 to allow
 public transportation and restaurants to operate and to all'ow
 agricultural activities to continue. All forms of unorganized
 sporting activity are permitted on Sundays. Religious pressure
 for restoration of sweeping Sunday bans has dissipated
 somewhat. No significant restrictions affect foreign clergy,
 missionary activity, charitable work, religious publishing and
 education, or other typical nonpolitical activities of
 religious organizations. In July news that a Muslim secondary
 school had invited its non-Muslim students to view a film
 entitled "Crucifixion or Crucifiction" led to major religious
 protests by religious groups. The Fiji Muslim League issued an
 apology, and the Government banned the film from being shown in
 schools..
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the tountry, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on freedom of movement within the
 country or abroad. Occasional detentions at the airport occur,
 but the courts do not hesitate to order redress where-this is
 warranted. Fiji citizens are free to emigrate. Acc6rding to
 the best available estimates, about 30,000 have done so since
 May 1987. Most of the emigrants are Indians, many of them
 
 
 853
 FIJI
 professionals, but Fijians and others also have left. Several
 thousand have claimed refugee status, especially when applying
 for admission to Canada, but neither the U.N. High Commissioner
 for Refugees (UNHCR) nor any Government has recognized those
 claims. The increased emigration rate of Indians since the
 1987 coups, coupled with a recent upsurge in the birthrate of
 ethnic Fijians, has reversed the precoup racial composition
 rankings. Fijians once again make up the single, largest
 ethnic group with 48.9 percent of the population compared to
 46.2 percent for Indo-Fijians.
 Increasingly, Fiji is receiving applications from Chinese
 immigrants. Reportedly the Government is encouraging this
 trend to compensate for the departure of skilled Indo-Fijians.
 There are no refugees in Fiji, and no forced resettlement
 programs. In 1991 a diplomat from the Peoples Republic of
 China Embassy requested and was granted temporary asylum in
 Fiji until such time as the UNHCR can process his case.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The right of citizens to change their government is abridged by
 the provision of the new Constitution ensuring political
 dominance by ethnic Fijians. Moreover, the Constitution was
 promulgated by an unelected interim government and was never
 approved by a national referendum. In January 1990, the term
 of the first interim government came to an end, and the
 President announced a second interim government, with a reduced
 17-member Cabinet, devoid of active duty military officers. In
 July 1990, this Government implemented the first part of its
 announced mandate with the promulgation of the new
 Constitution. In 1991 the Constituency Boundaries Commission
 completed its work of delimiting new boundaries. Voter
 registration was also undertaken with an estimated 83 percent
 of eligible voters registered. National elections are expected
 to take place in the first half of 1992.
 There are currently about a dozen political parties that have
 declared themselves prepared to contest the elections. Several
 of these are Indian-based. One, the National Federation Party
 (NFP), has pledged to continue its opposition to the
 Constitution in the Parliament, once elected to it. According
 to the Government, the new Constitution is intended to ensure
 political dominance by the indigenous Fijians, while
 reinstating a form of parliamentary democracy and ensuring
 protection for basic human rights and Indian communal
 interests. The Constitution thus provides that indigenous
 Fijians are to hold 37 of 70 seats in the elected lower house
 of Parliament with the ethnic Indians accorded 27 seats,
 Rotumans (culturally distinct Polynesians) 1, and other races
 5. In the Senate, an appointed body with essentially review
 powers and the right to veto legislation, indigenous Fijians
 are to hold 24 of the 34 seats, Rotumans 1, and the other
 groups 9. Other constitutional features designed to ensure
 indigenous Fijian political dominance include procedures and
 requirements governing the selection of the President and the
 Prime Minister.
 The Constitution also incorporates a Bill of Rights, providing
 for freedom of speech, assembly, religion, and other rights and
 freedoms. The section setting forth these rights provides that
 they may not be altered by Parliament except with the approval
 of two-thirds of the lower h6use. However, elsewhere in the
 Constitution, Parliament is also given the authority to pass
 
 
 854
 FIJI
 special acts to deal with certain specified emergency
 situations, notwithstanding human rights guarantees found in
 other sections of that document. The Attorney General's office
 has taken the view that any legislation introduced under the
 emergency powers provision would require two-thirds approval by
 the lower house, but critics of the Constitution maintain that
 only a simple majority would be needed. Critics thus claim
 that indigenous Fijians in the lower house would be able,
 solely on the strength of their own numbers, to abrogate
 constitutional human rights protections. The Labor Party
 faction of the opposition coalition continues to cite this
 concern, along with the lack of proportional parliamentary
 representation for all races, as major factors in its announced
 decision to boycott any elections held under the new
 Constitution.
 The President is to be selected (as are the Fijian members of
 the Senate) by the Great Council of Chiefs (GCCY, a: traditional
 Fijian leadership body. The Prime Minister, who along with the
 Cabinet will hold-most executive authority, is to be chosen by
 the President from among the Fijian members of the lower house
 on the basis of his ability to command majority support within
 that body.
 Elections are to be held by secret ballot, with voting only by
 communal constituencies. The complex system of cross-voting in
 the 1970 constitution, allowing Indians a say in the selection
 of some Fijians and vice versa, has been abolished. The
 Constitution calls for elections every 5 years, but the
 Government may call an election at any time. A significant
 feature of the 1990 Constitution provides for a formal review
 of its provisions before the end of 7 years and every l0 years
 thereafter.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no local human rights groups as such in Fiji, but the
 women's rights movement, the labor movement, and various
 political groups are involved in promoting a number of human
 rights causes. There are also several small foreign-based
 organizations that purport to advance human rights causes in
 Fiji, including the Coalition for Democracy in Fiji (with
 offices in New Zealand and Australia) and two U.K.-based
 groups, the International Fiji Movement and the Movement for
 Democracy in Fiji.
 While the Government holds a very strong view on external
 interference in its domestic affairs and has invoked this
 principle in the past to inhibit certain investigations of the
 political and human rights situation by such organizations as
 Amnesty International, it did allow representatives from
 several such organizations to attend the sedition trial of six
 Rotumans in 1991. The Rotumans won a reversal of their 1988
 conviction.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The stated purpose of the 1987 military coups was to ensure the
 political supremacy of the indigenous Fijian people and to
 protect their traditional way of life and communal control of
 land. To this end, a number of measures have been taken that
 favor the Fijian community over the other ethnic groups. The
 
 
 855
 FIJI
 most obvious is the reapportionment of the new Parliament to
 guarantee a preponderance of Fijians.' The Government is also
 committed to raising the proportion of Fijians and Rotumans in
 the public service to 50 percent or more at all levels. Many
 Fijians felt that the public service prior to the coup
 discriminated in favor of Indians, who controlled most of
 middle management because of their higher educational
 achievements. Current promotion and hiring policies in the
 public service favor ethnic Fijians. The new Constitution also
 provides specific affirmative action provisions to improve the
 conditions of those disadvantaged as a result of race, sex,
 place of origin, political opinion, color, religion, or creed.
 Control of land is a highly sensitive issue in Fiji. About 85
 percent of the land is held communally by indigenous Fijians.
 Most cash crop farmers are Indians, who lease their land from
 the Fijian villages. Freehold land title is not an indigenous
 concept; lands owned currently by the State (6 percent) and by
 individuals (9 percent) were transferred from customary owners
 during the colonial period. The present land ownership
 arrangements were instituted by the British to protedt the
 interests of the indigenous Fijians. Many Indians,
 particularly farmers, feel that the absence of secure land
 tenure discriminates against them. The military coups were
 prompted, in part, by Fijians' fears that Indians sought to
 take away their land.
 Indians are subject to occasional harassment and crime based on
 race, which is compounded by inadequate police protection.
 More rarely, similar acts of vandalism have been reported
 against Chinese farmers in remote rural areas. There have been
 no credible allegations of government involvement in such
 incidents, and the police have investigated and, where
 possible, arrested lawbreakers.
 Women in both the Fijian and Indian communities have functioned
 primarily in traditional roles, although some women rise to
 high places in the public service, politics, and business.
 Women can also attain high status in Fiji's traditional chiefly
 system. The Prime Minister's wife is, in her own right, Fiji's
 second highest ranking traditional chief. In general, women in
 the Fijian community are more likely to rise to prominence in
 their own right than are women in the Indian community. Women
 have full rights of property ownership and inheritance, and a
 number have become successful entrepreneurs. Women are
 generally paid less than men, a discrepancy that is especially
 notable in the garment industry. Garment workers, most of whom
 are female, are subject to a special minimum wage considerably
 lower than that in other sectors. In December 1991, the leader
 of the women's wing of the local labor confederation charged
 that women in the garment industry are being sexually harassed
 at the workplace, especially when tasked by their superiors to
 work overtime.
 There is a small but active women's rights movement, which has
 pressed for more serious treatment of rape in the courts. The
 crime tends to draw prison sentences of only a few years.
 Continued admonitions by the Chief Justice in 1991 resulted in
 some increase in the average prison term of rape. The law
 allows corporal punishment for rape, but this is generally used
 only in cases of offenses against minors. Domestic violence is
 also a problem in Fiji and is a second major focus of the
 women's movement. This problem appears more commonplace within
 Fiji's Indian community where, for. instance, the use of the
 "danda." (stick) is seldom questioned. The authorities are
 
 
 856
 FIJI
 generally reluctant to intervene in cases of domestic violence
 unless it is necessary to save the woman's life. Few cases
 result in prosecution, as the victim generally does not press
 charges. The Government has not-been active in dealing with
 domestic violence. Suva, the capital, has a privately funded
 women's crisis center which offers counseling and assistance to
 women in cases of rape, domestic violence, and other problems,
 such as child support payments. There is, overall, a growing
 awareness that women's issues are deserving of greater
 attention, but the issue has been overshadowed by the political
 events stemming from the 1987 coups.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers' rights to form and join unions, elect their own
 representatives, publicize their views on labor matters, and
 determine their own policies are protected by law. Strikes are
 legal.
 Vigorous strike action occurred throughout 1991, delaying the
 sugar harvest once again and severely impairing operations at
 the nation's gold mine. A national strike was narrowly averted
 by Maj. Gen. Rabuka bringing labor union leaders and the
 President together. This resulted in the suspension of two
 draconian decrees promulgated to protect the sugar and other
 key industries from strike action. The Government continued to
 charge that union activism was driven by a political agenda.
 All unions must register with, but are not controlled by, the
 Government. The only central labor body, the Fiji Trade Union
 Congress (FTUC), is closely associated with the opposition FLP
 and the deposed Bavadra Government. The labor movement is led
 largely by ethnic Indians. Persons with close ties to the
 Government have started rival unions primarily for ethnic
 Fijians; these unions are more amenable to political
 cooperation with the Government. During the national economic
 summit in May, the Government publicly discussed plans to
 reform the role of the labor unions. These plans included
 strict definition of valid conditions for a strike,
 establishment of separate machinery for settlement of labor
 disputes and other guidelines to control union activity. On
 November 1. the Government passed decrees 42, 43, and 44 which
 effectively brought these measures into effect. The more
 militant wing of the FTUC has called for international support
 for a general strike. In response, the Australian
 Confederation of Trade Unions has pledged a 1-day ban on trade
 and transport. On December 10, FTUC National Secretary
 Mahendra Chaudhry filed a writ challenging some of these
 decrees on the ground that they contravene certain sections of
 the 1990 Constitution. Other elements of the FTUC leadership
 reportedly are disposed to negotiate with the Government over
 the reforms. The FTUC is free to associate internationally.
 The Committee on Freedom of Association of the International
 Labor Organization (ILO), at its 1990 session, again asked the
 Government to reconsider its ban on Sunday meetings, including
 union meetings. The ban had been relaxed previously; however,
 permits for such meetings are often not granted.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The law recognizes the right to organize and bargain
 collectively. Employers are required to recognize a union if
 
 
 857
 FIJI
 more than half the employees in a workplace have joined it.
 Recognition is determined by union membership numbers rather
 than by an election. The Government has the power to order
 recalcitrant employers to recognize unions, although union
 leaders accused the Government of failing to apply the law
 correctly in one recent case. Key sectors of the economy,
 including sugar and tourism, are organized, and collective
 bargaining is the norm. In 1991 the Government lifted wage
 guidelines. These guidelines had been devised to replace a
 mandatory wage cut and freeze put into effect after the 1987
 coups. Fiji's practice for wage bargaining has been to set
 national wage guidelines after consultations among the
 Government, employers, and unions.
 Wage negotiation on an industry-by-industry basis is not
 practiced, and a government proposal to introduce such
 negotiations has been resisted by employers and unions. Union
 leaders fear that straight market-based wage bargaining would
 open unacceptably large wage gaps between skilled and unskilled
 workers. Until 1984-a tripartite forum of employers, unions,
 and government oversaw labor negotiations. In that year,
 however, labor withdrew from the forum and it was abolished.
 The restoration of the body is now a key demand of the FTUC,
 reiterated in 1990 at its 33rd Biennial Delegates Conference
 and on several occasions in 1991. While the Government has
 reportedly agreed to consider the request, it is believed to
 favor the current format of an annual national economic summit
 as the forum for dealing with labor matters.
 The 1990 Constitution expressly protects the right of persons
 "to form or belong to trade unions" but permits restrictions to
 be applied on public officers; in the interests of defense,
 public safety, public order, public morality, or public health,
 or to protect the rights and freedoms of other persons. The
 unions are generally successful in preventing discrimination
 against workers for union activities. In 1990 FTUC Women's
 Wing Secretary Ema Druavesi reported some progress in
 organizing women in the garment industry despite what she said
 were the fears of many women regarding victimization and
 intimidation for union activity. Some 20 garment factories out
 of the total 55 operating in Fiji are reportedly now
 unionized. Fiji's export processing zones are subject to the
 same laws as the rest of the country, and many of their firms
 have unions which have negotiated collective bargaining
 agreements.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor does not exist in Fiji. The 1990 Constitution
 specifically prohibits such practices.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Children under 12 may not be employed in any capacity.
 Children (under age 15) and "young persons" (ages 15-17) may
 not be employed in industry or work with machinery.
 Enforcement by the Ministry of Employment and Industrial
 Relations generally is effective, except in the case of family
 members working on family farms or businesses.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 No national minimum wage has been established. Certain sectors
 have minimum wages set by the Ministry for Employment and
 Industrial Relations. The minimum wage, which is effectively

 enforced, will generally support a barely adequate standard of
 living in all sectors except the garment industry. In the
 garment industry, the starting wage is based on the assumption
 that workers are young people or-married women living at home
 and not expecting to support a household.
 Fiji has no regulation specifying maximum hours of work for
 adult males. Women are prohibited from night work in industry
 and underground work in mines. Certain industries, notably
 transportation and shipping, have problems with excessive hours
 of work. A number of fatal bus accidents have been attributed
 to excessive working hours for drivers. Indians, who generally
 require a cash income to survive, are more vulnerable to
 pressure to work long hours than Fijians. Many Fijians can and'
 will return to their villages rather than work what they
 consider excessive hours.
 Fiji has workplace safety regulations, a workmen's compensation
 act, and an accident compensation plan. Awards for workers
 injured on the-job are set by a tribunal. Government
 enforcement of safety standards under the direction of the
 Employment Ministry suffers from a lack of trained enforcement
 personnel, but the unions do a reasonable job of monitoring
 safety standards in organized workplaces. A 1989 study of
 working conditions in the garment industry resulted in the
 Government ordering many employers to improve working
 conditions. Union leaders complained that the Government's
 action was too mild and that the employers should have been
 subject to criminal prosecution.

 EDITORIAL NOTE
 This volume continues the series first published in a reprinted
 edition in 1982 and containing Country Reports on Human Rights
 Practices from 1977 through 1980 (except 1978 when no such report
 was prepared), and the less regular Reports on Human Rights Prac-
 tices in Countries Receiving United States Aid for 1976 and 1978.
 The practice of the Department of State to submit to Congress the
 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices on an annual basis has
 continued through the 1980s and into the 1990s. This does not seem
 to be the case with the Reports on Human Rights in Countries
 Receiving United States Aid. The last of these reports was submitted
 by the Department of State to Congress in 1979.
 This reprint series continues to publish these reports for the later
 years as they become available.
