 LEBANON
 Formally, Lebanon is a constitutional democracy with a diredtly
 elected, unicameral-parliament which chooses the president.
 Political pdwer is divided on the basis of a formal
 constitution, and in accordance with the unwritten,
 confessionl-ly based National Pact of 1943.' The latter
 provides for ,a- Maronite Catholic presildeit, a Sunnil Muslim
 prime minister, and a Shi'ite Muslim speaker of the National
 Assembly. This same National Pact provides also for the
 proportional allocation of government positions among various
 religious groups on the basis of the last nationdl 'census--
 conddcted in 1932. -
 Twelveyears of civil war have altered greatly this
 governmental arrangement. Parliamentary eledtions, which
 should take place every 4 years, were last held in 1972.
 Since that election, one-fifth of the elected parliamentarians
 have died and, with one exception, have not been replaced,
 leaving some constituencies unrepresented.
 The years of intermittent warfare also have reduced
 drastically the authority of the central Government and its
 ability to safeguard human rights. Extralegal militias
 control much of the country, where they, in effect, govern the
 civilian population and enforce their own version of justice
 without regard to the central Government or legal norms.
 Armed confrontations between differing militia elements are
 frequent and periodically result in civilian casualties.
 The presence of foreign forces further reduces those areas
 under government authority. Although Israel withdrew the bulk
 of its forces from south Lebanon during 1985, the Lebanese
 Government has yet to extend effective authority to that
 region. Israel maintains a "security zone" that encompasses
 Lebanese territory and mounts ground and air operations
 against targets in south Lebanon which often result in
 civilian casualties.
 Syria added to its already large military presence during 1987
 when additional security forces were sent to West Beirut at
 the request of Lebanese Muslim political leaders. Syrian
 troops in Beirut, north Lebanon, and the Biqa' Valley
 currently number about 35,000. In those areas, the Syrian
 authorities carry out security and other functions normally
 reserved to the central government. Syrian military responses
 to local opposition resulted in civilian casualties and heavy
 material damage at times during 1987.
 Already seriously disrupted by more than a decade of war,
 Lebanon's free enterprise economy continued to deteriorate at
 an increasingly catastrophic rate during 1987, prompting
 violent demonstrations for the first time. The deterioration
 of the Le6!ese pound against the U.S. dollar was 74.4 percent
 after the first 9 months of 1987, and Lebanese emigration was
 increasing substantially.
 The year 1987 brought no visible improvement in the human
 rights situation. As in previous years, major battles fought
 in densely populated areas intentionally or unintentionally
 wounded and killed hundreds of civilians. Noncombatants were
 the targets of violence, such as terrorist bombings, random
 shellings, sniping, abductions, summary executions, and
 assassinations. Freedom of movement between East and West
 Beirut--already restricted--was limited further by the closing
 of a major vehicular crossing point on the demarcation line

 LEBANON
 separating the two halves of the capital. Movement to other
 areas was made increasingly difficult by measures adopted by
 militia and foreign military forces. Beirut International
 Airport was closed for 3 months after being shelled. The
 ferry sermice connecting Jounieh port in East Beirut with
 Larnaca, Cyprus, was interdicted briefly by the Israeli navy.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including-
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Rival factions routinely kill for-political motives. Such
 killing has not been restricted to soldiers and militiamen.
 Civilians have been victimized by car bombs exploded in
 crowded areas, indiscriminate shelling, and daily sniping
 across the demarcation line separating East and West Beirut.
 In addition, there have been carefully planned assassinations-
 of political figures, claims of hostage execution, and death
 threats aimed at forcing certain political actions. While
 forces outside of government control were responsible for most
 of these actions, opponents of the Lebanese Government charge
 that security forces and the Lebanese-army had roles in bdth
 indiscriminate and planned attacks reulting in politically
 motivated deaths. As in the past, the establishment of
 culpability-and the administration of. just punishment did not
 follow any of the political killings or assassination attempts
 in 1987.
 Political killing has resulted from both conventional warfare
 and from terrorist attacks. Again in 1987, residential areas
 in greater Beirut, Sidon, and elsewhere-i, south Lebanon were
 frequently the target of random shelling, the purpose of which
 often appeared to have been to kill -or t intimidate
 civilians. Snipers shooting across the Green Line that
 separates East and West Beirut made no distinction between
 military and civilian victims. Terrorist attacks in the form
 of massive car bombs brought indiscriminate death or maiming
 to numerous civilians in East and West Beirut, Tripoli,
 Baalbek, Zahleh, and Tyre. This year also saw the return of
 remotely controlled explosive devices as a method of   -
 assassination. Syrian security forces were targeted with
 increased frequency in 1987. For a week in February, West
 Beirut was the scene of what his been described by witnesses
 as the worst fighting since the war began in- 1975. The
 fighting between Shi'ite militiamen and a Druze-led leftist
 coalition resulted in civilian as well as military casualties.
 Random confrontations between various militia groups often
 resulted in short, fierce street'f-ights--usually at illegal
 checkpoints--but sometimes when carloads of roving militimen
 encountered each other. Wounding, hostage-takingi and deaths
 frequently resulted from such chance encounters.
 The "Camps War" fighting between Shi'ite Amal militiamen and
 Palestinian fighters near refugee camps in Tyre, Sidon, and
 Beirut continued at fierce levels from October 1986 through
 February 1987, when the fighting spilled over into open
 militia warfare in the streets of West Beirut. "Camps War"
 fighting continued at reduced intensity into April, then
 subsided, but sporadic skirmishes picked up again in September
 and October, threatening a new major outbreak of fighting. As
 a result of the Shi'ite-Palestinian fighting, hundreds have
 been killed and thousands wounded, the majority of them
 
 
 1224
 LEBANON
 civilians from both sides. Kousing and infrastructure in the
 camps proper were heavily damaged, as also occurred in the
 Shilite areas immediately surrounding the camps. Fighting in
 Tyre reportedly led hundreds of'Pal-estinian families to flee
 to Sidon,,and fighting in towns and villages east of Sidon
 drove thousands of Christian and Shi'ite families from their
 homes.
 In addition to random acts against civilians, there were
 numerous:assassination.attempts against prominent political,
 military, and educational figures. The assassination attempts
 took the form of ambushes, rocket attacks on homes, car
 bombings, explosive-devices planted in buildings and aircraft
 for remote detonation, and execution-style attacks. Foreign
 diplomats and embassies were targeted. Terrorist organizations
 also claimed to have executed a number of hostages from
 Lebanon's smaLlJewish~community. Lebanon's Prime Minister,
 an important presidential advisor, and the Jesuit director of
 the south JIebanon campus of a major .university were among
 those murdered in 1987. Numerous political figures received
 death threats in the course of the year.
 * b. Disappearance
 Thousands of Lebanon's inhabitants have disappeared since the
 beginning.of the war in 197-5. Private militias and foreign
 forces, rather than official Lebanese security services,
 appear tobe responsible for most of these kidnapings. Some
 victims propbbly were summarily.executed. Most of these
 persons remain unaccounted for, but occasional hostage
 exchanges and releases do occur.
 During 1987. politically-motivated kidnapings continued.
 Abducbons.-were particularly prevalent in West Beirut,
 Beirub's pouthern suburbs, and.along the Green Line, which
 divides predominantly ;Christian East Beirut from mostly Muslim
 West Beirut, Some Lebanese were kidnaped because of their
 affiliation with rival militias--others because of interfamily
 disputes. Most,,bowever, were-civilians abducted simply on
 the basis of religion or for ransom. In this-latter category,
 civilian seizures often tended to coincide with media coverage
 of sensitive political issues. Lebanese victims included, for
 example, Muslims traveling to East Beirut and Christians
 living or working in West Beirut.
 In 1987 abductionsof foreigr% diplomats, journalists,
 businessmen, and academics continued in West Beirut and the
 southern suburbs. A few were eventually released but, as of
 the end of 1987, eight U.S., five French, three British, one
 German, one Italian, one Irish, one South Korean, and one
 Indian (a U.S. permanent resident)-remained hostage. In 1987
 four professors were abducted from the campus of Beirut
 University College in West Beirut, the special envoy of the
 Archbishop of Canterbury disappeared during a mission to
 negotiate the release of Western hostages, a diplomat, two
 journalists, and a businessman were taken hostage. The
 diplomat (a Saudi) and one of the journalists (an American)
 subsequgntly were released. A prominent Lebanese politician
 was also kidnaped and held for several days before being
 released.

 LEBANON
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment.
 Overwhelmed by the presence of private militias and foreign
 forces, the official Lebanese security services control so
 little territory that relatively few allegations of torture
 are made against them. There are many allegations of brutal
 treatment by Lebanese militias, Syrian occupying forces, the
 Israeli-funded Army of South Lebanon, the Palestinians, and
 Hizballah. It is difficult, however, to determine to what
 extent these allegations, which are often leveled by
 archenemies, reflect actual practice.
 In its 1987 Report, covering 1986, Amnesty International
 expressed its concern about the torture and ill-treatment of
 prisoners and noted that it had received allegations of
 torture from former detainees held by the Amal militia; the
 Lebanese Forces, a coalition of Christian militias; and the
 South Lebanon Army. Methods of torture reportedly included
 hanging detainees from the ceiling by their feet, electric
 shocks, and severe beatings.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Under Lebanese law, a suspect must be arraigned before an
 accusation committee (a panel of three judges) and the
 prosecutor within 48 hours of arrest, but government
 prosecutors sometimes hold suspects indefinitely for
 interrogation without reference to a court or judge. Every
 prisoner has the right to legal counsel, and bail is permitted
 in most cases. There is no public defender's office.
 No militia or foreign occupying force observes the legal
 safeguards which the Government is committed to apply in
 arrest cases. In general, persons arrested by these groups
 are denied access to the judicial system. Some of the major
 militia groups have periodically turned individuals accused of
 civil crimes over to the legal authorities. Normally, howeyer,
 the various militias detain individuals arbitrarily for
 indefinite periods, often to be exchanged for persons held by
 rival militias. Such detainees are frequently held
 incommunicado. In addition to politically motivated
 abductions, some militias presume to enforce law and order in
 regions under their control, arresting, imprisoning, and
 executing persons on purely criminal charges. The
 Israeli-funded Army of South Lebanon maintains a detention
 center in Rhiam, which neutral observers have not been allowed
 to visit.
 The Government does not, as a rule, arrest or exile its
 political opponents. Fear of assassination by political
 rivals has, however, driven several prominent Lebanese into
 voluntary exile, and the general decline in public security
 has stimulated the emigration of many Lebanese.
 The Government does not use forced labor. In the present
 'anarchy, however, militias have forced workers, especially
 immigrant laborers, to perform unpaid duties such as filling
 sandbags for use in building defenses against attack and
 cleaning of militia offices. Hospitals and physicians are
 sometimes also required to provide services free to the army
 and the militias. In the case of the army, the mechanism for
 reimbursement exists, but the central Goverempnt has not
 fulfilled its obligation for several years. The militias use
 the authority of the gun to claim the same privilege as the
 
 
 1226
 LEBANON
 army. This wide-scale nonpayment for medical services has
 contributed significantly to the growing emigration of doctors.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Lebanese law, practice, and custom provide the right to a fair
 publi6 trial. A decade of war, however, has disrupted the
 judicial process, and many cases remain unadjudicated. Trial
 delays result, for example, from the difficulty of conducting
 investigations when most of the country remains beyond
 effective government control from a shortage of judges, and,
 most importantly, from the general breakdown in security.
 Although Lebanese police and courts are present throughout the'
 country, the disposition of criminal cases ultimately depends
 on the group in power locally. For example, militias
 frequently ihtervene to protect their supporters from
 detention and prosecution.
 The Government does not sentence persons to imprisonment for
 essentially'political beliefs or acts. As noted, however,
 militias frequently arrest and imprison members of opposing
 political and military groups. Also, in the case of persons
 arrested in connection with political assassination, the
 detention periqd without trial or recourse to a lawyer can
 drag on for years.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The'Gov(rnment generally has evinced no interest in controlling
 personal life. The law requires the Government to obtain the
 equivalent of a warrant before entering homes, except when the
 Lebanese army is pursuing an armed attacker.
 Rights of privacy, however, are violated frequently in the
 course-of military operations mounted by the army, militias,
 and foreign forces in Lebanon and in the militias'
 administration of'areas under their control. All'of these
 groups.have attempted to gather intelligence on their
 adversaries; these efforts have included informer networks and
 telephone monitoring.
 g. Violations of Humanitarian Law in Armed Conflicts
 In a report on its humanitarian activities to extend
 protection 'and assistance to the civilian population of
 Lebanon during the year 1986, the International Committee of
 the Red Cross noted that outbreaks of fighting in various
 parts of the country often compelled groups of civilians to
 flee their homes or left them isolated in their villages or
 camps, unable to get food or medical care. It noted that both
 crops and homes were pillaged or destroyed in some areas.  It
 also noted the difficulties it had encountered in gaining
 access to persons capture or detained because of the conflict.
 Section.2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Zpeech and Press
 Lebanon has a strong heritage of freedom of opinion, speech,
 and press. The Government traditionally has protected the
 rights of those who have opposed government policies through
 peaceful means.
 
 
 1227
 LEBANON
 Dozens of newspapers and magazines representing a broad
 spectrum of opinion are freely published. Extralegal radios
 and television stations are operated by widely diverse
 political groups. Intimidation of journalists, including
 assassination attempts by militias and terrorists, consituted
 the most serious threat to press freedom. In 1987 two foreign
 journalists were abducted: U.S. journalist Charles Glass
 (kidnaped and held from June 17 to August 18) and French
 journalist Roger Auque (kidnaped July 13 and still held
 hostage). Associated Press correspondent Terry Anderson
 remains hostage 2 1/2 years after his abduction. Few other
 foreign journalists remain in the country.
 While there is an independent press in Lebanon, many
 newspapers and magazines are widely believed to receive
 financial backing from a number of other Middle Eastern
 states--most notably Syria, Libya, and Iran. For this reason,
 these publications reflect the opinions of their patrons on
 various internal, regional, and international issues.
 Christian militias have prevented the regular distribution in
 East Beirut of several leftist and Islamic publications, and
 militias in West Beirut have periodically refused to allow
 distribution of Christian militia publications in their area
 of control. Amal has stopped distribution of Hizballah
 journals in south Lebanon.
 The continued breakdown in security in 1987 greatly disrupted
 schools and universities to the detriment of academic frbedom.
 Radical groups and militiamen continued the intimidation of
 university faculty, administrators, and students, posing a
 serious threat to Lebanon's long tradition of academic freedom.
 As noted earlier, professors were abducted from the campus of
 one West Beirut university. Syrian troops staged a nighttime
 raid on another university's West Beirut campus. Students
 attempting to cross from East to West Beirut to attend classes
 were turned back at the demarcation lines by Christian
 militiamen. Strikes in protest of government inaction towards
 a sharply deteriorating economy further interfered with the
 free pursuit of education. The assassination of the French
 Jesuit director of the south Lebanon branch of one of
 Lebanon's major Western universities was seen as the
 continuation of terrorist activity aimed at driving Western
 education out of Lebanon.
 Behind-the-scenes pressures--both internal and external--
 inhibited the free expression of opinion. Assassinations and
 attempts at assassinations proved a more obvious deterrent to
 openly expressed views and have greatly circumscribed efforts
 at dialogue between Lebanese political factions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government places no restriction on the right of free
 assembly, as long as it does not incite popular unrest. Many
 groups in Lebanon--even the most radical--exercised their
 right to engage in peaceful public demonstrations during the
 year.
 The major constraint came from the militias and foreign
 forces. In areas under the exclusive control of one militia,
 demonstrations or open shows of support for rival militias or
 political groups were not permitted.
 Political groups, such as those which opposed the Israeli
 occupation, are not permitted to operate freely in areas still
 
 
 1228
 LEBANON
 under the control of the Israeli-backed militia. The Syrians
 do not, in general, allow groups openly hostile to them to
 remain in areas they occupy.
 Lebanon has traditionally enjoyed democratic labor and
 management institutions. Collective bargaining and the right
 to strike continue to exist. During the past 12 months, the
 country's largest labor group, the General Confederation of
 Lebanese Workers (CGTL), has called for five general strikes
 which have been observed nationwide. There are no
 comprehensive statistics on union membership, although the
 CGTL claims 200,000 to 250,000 dues-paying members. Employees
 remain highly organized in the banking industry. The CGTL
 sometimes negotiates wage increases with the Government to
 seek'to offset inflation whenever economic pressures dictate.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Government affirms the right of freedom of worship, and
 Lebanese practice their various religions with a great degree
 of liberty.
 The 1943 National Pact essentially allocated political power,
 on a confessional basis, according to the proportion of
 various religious groups in Lebanon as determined by the 1932
 census. The unwritten National Pact stipulated that the
 president would be a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a
 Sunni Muslim,-and the speaker of parliament a Shi'ite Muslim.
 Seats inthe Parliament were-divided on.a six-to-five ratio of
 Christians to Muslims. Positions in the government bureaucracy
 were allocated on a similar basis. Some religious groups thus
 enjoy greater institutionalized political power than others,
 and it has been frequently charged that politically powerful
 groups havp influenced government policies to the economic
 benefit of their coreligionists. Efforts to alter or abolish
 the confessional system-of allocating political power have
 been at the center of Lebanese politics for more than three
 decades. Those religious groups most favored by the 1943
 formula have sought to preserve it, while-others who feel
 disadvantaged by it have sought to revise it on the basis of
 new demographic realities or to abolish, it entirely. This
 struggle has given a strongly religious coloration to Lebanese
 politics and to the continuing civil strife there.
 The intensification of religious hatreds has led away from
 confessional mixing and towards confessional segregation.
 Today, Lebanese live more and more in neighborhoods and
 villages inhabited exclusively by one religious community.
 Many fear to travel to areas where other sects predominate.
 Few Muslims live, for example, in East Beirut. Christians
 continued to leave mainly Muslim West Beirut during 1987,
 complaining of increasing efforts to enforce Islamic mores and
 of a severe deterioration in public security (despite the
 augmentation of a Syrian security force). Virtually no Jews
 remain in their traditional neighborhood in West Beirut.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigation and Repatriation
 The Government does not restrict foreign travel by Lebanese
 citizens. Emigration and dual citizenship are permitted.
 There is no impediment to voluntary repatriation by Lebanese
 with valid identity papers.
 
 
 1229
 LEBANON
 Lebanon historically has been a land of asylum. During this
 century, it has .given refuge to hundreds of thousands of
 Armenians and Palestinians as well as to smaller numbers from
 other Middle Eastern ethnic and religious groups. Lebanon's
 political and economic troubles in recent years have greatly
 diminished its.appeal to refugees.
 Lebanon's relationship with the Palestinian community has been
 difficult. Most Palestinians, like other foreigners, have not
 been able to obtain Lebanese citizenship. Their status as a
 "state within a state" under the 1969 Cairo Accords (abrogated
 in 1987) and their involvement in internal fighting from 1975
 to 1982 and again from 1985 until 1987 resulted in the bitter
 enmity of many other groups. In the wake of the 1982 conflict,
 many Palestinians encountered difficulty in renewing residence
 permits and travel documents, and delays still continue. In
 1987 Palestinian combatants continued to return to Lebanon,
 and there were serious battles between them and Shi'ite
 Lebanese militias.
 Lebanese traditionally enjoyed freedom of internal travel, but
 this freedom has been greatly circumscribed by militia groups
 which have established checkpoints to keep those deemed
 undesirable out of areas under their control. The Green Line
 bisecting East and West Beirut remained closea'.for lengthy
 periods, effectively dividing the city and paralyzing many
 aspects of daily life in Beirut. Crossing the Green Line even-
 when it was officially open remained extremely risky. The
 Israeli-sponsored Army of South Lebanon maintained tight
 restrictions on the movement of people and goods into and out
 of areas which it occupied.
 Because of the closure of the Green Line, fighting and
 kidnapings along the road to Beirut International Airport, and
 chaotic security conditions at the airport itself, many
 Lebanese encountered  serious difficulties in traveling
 abroad. Travelers unable or unwilling to risk using Beirut
 International Airport, which is located in West Beirut, had
 the option of trav'eling overland to Damascus or using a ferry
 which runs between Jounieh in East Beirut and Larnaca, Cyprus.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights:' The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 In practice, Lebanese citizens do not enjoy the right to
 change their government. Formally, Lebanon is a parliamentary
 democracy. According to its Constitution, direct elections
 must be held for its 99-member Parliament every 4 years.
 Parliament, in turn, elects a president every 6 years, and the
 president appoints a cabinet which must obtain the confidence
 of Parliament. Political parties may be formed. In theory,
 women enjoy the ame civil rights as men, but, in actuality,
 women play almos no significant role in Lebanese politics.
 More than a decade of political turmoil, a greatly expanded
 militia role, and foreign occupation has robbed democratic
 institutions of much of their substance. No parliamentary
 elections have been held since 1972. Although Parliament, the
 Presidency, and the Cabinet continue to exist, their effective
 authority does not extend to most of the country, which is
 under foreign occupation or militia control.
 In the past decade, violence has dominated the political
 process as militia groups and foreign forces have resorted to
 force to gain their way. Leaders of the major factions met in
 
 
 1230
 LEBANON
 Lausanne,, Switzerland in-March 1984 and agreed on a program
 for.;national conciliatin. These leaders later formed a
 atiohbl unity government, but the Cabinet-has not met'since
 early 1986.'       -

 Karami, efforts at dialogue staled, and the boycott of the
 Pregidencyby approximately half of the cabinet members

 The'Gfiernmbnt has- a mixed record' in dealing with international

 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religibh,
 Language, or Social Status
 Women enjoy 'Vqua-lity of--civil" rights and attend instittitions
 of higher lennn in large numbers. -Religion, social
 traditioh; nd the prevailing atmosphere of. insecurity and
 economic-hatdship make it difficult, however,"for'women to

 CONDITIONS OF ABOR
 Lebanon has comprehensive labor laws covering -a range of-"
 issues involving workers" right's, including minimum wages,
 safe working conditions, length-of the Workweek, child labor,
 and ahnul 'holidays. However, given the civil strife and
 weakness'of the central Government, most of the 'statutes are
