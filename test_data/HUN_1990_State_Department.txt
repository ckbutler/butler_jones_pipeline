 HUNGARY
 In 1990 Hungary evolved into a working multiparty democracy.
 The Hungarian Socialist Party was defeated in free
 parliamentary elections in March and April, and a coalition
 government was formed by three of the parties represented in
 Parliament. Jozsef Antall from the Hungarian Democratic Forum
 became Prime Minister, and Arpad Goncz from the opposition
 Alliance of Free Democrats was elected President by the
 Parliament.
 Although the Minister of Interior no longer directly controls
 the police on day-to-day matters, he remains ultimately
 responsible for the police to Parliament. The State Security
 Service also has been removed from control of the Ministry of
 Interior and now reports to a separate Minister without
 Portfolio. The discovery in January that state security was
 continuing to wiretap opposition political figures forced the
 resignation or dismissal of the then Interior Minister and
 other officials. As a result, security matters came under
 closer scrutiny, and after the elections persons without
 Communist connections were appointed to high Interior Ministry
 positions. The Government on March 10, 1990, concluded an
 agreement with the Soviet Government for the withdrawal of all
 Soviet troops from Hungary by June 30, 1991.
 Hungary's economy continued the process of transformation from
 state to private market regulation. Government leaders
 committed themselves to privatization and economic
 restructuring along market lines, while struggling with the
 mechanics of these processes. Major external issues were
 Hungary's $21 billion external gross debt, the movement away
 from trade ties with Communist countries toward world markets,
 and currency convertibility. Internally, the Government
 grappled to control the budget deficit, high inflation fueled
 by subsidy cuts, and the specter of rising unemployment as
 inefficient state industries were shut down or privatized.
 In 1990 Hungary consolidated the signal human rights gains of
 1989. Independent media continued to proliferate, although
 not without some vestiges of government interference. The
 year saw the official death of the Communist labor movement
 and continued development of independent unions and
 organizations. The 1989 landmark law on freedom of conscience
 and religion, which removed restrictions on religious
 practice, paved the way for the reopening of scores of
 religious orders and schools. The Government in February
 restored full diplomatic relations with the Vatican, and a
 Papal Nuncio has since been accredited to Hungary.
 Anti-Semitic expression reappeared in the freer political
 atmosphere, but the Government reiterated its commitment to
 respect and protect the Jewish community.
 In cooperation with the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees, the Government continued to receive and provide for
 a flow of refugees into Hungary that has approached 40,000
 since borders were opened in 1989. Preferential allocations
 of scarce housing and employment to refugees and immigrants
 remained troublesome issues.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section X.-Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 .    Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing-
 There is no evidence that such killings occurred.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 No known instances of torture occurred. There are three
 levels of punitive incarceration: "workhouse," which allows
 some privileges such as visits, outside work, and leave;
 "jail," which is more punitive; and "prison," which means a
 maximum security penitentiary. With varying degrees of
 frequency, depending on levels of imprisonment, prisoners have
 rights to visitation by family members, other relatives, and
 friends. There does not appear to be systematic mistreatment
 of prisoners; and no such cases were reported in 1990.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Persons no longer are subject to arbitrary arrest. Upon
 arrest, they must be informed of the charges against them and
 may be held for a maximum of 72 hours before charges must be
 filed. Persons are allowed access to counsel from the moment
 they are suspects undergoing questioning and throughout all
 subsequent proceedings. The uthorities must specifically
 offer counsel when a person is mentally handicapped, juvenile,
 or unable to afford counsel. There is no bail system.
 Incarceration is limited to 1 year while criminal proceedings
 are in progress. There is no evidence that these procedures
 were violated during 1990 or that any illegal or incommunicado
 detention occurred.
 Search warrants are generally obtained. House searches are
 conducted on the basis of court-approved warrants and must be
 carried out in the.presence of two witnesses. A written
 inventory of items removed from the premises must be
 prepared.
 Under 1989 changes to the Constitution and penal code,
 antistate crimes are defined as those which threaten the
 constitutional principles of the political system or the
 existence of the State. Public criticism of government
 programs and actions is not a punishable crime. There is no
 exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Under the Constitution, courts in Budapest and at the county
 and local levels function under the guidance of the Supreme
 Court. No judge or member of the Supreme Court may belong to
 a political party or engage in political activity. The
 Constitutional Court's 15 members are elected by Parliament
 for one 9-year term.
 Trials are public. Defendants are entitled to counsel during
 all phases of criminal proceedings and-are.presumed innocent
 
 
 1178
 
 HUNGARY
 until proven guilty. Judicial proceedings are generally
 investigative rather than adversarial in nature; there is no
 trial by jury. Decisions of the courts may be appealed if
 they are believed to infringe on individual rights guaranteed
 by the Constitution.
 Hungarian citizens are no longer imprisoned for the peaceful
 expression of political, social, or religious beliefs. Many
 persons convicted and imprisoned by the former regime for
 political reasons were retried or released during 1989 and
 1990. Hungary reportedly released its last four political
 prisoners in September 1990.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In January evidence was uncovered that the state security
 apparatus was continuing to collect information about
 opposition politicians and public figures by using clandestine
 methods, such as wiretapping. As a result of the public
 outcry, several investigations were launched, and the
 Communist Minister of Interior and other high officials
 resigned or were dismissed. After the parliamentary elections
 of March-April, there were no further reports of such
 interference with private communications. In 1990 the
 Ministry of Justice was given legal authority to use
 wiretapping for national security reasons. Although the
 legislation does not refer to criminal investigations, the
 Ministry of Justice may authorize wiretapping for legitimate
 criminal investigations.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are provided for in the Constitution and
 respected in practice. The media routinely reported on the
 full range of world and internal events without restriction,
 and there was no apparent self-censorship in their analysis
 and criticism of government policies and actions.
 Administratively, major Hungarian radio and television
 stations continued as state properties, but the Prime Minister
 and the President, as part of the reform process, appointed
 new management. The new directors appeared to enjoy a high
 degree of autonomy, and opposition views were.fairly
 reported. The top directorship of the official Hungarian news
 agency was opened to public competition. Private radio and
 television stations operated in 1990.
 Independent news publications continued to proliferate, and
 several foreign publishers purchased interests in new and
 existing ventures. Alleged behind-thescenes government
 interference in foreign media investments, including a scandal
 in which a senior government minister favored one of two
 foreign firms seeking to invest in a major newspaper because
 of its editorial views, caused public concern. By September
 the Socialist Party had relinquished all of its national and
 county-level newspapers to private control. Former state-run
 publications, however, were troubled by continuing uncertainty
 over who actually owned their facilities and equipment.

 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Under current law, peaceful public gatherings are allowed as
 long as they do not result in the advocacy or commission of
 crimes, or infringe on-the rights of others. In general, no
 permits are required. for assembly except when a public
 gathering is planned near sensitive installations such as
 military facilities, embassies, and key government buildings.
 Police may sometimes alter or revoke permits, but there does --
 not appear to be official abuse of this right. Gatherings and
 demonstrations to promote a wide variety of political and
 -social causes continued on abroad scale throughout 1990.
 Although mass gatherings were carefully monitored by police
 for public safety reasons, there were no. reports of
 interference with the right to assemble.
 Any 10 or more persons may establish an association, provided
 that it does not commit criminal offenses or disturb the
 rights of others. Associations with charters and elected
 officers must register with the courts. Private Hungarian
 organizations, such as trade associations, political parties
 and legal groups, enjoyed numerous contacts with their
 counterparts-abroad in 1990.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The law on freedom of conscience and religion adopted at the
 end of 1989 radically altered conditions of religious
 expression and education after decades of official
 suppression. Religious denominations became free to establish
 places of worship and instruction. From late 1989 on, more
 than 60 religious orders and numerous seminaries and schools
 were established or reopened. Instructors in religion must
 register once with their local governments, but yearly
 renewals were abolished. Official control of religious
 education ceased.
 Work 'continued on the return of confiscated church properties,
 which is difficult because many such properties were converted
 into social and cultural institutions. Denominations are free
 to establish relations with counterparts abroad. In February
 full diplomatic relations were reestablished with the-Vatican,
 and a Papal Nuncio was accredited to Hungary. As of mid-1990,
 several foreign missionary groups were operating in Hungary,
 some setting up institutes for the training of clergy.
 Although many elements in the new Government are influenced by
 pre-1956 Christian traditions, there is no officially preferred
 religion, and religious affiliation carries no benefits or
 penalties. Hungary is largely Roman Catholic by tradition;
 members of many other faiths practice their religions freely.
 d. rreedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The movement of Hungarian citizens within the country is
 unrestricted. All residents carry identity cards and must
 register with the local town or district council when they
 change residences.
 Foreign travel is generally hindered only by the shortage of
 hard currency for individual use. Nevertheless, the
 unrestricted availability of Hungarian passports valid for all
 countries resulted in an overwhelming flood of "economic
 tourists" to neighboring countries as well as travel
 
 
 1180
 
 HUNGARY
 elsewhere. Current law establishes the right of Hungarians to
 emigrate and of emigres to return freely. Emigration may be
 delayed, but not denied, for those who have significant
 court-assessed debts or who possess state secrets. From
 mid-1989 on, several exiled dissidents returned to Hungary and
 successfully regained their revoked citizenships. A notable
 example was Bela Kiraly, who went into exile after the defeat
 of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, regained his citizenship
 in early 1990, and is now a member of the new Parliament.
 Hungary's 1989 accession to the 1951 U.N. Convention on the
 Status of Refugees and the 1967 Additional Protocol included a
 reservation whereby it bound itself only to accept and care
 for European refugees. In practice, however, persons of all
 nationalities were accepted in 1990 and provided to the best
 of the Government's ability with housing, education, and
 employment aid, despite increasingly severe strains on
 resources.
 Most refugees seeking to stay in Hungary in 1990 continued to
 be Romanian citizens; of these, ethnic Hungarians generally
 had little trouble finding work and acceptance. Public
 tolerance of ethnic Romanians and Gypsies was lower; as
 economic conditions deteriorated, public resentment over what
 was perceived as these groups' preferential access to housing
 and jobs became an increasingly sensitive issue. There were
 several accounts that authorities turned back Romanian
 refugees at the border, and on August 11 Romanian refugees
 threatening a hunger strike at the American Embassy were
 reportedly forcibly repatriated.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Events in 1990 demonstrated the newly acquired right of
 Hungarian citizens peacefully to change their government.
 Parliamentary elections in March and April, which saw the
 overwhelming defeat of the Communist regime, resulted in a
 peaceful transition to a coalition government formed by the
 Hungarian Democratic Forum, the Independent Smallholders
 Party, and the Christian Democratic People's Party which
 together hold 230 of the 386 seats. In opposition were the
 Alliance of Free Democrats, the Federation of Young Democrats,
 and the Hungarian Socialist (formerly Communist) Party.
 In late summer, Parliament passed a local government bill
 designed to transfer many powers to local authorities, and
 local elections were held in September and October. Elections
 were characterized by the participation of multiple parties
 fielding freely chosen slates of candidates, secret balloting,
 and universal suffrage. There was no evidence of fraud or
 coercion in the election processes.
 A late July referendum sponsored by the Hungarian Socialist
 Party to have the president elected by popular vote instead of
 by Parliament failed because of insufficient voter turnout.
 Executive autonomy is promoted through statutes prohibiting
 Members of Parliament from holding any other governmental
 positions.
 There are no restrictions, in law or in practice, on the
 participation of women in government or politics.
 Participation of women in the highest levels of government,
 however, remains very limited. A few Members of Parliament
 are of minority ethnic background, but no minority party
 
 
 1181
 
 HUNGARY
 candidate ran for office in the national legislature. In an
 attempt to promote minority representation, the Government
 devised a system of minority lists for elections to local
 governments and in September authorized a $240,000 fund to
 support minority candidates in local elections.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 At least four well-known humanorights monitoring groups
 operate freely in Hungary: the Hungarian Helsinki Committee,
 the Hungarian Chapter of Amnesty International, the Wallenberg
 Associhtion for Minority Rights, and the Hungarian Human
 Rights Federation. A 25-member parliamentary committee for
 human, minority, and religious rights oversees the field of
 human rights. Hungary in 1990 was not subject to allegations
 or investigations of human rights abuses by any international
 or nongovernmental body. It worked actively in the United
 Nations and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in
 Europe to promote human and minority rights. Hungary's
 particular preoccupation is the welfare of its ethnic
 minorities in neighboring countries; a separate government
 office was established during 1990 to promote the rights of
 Hungarians abroad.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Hungary's largest minority group is the Gypsies, who account
 for roughly 5 percent of its population of 10.3 million.
 Conditions of life within the Gypsy community are
 significantly poorer than among the general populace. Gypsies
 tend to be considerably less educated, have lower than average
 incomes, and have a life expectancy that falls several years
 short of national norms. Gypsies reportedly account for over
 half of Hungary's unemployed, and the crime rate in the Gypsy
 community is nearly double that in the general population.
 The Government sponsors programs both to preserve Gypsy
 language and cultural heritage and to assist social and
 economic assimilation. Beginning in mid-1990, the media
 increased public discussion of Gypsy issues and reflected
 official sensitivity.to heavyhanded treatment of Gypsies under
 the Communist regime. Widespread popular prejudice continues,
 however, along with de facto discrimination in housing and
 jobs. In June the various Gypsy rights organizations were
 assembled under the umbrella of a new national oversight body,
 the Nationality Council of Gypsy Organizations.
 Hungary's Jewish community in 1990 was the object both of
 rising expressions of anti-Semitism and of government efforts
 to affirm and protect its status. There were scattered
 reports of anti-Semitic provocations, including an
 inflammatory January radio broadcast by a nationalist Member
 of Parliament, Istvan Csurka, and a September incident of
 verbal abuse of children in a largely Jewish school supported
 by private American funds. The Government consistently
 condemned all anti-Semitic activities and responded with
 action when required. For example, the police promptly
 arrested those in the school incident. In July the Government
 demonstrated its support for the Jewish community when
 President Goncz, Prime Minister Antall, and a score of top
 leaders attended the dedication of the new holocaust memorial.

 HUNGARY
 Legally, women have the same rights as men, including
 identical inheritance and property rights. There is no overt
 employment discrimination against women. However, the number
 of women in middle or upper managerial positions is low.
 The embryonic women's rights movement has had no noticeable
 impact on societal attitudes, although at least one official
 feminist organization was in operation as of late 1989. Wife
 beating is reportedly common. While there are laws against
 rape, it often goes unreported because public attitudes toward
 crimes of rape have not kept up with legal prohibitions.
 Marital sexual abuse is not an acknowledged legal concept.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 In March the old Communist labor umbrella organization, SZOT,
 disbanded, and a successor body, the Confederation of
 Hungarian Trade Unions (MSzOSz), took its place. With the
 demise of SZOT, Hungary cut its ties to the Communist-
 controlled World Federation of Trade Unions. Although
 nominally reformed, the MSzOSz' credentials suffered because
 of its holdover leadership and perceived efforts to retain
 control of trade union properties and assets. Initially, a
 majority of trade unions formerly affiliated with SZOT joined
 the MSzOSz, but several later left, and many elected to join
 other umbrella groups or remain independent. At year's end,
 four major groupings dominated the labor scene: MSzOSz; the
 Democratic League of Independent Trade Unions, formed in 1989;
 Workers' Solidarity, a small blue-collar coordinating group;
 and nonaffiliated unions. Independent unions continued to
 proliferate, and workers, on the whole, were able to join them
 without interference. There remained, however, a so-called
 checkoff system that workers must go through to relinquish
 MSzOSz membership, which other union groups denounced as an
 unfair pressure tactic and sought to have abolished.
 Legislation passed in 1990 gives all workers, excluding
 judicial and military personnel and police, the right to
 strike. A miners' strike in July resulted in changed plant
 management, higher wages, and improved pension provisions for
 the striking workers; a major transport strike occurred in
 October. Unions are free to form confederations and affiliate
 with international labor organizations. Hungarian unions now
 maintain extensive relationships with such bodies as the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Ministry of Labor is responsible for labor-related
 legislation, while special labor courts enforce labor laws.
 Legally, the right to organize is ensured, and striking
 workers are protected against antiunion discrimination.
 However, there were reports in 1990 of enterprise managers,
 including Western managers involved in Hungarian firms,
 attempting to interfere with labor organization inside their
 enterprises. The Mihistry of Labor pledged to work with labor
 groups to prevent such activity.
 No change occurred in the mechanism of "interest
 coordination," or wage negotiation between labor and
 management based on government guidelines, which provides for
 some degree of collective bargaining. There are no
 export-processing zones or other special economic zones.
 
 
 1183
 HUNGARY
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Compulsory labor laws were abolished by Parliament in June,
 1989. There were no reports of forced or compulsory labor in
 1990.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The labor courts enforce Hungary's minimum-employment age of
 15 years. There does not appear to be any significant abuse
 of this statute.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Hungary's legal minimum wage was raised in 1990 to about
 $82 per month. With price increases resulting from the
 lifting of subsidies on many basic goods and services, this
 does not provide an adequate living for workers and their
 families; -real incomes dropped during the year by around 4
 percent. In order to-maintain a decent standard of living,
 many Hungarians supplement their primary employment with
 second and even third jobs.
 The average official workweek is 40 hours. This does-not
 apply to secondary employment. Under existing law, workers
 receive overtime, a minimum of 15 days of paid leave per year,
 free health care, and pensions. Federal labor courts enforce
 . occupational.safety standards for work places, but specific
 safety conditions are not up to internationally accepted
 standards.
