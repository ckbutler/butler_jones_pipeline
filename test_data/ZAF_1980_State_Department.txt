 SOUTIL AFRICA
 The governing reality of life in the Republic of South
 Africa is apartheid. This system of racial discrimina-
 tion and separation, sometimes called "separate develop-
 ment," institutionalizes white political and economic
 control. The 16% white minority generally enjoys politi-
 cal freedoms and a high standard of living. The 84%
 black majority, composed of persons of African, Colored
 (mixed race) and Asian background, suffers pervasive dis-
 crimination which severely limits its political, social
 and economic life.
 Apartheid evolved from and is dependent upon the white
 monopoly of national political power. The Constitution of
 South Africa, as amended since the Nationalist Party came
 to power in 1948, denies all persons who are not white the
 right to vote and to be a member of the Parliament. The
 Constitution contains no bill of rights and provides com-
 plete parliamentary sovereignty. Moreover, the courts'
 power to construe or apply legislation has been limited by
 successive grants of virtually unreviewable discretion to
 the executive in many important areas, especially limita-
 tion of rights and freedoms for "security" reasons.
 The South African Government'(SAG) contends that, because
 of South Africa's ethnic and cultural diversity and the
 present economic and educational disparities among its
 constituent groups, an orderly society can best be achiev-
 ed through separation of the races. A web of discriminato-
 ry laws and practices has thus been implemented over the
 years, infusing apartheid principles in all aspects of life.
 Important examples include:  (a) the Constitution itself;
 (b) legislation which limits the citizenship and political
 rights of South Africa's 20.1 million African citizens (72
 percent of the population) to "homelands" comprising 13 per-
 cent of the country's land area; (c) influx control or "pass
 laws, which prescribe the conditions under which black wor-
 kers and their families may remain in urban areas; (d) sepa-
 rate and grossly unequal educational systems for the various
 race groups; (e) labor laws and practices which effectively
 limit the proportion of black workers as a percentage of a
 company's labor force in an urban area, and inhibit the
 growth of free trade union; (f) the Race Classification Act,
 which requires the categorization of every South African
 into one of the four racial groups; (g) the Group Areas Act,
 which mandates separate residential areas for whites,
 Coloreds, and Asians (mostly Indians) and which has result-
 ed in the forced relocation of several hundred thousand
 people; (h) the Immorality and Mixed Marriage Acts, which
 make sexual relations or marriages between persons of dif-
 ferent races illegal; and (i) the Separate Amenities Act,
 which authorizes the exclusive use of public facilities by
 persons of a particular race without requiring equivalent
 facilities for other racial groups. The operation of these
 laws not only has left the African majority without a voice
 in the national government, but also has severely limited
 geographic mobility and access to education and employment
 opportunities, and denied them acceptance as equal members
 of South African society.
 The Government has through the years enacted legislation
 
 
 239
 that,.in the name of security,-drastically curtails the
 civil liberties of those persons (of all races) whose
 statements, actions, or associations are viewed as serious-
 ly challenging the established order. Security laws were
 frequently used during 1980 to detain and convict persons
 involved in school boycotts, labor strikes, and the acti-
 vities of black political organizations. Several persons
 who advocated peaceful opposition to Government policies
 through joint action by blacks and whites were prohibited
 from attending gatherings for periods ranging from two to
 five years, and the Government banned all political meetings
 of more than ten people for two and one-half months during
 the year. Restrictions on press reporting of internal
 security matters were tightened, and newsmen were at one
 point barred from entering black townships during periods
 of unrest.
 In the face of domestic and international criticism, and
 a degree of diplomatic isolation, the SAG defends its
 policies as a 4ecessary response to unique circumstances.
 Over the past several years, however, the Government has
 initiated a limited relaxation of certain prohibitions
 against social mixing of the races and promoted other
 changes which would allow increased, but not full, parti-
 cipation in the political life of the nation by Africans,
 Coloreds, and Asians. These efforts continued during
 1980; the Government allowed a small number of establish-
 ments to open their doors to all racial groups. It also
 appointed persons to a multi-racial 60-member "President's
 Advisory Codncil" which will draw up proposals for future
 political structures in South Africa. The President's
 Council specifically excludes Africans, and many Colored
 and Asian leaders have refused to participate because of
 this. In addition, the present Government has indicated
 a willingness to engage in dialogue on its own terms with
 a range of black leaders, including a number of moderate
 anti-government figures, but so far little concrete or
 specific has emerged on what fundamental political reforms
 the Government has in mind. The Government has, however,
 reiterated its commitment to preserve separate residential
 areas, schools, churches and social institutions, its
 continuing rejection of "one man one vote" political
 structures, and its insistence that the political aspira-
 tions of Africans should be achieved through "homeland"
 government institutions. Thus, the basic structures of
 apartheid continue to operate much as before, with little
 change in basic patterns of discrimination affecting black
 South Africans.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Torture
 South African security laws, while they do not condone
 torture, provide police considerable latitude in arrest-
 ing suspects and questioning detainees. For example,
 Section 6 of the Terrorism Act of 1967 permits detention
 for the purposes of interrogation until a detainee has
 "satisfactorily replied to all questions" or until it is
 decided that further detention serves no purpose. Other
 statutes are interpreted to allow such interrogation of
 the detainees as seems "reasonable to the Government."
 Although there have been no known deaths of security
 detainees since mid-July 1978 (contrasting with 52 deaths
 between 1963 and 1978), defendants and witnesses in a num-
 ber of recent political trials testified in court that
 
 
 240
 they had been assaulted or abused by police during interro-
 gation. In a trial in Krugersdorp in August 1979, the State
 conceded that former Soweto student leader, Linda Mogale,
 had been assaulted by police while detained. Others charged
 that they had been beaten, kicked, subjected to electric
 shocks, and deprived of food, water, and sleep. In three
 instances during 1980, detainees or their families applied
 for court orders to restrain police from assaulting the
 detainees.
 Following the death in detention of black conciousness leader
 Steve Biko in 1977, thi SAG began a practice of appointing
 two retired justices, designated by the Minister of Justice,
 to visit security detainees and file regular confidential
 reports of their findings to the Minister of Justice. This
 practice continued throughout 1980. In September 1980 sev-
 eral released detainees charged that complaints they had made
 to the visiting inspectors resulted in no changes in the con-
 ditions of their detention.
 According to the annual report of the Commissioner of Prisons,
 373 prison personnel were charged with assault between July
 1978 and July 1979 (the latest available figures); 226 were
 found guilty. During the same year 308 prisoners died; 230
 of these deaths were listed as resulting from natural causes,
 35 as a result of assaults from other prisoners, and the
 remaining 43 due to suicide, attempted escape, accidents, or
 unknown causes. The average number of prisoners during
 1978/79 was given as 98,292.
 The Rabie Commission, appointed by the Government in August
 1979 to examine security laws and propose changes, continued
 its study throughout the year.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment;
 Prison conditions in South Africa have been criticized in
 the past for being unduly harsh for political prisoners,
 particularly those incarcerated on Robben Island. Reports
 indicate a marked improvement in conditions at this prison
 since 1973. Released prisoners have privately acknowledged
 this improvement: hard labor details have been ended;
 food, clothing and living conditions have improved; and
 edited news broadcasts and some local and international
 publications are now available.
 The Minister of Prisons acknowledged, in response to a
 parliamentary question in May 1980, that 14 persons under
 the age of 18 were serving sentences on Robben Island, of
 whom six were convicted under security legislation. In
 addition, in October 1980 two 14-year olds and three 15-
 year olds were detained under Section 6 of the Terrorism
 Act.
 South Africa has a parole system for short-term prisoners
 under which such prisoners are employed by private indivi-
 duals and companies, mostly on farms, as an alternative to
 incarceration. The Department of Prisons states that pris-
 oners are not coerced to accept such employment, and that
 those who accept are allowed to choose their employers. A
 number of black prisoners employed under the parole labor
 system, including many Africans convicted under influx con-
 trol laws, have charged mistreatment by their white employers.
 In 1979, 133 persons were executed in South Africa, one
 more than in 1978, the previous record. Of these, 98 were
 
 
 241
 Africans, 33 were Colored, and 2 were white. The James
 Mange death sentence of November 1979, which provoked pro-
 test as the first death sentence for treason in peacetime
 and without a collateral murder charge, was commuted to 20
 years imprisonment in September 1980. Three persons were
 sentenced to death for treason im a trial in Pretoria in
 November 1980; their cases have been appealed to the Appel-
 late Division of the South African Supreme Court. In
 another case, convicted murderer Leslie Sikweyiya had his
 death sentence and conviction overturned on appeal to the
 Appeals Court in Bloemfontein in June 1980. Under South
 African security legislation, which permits broad interpre-
 tation and severe punishment, the death sentence can tech-
 nically be imposed for an almost unlimited number of ac-
 tions not associated with the death sentence in democratic
 countries.
 Under the Internal Security Act, the Minister of Justice
 may invoke a banning order against any person he or she
 finds to be engaging in activities considered dangerous
 to the security of the State or the maintenance of public
 order. A banning order usually restricts a person to a
 particular area, prohibits visiting certain facilities
 or attending "gatherings" (defined as any group consist-
 ing of the banned person and more than one other indivi-
 dual), and prohibits the banned person from pursuing his
 or her livelihood. When the banning order restricts an
 individual to a remote part of the country or to an area
 other than the individual's domicile at the time of the
 banning, it is commonly referred to as banishment. Ban-
 ning orders are usually imposed for periods ranging from
 two to five years and may be renewed. Because the im-
 position of a banning order may be challenged in court
 only if it can be shown that the Minister acted in bad
 faith or did not consider the matter carefully, a banned
 person is without legal recourse, as the Minister is not
 required to disclose reasons for issuing a banning order.
 According to a SAG gazette published on July 18, 1980,
 there were 154 banned persons, of whom 119 were black and
 35 were white. On December 29 three-year banning orders
 were issued to Zwelakhe Sisulu and Marimuthu Subramoney.
 c. Disappearances
 South African laws do not require notification of a de-
 tainee's family, lawyer, or any other person when the in-
 dividual is detained or released. In fact, the Second
 Police Amendment Act of 1980 prohibits unauthorized pu-
 blication of the name of any person detained during a
 police action "for the prevention or combatting of ter-
 roristic activities." Police spokesmen usually do not
 volunteer information on detainees, although they respond
 to written inquiries about their status.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Several South African statutes provide for arrest and de-
 tention for varying lengths of time without reference to
 the courts. The General Laws Amendment Act of 1966,
 Terrorism Act, Internal Security Act, and Criminal Proce-
 dures Act of 1977 all provide for arrest without a warrant
 under certain circumstances. A person may be detained for
 14 days without charge before being brought to court under
 Section 22 of the General Laws Amendment Act of 1966, for
 180 days (which may be renewed) under Section 12(b) of the
 Internal Security Act, and for an indefinite period of
 
 
 242
 time under Section 6 of the Terrorism Act. While detain-
 ed under these provisions a person does not have access to
 legal counsel until charged or brought to court as a witness,
 and a Section 6 detainee can be held in solitary confine-
 ment without access to anyone, including family and legal
 counsel. In addition to these laws, preventive detention
 for up to 12 months at a time is authorized by Section 10
 of the Internal Security Act, although a committee consist-
 ing of a judge or magistrate and two other persons may re-
 commend (but not require) a detainee's release. Section
 10 detainees are entitled to and normally receive privi-
 leges accorded ordinary prisoners awaiting trial.
 The year 1980 was marked by school boycotts and labor strikes
 in various parts of the country. According to the South
 African Institute of Race Relations, at least 965 persons
 were detained in 1980, including 146 in the Ciskei, 41 in
 the Transkei, 1 in Venda, and 768 in the rest of South Africa.
 Of those detained, 341 were primary or secondary school stu-
 dents; 117 were college or university students; 32 were
 teachers or principals; 67 were political leaders; 39 were
 community workers; 21 were trade unionists; and 10 were
 journalists. The occupation of the other detainees were not
 known. Although the exact number of persons in detention is
 unknown, it is believed that most had been released by the
 end of the year except in the Ciskei where other sources re-
 port that 50-100 students are still being held by police.
 In addition to those detained, 36 persons were sentenced to
 a total of 227 years imprisonment for offenses under the
 Terrorism Act, and 14 other were banned under the Internal
 Security Act. As of March 10, 1980 a total of 482 persons
 were serving sentences on Robben Island for political of-
 fenses. Nine other political prisoners were incarcerated
 elsewhere in the Republic.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 While the principle of habeas corpus is affirmed in South
 African common law, it is circumscribed in practice by
 various security law provisions as noted above. In gen-
 eral, all persons except those detained under Section 22
 of the General Laws Amendment Act of 1966 and Section 6
 of the Terrorism Act have the right to counsel. If a
 person cannot pay for his or her own defense, the publicly
 financed legal aid boards or various private organizations
 have funds for legal assistance, but these sources do not
 accept all cases, nor do they meet more than a small fraction
 of the total need. Only in cases involving capital offenses,
 the court may appoint counsel without charge. Once legal
 assistance is obtained and paid for, a defendant has access
 to counsel throughout the course of proceedings. While con-
 victed prisoners are generally allowed access to their at-
 torneys, the timing and frequency of such visits are at the
 discretion of prison authorities where the prisoner is
 incarcerated. Many lawyers who defend persons accused under
 security laws have alleged harassment by the security police
 and government agencies. Several attorneys who defended per-
 sons accused in political trials have been banned or have
 fled the country.
 Because an individual may be-interrogated under security law
 detention without access to counsel, that person may admit
 to actions or charges, the implications of which he or she
 may not fully understand. Such statements may be admissible
 in court. The Terrorism Act provides for unlimited detention
 until "no useful purpose will be served by further detention".
 No court can order release of the detainee. Long periods of
 
 
 243
 detention in solitary confinemgent, and reported assaults
 and/or inducements to make statements may also jeopardize
 a detainees's ability to be effectively represented and
 obtain a fair trial. In being brought to trial, an indivi-
 dual may not be aware that legal assistance has been
 obtained. In several instances attorneys retained by fami-
 lies of detained persons have found out through newspaper
 articles shortly before the fact that their client was about
 to be brought to trial. In addition, an increasing number
 of trials are held "in camera" and some trials are held in
 distant parts of the country making it difficult or impos-
 sible for family and others to attend.
 South African law acknowledges the right to bail, but in
 cases involving certain crimes or security laws a magis-
 trate may withhold bail. No court is permited to grant
 trial to a person charged under the Terrorism Act without
 the consent of the Attorney General. Trial by jury was
 abolished by Parliament in 1969. Protection against double
 jeopardy, recognized in the Criminal Procedure Act of 1977
 (the comprehensive statute governing South African criminal
 law), is undermined by the Sabotage Act and the Terrorism
 Act, which provide that a person may be tried for another
 offense deriving from the same action. In addition, charges
 under Section 2 of the Terrorism Act and Section 11 of the
 Internal Security Act reverse the presumption that a person
 is innocent until proven guilty. Under Section 2 of the
 Terrorism Act, a person must prove beyond a reasonable
 doubt that an act which he or she is proved to have commit-
 ted was not undertaken with the intent to endanger the
 maintenance of law and order. This Act prohibits activi-
 ties that are likely "to cause substantial financial loss
 to any person or the State," also actions "calculated to
 create feelings of hostility between whites and blacks.
 Under Section 11, a person must prove beyond a reasonable
 doubt that he or she did not undergo training or obtain in-
 formation which could further the objects of communism or
 any unlawful organization.    Security as well as criminal
 trials are held before regular courts, which are generally
 regarded as being independent of executive or military
 control. However, in August 1980 it was revealed that a
 code of conduct for magistrates issued by the Department
 of Justice requested magistrates not to criticize Govern-
 ment departments in judgments unless such criticism was
 felt absolutely essential to a judgment. In addition, the
 appointment of several civil servants as judges has led to
 charges that the Government is attempting to influence the
 courts in this manner. There have been no recent cases of
 civilians being tried by military courts and no known sum-
 mary executions.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The Black Urban Areas Consolidation Act allows police entry
 to homes without a warrant if they suspect any black person
 may be illegally residing or employed therein. In addition,
 black persons have been forcibly removed from their homes
 in connection with Government-ordered relocation to areas
 designated for different racial groups or homeland areas.
 Section 25 of the Criminal Procedures Act of 1977 authori-
 zes a judge or magistrate to issue a search warrant if
 there are reasonable grounds to believe that "the internal
 security of the Republic or the maintenance of law and
 order is likely to be endangered by or in consequence of
 any meeting" being held in a given place. Under Section 25
 a police officer may enter, search, and question anyone in
 
 
 244
 a place without a warrant if-the officer has reason to be-
 lieve that a warrant for such purposes would be issued but
 that the delay caused by first obtaining the warrant would
 defeat the purpose of the search.
 2. Government Policies Relating to Fulfillment of Vital
 Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 Economic Situation
 South Africa was, until very recently, categorized by the
 IMF as one of the "more developed primary producing coun-
 tries." It has now been reclassified as one of the "non-
 oil developing countries." South Africa's economy is in
 fact dualistic in nature. While the majority of South
 Africans of all races make their living from the modern
 sector, only the whites are truly integrated in the devel-
 oped sector. Only a small, although rapidly increasing,
 number of urban blacks are in skilled, technical, or pro-
 fessional level work. The traditional (black) agricultu-
 ral sector does not begin to support the black rural pop-
 ulation. Very few blacks, particularly women, are able
 to participate meaningfully in South Africa's free enter-
 prise capitalist economic system. On the basis of such
 indicators as educational achievement, infant mortality,
 and per capita income, South Africa is a'developing coun-
 try. More accurately, "white" South Africa is developed,
 "black" South Africa is developing. In fact, standards
 of living and per capita income in the country's African
 "homelands, where 9.7 million Africans reside, are com-
 parable with some of the poorest African nations.
 The GDP per capita in South Africa at the end of 1979 was
 $2,040 and GNP $1,955. However, white per capita GDP is
 probably in the range of $8,000 to $10,000. There is no
 definitive account of the distribution of national income
 by race. Several academic studies assign a racial income
 share to white South Africans of 70 percent, Africans 20
 percent, and Coloreds/Indians 10 percent. Although approx-
 imations, the order of magnitude indicates a high degree
 of racial income inequality. Further indicators of racial
 income inequality include:
 (1) Life Expectancy: The average life span for
 whites is 65 years and for Africans 52 years. Coloreds
 have a life expectancy of only 49 years.
 (2) Infant Mortality Rate (IMR): Whites have an
 IMR of 18 per thousand, Asians 28 per thousand. The
 Colored IMR nationally is 89/1,000, but is much lower
 in Cape Town and higher in some rural communities. The
 Government does not gather statistics on the IMR of Afri-
 cans. Estimates by medical practitioners range from
 46/1,000 in Soweto to as high as 300/1,000 in some rural
 areas. A paper presented at a University of Cape Town
 conference on health care in 1978 reported an IMR of
 220/100,000 for African children, and a recent editorial
 in the South African medical journal asserted that one
 half of all African children in South Africa die before
 their fifth birthday.
 (3) Wage Rates: The average annual remuneration
 for white employees in 1976 was four times that of blacks.
 (4) Per Capita Income Ratios: The ratio of white to
 black income per capita on a national basis is generally
 estimated in a range between 8:1 and 13:1. The white/
 
 
 245
 African ratio is in a range of-12:1 to 15:1. Black income
 has, however, been increasing faster than white in recent
 years, and the black share may be increasing somewhat.
 (5) Disease: In 1979, of the 45,000 reported new
 cases of tuberculosis, 98 percent were black. (The South
 African Tuberculosis Association estimates that three
 times as many cases were not reported.)
 SAG Record in Providing Economic Rights
 The SAG's economic policies have in recent years generally
 been directed at promoting growth rather than wealth re-
 distribution or equity. This approach has produced a good
 record of economic growth. To the extent that this growth
 has brought more jobs and higher wages, many blacks have
 benefited. However, the sharing in the benefits of
 growth has been uneven. South Africa's blacks have been
 relatively disadvantaged vis-a-vis whites with respect to
 all four of the basic economic rights.
 (1) Property Rights: While a private enterprise econ-
 omic system exists in South Africa, it is Government policy
 that Africans are allowed to own property by freehold title
 only in the homelands, subject to tribal communal land
 restrictions. Whites, Coloreds, and Indians can own homes
 and businesses only in their own designated "group areas."
 The SAG two years ago extended to certain Africans in "white
 areas" (with the exception of the western Cape) the right to
 occupy property under 99-year leasehold. While thousands of
 Africans have applied for these leases, few have been granted
 to date.
 The Groups Areas Act has raised the cost of property to
 Coloreds and Indians by limiting the supply of land, housing
 and commercial property. Ownership of business property by
 Coloreds and Indians outside of group areas designated for
 them is limited to certain open trading areas delineated by
 the Government. African businessmen cannot own property
 outside the homelands (including the property on which they
 operate). Moreover, the 450 laws which regulate African
 business have restricted the real growth in the number of
 African entrepreneurs, and prevented them from expanding
 their activities.
 (2) Work Conditions and Remuneration: Past legisla-
 tion (e.g., Industrial Conciliation Apprenticeship, Wages,
 mines and Works, Native Labor Regulation, and Land Acts)
 designed to protect the privileged position of whites has
 had the effect of restricting economic opportunities for
 blacks.
 Barriers to collective bargaining and to occupational mobi-
 lity, severe restrictions on land purchase, and lack
 of access to equivalent education and training have all
 worked to keep black earnings artificially low. In many
 cases wages of whites are higher and wages of Africans
 lower than they would be in a more perfectly competitive
 labor market. In 1976, the last year for which figures
 are available, the average annual remuneration for white
 employees was R3,299 for blacks, the average annual wage
 was R748.
 Historically, there have been two distinct South African
 labor markets, skilled (white) and unskilled (black).
 While the black skilled workforce is becoming increasingly
 
 
 246
 important, and the real wage gap between white and black
 skilled workers appears to be narrowing, the wage gap
 between skilled and unskilled workers, and between salari-
 ed employees (largely white) and employees paid on an hour-
 ly basis (largely black) remains large. There is no
 national minimum wage, although industrial council agree-
 ments set legally binding base remuneration levels for
 certain industries.
 The South African economy has been enjoying boom condi-
 tions since early 1980 resulting in a modest increase in
 employment. However, because of a rapid rate of entry of
 new workers into the labor force, there has been little
 if any decrease in unemployment. There is very little
 white unemployment, but black unemployment'in recent years
 has been growing due to the high black population growth
 rate and increasing capital intensity of agriculture and
 industry.South Africa's real economic growth rate in mid-
 1980 was around 8 percent, and the inflation rate approach-
 ed 15 percent.
 The level of unemployment has a significant influence
 on South African working conditions and remuneration.
 While skilled labor is in extremely short supply and
 can command a wage premium in today's market, there is
 a high level of unemployment among black unskilled wor-
 kers. A Government -urvey of non-agricultural workers in
 May 1980 put the African unemployment figure at 486,000.
 The Institute of Race Relations suggests a figure of two
 million may be an accurate estimate, if black agricultural
 workers are included. Whatever the actual numbers might
 be, there is an abundance of unskilled black labor. Con-
 sequently, unskilled blacks have little leverage to nego-
 tiate better working conditions or remuneration. Striking
 unskilled workers frequently are dismissed en masse by
 employers; once dismissed, they are legally regarded as
 unemployed and consequefitly illegally present in'the so-
 called white areas of South Africa. On several occasions
 in 1980 (Johannesburg municipal workers strike, Cape meat
 workers strike), dismissed workers have been involuntarily
 transported to nearby homelands.
 The relative weakness of free trade unionism in South
 Africa is another major determinant of wages and working
 conditions. Of South Africa's 9.4 million working popula-
 tion, only 756,000 or 8.1 percent are members of unions.
 The combined claimed African trade union membership is
 about 100,000. Black trade unionism is, therefore, still
 in the survival state, with only slightly more than one
 percent of the African labor forc6 unionized. The bulk of
 the black workforce--Government employees, agricultural
 and domestic workers--are not unionized. The Government
 has in the past year begun to grant registration for the
 first time to black trade unions. The legal prohibition
 of mixed-race unions has been retained, but the Government
 has authorized them on an individual, exemption basis. At
 the end of 1980, the Government had under consideration a
 Labor Relations Amendment Bill which would give registered
 unions the right to admit members of any race without
 special permission from the Government.
 While a relatively important proportion of the Indian and
 Colored workforce is moving up the occupational ladder,
 the proportion of the African workforce which has advanced
 is still relatively small, although the absolute numbers
 are growing. This upward occupational mobility for blacks
 
 
 247
 
 is happening largely as the result of market forces (parti-
 cularly the demand for skilled workers), and not because
 of legislation or SAG administrative support. Job reser-
 vation has, however, been largely dismantled over the last
 few years, but long-standing practice and restrictions on
 union organization have continued to exclude blacks from
 many occupations.
 Work conditions vary greatly from industry to industry.
 Agricultural workers are perhaps the poorest paid. Most
 miners are migrants, and live in single-sex hostels; they
 do, however, usually receive good health care, and pay is
 improving. Many black workers are forced to live long dis-
 tances from their work meaning extra costs and more time
 commuting.
 (3) Post-work Security: There is no comprehensive
 national social security scheme in South Africa. Men over
 65 and women over 60 are eligible for old age pensions,
 subject to citizenship and residence qualifications, and a
 means test. In 1977 some 135,000 whites and 182,000 Africans
 received old age pensions. The number of Africans being
 paid old age pensions directly by the SAG has been declining
 steadily'since 1960, as homelands authorities have become
 increasingly responsible for African social security.
 Over 30,000 people, mostly whites and Coloreds, get veterans'
 pensions. Pensions and other maintenance grants are mutual-
 ly exclusive, i.e., one cannot simultaneously receive an old
 age pension and a veterans' pension, or unemployment insurance.
 The vast majority of pensions, black and white, are paid by
 private pension schemes, often financed jointly by employer
 and employee. Pensions tend to be very modest in terms of
 the cost of living. Average white pensions are greater than
 those of blacks by a multiple of over three to one. In October
 1980 the monthly pensions for whites was R109, for Coloreds
 and Indians R62, and for Africans R33.  ($1.00 = .75 Rand.)
 (4) Standard of Living Adequate for Health and Well-Being:
 Most whites in South Africa enjoy a very high material stand-
 ard of living comparable to residents of most OECD countries.
 Black living standards vary widely, but available data strongly
 argues that the basic needs of the majority of blacks are not
 being met. In addition to low income, black urban dwellers
 frequently face high levels of crime, crowding, and lack of
 such modern facilities as electricity. Homeland Africans
 are often worse off, many living at the edge of physical
 subsistence. Rural black South Africa is beset by unemploy-
 ment, widespread poverty and malnutrition.
 Blacks have virtually no voice in either their taxation or
 in the allocation of State revenues. South Africa has a
 progressive income tax on individuals and companies and is
 in the process of equalizing the income tax liability of
 whites and blacks. As a result of the racial income dis-
 parities, few blacks pay a significant amount of income tax.
 The SAG allocates public funds among whites on the basis of
 equity or of need. There is no policy of attempting to
 provide blacks with services comparable to those received
 by whites. Consequently, living standards vary tremendous-
 ly among blacks, fall far below those of whites, and perpe-
 tuate chronic poverty. Huge shortages exist in practically
 all public facilities and services available to blacks:
 education, housing, transport, health, and police protection
 
 
 248
 Health
 In 1977/1978 Parliament allotted R877 million or 2.23 per-
 cent of its GNP, to white health. The comparable figure
 allocated for Africans was R89.1 million, or 0.23 percent.
 These figures do not tell the whole story, however, because
 South Africa has no national health scheme, and some hospi-
 tals and clinics are funded by provincial and municipal
 governments. Nevertheless, per capita health expenditure
 on whites is at least several times larger that on blacks.
 While medical services at hospitals and clinics designated
 for blacks are provided at little or no cost, these facili-
 ties are severely overcrowded.
 The bulk of the burden of ill health and disease in South
 Africa falls on the black population as health care tends
 to be curative, not preventive, and for rural blacks, in
 particular, extremely limited in scope and availability.
 The Government announced a reorientation of policy towards
 preventive medicine several years ago, and a number of new
 clinics and hospital for blacks have been opened. One
 serious problem has been the maldistribution of doctors
 between urban and rural areas. The SAG has seconded 800
 doctors and dentists to the homelands, but many rural
 blacks commute to white cities for medical treatment.
 At least 90 percent of South Africa's 17,000 doctorO live
 in the cities, where the majority of whites live, and
 primarily serve the white population. Hospitals are
 segregated by law; but black nurses are allowed to care
 for white patients under certain conditions. South Afri-
 ca, excluding the three "independent" homelands, has 40,000
 hospital beds available for whites, and 65,000 for-blacks.
 Malnutrition is probably the most serious health problem
 nationally and is especially evident among blacks; it con-
 tributes to a high rate of death and illness from other
 causes considered malnutrition-related in the black
 community.
 Education
 The SAG spent more than one billion Rand on white educa-
 tion in 1978 (the latest available figures), compared to
 R254 million on African education in the 1980/81 budget.
 On a per capita basis, state expenditure on white students
 compared to Africans is roughly 10:1. This ratio has been
 declining in recent years, indicating that the Government
 has been devoting proportionately greater resources to
 black education. Still more is spent in the aggregate on
 educating South Africa's 1.4 million white children than
 on three times as many blacks (Africans, Asians, and Color-
 eds). African schools have an average teacher-student
 ratio of 1:47, compared to 1:20 in white schools. Color-
 'ed and African schools have high dropout rates; while 83
 percent of white children aged 7-19 are in school, only
 51 percent of African children are. The trend is, however,
 toward broadening the base of black education. The liter-
 acy rate is nearly 100 percent among whites. Among Afri-
 cans the rate was slightly under 50 percent in the 1970
 census, but is believed to have been substantially raised
 during the 1970s. The year 1980 has witnessed extensive
 boycotts throughout South Africa, particularly by Colored
 and African students, who are protesting unequal education.
 Housing
 While white South Africans are generally well off, a great
 need exists in the black community. However, some white
 old age pensioners were hurt by Government decisions to
 
 
 249
 remove rent control and allow apartment conversion to con-
 dominiums. Such difficulties are dwarfed by housing
 shortages for blacks; the shortage for Africans has been
 estimated by the Urban Foundation at 400,000 units, imply-
 ing that over two million people require housing. In
 Soweto alone, the backlog is estimated at 32,000 houses.
 Available data point to a shift in the public sector away
 from the provision of white housing in favor of more rapid
 production of housing for blacks. However, the Government
 building program, running at around 90,000 houses a year,
 is nowhere near sufficient to keep up with the rate at
 which the black population is growing and blacks are being
 urbenized, both in homelands and in "white" areas.
 Certain discriminatory Government policies have exacerbated
 the housing shortage. The policy of urban influx control
 associated with the migrant labor system is applied in
 practice only to blacks. A major manifestation of influx
 control has been the housing of hundreds of thousands of
 migrant workers in so-called 'bachelor' quarters, or single-
 sex'hostels. With very few exceptions, migrant workers are
 required to leave their families behind in the homelands,
 often for much of their entire working lives. Squatter
 camps have developed in an effort to circumvent Government
 barriers to families living together in the "white" urban
 areas. Another cause of the black housing shortage has been
 enforcement of the Group Areas Act. Since its introduction
 in 1950, nearly half a million people have been moved under
 this legislation; only 2 percent of these have been white.
 In 1980 the Government continued removals under the Group
 Areas Act of a number of black areas, including the Indian
 township of Pageview and the Colored area of District Six.
 Rural-Urban Disparities
 African rural dwellers are deprived of economic rights
 to a greater degree than Africans as a whole. Homelands
 produce only about one-third of their food requirements.
 In addition, the homelands face population pressures caused
 by natural increases and relocation resulting from forced
 uprooting. Large rural towns have come into being, with
 high levels of unemployment, poverty, disease, and crime.
 Many hundreds of thousands of Africans have been forcibly
 moved to the homelands from "white areas" over the last
 twenty years, and the resettlement process is still being
 pursued with vigor by the Government. Africans affected
 by relocation include residents of so-called "black spots"
 in "white South Africa"; tenants and squatters on white
 farms; and Africans relocated from locations in "white"
 towns. The uprooting has spawned large temporary reset-
 tlement camps within the homelands, and added immeasurably
 to the long-term food, housing, and employment problems of
 the homeland governments.
 Government Policy
 The recent "gold bonanza" gave the SAG an opportunity to
 direct additional funds toward improving the standard of
 living for blacks, and for the poor generally. However,
 the 1980/81 budget, while it greatly stimulated the economy,
 included no major effort to improve black living standards
 in any specific social area (e.g., education).
 
 
 250
 Nor did the Government repeal fiajor discriminatory legis-
 altion (e.g., controls on labor mobility). Rather, it
 continued to rely on limited administrative steps to elim-
 inate or mitigate certain aspects of racial discrimina-
 tion in the economic area. For example, certain regula-
 tions imposing racially based limitatons on black econ-
 omic activity were removed; state assistance to blacks
 wanting to establish light industries in the townships
 has been promised; and white capital is now permissible
 in the black townships on a 49/51 percent basis.
 There has, therefore, been little actual progress over the
 last year in extending basic economic rights to the black
 majority of South Africans. Close analysis of many of the
 reforms that have been made reveals them to be more shadow
 than substance and indeed a more sophisticated form control
 over black lives. Some recent Government initiatives, in
 fact, seem to have enforced the existing separation between
 urban blacks with permanent residence rights and rural com-
 muters and migrants without these rights. The SAG is of-
 fering a 'new deal' for blacks living in places like Soweto,
 including greater black labor mobility within the white
 areas, more housing, electricity, and other urban amenities,
 and regional growth points. At the same time, it has tight-
 ened influx control and continues to resettle African and
 Colored people further away from the white areas. Putting
 up barriers between 'insider' and 'outsider' blacks is a
 further step in the political and economic dispossession of
 rural blacks. At the very heart of the question of human
 rights in South Africa is this denial to rural blacks of
 the right, as distinguished from the sometimes-extended
 privilege, of participation in the modern sector of the
 South African economy.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion, and Assembly
 The press, particularly opposition press in South Africa,
 continues to be a vigorous critic of the Government and
 carries extensive reporting and commentary on basic Gov-
 ernment policies, especially in regard to the Government's
 constitutional proposals, separate development in general,
 and the condition of the various racial communities.
 During the 1980 Parliamentary session, however, three laws
 were enacted which further limited the press' ability to
 fully report matters affecting internal security and human
 rights. One of these, the National Key Points Act, which
 provides for the security of installations regarded as
 being strategic, prohibits the publication of "any infor-
 mation relating to the security measures applicable at or
 in respect of any national key points or in respect of any
 incident that ocurred there" without the approval of the
 Minister of Defense. Failure to do so is punishable by a
 fine up to Rl0,000 ($13,300) or three years imprisonment
 or both. Significant press curbs were also contained in
 the Second Police Amendment Act, which prohibits the publi-
 cation of information on the "constitution, movements,
 deployment, or methods of any member or part of the South
 African police" involved in preventing "terrorist" activi-
 ty, or of names of those detained under Section 6 of the
 Terrorism Act, without permission of the Minister or Com-
 missioner of Police. Violation of the Act may be punished
 by a R15,000 fine and/or eight years imprisonment. A third
 
 
 law, the Armaments Development and Production Amendment Act
 of 1980, prohibits the disclosure of any information relat-
 ing to the acquisition, trade, manufacture, or of research
 on armaments in connection with the South African Arms Corp-
 oration or subsidiary companies. In addition to these legis-
 lative acts, the Minister of Police banned all news report-
 ers from entering black townships during disturbances con-
 nected with the fourth anniversary of the 1976 unrest.
 Occasionally, the Government continues to ban particular
 issues of publications without showing cause. As a result
 most editors practice self-censorship, a technique which
 is formalized in the newspaper press unions code of conduct.
 Direct government censorship of all other publications,
 films, and public entertainment is authorized by the Publi-
 cations Act of 1974, which does not apply to newspapers.
 The Government-appointed Publications Committees establ-
 ished by the Act may prohibit the distribution or posses-
 sion of publications, films, or other public entertainment
 that are considered obscene or blasphemous, that bring any
 section of the public into ridicule, that harm relations
 between sections of the public, or that are prejudicial
 to the safety of the State. The Committees may allow dis-
 tribution of a publication or the holding of an event
 subject to certain restrictions, such as age limits for
 attendance at public events. Decisions of the Publica-
 tions Committees may be appealed to the Government-
 appointed Publications Appeal Board but not to the courts.
 Recent statistics show that the ratio of material banned
 for being "prejudicial to the State" has risen vis-a-vis
 the banning of material deemed pornographic or immoral.
 The ban on outdoor public meetings other than bona fide
 sporting events and fairs, which was imposed following
 the 1976-77 unrest, was reimposed for a year in March
 1980. In addition, the Minister of Justice used author-
 ity granted him under the Riotous Assemblies Act to
 prohibit all gatherings of a political nature involving
 more than ten persons between June 13 and August 31,
 1980. The ban affected 45 of the country's major urban
 areas and prevented the holding of events ranging from
 services planned to commemorate the June 16 Soweto up-
 rising to meetings of white political parties. When
 the ban was allowed to expire on August 31, Minister of
 Justice Schlebusch warned that it would be reimposed if
 there was further unrest.
 Freedom of association is regulated by the complex of
 laws prescribing separate residential areas and public
 facilities for different racial groups. During 1980 the
 Government expanded the scope of obtaining administrative
 exemptions from apartheid laws, allowing restaurants,
 drive-in theaters, private hospitals, libraries, and other
 public amenities to admit persons of all races. At the
 same time, the Government reaffirmed that ieasures which
 preserved the residential, social, cultural and political
 separateness of the white community would remain.
 Freedom of religion is generally respected, and religious
 organizations are allowed to hold meetings and other act-
 ivities without interference so long as they do not chal-
 lenge Government policies or otherwise venture into the
 political realm. Fifty-three church leaders who staged a
 peaceful march in downtown Johannesburg in May 1980 to pro-
 test the detention of a fellow minister, were jailed for
 
 
 252
 one night and fined for contravening the Rioutous Assem-
 blies Act. Several Government ministers have criticized
 the activities of the South African Council of Churches,
 though in August 1980 Prime Minister P. W. Botha met with
 SACC leaders for wide-ranging discussions on the situation
 in the country.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Except that they must obtain permits to visit African town-
 ships and homelands,white South Africans, other than ban-
 ned persons, are generally free to move about the country.
 They must also possess valid travel documents in order to
 travel abroad and emigrate to other countries without fear
 of losing their citizenship. The rest of the South African
 people is subject to severe restrictions contained in laws
 implementing the Government's policy of separate development.
 Persons designated as Colored or Asian are required by the
 Group Areas Act to reside in areas set aside for these groups
 and, like Africans, may not legally enter facilities reserved
 for whites, unless these facilities have received govern-
 mental permission to admit them. In fact, Asians cannot
 reside nor legally stay overnight in the Orange Free State
 and certain parts of Natal without special permission.
 Africans' residences and travel are regulated by a system of
 "influx control" or "pass laws" which require those over
 sixteen to carry reference books to show that they are en-
 titled to be in a given urban area for more than 72 hours
 at a time. During 1980 the Government relaxed some influx
 control restrictions applying to Africans with permanent
 residence status in urban areas. A further improvement'was
 brought about when the Appeal Court struck down a regulation
 requiring "lodger" permits of family members who wished to
 live with their head of household in urban reas. In addi-
 tion to these measures, the Government proposed legislation
 in October 1980 which would replace the 72-hour rule and
 other aspects of the Urban Areas Consolidation Act of 1945
 with new terminology providing permanent residence in urban
 areas to those Africans who are legally employed and allocated
 housing (including leaseholds) in urban areas, their dependents,
 and "bona fide" visitors (up to 30 days per year).
 Depite such relaxation of the pass laws as has occurred,
 more than 203,000 Africans were arrested for pass violations
 during 1979. Nevertheless, the prospect of arrest and re-
 moval has not deterred many Africans from seeking the
 greater economic opportunities available in urban areas.
 The threat of removal is not limited to undocumented Afri-
 cans in urban areas. It is estimated that 3 million Afri-
 cans have been resettled from one area to another as a
 result of the Government's efforts to implement its ethnic
 blueprint for South Africa by consolidating the territories
 of its homelands. In most cases these removals have been
 Government-ordered against the will of the persons involved,
 by means of forcibly transporting individuals and their
 belongings to the areas in which they are to be resettled.
 Following the forced removal of 1600 Batlokwa people in
 September 1979 to a completely undeveloped area 100 miles
 away from their relatively well-developed traditional home,
 Minister Koornhof said that there would be no more "forced"
 removals. "Voluntary" (i.e., approved by the chief but not
 necessarily all members of the community) removals would
 continue, in spite of complaints of Government pressure and
 coercion. One and a half million persons are scheduled for
 relocation as part of the Government's homeland consolida-
 tion plan.
 
 
 253
 Of the more than 200,000 passport applications submitted to
 the Government in 1979, 79 were refused and 12 withdrawn.
 During the past two years, 18 persons invited to visit the
 United States under United'States Government sponsorship
 were unable to obtain passports because of the SAG's insist-
 ence that they use passports issued by the "independent"
 homelands, which are not recognized abroad. Many Africans
 have refused invitations to travel abroad to avoid acknowl-
 edging a non-South African citizenship in this way. Black
 passport applicants are often required to deposit R400
 ($539) in the event of destitution abroad.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Participation in the political process in South Africa
 is strictly separated along racial lines and blacks are
 excluded from any meaningful role in national politics.
 The Political Interference Act of 1968 makes it unlawful
 for a person of one racial group to: join a political
 party which has members from other racial groups, parti-
 cipate in an election campaign for a person of another
 racial group, or address a group of people, all or most
 of whom belong to another racial group,-to promote a pol-
 itical party. Thus, each racial group must pursue its
 political aspirations in distinct structures, each of
 which provides a different degree of self-government.
 White South Africans may participate in a parliamentary
 system similar to the British model. While the ruling
 National Party has a substantial majority, two small op-
 position parties, comprising 16 percent of all seats are
 represented in parliament. They have good access to the
 press, are able to hold public meetings, and function as
 freely as the ruling party. They are, however, subject-
 ed to close surveillance by the SAG security apparatus.
 Political structures assigned to South Africans designat-
 ed as Colored or Indian are considerably more limited in
 scope. The Colored Persons Representative Council, which
 had a measure of legislative and budgetary authority over.
 Colored affairs but was opposed by the Labor Party (which
 had a majority of seats on the Council), was allowed to
 lapse in 1980. Legislation providing for a Colored Per-
 son's Council was passed in the 1980 parliamentary session
 but not implemented, probably because of even stronger op-
 position from the Colored community and the impending
 creation of the President's Council, which includes
 appointed Colored and Indian members but not blacks. The
 South African Indian Council, the corresponding organiza-
 tion for Indians, was dissolved on October 31, 1980. The
 Government has announced that an "Indian Executive Cosmit-
 tee," consisting of 15 elected and 15 Government-appointed
 members, will be formed in 1981; voting for the elected mem-
 bers will take place on February 18, 1981. In terms of the
 Government's constitutional proposals, persons designated
 as Colored and Asian have been appointed to positions on
 the President's Council now being set up to chart South
 Africa's constitutional future.
 Since 1970, all Africans have been considered to be citi-
 zens of their own homelands or "national states." There
 are considered to be nine African tribal groups in South
 Africa, and each African from birth is assigned citizen-
 ship in one of the ten homelands on the basis of his or her
 supposed tribal heritage, language, etc, regardless of
 whether the individual was born, or has lived, or ever been
 
 
 254
 in his or her "place of origin." As long as their homeland
 does not declare "independence" - as have the Transkei, Bo-
 phuthatswana, and Venda - the individuals remain nationals
 of South Africa. However, when the homeland opts for "inde-
 pendence," South African nationality is withdrawn, leaving
 the individual simply a citizen of the homeland, with rights
 in South Africa based on "international" agreements with the
 new "states." In this manner nearly six million Africans have
 already beerf divested of their former South African citizen-
 ship.
 In theory, all citizens of the homelands are entitled to
 participate in the homeland political process. In practice,
 the majorities in the legislatures are appointed, a number
 of opposition leaders have been banned or imprisoned, and
 most real decision-making power in the non-independent home-
 lands remains in the hands of white civil servants seconded
 from the SAG. Such rights as the people of the homelands
 have are conferred - and may be withdrawn - by the-white
 National Parliament, which establishes systems for gover-
 nance of all South Africans.
 All of the homelands have adopted security legislation
 modeled on South Africa's, although Bophuthatswana's con-
 stitution does contain a bill of rights. In the Transkei,
 Venda, and the Ciskei, security laws have been used against
 political opponents of the government. The Transkeian gov-
 ernment banned 34 political and religious organizations in
 1979. It also banned a leading South African newspaper
 (the East London Daily Dispatch) for three weeks during
 1980 and detained two South African journalists and a black
 Durban attorney. Before fleeing to Zambia the leader of the
 parliamentary opposition, Chief Sabata Dalindyebo, was con-
 victed of "injuring the reputation of the state president"
 in April 1980 and stripped of his chieftainship. In Septem-
 ber 1980, Interior Minister Saul Ndzumo died while detained
 by Transkeian security police after revealing reports of a
 planned coup against the government; his death was attribut-
 ed by Transkeian officials to natural causes.
 The Ciskeian government, which in October 1980 announced
 that it was prepared "in principle" to accept "independence"
 from South Africa, continues to exercise extraordinary security
 powers in terms of a state of emergency, declared in September
 1977. At least 68 of the nearly 400 persons detained in South
 Africa in connection with black school boycotts and labor act-
 ivity in mid-1980 were Ciskeian residents.
 Although all Africans are technically homeland citizens, over
 9 million live in so-called white areas; the majority of these
 persons reside in urban areas. The right which a limited number
 of Africans have to stay permanently in urban areas is not in-
 heritable, and any child born after the "independence" of the
 homeland to which he is assigned is considered a foreigner in
 South Africa.
 The SAG has appointed committees to look into the problems
 of Africans, including homelands territorial consolidation
 and the role of the urban African within the context of
 separate development. At present, political participation
 by urban Africans is limited to electing community councils
 for their townships. During 1980 the limited responsibili-
 ties of certain community councils were expanded to include
 the authority to levy rent increases, allocate housing, and
 oversee the administration of projects such as township
 electrification. Nevertheless, their role remains circum-
 scribed by their continuing financial and administrative
 dependence on the Department of Cooperation and Development
 
 
 255
 and the Administration Boards which oversee them. In
 October 1980 the Government proposed new legislation on the
 form of African municipal government which will be put before
 the 1981 session of parliament.
 Aside from limits deriving from the nature of the poli-
 tical structures provided for blacks, the expression of
 their political aspirations has been hindered by the ban-
 ning of many of their political leaders and organizations.
 The majority of all banned persons is black and most of
 their major black political movements, including the Afri-
 can National Congress, the Pan Africanist Congress, the
 South African Student's Organization, and the Black Peoples'
 Convention, have been proscribed. Subsequent efforts at
 political organization have almost invariably been stifled
 by detention and bannings. Efforts to revive previously
 banned organizations ( such as the Azanian Peoples' Organi-
 zation or to build new ones have been hampered by the deten-
 tion and/or banning of their leaders; prominent black leaders
 Curtis Nkondo (AZAPO), Thozamile Botha (Port Elizabeth Black
 Civic Organization), and Fanyana Mazibuko (Soweto Teachers's
 Action Committee) were among those banned during 1980.
 Women in South Africa are discriminated against through legis-
 lation that circumscribes their civil, political, and economic
 rights and opportunities. While women form an increasing
 percentage of the white labor force (up from 29 percent in
 1965 to a projected 37 percent in.1981), they are not
 protected from wage discrimination. A recent study claims
 that women earn half the wages of men with the same quali-
 fications and that they tend to become nurses and teachers,
 "professions seen as extensions of their domestic role."
 Moreover, South African tax laws do not permit separate
 taxation of a working couple's income; the women's earn-
 ings are added to those of her husband's for tax purposes.
 White males have three times as many bachelor's degrees,
 five times as many master's degrees, and ten times as many
 doctorates as women. Aside from such economic limitations,
 married women are regarded as virtual minors before the law
 in the absence of pre-nuptial contracts. The Government
 has, however, proposed legislation which would grant to
 married women legal and property rights within and upon the
 breaking of a legal marriage. White women were granted the
 vote in 1929, and make up an estimated 52 percent of the
 registered voters.Two women are currently serving as elect-
 ed members of parliament.
 Black women encounter far greater difficulties than their
 white counterparts. They are regarded as perpetual minors
 before the law which severely limits their ability to own
 property and to rent accommodation in urban areas. In urban
 areas, African women earn only one-half as much as African
 men; many women work in the low wage services sector (e.g.,
 as domestic workers). One recent survey found that in the
 eastern Cape almost three quarters of the full time domestic
 servants interviewed earned less than R30        per week.
 A study cited "influx control" as the major constraint on
 black women and claimed it trapped them in homelands and de-
 prived them of employment alternatives. Wives of African
 migrant workers, numbering several hundred thousand,are
 left alone up to eleven months a year to bring up their
 families through subsistence farming and remittances
 from their spouses.
 In the area of labor relations, the Government took admini-
 strative steps during 1980 to remove some apartheid related
 restrictions, though still within the general framework of
 separate development.

 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigations of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights:
 The SAG has been critical of complaints about its human
 rights record by United Nations organizations and groups
 such as Amnesty International. It does permit representa-
 tives of the International Committee of the Red Cross to
 visit on an anngal basis Section 10 detainees and the Robben
 Island maximm security prison where a number of black pol-
 itical prisoners are held. The ICRC's findings are not made
 public, but its discussions with the SAG have reportedly led
 to improved conditions at Robben Island. ICRC has been
 refused access to those detained under Section 6 of the
 Terrorism Act.
 Foreign journalists have on occasion been allowed to visit
 South African prisons. In April 1977 a group of 25 reporters,
 including a number of foreign correspondents, were invited
 to tour the Robben IslaAd facility. The Prisons Act, however,
 has tightly limited investigative journalism into prison
 conditions. Over the years, legal and human rights groups
 have frequently attended important trials. Foreign legal
 experts were allowed to attend the inquest into the death of
 Steve Biko held in November 1977. However, foreign diplomats
 have been excluded from those political trials which are held
 in camera. South Africa extends little or no cooperation to
 various United Nations bodies investigating its human rights
 record.
 A number of South African organizations observe, report,
 and contest human rights violations in the coutry. Black
 political organizations have been particularly vocal in
 calling for a society based on internationally accepted
 principles of human rights, and have borne the brunt of
 the SAG displeasure with opposition groups which seriously
 challenge the established order.A number of other organiza-
 tions have also been active.In June 1980, a "Lawyers for
 Human Rights" association was formed to monitor and suggest
 changes in the human rights situation in South Africa. The
 Black Sash organization, which was formed to protest the
 means by which Colored citizens were removed from the common
 voting roles in 19S5, reports extensively on the abuses of
 the influx control system based on its experience in assist-
 ing blacks who have fallen afoul of the pass laws. The South
 African Council of Churches has spoken out on a wide range of
 human rights issues, and is active in assisting persons incar-
 cerated under security laws and other groups which are system-
 atically deprived of their human rights. While no official
 action has been taken against the Council, it has frequently
 been criticized and threatened by the Government.
 
 
 257
 NAMIBIA
 Following World War I, Namibia (Southwest Africa at the
 time) was administered by South Africa under a League of
 Nations mandate. South Africa accepted the mandate as
 "a sacred trust" and was given full powers of administra-
 tion, to be exercised, among other things, to promote the
 interest and well being of the inhabitants while reporting
 to the League. When the League ended and the United Nations
 commenced, a dispute developed over the status of Namibia
 and South Africa's rights and obligations. After three
 advisory opinions affirming South African responsibility to
 the United Nations (1950, 1955, 1956), the continuing re-
 fusal of South Africa to discharge its responsibility, com-
 bined with its application of apartheid to the territory,
 led the UN General Assembly in 1966 to declare South Africa
 no longer the lawful authority and that Namibia had come
 under the "direct responsibility" of the United Nations.
 The illegality of South Africa's rule was later affirmed by
 the UN.Security Council and, in 1971, by advisory opinion
 of the International Court of Justice on Legal Consequences
 for States of the Continuing Presence of South Africa in
 Namibia (South West Africa) Notwithstanding Security Council
 Resolution 276 (1970), I.C.J. Reports 1971. The 1971 court
 opinion described South Africa's application of apartheid
 to Namibia as a violation of the human rights of the Namibian
 people. The Court further stated that South Africa remains
 "under obligation to mithdraw its Administration from Namibia
 immediately" and that while continuing to violate its inter-
 national obligations by maintaining its illegal occupation,
 South Africa "also remains accountable for any violations.. .of
 the rights of the people of. Namibia."
 For more than a decade, forces of the South West African
 Peoples Organization (SWAPO) seeking to end South Africa's
 physical control have engaged in extensive conflict with
 South African forces. The conflict is particularly marked
 in the Ovambo region where it is widely assumed that nearly
 half the people of Namibia live and where SWAPO support has
 been especially strong. Civilians are often the victims
 in this conflict. Martial law is in effect in large seg-
 ments of Namibia. Efforts at resolution of the matter have
 continued, especially in the Security Council of the United
 Nations. In 1978, agreement was reached under United Nations
 auspices on a plan for ending the conflict by elections in
 accordance with an underlying Security Council Resolution
 calling for elections under United Nations supervision and
 control. This plan is yet to be implemented; negotiations
 regarding its implementation are continuing.
 With respect to South Africa's application of apartheid to
 Namibia, the International Court of Justice recorded in an
 advisory opinion in 1971 that South Africa adopted "restrictive
 measures of control" establishing "limitations, exclusions or
 restrictions for the members of the indigenous population
 groups .... "  It found South Africa's conduct "based on grounds
 of race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin" to be
 "a denial of fundamental human rights" and "a flagrant viola-
 tion of the purposes and principles of the [United Nations]
 Charter." Since 1971, concrete steps have been taken to
 eliminate certain of the distinctions referred to by the
 Court. While ultimate authority rests with South Africa's
 all-White Parliament,Blacks participate in political
 institutions established by the South African government.
 Restrictions on freedom of assembly and association have
 been somewhat relaxed, although important legal restrictions
 still exist which separate persons on racial and ethnic
 grounds.
 
 
 258
 South African security laws have been applied by the South
 African Parliament to Namibia. Police and Administration
 authorities use them extensively, with concomitant viola-
 tions of the human rights of Namibians. A number of orders
 issued by the Administrator General appointed by South Africa
 provide legal bases for further curtailments of human rights.
 Also, by virtue of the application of martial law in Ovamboland,
 Kaokoland, Okavango, the Caprivi Strip, Windhoek and other areas,
 the Army and other security elements exercise wide discretion
 to proceed without judicial review.
 With respect. to the ongoing conflict in Namibia, violations
 of human rights appear to be committed by both sides. SWAPO
 forces, employing terrorist tactics, attack and sometimes
 kill or seriously harm civilians. The SADF has been reported
 in the press and in testimony to the United Nations to have
 violated basic human rights of persons captured or otherwise
 hors de combat which must be respected under the Geneva Conven-
 tion of 1949, to which South Africa is a Party.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 By law, Namibians, like South Africans, may be denied timely
 access to courts and other safeguards against official abuses.
 South Africa's Terrorism Act, its Internal Security Act, and
 Proclamations of the Administrator General (AG-9 and 26), in
 combined application to Namibia, provide the police wide
 latitude for arrest, indefinite detention without charge
 and interrogation. Detention may be without access to courts,
 family, or lawyers. Some detainees have reported physical
 and psychological abuse, including beatings, electric shock,
 deprivation of sleep, food, and water, and hanging by hands
 or feet. In' 1978 state witnesses admitted they had been
 tortured to obtain their testimony against a SWAPO official,
 and a churchman's publication reproduced ten sworn court
 statements of people who claimed to have been tortured by
 South African security police in Ovamboland. Such repre-
 sentations have been made by defendents and witnesses in
 cases before the courts. Repeated representations from
 reputable Namibian church authorities to the South African
 Prime Minister, the Administrator General, and the UN are
 on record seeking relief from torture. There have been at
 least three unverified reports of torture in 1980. Veri-
 fication is difficult, in part, due to present circumstances
 and, in part, because of the application of South Africa's
 security legislation.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The Internal Security Act, also extends the power to "ban"
 to persons in Namibia. However, this power is infrequently
 used. The Vice-President of SWAPO is serving his second
 five-year ban, and is restricted to a township outside
 Walvis Bay.
 C. Disappearances
 Disappearances in Namibia may result from, inter alia
 flight into exile and incommunicado detenti.Tein-
 cidence of disappearances in circumstances suggesting
 official detention in Namibia does not appear to be great.
 
 
 259
 However, an action was brought in October, 1979, by the wives
 of three SWAPO supporters who had disappeared. The authori-
 ties have been known to withhold any information about
 persons they detain.
 d. Arbitra-y Arrest and Imprisonment
 Namibians may be, and have been, detained under Section 6 of
 the Terrorism Act of 1967 without access to courts, lawyers,
 clergy, family or friends. Nambiams were among the first to
 be so treated under the Act. As previously noted, a number
 of laws now combine to permit such arbitrary detention.
 According to the ICRC, they have had access to all Namibian
 detainees, except perhaps some rumored to be held in the
 operational area. In addition, ICRC has been given per-
 mission to open an office in Windhoek.
 The number of political prisoners in detention at any one
 time is difficult to estimate. A Department of State survey
 in may 1977 identified 133 Naibian political prisoners,
 noting at the same time that Church estimates of the total
 exceeded 200. Both estimates excluded those held by security
 forces in the North, which we are unable to quantify. In
 August 1977 South Africa listed a total of 53 Namibian
 "security" detainees. Since then from 3,000 to over 4,000
 people have been reported temporarily detained in round-ups,
 then released. Some were detained more than once. These
 numbers do not include a sizeable number of SWAPO personnel
 and others captured during South African raids on SWAPO
 bases in Angola and held at a military camp in Southern
 Namibia.
 Although an internal wing of SWAPO has been permitted to
 engage in political activity its leadership has been
 frequently detained. In the past, the pattern has bean
 that a large portion of detainees are leaders and adherents
 of SWAPO. They are detained and released, followed by
 redetention and release under "release warrants" - imposing
 restrictions of unlimited duration similar to banning under
 the Internal Security Act.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 By virtue of the application of South African law to Namibians,
 they suffer the same serious impairments of their right
 to fair, public trial.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Invasion of the homes of Namibians has become increasingly
 common. In areas proclaimed "Security Districts", which
 now include not only the border regions, but also municipal
 areas such as Windhoek and Tsumeb, a member of the security
 forces may search the home of any "suspicious" person. No
 warrant is required. Allegations of widespread entry into
 private homes followed a police sweep of Katatura Township
 outside Windhoek in June 1979, which resulted in 1,500
 arrests and mass deportations to Ovambo, even though those
 detained were not classified as "security suspects".
 Similar raids were repeated in 1980 at Grootfontein and
 swakopmund. The latter involved 400 arrests at the
 Ovambo Hostel. Similar allegations are also frequently
 heard in Ovambo.
 
 
 260
 2.   Government Policies Relating to Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 Namibia has a dual economy in which a fairly well-developed
 sector exists alongside a much larger, much poorer sector
 that is relatively undeveloped. Distribution of income,
 wealth, and land is highly unbalanced, with Namibia's
 Whites--approximately ten percent of the population--and
 outside firms holding the vast majority of the territory's
 resources. Mining, agriculture, and fishing are the major
 sectoral components of the developed part of the economy.
 There is an estimated 20-30 percent unemployment among
 Blacks. Adequate housing, .particularly in the Black Windhoek
 township of Katatura, remains a major problem. Hospitals
 remain segregated and health care is inadequate in many rural
 areas although missions and the government offer some basic
 care. Windhoek's Black hospital is modern and health care is
 available there. Public education is free, but largely
 segregated, throughout Namibia. As in South Africa, the
 education available to the average Black is inferior to that
 available to Whites. The budget for White schooling and
 health is more than ten times higher per capita than for
 Blacks. Rural schools tend to be particularly overcrowded
 and understaffed.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of speech or expression, t6 which freedom o f opinion
 is closely related, is limited in Namibia by application of
 South Africa's Internal Security Act and the Terrorism Act.
 The provisions of both laws go far beyond outlawing activity
 conventionally regarded as terrorism, and provide wide dis-
 cretion for arbitrary limitation of freedom of speech or
 expression. They enable the authorities to penalize by
 banning or detention any person(s) whom they deem likely
 to advocate or encourage achievement of any of the objects
 of communism or who the authorities believe to be "engaged
 in activities which endanger or are calculated to endanger
 the security of the state or the maintenance of public order."
 South Africa also applies its Publications Act of 1974 to
 Namibia to make books, magazines, pamphlets, greeting cards
 and posters subject to censorship. While the press is not
 government-controlled, it works under restrictive laws and
 there is a large degree of self-censorship. News reports
 on defense matters must be cleared by military authorities,
 who have adopted a broad definition of what is included in
 the term "defense."
 Religion may be freely practiced, although the churches
 other than the Dutch Reformed Church have reported that the
 latter is favored in the matter of visits to detainees.
 Often the churches - notably the Lutheran, Anglican
 and Catholic churches - have traditionally defended the
 Black population against repressive treatment, especially
 in the North, and an adversary relationship has developed
 between these important churches and the government. Four
 White Anglican Bishops, two of them Acting Bishops, and
 other church people, Anglican and Lutheran, were expelled
 in past years. Heightening of tension has been accompanied
 by reports of harassment of church members and interruptions
 of church services by security forces, especially in Ovambo,
 although church leaders reported some improvement in 1980.
 In the past police raids on the Council of Churches in
 Windhoek in search of alleged subversive literature have
 occurred. The printing press of the important Evangelical
 Lutheran Ovambokavango Church was destroyed by bombs in
 1973 and again in 1980 by unknown parties. In general,
 
 
 261
 the right to assemble in public meetings can be curtailed,
 or a meeting can be banned entirely, when officials believe
 such meetings threaten the peace, encourage enmity between
 population groups, or are politically unacceptable. In
 security districts, permits are required for all public
 meetings; urban authorities elsewhere can restrict meetings
 of Africans, but only the Administrator General can prohibit
 them.
 With respect to freedom of assembly and association,
 South Africa's immorality and mixed marriages acts were
 repealed for Namibia in October 1977. A law opening some
 public amenities (hotels, resorts, restaurants, theaters)
 to all-races took effect August 10, 1979. However, in
 Windhoek the public library, municipal swimming pool and
 hospital remain segregated. Under the general law amend-
 ment proclamation (AG-5) of October 1977, Africans need
 no longer carry passes at all times showing permission
 to be in White areas. It is required that all persons have
 an identity document.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Since the removal of the pass law, the principal infringe-
 ments of freedom of movement within Namibia stem from
 the application of the Internal Security Act (banning,
 detention), the Terrorism Act (detention), certain pro-
 clamations of the Administrator General (detention and
 conditional release), remaining exclusions of Blacks
 from facilities and tight controls on movement, for
 example the curfew and no-go areas in Ovambo, imposed
 under martial law and "security district" legislation.
 The authorities exercise judicially unreviewable dis-
 cretion to deny passports and to deport persons they
 deem undesirable.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 More than 30 political parties exist in Namibia, many
 of them multiracial and including the SWAPO political
 wing. SWAPO's internal wing, however, closed its head-
 quarters office in Windhoek for a few months in 1979,
 because the majority of its leadership was in detention
 and its office had been vandalized. Branch offices of
 the movement remain open and SWAPO remains active. It
 held a rally on March 30, 1980 at Katatura Township with
 reported attendance of 3,000 which was addressed by members
 of the Executive Committee and another on August 15, 1980
 at Luderitz. In general, periodic detentions of SWAPO
 leaders is a deterrent to free participation of SWAPO
 in the political process. The December 1978 South African-
 organized elections for a consituent assembly, which became
 the "National Assembly", took place on a one-man, one-vote
 basis. Over 90 percent of the probably under-estimated
 eligible population of 443,411 registered to vote in
 the course of an extensive campaign, and 81 percent of
 the registered voters cast ballots. SWAPO and the
 major Centrist parties did not participate in the election,
 believing that only a UN-supervised election would be
 a valid test of voter sentiment. The election took place
 
 
 in the presence of 20,000 SADF personnel concentrated
 chiefly in the populous Ovambo region. A meeting in Geneva
 in January 1981 was agreed to , by all parties, giving
 parties a chance to be present at a discussion of implementa-
 tion of the plans for UN-sponsored elections.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigations of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The attitude and record of South Africa respecting inter-
 national and non-governmental investigations of alleged
 human rights violations in Namibia is somewhat ambiguous.
 The ICRC has access to all presently known places of detention.
 It has been allowed access to the Namibians on Robben Island
 and to detainees inside Namibia. Amnesty Internationals
 efforts, however, have been rebuffed. On a broader scale,
 South Africa offered access to Namibia to the International
 Court of Justice in the course of proceedings before the
 Court in the 60's and early 70's; it has permitted the Seqretary
 General and those associated with him entry into the country
 in connection with negotiations under the Security Council
 Resolution earlier referred to; but it had previously
 denied access to the UN Council for Namibia and it has
 evidenced a non-cooperative attitude toward a UN Subcom-
 mittee specifically looking into human rights violations
 in the territory. It has permitted observers at trials
 of persons and organizations whose cases raise human rights
 issues, but it retains the statutory authority to bar all
 persons from pre-trial access to Section 6 detainees.
