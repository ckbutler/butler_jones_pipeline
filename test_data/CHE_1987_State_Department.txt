 SWITZERLAND
 Switzerland is a constitutional democracy with a federal
 structure. Federal legislative power is vested in a bicameral
 legislature elected every 4 years. The Constitution guarantees
 all basic freedoms. Initiative and referendum procedures
 provide avenues for significant changes in policy through
 direct action. Despite linguistic and religious diversity,
 Switzerland has developed a political system based on national
 consensus.
 Individual cantons have considerable autonomy. They are
 directly involved in many human rights matters, subject to
 limitations established by Federal legislative and
 constitutional guarantees. Persons contending that their
 rights have been violated at cantonal level can seek redress
 by appeal to the Federal Supreme Court.
 Switzerland traditionally serves as host for many
 international organizations and conferences concerned with
 humanitarian law and human rights, including the International
 Labor Organization and the International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC).
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 No such occurrences took place.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of abduction, secret arrests, or
 clandestine detention.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution provides freedom from all of the above, and
 there were no allegations of any violations. In December
 1986, Switzerland ratified the U.N. Convention on Torture and
 Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile is
 guaranteed by law. A detained person may not be held longer
 than 24 hours without a warrant of arrest issued by the judge
 conducting the preliminary investigation. A suspect must
 immediately be shown the warrant and has the right to contact
 legal counsel as soon as a warrant is issued. A suspect may
 be detained with a warrant until the investigation is
 completed, but the length of investigative detention is always
 reviewed'by higher judicial authority, and investigations are
 typically completed quickly. Bail, or release on personal
 recognizance, is granted unless the examining magistrate
 believes the individual is a danger to society or will not
 appear for trial. Within the standards of local law, there is
 a pattern of failure of certain cantonal authorities in
 western Switzerland to provide timely notice and consular
 access in the case of detained Americans (and perhaps other
 foreigners).

 There is no forced or compulsory labor in Switzerland.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for public trials. Minor cases are
 tried by a single judge, difficult cases by a panel of judges,
 and murder or other serious crimes by a public jury. Even the
 most serious cases are usually brought to trial within several
 weeks or, at the most, a few months.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There were no allegations of violations of this nature by
 Swiss authorities.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There are no restrictions on freedom of speech and press
 except in cases involving groups or associations considered a
 potential threat to the State. No groups or associations are
 so designated at the present time.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The only restriction on peaceful assembly and association is a
 requirement to obtain permits from police authorities before
 holding public meetings. These are rarely refused unless
 authorities have reason to believe the meeting will lead to
 violence. There was considerable public criticism on one
 occasion in 1987 when an antinuclear demonstration in Bern
 became violent and resulted in widespread use of tear gas,
 clashes between police and demonstrators, and property damage
 in downtown Bern.
 Labor unions enjoy full freedom to organize, strike, and
 influence political decisions. Swiss labor relations have
 been characterized by industrial peace, and strikes and
 similar labor unrest are practically unknown.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Switzerland enjoys religious freedom. The legal requirement
 for universal male military service thus far has provided no
 exemption for conscientious objectors, who were nearly always
 convicted for refusal to serve. Efforts to provide some form
 of alternative service for those claiming exemption for
 reasons of conscience were renewed in 1987, with a view to
 providing alternative unarmed military or public labor service
 for conscientious objectors. Amnesty International has
 continued to express concern at the practice of prosecuting
 conscientious objectors.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Swiss citizens have freedom to travel in or outside the
 country and can emigrate without difficulty.
 Switzerland was traditionally a haven for refugees, but
 concern over demands upon public services by growing numbers
 of asylum seekers has tempered public support for liberal
 policies in this regard. Situations involving economic
 
 
 1030
 SWITZERLAND
 migrants, e.g., Tamils from Sri Lanka, led to reiteration of
 the policy that applicants failing to meet criteria for
 political asylum must subsequently depart Switzerland.
 However, domestic political objection to such a policy and the
 prevailing situation in countries of origin, such as Sri
 Lanka, have resulted, in practice, in very few involuntary
 departures. During a 1987 national referendum, two-thirds of
 those voting approved amendment of the asylum and nationality
 laws intended to improve procedures for both processing asylum
 requests and expediting the departure of unsuccessful
 applicants. The holding of the referendum appears to have
 diminished active public concern over this issue.
 The Swiss people generally remain willing to assist political
 refugees; in 1987 prominent Soviet dissident psychiatrist
 Anatoly Koryagin and his family were granted asylum. In
 October 1987 parliamentary elections, a party whose platform
 consisted mainly of opposition to foreigners lost both votes
 and seats. However, Federal and cantonal actions also reflect
 a popular consensus that Switzerland should continue to adhere
 to a narrow definition of those entitled to assistance by
 grant of asylum. Amnesty International in 1987 criticized
 Switzerland, among other nations, for seeking to limit asylum
 and immigration.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Switzerland is a highly developed constitutional democracy.
 There is universal adult suffrage in Federal elections.
 Initiative and referendum procedures provide unusually intense
 popular oversight of, and involvement in, the legislative
 process.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There were no requests during 1987 for outside investigations
 of the human rights situation. Switzerland cooperates with
 international and nongovernmental groups in all areas of human
 rights. The ICRC is made up of Swiss nationals, and they play
 prominent roles in other humanitarian nongovernmental
 organizations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Involvement of women in the political and business worlds has
 been limited historically but continues to expand slowly. At
 least 28 women will sit in the new Parliament elected in 1987,
 an increase of at least 3 (based on incomplete election
 results) over the previous session, and since 1984 a woman has
 served on the 7-member Federal Council, the nation's executive
 body. In January 1987, Switzerland adhered to the 1979 U.N.
 Convention on Elimination of Discrimination Against Women.
 One of the smallest and most rural of the 26 cantons still
 excludes female suffrage at the cantonal level, but this
 situation is now regarded as a curiosity rather than a
 disability by most Swiss women. Women are still subject to
 some legal disabilities, are typically paid less than men for
 equal work, and remain underrepresented in senior positions in
 industry, banking, and government.

 Italian and Romansch linguistic minorities (respectively about
 10 and 1 percent of the population) express concern that the
 limited resources made available to them by the Federal
 Government endanger the continued intellectual vitality of
 these languages. Some argue that this amounts to deprivation
 of freedom of speech. Recurrent complaints about the lack of
 an Italian-language university were answered by the
 announcement in 1985 of plans for a university-level technical
 institute in Lugano which, however, would not grant degrees.
 The Federal Government's announced policy is to ensure,
 through careful apportionment of funds, that all linguistic
 groups have commensurate facilities and means to carry out
 cultural activities in their own languages.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 There is no national minimum wage. Industrial wages are
 negotiated by employer associations and labor unions during
 the collective bargaining process. The Labor Act established
 a maximum 45-hour workweek for blue- and white-collar workers
 in industry, offices, and retail trades, and a 50-hour
 workweek for all other workers. Currently, the workweek for
 blue-collar workers in most industries is 43 hours and for
 white-collar workers between 40 and 43 hours. Overtime is
 restricted by law to 120 hours annually.
 The Labor Act and the Federal Code of Obligations contain
 extensive regulations to protect the health and safety of
 workers. Special provisions exist for female workers, who may
 not be employed for dangerous work or, in industrial
 enterprises, at night or on Sundays.
 About 15 percent of the Swiss population of 6.5 million is
 made up of habitual foreign residents, that is, foreign
 workers and families. Prompted by popular concerns that
 attribute unemployment to the influx of foreign labor, the
 Government has sought to limit the numbers of foreign workers
 entering Switzerland or obtaining residence permits. Federal
 and cantonal authorities have made efforts to integrate
 foreign workers and their families into social service
 programs, although there has been some popular resentment at
 the additional facilities provided to such foreign workers.
 The minimum age for the employment of children is 15 years.
 Children over 13 may be employed for light duties (e.g.,
 helping in retail stores), for not more than 9 hours per week
 during the school year and 15 hours otherwise. Strict
 regulations govern employment of young people between the ages
 of 15 and 20; for example, they may not work at night or on
 Sundays, or under hazardous or dangerous conditions.
