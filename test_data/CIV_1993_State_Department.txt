 COTE D'IVOIRE
 Power in Cote d'Ivoire was concentrated in President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, the
 country's leader since independence, and in the political party he founded, the
 Democratic Party of Cote d'Ivoire (PDCI). Genuine reforms have resulted in muitiple
 political parties and opposition groups as well as a vigorous free press, but
 Houphouet-Boigy and the PDCI, winners of the 1990 elections, continued to domi-
 nate all levels of government. Houphouet-Boigny's 33-year rule ended with his death
 on December 7, but his legacy continued as Henri Konan Bedie, National Assembly
 President, PDCI stalwart, and Houphouet-Boigny's constitutionally designated suc-
 cessor, assumed the Presidency without incident.
 Cote d'Ivoire's security forces include the national police (Surete) and the Gendar-
 merie, a branch of the armed forces with responsibility for general law enforcement.
 The Gendarmerie is the primary police organization outside the cities and is under
 the Ministry of Defense. The total personnel of the uniformed services, which in-
 cludes the military forces and the gendarmes (but not the police), is 16,000. The
 armed forces traditionally have accepted the primacy of civilian authority..Security
 forces were responsible for a number of human rights abuses in 1993, including
 extrajudicial killing of criminal suspects.
 Agriculture is the keystone of Cote d'Ivoire's economy. During the 1980's, Cote
 d'Ivoire was squeezed by a heavy debt burden and falling p rices for its exprts, prin-
 cipally cocoa, coffee, and tropical woods. Per capita annual income slipped in recent
 years from well over $1,000 to below $800. After reaching agreement with the Inter-
 national Monetary Fund and the World Bank on a stabilization program in 1991,
 the Government reduced its budget deficit, instituted changes in the tax and labor
 codes, and announced an ambitious program of privatization and administrative re-
 form. Progress, however, has been slow.
 The sometimes heightened political tensions of recent years were noticeably lower
 in 1993, with fewer instances of politically motivated abuses, such as arrests and
 detentions, travel restrictions, and harassment. The presence of opposition groups,
 other independent organizations, and a vigorous free press continued to improve
 both awareness and observance of human rights on a day-to-day basis.
 However, in 1993 there continued to be serious human ights abuses. Members
 of the security forces, mainly the police and forest rangers (an armed unit under
 the authority of the Ministry of Agriculture), agin carried out extrajudicial killings
 of criminal suspects and beat and abused detainees. They sometimes used beatings
 to extract confessions or as punishment. Many of these extrajudicial actions were
 the result of the authorities relaxing restrictions in 1992 on the police to help com-
 bat the extremely high crime rate n Abidjan. Abuse of authority by law enforce-
 ment personnel, who extort money at numerous roadblocks for contrived minor in-
 fractions from people traveling by private or public conveyance, is an example of the
 Government's failure to apply proper discipline to and control over law enforcement
 oricials. There continue  to be serious questions about the independence of the
 Ivorian judiciary, which appeared to be subject to external political influences.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-There were no known political
 killings by government forces in 1993. However, following the Government s relax-
 ation of restrictions in 1992 on the use of deadly force by security forces against
 armed suspects, there were new incidents in 1993 of the forces killing suspects dur-
 ing apprehension. There were also repeated reports, including in the media, that the
 
 
 security forces killed alleged perpetrators after their arrest. Malefactors in the secu-
 rity forces are punished, and cases against several persons remained pending in the
 courts at the end of the year.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of officially sanctioned abduction or dis-
 appearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Police sometimes beat detainees in order to punish them or to extract confessions.
 Television footage and press photographs regularly show criminal detainees with
 swollen or bruised faces and bodies, possibly indicating police mistreatment during
 arrest or detention. Prisoners are often treated in a degrading or humiliating man-
 ner. For example, there were reports of prisoners held unclothed or clad only in
 undershorts, chained in pairs, and kept in cells measuring only 4 square meters
 without running water or electricity. In particular, non-Ivonan Africans residing in
 Cote d'Ivoire (who represent a third of the total population) are routinely treated
 more roughly by police on arrest than are Ivorians. In 1993 there were reported in-
 stances of officials being punished for mistreatment of detainees or prisoners. The
 Ivorian media also reported several incidents of poor treatment of prisoners, includ-
 ing reports of deaths at the hands of security forces.
 Sanitary conditions in prisons are abysmal and are responsible for a high death
 rate. Common problems include overcrowding, malnutrition, infectious diseases, and
 infestation by vermin. In 1993 the Ivorian media published several reports on prison
 conditions, leading to severe public condemnation by human rights organizations
 and opposition political figures, many of whom had spent time in prison in 1992.
 Following this, the Government took steps to upgrade prison conditions in selected
 facilities. At Maca, the nation's largest detention facility, the Government rehabili-
 tated the prison's workshop, bakery, and carpentry shop, and agricultural projects
 were introduced at several other prisons, allowing prisoners to grow some of their
 own food.
 A prison riot in March in Abidjan resulted in 4 prisoners killed and 19 wounded
 when police used excessive force in attempting to quell the riot.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Under the Code of Penal Procedure, a
 ublic prosecutor may order the detention of a suspect for up to 48 hours without
 ringing charges. The Code dictates that longer detention must be ordered by a
 magistrate, who may authorize detention for up to 4 months, but who must also pro-
 vide the Minister of Justice a written justification for continued detention on a
 monthly basis. However, the law is often violated. Police have held persons for more
 than 48 hours without bringing charges. Defendants are not guaranteed the right
 to a judicial determination of the legality of their detention.
 In contrast to 1992, when the Government detained large numbers of political ac-
 tivists who had not used or advocated violence, no such arrests were known to have
 occurred in 1993.
 The Government does not use exile as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The modern judicial system is headed by a Su-
 preme Court and includes the Court of Appeals and lower courts. The judiciary is
 theoretically independent of the executive branch in ordinary criminal cases. In
 practice, as well as under the Constitution's separation of powers provisions, the ju-
 diciary follows the lead of the executive in cases concerning perceived national secu-
 rity or political issues.
 There is not a clear separation between the judicial and executive branches of
 government. There are credible reports that the courts give lenient treatment to in-
 dividuals with personal ties to the Government. The Government, in turn, has as-
 serted itself in matters pertaining to the judiciary; for example, a government offi-
 cial attempted at the last minute to cancel a long-planned judicial seminar involving
 both Ivorian and American jurists. Though a truncated version of the seminar fi-
 nally took place a day later than planned, the resulting controversy greatly reduced
 attendance.
 Ivorian law establishes the right to a public trial, although key evidence ii some-
 times given in camera. Defendants have the right to be present at their trials, and
 their innocence is presumed. Those convicted have the right of appeal, though in
 practice verdicts are rarely overturned. Defendants accused of felonies or capital
 crimes have the right to legal counsel, and the judicial system provides for court-
 appointed attorneys for indigent defendants. In practice, many defendants cannot
 afford private counsel, and court-appointed attorneys are not readily available.
 In rural areas, justice is often administered at the village level through traditional
 institutions which handle domestic disputes, minor land questions, and family law.
 Dispute resolution is by extended debate, with no known instances of resort to phys-
 ical punishment. These traditional courts are being increasingly superseded by the
 formal judicial system.
 
 
 Civilians are not tried by military courts. Although there are no appellate courts
 within the military court system, persons convicted by a military tribunal may peti-
 tion the Supreme Court to set aside the tribunal's verdict and order a retrial.
 There were no known political detainees or prisoners in 1993.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-In Cote
 d'Ivoire's multiparty political system, citizens are free to join, or not join, any politi-
 cal party. However, public officials and employees of state-owned corporations are
 subject to pressure to become members of the PDCI. Party membership applications
 are sometimes passed to employees by their supervisors, and those who fail to sign
 up are believed to suffer in terms of promotion.
 The Code of Penal Procedure specifies that a police official or investigative mag-
 istrate may conduct searches of homes without a judicial warrant if there is reason
 to believe that there is evidence on the premises concerning a crime. The official
 must have the prosecutor's agreement to retain any objects seized in the search and
 is required to have witnesses to the search, which may not take place between the
 hours of 9 p.m. and 4 a.m. In practice, the police sometimes use a general search
 warrant without a name or address. On occasion, the police have entered homes of
 non-Ivorian Africans (or rounded them up on the streets), taken them to local police
 stations, and extorted small amounts of money for alleged minor offenses.
 Security forces monitor some private telephone conversations, but the extent of
 the practice is unknown. There is no evidence that private correspondence is mon-
 itored.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion. Independent newspapers criticized government policies frequently and also
 made unfavorable comments concerning the President of the Republic. The two gov-
 ernment-owned daily newspapers offer some censure of government policy, although,
 in general, government-owned radio and television do not. The opposition press, or-
 dinary citizens, opposition political party leaders, and student groups voice their dis-
 approval of government or residential actions frequently and loudly.
 Although such criticism is tolerated, insults or attacks on the honor of the coun-
 try's highest officials are not. It is a crime, punishable by from 3 months to 2 years
 in prison, to offend the President, the Prime Minister, foreign chiefs of state or gov-
 ernment, or their diplomatic representatives, or to defame institutions of the State.
 Moreover, a press law enacted in late 1991 created a new commission to enforce
 laws against publishing material "undermining the reputation of the nation or de-
 faming institutions of the State." Although this law was not used to prosecute any
 newspaper publisher or journalist in 1993, it imposes stiff penalties, including the
 seizure of offending newspapers.
 The Government owns both television networks-although there is one private
 television subscription service, Canal Horizon-and the major radio station. There
 are also four independent radio stations operating in the Cote d'Ivoire. The Govern-
 ment continues to exercise considerable influence over official media program con-
 tent, news coverage, and other matters, using these media to promote its policies.
 Much of the news programming is devoted to coverage of the activities of the Presi-
 dent, the Government, and the PDCI, but the amount of coverage given to the politi-
 cal opposition continues to increase. In 1993 the Government granted licenses to op-
 erate five radio stations and one television channel to private organizations, though
 none of the applicants with ties to the political opposition was selected.
 Of the five daily newspapers, those with the widest circulation, Fraternite-Matin
 and Ivoire Soir, are government owned, though in 1993 both newspapers ran stories
 critical of government policies and increased significantly their coverage of the polit-
 ical opposition. A third daily, La Voie, with circulation figures approaching those of
 the government-owned dailies, is owned by members of the Ivoirian Popu lar Front,
 Cote dIvoire's principal opposition party. The fourth daily, Bonsoir, devotes most of
 its space to stories of general interest, and the fifth only began circulation in Sep-
 tember. Most of the weekly newspapers are affiliated either with the ruling or oppo-
 sition political parties. Foreign publications circulated freely.
 Many prominent Ivorian scholars are active in opposition politics and have not
 suffered professionally. The Government insists, however, that teachers separate
 their political activity from their work in the classroom. There are reports that the
 police have used informers at the University of Abidjan to provide data on dissident
 political activity.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly, but in practice that freedom is restricted when the Govern-
 ment perceives a danger to public order.
 
 
 Although opposition parties believe that the Constitution permits private associa-
 tions of any sort, the Government disagrees, and all organizations must register be-
 fore commencing activities. There were no reports in the past 2 years of registration
 being denied. Further, Ivorian law prohibits the formation of political parties along
 ethnic or religious lines. The past several years have seen a proliferation of non-
 governmental organizations (NGO's) addressing social, political, environmental, and
 other issues. In 1991 the Government made an administrative decision to ban the
 Federation of Ivorian Students (FESCI). Though the ban remains in effect, it was
 not enforced in 1993, allowing the FESCI to operate openly.
 Permits are required for public meetings and are sometimes denied to the opposi-
 tion but never to the PDCI. Gatherings occasionally are prohibited to prevent the
 expression of controversial views in public forums. In February 1992, the Govern-
 ment banned all outdoor public meetings "until further notice"; that ban has not
 been rescinded, though it is no longer strictly enforced.
 An "antivandal" law passed by the National Assembly in 1992 holds organizers
 of a march or demonstration responsible if any of the participants engage in vio-
 lence. The law was condemned by all major opposition parties and by the Ivorian
 Human Rights League (LIDHO) as being unduly vague and for imposing collective
 punishment for the crimes of a few. The law was not applied in 1993, although
 there were several instances when it could have been utilized, and it had no notice-
 able effect in restricting demonstrations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There are no known impediments to religious expression.
 There is no dominant religion, and no faith is officially favored by the Government.
 The open practice of religion is permitted, and there are no restrictions on religious
 ceremonies or teaching.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government exercises minimal control over domestic travel. How-
 ever, one of the most pervasive hindrances to freedom of movement and commerce
 within the country is the practice of establishing unauthorized internal roadblocks
 at which uniformed law enforcement officials extort small amounts of money or
 goods for contrived or minor infractions by motorists or passengers on public convey-
 ances. This practice affects both Ivorian and foreign travelers and is a flagrant ex-
 ample of the misuse of authority and lack of discipline of law enforcement person-
 nel.
 Ivorians normally can travel abroad and emigrate freely, and they have the right
 of voluntary repatriation. There are no known cases of revocation of citizenship. In
 1993 the Government twice denied permission to travel to international meetings
 to the head of the LIDHO under the pretext that he was neglecting his duties as
 dean of the university law faculty. For this reason he was unable to attend the
 World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna.
 Cote d'Ivoire's refugee and asylum practices are liberal. The Government respects
 the right to first asylum, and no groups are denied recognition as refugees, either
 by law or custom. Refugees normally receive 1-year renewable resident visas for
 their first 5 years in the country, after which they may apply for permanent resi-
 dence. Cote d'Ivoire does not offer permanent resettlement to refugees who have
 been granted temporary asylum elsewhere.
 Cote d'Ivoire currently hosts some 260,000 refugees from the Liberian civil war,
 and the Government was actively involved in managing Liberian refugee relief,
 though most resources came from foreign donors. While the first influx oT Liberian
 refugees received refugee status on entry, the large numbers that followed prompted
 the Government to initiate an application process, by which each refugee's status
 is determined by an interagency committee that includes representatives of the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Those not granted refugee status
 are allowed to remain in the country but are not allowed to benefit from any refugee
 assistance programs. Since the Government expects that Liberian refugees will re-
 patriate when conditions permit, no provisions have been made for their attaining
 permanent residence in Cote d'Ivoire. No cases of involuntary repatriation were re-
 ported in 1993.
 Political exiles from a number of countries have found Cote d'Ivoire a hospitable
 safe haven as long as they do not engage in political activities directed against their
 home governments.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have this right, although many in the ruling PDCI continue to block
 needed reforms and to engage in practices that do not encourage further democra-
 tization. Multiple parties were permitted in the 1990 presidential, legislative, and
 municipal elections whose results were generally accepted as legitimate, despite nu-
 
 
 72
 merous flaws and fraud. Although under the Constitution only Ivorian citizens are
 entitled to vote, the electoral law, which is promulgated for each election, has in re-
 cent years extended voting rights to non-Ivorian Aficans living in Cote d'Ivoire, who
 constitute approximately one-third of the country's population. This anomaly per-
 sists because only the President of the Republic and the President of the National
 Assembly have the standing to challenge the constitutionality of the electoral law,
 and neither has chosen to do so. Balloting is done in secret.
 The President is both Head of State and president of the PDCI. An appointed
 Prime Minister, who serves at the pleasure of the President, controls day-to-day
 governmental affairs and economic policy. With 3 seats vacant, the PDCI holds 162
 of the 175 seats in the National Assembly, which in practice is subordinate to the
 executive branch. Effectively, therefore, the President and the PDCI control all as-
 pects of Ivorian political life.
 There are no restrictions in law or practice on the participation of women in poli-
 tics, and they play an active role in Ivorian society and government. There are two
 female Ministers in the Cabinet (Minister of Communications and Minister of Fam-
 ily and the Protection of Women) as well as a female director of the social security
 system. Women play a limited but noticeable role in the legislature; while only 8
 of the 175 deputies in the National Assembly are women, 5 of the 36 leadership po-
 sitiins in the Assembly are held by females. Two members of the Supreme Court
 are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 An internal independent human rights organization, the Ivorian League of
 Human Rights (LIDHO), was formed in 1987 and was recognized by the Govern-
 ment in July 1990. The League has actively investigated alleged violations of human
 rights and issued press releases and reports, some of which have been critical of the
 Government. In 1991 the Ivorian Association for the Promotion of Human Rights
 was established for thepurpose of improving Ivorians' awareness of their basic
 r  e Government has been cooperative towards international inquiries into its
 human rights practices.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Discrimination based on race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, or religion is against
 the law. Although French is the official language and the language of instruction
 in the public schools, radio and television programs are also broadcast in major na-
 tional languages. Social and economic mobility are not limited by policy or custom
 on the basis of ethnicity or religion, although there are pronounced inequalities
 based on sex with males clearly in the preponderant role.
 Women.--ome Ivorian traditional societies accord women considerable political
 and economic power. In rural areas, tribal customs dictate that menial tasks are
 performed mostly by women, although farm work by men is also common. Govern-
 ment policy encourages full participation by women in social and economic life, but
 there is considerable informal resistance among employers in hiring women, who
 may be considered undependable by virtue of potential pregnancy. Women are
 underrepresented in some professions and in the managerial sector as a whole.
 Women in the formal sector, however, are paid on an equal scale with men and also
 enjoy maternity benefits. There are no reliable figures available on the percentage
 of women in the work force. Several Ivorian NGO s address the legal, economic, and
 social welfare of women, and there is a government ministry devoted to women's af-
 fairs.
 Violence against women, especially wife beating, is neither widely practiced nor
 tacitly condoned. However, representatives of women's organizations state that wife
 beating does occur and often leads to divorce. Doctors state that they rarely see the
 victims of such violence. A severe social stigma is attached to such violence; neigh-
 bors will often intervene in a domestic quarrel to protect a woman who is the object
 of physical abuse. The courts and police view such domestic violence as a family
 problem unless serious bodily harm is inflicted or the victim lodges a complaint, in
 which case criminal proceedings may take place. The Government has no clear-cut
 policy regarding spouse abuse beyond the obvious strictures against violence in the
 Civil Code.
 Children.-Cote d'Ivoire is a signatory to the U.N. International Charter on
 Human Rights, which contains sections promoting the health and education of chil-
 dren, and its Penal Code contains sections protecting children from infanticide and
 other violence and abandonment. The Ministries of Social Affairs and of Health and
 
 
 Social Protection are both charged with safeguarding the welfare of children, and
 the Government has also encouraged the formation of NGO's centered on children's
 issues, such as the Abidjan Legal Center for the Defense of Children.
 There is a parental preference for educating boys rather than girls, which is no-
 ticeable throughout the country but more pronounced in rural areas. According to
 a 1991 U.N. report, females in Cote d'Ivoire receive only one-third of the schooling
 of males. Sexual harassment of female students by male teachers is commonplace.
 Female genital mutilation is illegal in Cote d'Ivoire but is nevertheless practiced,
 particularly among the rural population in the north and west. The operation is
 usually performed on young girls or at puberty as part of a rite of passage; it is
 generally done outside modern medical facilities and may be extremely painful and
 dangerous to health. The Government does not make strong efforts to prevent the
 practice and social pressures are sufficiently intense that it persists, particularly
 in small villages, where the chief is the primary decisionmaker and village elders
 hold great influence. According to an independent expert in the field, the percentage
 of Ivorian women who have undergone genital mutilation may be as high as 60 per-
 cent. Excision is becoming less common as the population becomes u banized and
 better educated.
 People with Disabilities.-There are no laws mandating accessibility for the dis-
 abled. Laws do exist prohibiting the abandonment of the mentally or physically
 handicapped, as well as acts of violence directed at them. Traditional practices, be-
 liefs, and superstitions vary, but infants with serious disabilities have usually not
 been allowed to live, though this has changed since independence in 1960. The
 above laws were designed to combat this traditional practice and have resulted in
 some curtailment in the practice in recent years. Disabled adults are not the specific
 targets of abuse, but it is difficult for them to compete with able-bodied workers in
 the tight job market. The Government supports special schools, associations, and ar-
 tisans cooperatives for the disabled. The Ministry of Health and Social Protection
 has been working since 1992 on legislation to protect the rights of the disabled. The
 media increasingly addressed the issue in 1993, citing progress made but calling for
 more to be done.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right to form unions under the
 Labor Code of 1964, but union membership is not mandatory. For almost 30 years,
 the government-sponsored labor confederation, the General Union of Workers of
 Cote d'Ivoire (UGTCI), dominated union activity, except for the independent univer-
 sity teachers', secondary school teachers', and doctors' uaions. In 1991 several for-
 merly UGTCI-affiliated unions, including those representing transport, media, cus-
 toms, and bank workers, broke away and became independent. In 1992 a total of
 11 formerly independent unions joined together to form the Federation of Autono-
 mous Trade Unions of Cote d'Ivoire (FESCACI). A third labor federation, Dignite,
 has attracted few members. The leader of the UGTCI occupies a senior position in
 the PDCI hierarchy.
 The UGTCI is a relatively passive coordination mechanism rather than an active
 force for worker rights, although it has had some success in improving working con-
 ditions and safety standards. The UGTCI represents approximately one-third to one-
 half of the organizable work force. Non-UGTCI unions tend to be more activist than
 those within the UGTCI structure and to be identified with opposition causes.
 The Government's response to its loss of control over the labor movement has
 been to create rival unions in important sectors, such as university faculty, post and
 telecommunications, public transport, and radio and television, and to grant these
 unions special economic concessions. The World Confederation of Labor (WCL)
 charges that the Government sou ht to prevent a landslide victory of the WCL's
 Ivorian affiliate, Dignite, in national trade union elections in early 1993 by imposing
 a single election ticket of UGTCI in major enterprises and the port of Abidjan.
 These and other complaints alleging antiunion discrimination, intimidation, and de-
 nial of recognition of Dignite, as well as the harassment and arrest of leaders of
 the independent teachers' union, Synares, during the period 1990-92, continued
 under investigation by the International Labor Organization (ILO) Committee on
 Freedom of Association in 1993. The Government did not repress union activities
 or detain any union officials in 1993, but some of the participants in a 1991 protest
 march, who were alleged to have destroyed property, remain in detention. The Gov-
 ernment officially recognized Dignite in 1993.
 The right to strike is provided by the Constitution and by statute. The ILO's Com-
 mittee of Experts in 1993, however, reiterated earlier observations that the Labor
 Code gives the President excessive power to submit an industrial dispute to compul-
 sory arbitration in order to bring an end to a strike. The Labor Code requires a pro-
 
 
 74
 tracted series of negotiations and a 6-day notification period before a strike may be
 held, effectively making legal strikes difficult to organize. Strikes are seldom called
 by the UGTCI; however, non-UGTCI unions freely strike. In 1993 hospital employ-
 ees, telecommunications and postal workers, teachers, railroad employees, and staff
 at the Presidency and at a scientific research institute held strikes. Each of these
 strikes involved public sector workers. In each instance, the Government was able
 to meet some, although not all, of the demands presented by the unions, and the
 strikes were called off. In some cases, these unions went out on strike more than
 once during the year to protest arrearages in payment of salaries or other benefits
 that had been promised during earlier negotiations. Strikes in December involved
 teachers and electrical and health workers and were called off as a mark of respect
 after President Houphouet-Boigny's death was announced December 7, though agi-
 tation by university students continued.
 The MIGTCI, which is a member of the Organization of African Trade Union
 Unity, formally prohibits its individual trade unions from forming or maintaining
 affiliations with other international organizations in their fields. Non-UGTCI unions
 and confederations may freely affiliate with international bodies, as is the case of
 Dignite with its WCL affiliation.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code grants all
 Ivorians the right to join unions an dto bargain collectively. Collective bargaining
 agreements are in effect in many major business enterprises and sectors of the civil
 service. In most cases in which wages are not established in direct negotiations be-
 tween unions and employers, salaries are set by job categories by the Ministry of
 Employment and Civil Service. Labor inspectors have the responsibility to enforce
 a law which prohibits antiunion discrimination. Nonetheless, the ILO is reviewing
 charges that the Government practices such discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-There have been no reports of
 forced labor, which is prohibited by law. However, the ILO's Committee of Experts
 in its annual report questioned a decree that places certain categories of prisoners
 at the disposal of private enterprises for work assignments without their apparent
 consent.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-In most instances, the legal mini-
 mum working age is 16, and the Ministry of Employment and Civil Service enforces
 this provision effectively in the civil service and in large multinational companies.
 Ivorian labor law limits the hours of young workers, defined as those under 18, com-
 pared to the regular work force. However, children often work on family farms, and
 in cities some children routinely act as vendors in the informal sector. There are
 also reports of children working in what could be described as sweatshop conditions
 in small workshops. Many children leave the formal school system at an early age;
 primary education is mandatory but far from universally enforced, particularly in
 rural areas.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Cote d'Ivoire has administratively determined
 monthly minimum wage rates which were last adjusted in January 1986. A slightly
 higher rate applies to construction workers. Minimum wage rates are enforced only
 with respect to salaried workers employed by the Government or registered with the
 Social Security Office. Minimum wages vary according to occupation, with the low-
 est set at approximately $115 (CFA Francs 33,279) per month, insufficient to pro-
 vide a decent standard of living for a worker and family. The majority of Ivorians
 work in agriculture or in the informal sector where the minimum wage does not
 Through the Ministry of Employment and the Civil Service, the Government en-
 forces a comprehensive Labor Code governing the terms and conditions of service
 for wage earners and salaried workers and providing for occupational safety and
 health standards. Those employed in the formal sector are reasonably protected
 against unjust co pensation, excessive hours, and arbitrary discharge from employ-
 ment. The standard legal workweek is 40 hours. The law requires overtime payment
 on a graduated scale for additional hours. The Ivorian Labor Code provides for at
 least one 24-hour rest period per week.
 Government labor inspectors are empowered to order employers to improve sub-
 standard conditions and, if the employer fails to comply, fines may be levied by a
 labor court. In the large informal sector of the economy, however, involving both
 urban and rural workers, the Government's occupational health and safety regula-
 tions are enforced erratically at best. Ivorian workers in the formal sector have the
 right, under the Labor Code, to remove themselves from dangerous work without
 jeopardy to continued employment by utilizing the Ministry of labor inspection sys-
 tem to document dangerous workplace conditions. However, workers in the informal
 
 
 75
 sector are unlikely to be able to remove themselves from such labor without losing
 their employment.
