 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 Equatorial Guinea is nominally a multiparty constitutional republic, but in reality
 power is exercised by President Teodoro Obiang Nguema through a small subclan
 of the majority Fang tribe, which has ruled since the country's independence in
 1968. President Obiang was elected to a new 7-year term of office in February
 through elections marred by extensive fraud and intimidation. The President's
 Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea (PDGE) controls the judiciary and the legis-
 lature, the latter also through fraudulent elections.
 
 
 President Obiang exercises control over the police and security forces through the
 Minister of the Interior, who also serves as president of the national electoral board.
 The security forces committed numerous serious human rights abuses.
 The majority of the population of approximately 400,000 lives by subsistence agri-
 culture, supplemented by hunting and fishing. Barter is a major aspect of the econ-
 omy in which the small monetary sector is based on exports of petroleum, cocoa, and
 increasing quantities of timber. Most foreign economic assistance has been sus-
 pended due to the lack of economic reform and the Government's repeated violations
 of human rights. Substantial new oil deposits were discovered in 1995, with exploi-
 tation beginning in 1996. The use and investment of oil revenues remains a closed
 process despite repeated calls from financial institutions and Equatoguinean citizens
 for financial openness. The country's economic potential continues to be undermined
 by fiscal mismanagement and a lack of transparency in public finance.
 The Government's human rights record remained poor, and serious and system-
 atic abuses continued, although there was some improvement in certain areas. Citi-
 zens do not have the right to change their government. Principal abuses by the se-
 curity forces included: Physical abuse of prisoners; torture; beatings of detainees; ar-
 bitrary arrest and detention; extortion from prisoners; searches without warrants;
 and confiscation of property without due process. Officials took no action against se-
 curity force members suspected of human rights violations. However, unlike the pre-
 vious year, there were no reports of extrajudicial killing. Prison conditions remained
 life threatening. The judicial system does not ensure due process and is subject to
 executive influence. The Government severely restricts freedom of speech and the
 press. However, it permitted the establishment of two small, independent news-
 papers. The Government effectively limits the right of assembly. In the February
 presidential elections, the Government used arbitrary arrests, illegal detention, ex-
 tensive roadblocks, beatings, and outright fraud to ensure President Obiang's hold
 on power. Discrimination and violence against women and foreigners remain serious
 problems. Discrimination against minorities persists.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-here were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of any unresolved disappearances. Re-
 ported disappearances usually involved detention for several days in secret locations
 without notification of family members or access to legal representation.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 These abuses are serious, frequent, and widespread. The police routinely beat de-
 tainees severely, and victims often require hospitalization after release. Access to
 risoners is not generally permitted. The Government also uses the psychological ef-
 fect of arrest, afong with the fear of beating, to intimidate opposition party mem-
 bers. The security forces arrested prominent members of the opposition and beat
 and tortured them, the torture usually taking the form of beating of the soles of the
 feet.
 Credible reports emerged that authorities arrested opposition politicians Victorino
 Bolekia, the mayor of Malabo, along with deputy mayor Santiago Obama and oppo-
 sition figures Celestino Bacale and Julian Ehapo in February and badly beat them
 in detention. According to police, the prisoners-all of whom were elected in the mu-
 nicipal elections of 1995-were engaged in plotting a coup. However, credible
 sources report that rather than plotting, the four were attending French lessons at
 the French cultural center when the police raided the location. Mayor Bolekia was
 released within a few hours while the others remained incarcerated for 2 days. No
 official government action was taken against those responsible for the arrests and
 subsequent mistreatment of the prisoners in detention.
 In March presidential candidate Amancio Gabriel Nze was reportedly arrested in
 Bata, chained to a wall, and beaten by Lt. Colonel Diosdado Ngnema, police chief
 of Bata and reportedly a cousin of the President. Supporters arriving at the prison
 with food for Nze were allegedly also beaten.
 In April Celestino Bacale was arrested again, this time for writing a memoran-
 dum calling attention to the Government's poor human rights record. He was se-
 cretly flown to Bata, on the African mainland, where he was allegedly tortured. In
 a rare show of independence, however, a magistrate reviewed Bacale's case and or-
 dered his release.
 While campaigning in Konibe, presidential candidate Secundino Oyono was re-
 portedly fired upon by soldiers, later arrested, and tortured for 14 hours along with
 campaign worker Roque Maria Oyon. While there is no independent confirmation
 
 
 of the incident, it appears consistent with other accounts of arbitrary arrests and
 beatings. The Government has not prosecuted or punished any security officials for
 these abuses.
 Prison conditions are primitive and life threatening. During a September roundup
 of foreigners for the purpose of extortion, authorities locked 29 detainees in a small
 cell for 1 week with only a bucket for a toilet. Several independent sources con-
 firmed that prison guards beat a Togolese woman in her sixth month of pregnancy,
 causing a miscarriage. Rations are inadequate, and sanitary conditions practically
 nonexistent. Female prisoners are housed separately from men but are reportedly
 subjected to sexual abuse by guards.
 Prison conditions are monitored by the International Committee for the Red Cross
 (ICRC), which makes recommendations to the Government. However, the ICRC rec-
 ommendations are reportedly not released to the public. At the Government's insist-
 ence, they remain restricted to the ICRC, the Government, and the local Red Cross,
 which is charged with implementing the recommendations. There were credible re-
 ports that suggested changes, such as providing cells with cement floors and allow-
 ing prisoners access to clean water, had led to modest improvements in otherwise
 filthy conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention or Exile.-There are nominal but unenforced legal
 procedural safeguards regarding detention, the need for search warrants, and other
 protection of citizen's rights. These safeguards are systematically ignored by secu-
 rity forces.
 Police routinely hold prisoners in incommunicado detention. The Government ar-
 rested political figures and detained them for indeterminate periods. Foreigners
 from neighboring countries are likewise subject to arbitrary mistreatment. On Sep-
 tember 26 and 27, when security forces purportedly needed funds for the upcoming
 national day celebration on October 12, authorities took into custody hundreds of
 foreigners allegedly living without documentation. These included Nigerians, Gha-
 naians, Togolese, and Beninois. Many were taken from their beds and had their
 homes looted during raids. Bribes for release reportedly ranged from the equivalent
 of $10 to $100.
 Even after paying bribes and being freed, some foreigners were reportedly ar-
 rested a second time and forced to pay again. Women seized during the raid were
 confined to a small cell without windows. One credible source described their deten-
 tion chamber as "a sweat box" and said that their screaming could be heard all
 night. The guards verbally abused one person who attempted to bring food to jailed
 friends. A credible source reported that over 200 Nigerians were arrested and jailed.
 Many of these reportedly had their immigration papers in order, but were neverthe-
 less jailed for the purpose of extortion. Authorities allegedly forced prisoners to pay
 rent on their cells for the time of incarceration. The authorities reportedly con-
 fiscated the documents and property of 35 Nigerians without due process, then load-
 ed them onto a freighter, many clothed only in underwear, for forced repatriation
 to Nigeria.
 On November 13, security agents arrested opposition figure Celestino Bacale for
 allegedly insulting the President in their presence. Reportedly, an intoxicated secu-
 rity agent accused Balale of plotting to kill President Obiang, and ordered Bacale's
 arrest, after Bacale refused to allow his briefcase to be searched. Authorities re-
 leased him November 16, hours before a meeting between President Obiang and the
 Spanish President in Rome. The Government later ordered Bacale to present him-
 self before a military court on the charge of insulting the President. Bacale went
 into hiding, with the Government reportedly broadcasting appeals to the public to
 apprehend him. He fled the country in December, with the charges pending against
 him.
 There were no reports of long term political detainees. However, during the year,
 the Government arrested political leaders and detained them for indeterminate peri-
 ods while they were interrogated, beaten, and tortured (see Section 1.c.).
 The Government does not officially force its citizens into exile, but many persons
 who were able to travel abroad sought political asylum (see Section 2.d.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is not independent; judges serve at
 the pleasure of the President and are appointed, transferred, and dismissed for po-
 litical reasons. Corruption is rampant.
 The court system is composed of lower provincial courts, two appeals courts, and
 a Supreme Court. The President appoints members of the Supreme Court, who re-
 port to him. There are also traditional courts in the countryside, in which tribal el-
 ders adjudicate civil claims and minor criminal matters.
 The Constitution and laws passed by the Chamber of Deputies provide for legal
 representation and the right to appeal. In practice, authorities often do not respect
 these provisions. Civil cases rarely come to public trial.
 
 
 There were no reports of long term political prisoners. During the year, however,
 the Government arrested political leaders and detained them for indeterminate peri-
 ods (see Section l.d.).
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government does not enforce the law requiring judicial warrants for searches. Secu-
 rity forces regularly search homes and arrest occupants and generally do so without
 warrants.
 The Government does not overtly force officials to join the PDGE. However, for
 lawyers, government employees, and others, party membership is necessary for em-
 ployment and promotion. Even in the private sector, many citizens claim that party
 membership is necessary in order to be hired. The party anner is prominently dis-
 played with the national flag in government offices, and many officials wear PDGE
 lapel pins.
 There is surveillance of members of the opposition parties, resident diplomats, as
 well as accredited diplomats.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and the Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of
 speech and the press, but the Government severely restricts these rights in practice.
 Mild criticism of public institutions and government mismanagement is allowed.
 The Government,     owever, permits no criticism of the President or the security
 forces. All journalists must be registered with the Ministry of Information. Accord-
 ing to trade sources, there are five or six independent reporters registered with the
 Ministry of Information. Between 30 and 40 reporters working for official party or
 government publications are also registered. Foreign reporters visiting Equatorial
 Guinea are required to be accompanied by guides from the Ministry of Information.
 The Ministry of Information also allegedly requires publishers to submit copy for
 approval prior to publication. All local publications exercise self-censorship an are
 subject to prior restraint. However, the Government permitted the establishment of
 two small, independent newspapers, La Gaceta and El Sol. Some foreign publica-
 tions are sold, though security forces reportedly peruse the contents of publications
 from Spain and con     ate literature critical of the Government. Outdated copies of
 Spanish and American newspapers are available to clients of prominent hotels.
 Shortwave broadcasts and government-controlled radio and television are available.
 Spanish broadcasts transmitted to Equatorial Guinea have been a source of friction
 between the two governments. Radio France International also transmits from
 Malabo.
 Television broadcasts only a few hours each day. Cable is available, broadcasting
 the Cable News Network (CNN), Music TV (MTV), French news, movies, and car-
 toons. The Government withholds access to broadcasting by opposition parties, and
 rarely refers to the opposition in anything but a negative light when broadcasting
 the news.
 There are no institutions of higher learning, although the Government is planning
 to open a university, with the foreign assistance, by combining teachers' training
 centers and other institutions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The right of assembly and as-
 sociation is provided for in the Constitution. However, government authorization
 must be obtained for meetings in private homes of more than 10 people for discus-
 sions that the regime considers political.
 All parties must register with the Minister of Interior, and supply the names of
 members and a statement of purpose. Opposition parties must seek permits to hold
 meetings, including conferences and private meetings. Opposition members who
 have attempted to circumvent this regulation were beaten by security forces. Gath-
 erings in public places, even small gatherings, are generally observed by security
 forces. The Government requires permits for public events, which it routinely grants
 but often quickly cancels, effectively undermining the right of assembly. Authorities
 granted, then canceled, permission for a meeting on the national day by opposition
 members who had planned to gather to discuss long-term strategies.
 Credible sources state that citizens living in rural areas are hesitant to associate
 or even be seen with foreigners, fearing that doing so may lead to repercussions
 from government authorities.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Government generally respects freedom of religion.
 There is no state religion, and the Government does not discriminate against any
 faith. However, a religious organization must first be formally recognized by the
 Ministry of Justice and Reigion before its practice is allowed. Foreign missionaries
 reported a significant easing of restrictions on their activities during the year.
 Nevertheless, the Government restricts the freedom of expression of the clergy.
 During the year, there were several incidents in which priests were arrested, beat-
 
 
 83
 en, and expelled from their parishes for allegedly preaching 'political sermons." On
 February 13, Father Jose Carlos Esono was reportedly arrested in Bata and sub-
 jected to mistreatment by police who accused him of antigovernment activities. Reli-
 able sources reported that a Nigerian priest was expelled in March for declining to
 celebrate mass for the President.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-In theory, freedom of movement and travel throughout the country are
 provided for in the law. However, local police routinely demand bribes from occu-
 pants of cars, taxis, and other vehicles traveling outside the capital. The Bubi ethnic
 group on the island of Bioko is unable to move about freely, according to credible
 sources, as the Government fears separatist sympathies among the Bubis. Road-
 blocks throughout the island reportedly prevent them from traveling between vil-
 lages. Ethnic Fangs are also subject to extortion at random roadblocks.
 During the 1996 Presidential elections, the Government systematically restricted
 the travel of opposition presidential candidates. According to credible reports, road-
 blocks on the island of Bioko and in continental Equatorial Guinea effectively kept
 opposition candidates away from their bases of popular support. Meetings were dis-
 rupted, and rallies canceled as a result. Election observers noted chains across
 major roads during the height of the political campaign.
 Since the elections, the PDGE promulgated a directive to provincial bureaus to
 further restrict the free movement of opposition figures. The order entails
 confiscating property and documents of traveling members of the opposition, as well
 as searching them for "subversive documents. The directive has been described as
 "an order of permanent harassment'
 Members of opposition parties frequently travel abroad but may face a hostile re-
 ception upon their return. For example, opposition figure Placido Mico was stopped
 and searched at the airport in October, following a visit to the United States. Au-
 thorities, led by the director general of national security, Antonio Mba (the Presi-
 dent's brother), reportedly confiscated literature and souvenirs brought home from
 the trip. Nearly 90 percent of citizens who obtained visas for Spain in recent years
 reportedly never returned to Equatorial Guinea. Most sought political asylum.
 There are both refugees and asylum seekers. According to a credible source, some
 20 refugees from Liberia, Rwanda, Sudan, and Mauritania have sought political asy-
 lum. The Government generally grants these requests. Most refugees, however, do
 not declare themselves.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution nominally provides citizens with the right to change their gov-
 ernment peacefully, but in fact there have been no free, fair, and transparent presi-
 dential elections since independence in 1968. The President exercises complete
 power as Head of State, commander of the armed forces, and leader of the PDGE.
 Leadership positions with the Government are, in general, restricted to the Presi-
 dent's subclan and closest supporters. While there is an elected Chamber of Depu-
 ties, it is not representative and is dominated by the Government. The Minister of
 the Interior also acts as president of the national electoral board.
 The February presidential election, in which President Obiang claimed victory
 with 98 percent of the vote, was considered openly fraudulent by international ob-
 servers. The President's early call for elections, ostensibly an effort to move toward
 democracy at the earliest opportunity, was perceived by many as a ploy to catch the
 opposition, as well as the nation's voters, off guard. The move met with repeated
 protests from the international community. It deprived opposition parties of suffi-
 cient time to organize their campaigns and meet with voters. Some opposition politi-
 cians who campaigned were beaten and jailed. Voting was done in the open and
 without secrecy, with opposition parties allegedly barred from access to polling
 areas. There were credible reports of widespread arrests and violence against oppo-
 sition party members before the elections. Several countries refused to dispatch offi-
 cial observers. Accounts of observers who did attend included reports of beatings,
 roadblocks, stuffed ballot boxes, and open voting in the presence of security forces.
 Most opposition parties, claiming that it was futile to run amidst such blatant cor-
 ruption, opted to boycott the elections.
 Although there are no legal restrictions on the participation of women in politics,
 women remain seriously underrepresented. There are 2 women in the 42-member
 Cabinet, and 5 in the 80-member legislature.
 
 
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no effective local human rights nongovernmental organizations. One
 person who attempted to initiate a program with European Union funds to deal
 with human rights issues and the rehabilitation of torture victims was arrested and
 accused of running an illegal operation. According to credible reports, the person
 sought government approval and appealed to the Prime Minister for support, but
 the project failed and the individualleft the country.
 The United Nations Special Rapporteur for Human Rights visited once during the
 year and received government cooperation.
 The United Nations Development Program's effort to encourage transparency in
 the 1995 municipal elections created friction with the Government. The Government
 requested the removal of the resident representative in 1995; he departed this year.
 The Government established a parliamentary commission on human rights ap-
 proximately 4 years ago. This organization, however, has rarely been heard from,
 and it has little credibility or influence.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 While the Constitution condemns all forms of discrimination, both governmental
 and social discrimination continue. These are reflected in traditional constraints on
 women's education and in the circumscribed opportunities for professional and occu-
 pational achievement of ethnic minorities. The Government deliberately limits po-
 tential opportunities for ethnic minorities.
 Women.-Societal violence against women, particularly wife beating, is common.
 Public beating of wives is forbidden by government decree, but violence in the home
 is generally tolerated. The Government does not prosecute perpetrators of domestic
 violence.
 Although the Constitution provides for equal rights, women are largely confined
 by custom to traditional roles, particularly in agriculture. Polygyny, which is wide-
 spread among the Fang, contributes to women a secondary status, as does limited
 educational opportunity;, on average, women receive only one-fifth as much schooling
 as men.
 There is no discrimination against women with regard to inheritance and family
 laws, but there is discrimination in traditional practice. For an estimated 90 percent
 of women, including virtually all ethnic groups except the Bubi, tradition dictates
 that if a marriage is dissolved, the wife must return the dowry given her family by
 the bridegom at the time of marriage, while the husband automatically receives
 custody otheir children.
 Similarly, in the Fang, Ndowe, and Bisio cultures, primogeniture is practiced, and
 as women become meers of their husband's families upon marriage, they are not
 usually accorded inheritance rights. According to the law women have the right to
 buy and sell property and goods, but in practice the male-dominated society permits
 few women access to sufficient funds to engage in more than petty trading or to pur-
 chase real property beyond a garden plot or modest home.
 Children.-There are no legislated provisions for the welfare of children. The Gov-
 ernment devotes little attention to children's rights or welfare and has no set policy
 in this area. Education is compulsory up to the age of 18, but the Government does
 not enforce the law.
 People With Disabi ities.No constitutional or legal provisions exist for the phys-
 ically disabled with respect to discrimination in employment or education. Nor is
 there legislation mandating accessibility to buildings or government services.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-There is no legaldiscrimination against eth-
 nic or racial minorities, and the Government does not overtly limit participation by
 them, but the monopolization of political power by the President's Mongomo sublan
 of the Fang ethnic group persists.
 In practice some members of minorities face discrimination because they are not
 members of the Fang ethnic group, or belong to a subclan other than the Presi-
 dent's. Minorities do not face discrimination in inheritance, marriage, or family
 laws.
 Several thousand citizens of Nigeria, Ghana, and Francophone Africa continue to
 reside in the country. Most are small traders and business people. There are numer-
 ous reports of their harassment by the police (ace Section 1.d.)
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Although the Constitution provides for the right to
 organize unions, the Government has not passed enabling legation. A 1995 peti-
 tion by service sector employees to form a union in the mainland capital of Bata
 
 
 has yet to be answered by the Government. In the small wage economy, no labor
 organization exists, although there are a few cooperatives with limited power. The
 law prohibits strikes. The Labor Code contains provisions to uphold worker rights,
 but the Government generally does not enforce them.
 It is generally acknowledged that membership in the PDGE is a prerequisite for
 hiring and promotion in both public and private sectors. Membership in a rival po-
 liticaorganization is considered grounds for dismissal from any position, public or
 private. Opposition politicians often claim to have been dismissed from their jobs
 after joining alternate political groups. Credible sources maintain that during the
 1996 presidential elections several large private employers reportedly threatened to
 dismiss workers who did not vote for President Obiang. Now that the oil industry
 is a major employer, hiring is controlled by the Government, operating through an
 agency, APEGESA. Independent sources confirm that APEGESA screens applicants
 for positions and excludes those considered unfriendly or indifferent to the PDGE.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There is no legislation regard-
 ing these rights, or prohibiting antiunion discrimination. There is no evidence of col-
 lective bargaining by any group. Wages are set by the Government and employers,
 with little or no input from the workers. Employers must pay the minimum wages
 set by the Government, and most companies pay more than the government-estab-
 lished minimum.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law forbids forced labor and
 slavery, and there is no evidence that such activity takes place. Convicted felons do,
 within the law, preform extensive labor outside prison without compensation.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The legal minimum age for child
 employment is 18 years, but the Ministry of Labor does not enforce this law. The
 Government also does not enforce the law that stipulates mandatory education up
 to the age of 18. Underage youth perform both family farm work and street vending.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law prescribes a standard 35-hour work-
 week and a 48-hour rest period which are observed in practice in the formal econ-
 omy. The minimum monthly wage is approximately $53 (cfa 27,500). The minimum
 wage does not provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family. The
 Labor Code provides for comprehensive protection for workers from occupational
 hazard, but the Government does not enforce this in practice. Employees who pro-
 test unhealthy or dangerous working conditions risk the loss of their jobs.
