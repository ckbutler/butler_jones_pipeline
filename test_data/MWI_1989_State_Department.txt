 MALAWI
 an alleged foreign press campaign against the official
 hostess, C. T. Kadzamira. This, and the fact that an earlier
 dissident leader was murdered in Harare in 1983 following
 similar criticism from the President, led many to believe that
 the act was directed by Malawian authorities. The Zambian
 Government's investigation has not been conclusive, and
 allegations continued to circulate. Before he died, Mhango
 told a reporter that the real target may have been Edward R.
 Chirwa Yapwanthwa, MAFREMO chairman, who planned to slip into
 Malawi clandestinely and had been staying at Mhango's home.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known political disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Beatings by police during arrest or detention are illegal but
 occur. Responsible officials are rarely disciplined. Terms
 of hard labor are the norm for common criminals. Al's 1989
 Report focuses on harsh conditions in several prisons. Al
 also reported a number of deaths in Nsanje and Dzeleka Prisons.
 In 1987 Orton and Vera Chirwa were transferred from Mikuyu
 prison to Zomba Central Prison where conditions were
 reportedly worse. Margaret Marango Banda, an Anglican women's
 leader (and Aleke Banda's cousin--see below) who was detained
 that same year, is imprisoned with Vera Chirwa. They are not
 permitted to speak with One another and are denied access to
 visiting clergy. Their diet is insufficient, and Ms. Banda is
 believed to be in poor health with inadequate medical
 attention. The Chirwas have not been able to speak with one
 another for at least 4 years and are not allowed to receive
 mail from their children.
 Frackson Zgambo, an airport official and football referee, was
 detained with Fred Sikwese. While there have been reports of
 his death, Zgambo is believed to be under detention in Mikuyu
 Prison.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under the Preservation of Public Security Act, the Minister of
 Justice (a position held by President Banda) may order the
 arrest, search, and detention of persons considered a threat
 to the preservation of public order. The Act was amended in
 1977 to eliminate a 30-day limit. Persons.arrested under this
 law can be, and often are, detained indefinitely without
 charge and without trial. The President must review such
 cases every 6 months, but this safeguard has had no noticeable
 effect.
 Still in detention at the end of 1989 were: Brown
 Mpinganjira, Deputy Chief of Information, detained in 1986 for
 providing information to foreign journalists; Dr. Goodluck
 Mhango, a veterinary surgeon with the Nalawi Young Pioneers,
 detained in September 1987 because his brother (killed in
 1989) wrote articles critical of the Government; Jack Mapanje,
 a prominent professor and poet, also detained in September
 1987 for planning to publish a volume of poetry deemed
 critical of the President; Mr. B 1eyo, a senior Ministry of
 Finance official, detained in August 1988, reportedly for
 revealing to the foreign press the -cost of a presidential trip
 to Great Britain; Dr. George Mtafu, Malawi's only native
 neurosurgeon, arrested in early 1989 after making a
 disparaging remark in a private gathering about the condition
 
 
 205
 of the aging President's brain. Kalusa Chimombo, a prominent
 member of the teachers' association of Malawi before his
 arrest in1978, remains imprisoned as the country's longest
 serving "prisoner of-conscience,"'according to AI.
 Other persons detained in early 1989 for unknown reasons
 included: Tozer Khonje, a government.agronomist; Dave Mumba,
 an employee of a private company; and George Thindwa, an
 employed of +he Ministry of Trade and Industry. Mtafu,
 Khonje, and hindwa may'have been~victims'of an antinorthern
 campaign (see tection 5). Aleke Banda, once a presidential
 confidant and high-ranking official, was quiIly. released from
 Mikuyu Prison in late 1988 and is currehtly under house Arrest
 nearby. Detained in 1980, Banda has never been charged.
 AI estimates that, a least 30 persons were detained in the
 first half of 1989.. Although Malawian secrecy makes an
 accurate etimate impossible, most observers consider this is
 a reliable estimate. Detentions continued, albeit at a
 reduced rate; late into the year. While forced exile has not
 been used as means of control, there is a small politically
 motivated outward flow of persons from the country. In late
 1988, the Chairman of the Malawi National Education Board,
 Donton Mkandawire, was dismissed for allegedly packing the
 education system with fellow northerners. Reportedly fearing
 imprisonment, he subsequently fled to Botswana.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Malawi has both traditional and modern court systems. Lawyers
 are not permitted to assist defendants in regional traditional
 court cases, but legal counsel is permitted in the modern
 court system. The right of appeal exists in both court
 systems. The judiciary is not independent, and the executive
 does not hesitate to intervene in cases of interest to it,
 particularly those of political or security import.
 The modern court'system consists of the magistrate courts, the
 High Court,'and the Supreme Court of Appeal. The President
 appoints the Chief Justice of the High Court and, after
 consultation with the Judicial Service Commission, other
 modern court justices. Most are well qualified. Due to much
 lower salaries, however, magistrates tend to be recent law
 school 'graduates with no experience. This is the level at
 which most poor persons (who cannot afford legal counsel)
 first come into contact with the modern court system. The
 latter is open to the public, and defendants are charged
 publicly. Due process, however, is frequently ignored. In
 1989 several-municipal officials including the town clerks of
 LilongweVand Blantyre, were summarily fired. Some were
 detained, then released without ever being charged. None was
 permitted to defend himself in court. Several attempted to
 sue the Government for wrongful dismissal, only to be informed
 that theii files had been closed by presidential decree.
 The three traditional courts at the regional level deal with
 most capital offenses, including treason (the Chirwas were
 tried in a traditional court). Police officials handle the
 prosecution, and defendants conduct their own defense.
 Traditional court justices are appointed directly by the
 President. Of the five members of each regional traditional
 court, three are chiefs without formal legal training, one is
 
 
 206
 MALAWI
 a trained lawyer who advises the court, and the fifth, the
 chairman, has had a course in law. There is little executive
 interference in traditional court cases dealing in
 nonpolitical matters of customary law.
 The Forfeiture Act permits the Government to revoke the
 property rights of those suspected of economic crimes, such as
 illegal currency transactions. These revocations sometimes
 have political overtones and are almost always directed
 against the Asian community. When the Forfeiture Act is
 invoked, the person loses all worldly possessions, including
 business, financial, and personal assets. Revocation of
 property rights is carried out by executive fiat with no
 judicial review. The Forfeiture Act was not invoked during
 1989, suggesting a government moderation in applying its
 draconian measures. The courts several times tried illegal
 currency cases instead. Punishments generally fit the crime.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home,. or
 Correspondence
 Police can enter houses of suspects at will under special
 entry authority to conduct searches for suspects or
 incriminating evidence. It is generally understood that
 telephones are.xoutinely tapped and that a network of
 informers reports private statements and actions to the
 Government. Authorities open some domestic and international
 mail.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government does not tolerate criticism of any kind of its
 policies. It is an offense (5 years'. imprisonment) to publish
 anything likely "to undermine the authority of, or public
 confidence in, the Government." Life imprisonment applies to
 "false information" sent out of the country which is "harmful
 to the interests or good name of Malawi." In practice, giving
 critical information to foreign journalists results in
 detention without trial. Any discussion of Malawi's political
 future or speculation about the President's age is prohibited.
 Local media do not submit their news and programs to the
 Government beforehand, but self-censorship "guidelines" are
 generally understood. Journalists, including senior editors,
 have been jailed for extended periods for overstepping these
 "guidelines." Malawi's two newspapers and government-owned
 radio station exist primarily to catalog the Chief of State's
 words and activities. Nevertheless, criticism of the
 efficiency of some government departments occasionally appears
 in the media and often in parliamentary debate.
 Foreign journalists must request permission to enter Malawi
 and must specify in advance the topics they intend to cover.
 Correspondents from the New York Times, Washington Post, and
 Financial Times visited Malawi in 1989 and wrote articles
 which would have been unheard of in past years. In a major
 breakthvough, two Western journalists were allowed to set up
 residence in Malawi. Although a spate of critical foreign
 press articles (of which they may have been innocent)
 temporarily compelled the two journalists to leave the country
 in October, they were allowed to return 2 weeks later.
 All publications, recordings, and movies entering Malawi are
 
 
 207
 MALAWI
 screened by the Censorship Board. The current list of banned
 items includes well over 1,000 titles.
 Limited freedom of inquiry into the natural and social
 sciences- exists at the University and may include some
 examination of radical political ideologies, provided this
 does not extend to criticism of the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political meetings are not permitted outside the framework of
 the Malawi Congress Party. Persons may be imprisoned if they
 further the aims of an "unlawful society," defined as "any
 group considered to be dangerous to the good government of the
 republic." In the nonpolitical sphere, individuals and
 organizations generally are free to meet and associate.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no-state or-preferred religion, but religious groups
 are required to register with the Government. Jehovah's
 Witnesses,,whose religious convictions prevent them from
 joining political parties, have.been banned since 1967. The
 Government considers the Witnesses' activities to be
 disruptive of "the prevailing calm, law, and order."
 Witnesses continue to be arrested and charged. In 1989 a
 Jehqvah'sWitness representative claimed that entire families
 were arrested in the period 1986-88 and are still in Dzeleka
 prison.
 Other religious groups generally may establish places of
 worship and train clergy. Religious publications, like all
 others, mayznot criticize the Government or the party. Most
 religious groups are free to establish -and maintain links with
 coreligionists in other countries, and members are free to
 travel abroad. Malawi's sizable Muslim minority- conducts its
 religion and builds mosques freely. President Banda has
 publicly stressed the importance of providing the same civic
 services to Muslims which the Christian majority enjoys.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There-are few restrictions, in practice, on movement within
 Malawi for most citizens, though legal provisions exist for
 restricting-movement of those convicted of political or
 criminal offenses. However, Asian residents and ci izens,
 while free-to travel within the country, must reside and work
 in one of four urban .areas (Lilongwe, Zomba, Mzuzu, and
 Dlantyre/Limbe). Denial of passports on political grounds
 frequently. extends to family members of persons in political
 disfavor and to those persons the Government suspects may
 criticize'it if allowed to travel abroad. Civil servants and
 employees of state-owned enterprises must obtain written
 permission to travel abroad, even on vacation. Obtaining such
 a clearance can take from a few days to several months.
 Formal emigration is neither restricted not encouraged.
 Malawi hosts the largest refugee population in Africa. Nearly
 800,000 Mozambicans, located in heavily populated areas with
 little available land, have seriously strained the economy as
 well as transportation and social services networks. The
 
 
 208
 MALAWI
 Government has shared its own scarce resources and has
 encouraged and cooperated with international and private
 voluntary organizations to operate relief efforts. The latter
 are coordinated by a committee chaired by the Ministry of
 Health. -The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and
 other international assistance groups travel freely to assess
 relief needs and to investigate allegations of protection
 problems.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens of Malawi do not, in practice, have the ability to
 change their government. Major political decisions are made
 by the President or his close associates. Opposition
 political parties or movements are not permitted. Membership
 in the Malawi Congress Party is not legally mandatory, but it
 is frequently coerced. Based on the 1987 census, over 70
 percent of the adult population holds at least nominal party
 membership. Membership is expected of those who aspire to
 government positions (including the civil service) or
 professional success. Party membership is often required of
 schoolchildren and of those who seek access to government
 services or entrance to local markets. The annual renewal fee
 is only about 35 cents, but this can be nearly half a day's
 pay for a minimum wage earner. When the President visits an
 area, financial contributions from individuals and businesses
 are also levied.
 The party structure provides for some choice among candidates
 for party, parliamentary, and other offices. All nominees,
 however, are selected by the party and approved by the
 President. Active political campaigning is not permitted.
 The National Assembly, consisting of both elected and a few
 appointed members, is mainly concerned with ratifying
 government policy. Its powers are broadly based in law but
 highly circumscribed in practice.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government does not permit organizations such as the
 International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty
 International to visit prisons or conduct human rights
 investigations in Malawi. It does not respond to their
 appeals. Local nongovernmental human rights organizations are
 not permitted to exist. Expressions of interest in alleged
 human rights problems by outside groups or persons are not
 welcomed. Repeated diplomatic efforts to discuss the case of
 Vera and Orton Chirwa with the Government have been rejected.
 Separate efforts in 1989 by representatives of the U.S. and
 West German Governments to discuss directly with President
 Banda the Mapanje and Dr. Mtafu cases, respectively, resulted
 in his angry rejection of what he termed interference in
 Malawi's internal affairs.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Asian residents, whether Malawian citizens or not, have been
 compelled to transfer ownership of rural shops and trucking
 businesses to ethnic Africans. Strict rules governing where
 Asians may own property effectively limit where they may
 reside. Changes in the citizenship law in 1986 eliminated a
 
 
 209
 MALAWI
 provision whereby persons who held foreign passports could
 reside-inddfinitely in Malawi. These changes in the law,
 together with actions under the Forfeiture Act (which has been
 applied in-large measure against Asians), have led many in the
 small Asian community (about 5,000 persons) to leave Malawi
 and others to question their long-term future there. Some
 Asians began to return, however, in'1989.
 Regionalism as a divisive domestic issue resurfaced during the
 President's annual crop tour in February 1989. Although the
 Life President evidently supported antinorthern campaigns in
 years past, this was the first time that President Banda
 allowed the full weight of his office to sanction regionalism
 openly. Prominent northerners who lost their jobs included:
 John Phiri, the Secretary for Trade and Industry. Hastings
 Chunga, General'Manager of Sedom (the Government's small
 enterprise development scheme); and James Chatupa, the
 Government's Chief Geologist. Other northerners, notably
 Police Commissioner G. G. Mtawala and Chief Magistrate S.F.C.
 Munyenyembe, were "retired" and stripped of their pensions.
 Several lesser officials were transferred to other jobs.
 Perhaps to compensate, the President highlighted unity (from
 Malawi's four doctrinaire cornerstones) at the annual party
 congress in September, during Mothers Day in October, and at
 the closing of Parliament in November. It-is unlikely that
 regional sensibilities were assuaged since few northerners who
 were detained, lost their jobs, or felt compelled to leave the
 country in 1989 have obtained remedial relief.
 Most women are lifiited to roles defined by a traditional
 African society and do not have opportunities equal to men,
 although the President takes a special interest in advancing
 their status. Violence against women is not tolerated. At
 the annual party conference in 1989, the President made the
 entire Central Committee stand and acknowledge that any wife
 beaten by her husband could approach them directly for
 redress. Responding as well to a report of telephone
 harassment against a European woman, the President directed
 the police to tap phones, find the culprit, and send him off
 to prison for life without a trial.
 Women enjoy access to maternal health services and to
 extension programs designed to improve their homemaking
 abilities. Such programs, while benefical, have'not given
 full recognition to the importance of women as agricultural
 producers in the rural sector (roughly 70 percent of all
 smallholder farms and over 50 percent of subsistence holdings
 are headed by women) and the potential role women can play in
 the modern sector. Males still have an advantage in education
 and employment, but the Government has initiated broad-scale
 programs to reverse existing discrimination. A third of the
 positions in the public education system, for example, have
 been'reserved for women. Malawi's traditional tribal
 leadership structures remain primarily matrilineal. Several
 small ethnic groups grant few rights and privileges to women
 and occasionally continue to practice female circumcision.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Nongovernment workers have the legal right to associate, form,
 and join unions, and labor unions do exist in the small wage
 sector'. However, their activities are highly circumscribed by
 
 
 210
 MALAWI
 the Government, and they are generally ineffective in
 achieving gains for workers. Most wage workers are unskilled
 laborers on large agricultural estates. Labor unions must
 associate under the Trade Union Congress of Malawi (TUCM).
 Malawi law provides for the right to strike, but strikes do
 not occur in practice. Ministry of Labor officers are quick
 to intervene at the first hint of labor unrest. With
 government supervision, the TUCM associates with international
 organizations and is affiliated with The Organization of
 African Trade Union Unity and the International Confederation
 of Free Trade Unions.
 The Government allowed the Southern African Trade Union
 Coordination Council to open a permanent office in Malawi in
 1988. It is headed by a former Malawian labor leader who was
 once detained for several years on political grounds. The
 Chamber of Commerce's general manager is also a former
 political detainee, illustrating that some persons are
 occasionally permitted to make a comeback in Malawi.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers have the legal right to organize, and the law
 prohibits antiunion discrimination by implication. Complaints
 are resolved by the Ministry of labor. Collective bargaining
 is protected by law, but its use is limited. The Government
 has set a minimum wage and regulates working conditions, but
 it does not intervene overtly in the collective bargaining
 process. Labor legislation is applied uniformly throughout
 the country. There are no export processing zones in Malawi.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is prohibited by law and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The -minirsum working age is 14, but this applies only to the
 small urban wage sector where it is enforced by labor
 inspectors from the Ministry of Labor. In the large
 subsistence agriculture sector, the minimum age is not
 enforced, and children work on family farms at a younger age.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Less than 15 percent of the work force is employed in the
 formal wage sector. For those fortunate enough to hold paid
 jobs, wages and working conditions are generally adequate, and
 paid holidays and safety standards in the workplace are
 required by law. However, enforcement of these standards is
 limited. Malawi's low wage levels reflect the abundance of
 unskilled labor and the Government's policy of limiting the
 urban-rural income gap to stem migration into the towns. Wage
 earners fare slightly better in living standards than the vast
 majority of workers engaged in subsistence agriculture. The
 minimum wage reflects the fact that Malawi is one of the
 poorest countries in the world.
 New minimum wage rates, the first in 3 years, were implemented
 in May 1989. Mimimum daily wages nearly doubled in Malawi's
 three cities, to 80 cents per day; and wage rates in rural
 areas increased 125 percent, to 30 cents per day. Wages for
 experienced skilled workers are increasing sharply as the
 supply of such workers diminishes, and large numbers of them
 find better paying jobs in S.A. and Botswana.
