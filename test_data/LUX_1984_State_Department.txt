 LUXEMBOURG
 Luxembourg is a parliamentary democracy led by a
 constitutional monarch. As a Western democracy, Luxembourg
 insures that human rights are respected at home and works
 actively to promote them internationally. The country's
 economy is highly industrialized. Its free enterprise system
 is centered on steel production, service industries
 (especially banking), radio and television broadcasting,
 agriculture, and tourism. Luxembourg continues efforts to
 treat women equally and its large foreign population fairly,
 and to engage labor unions in the industrial decisionmaking
 process, together with management and government. The
 judicial and penal systems are fair and nondiscriminatory.
 The integrity of the person and civil and political rights are
 guaranteed by the Constitution and are protected in practice.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Killing for political motives by the Government or by
 opposition political organizations is unknown in Luxembourg.
 There are no indigenous terrorist organizations in the
 country.
 b. Disappearance
 Official abduction or secret arrest does not occur.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by law and is not practiced. Treatment
 of prisoners is exemplary. Prisoners have free choice of
 attorneys and are allowed visitors. A new modern prison to
 serve all Luxembourg was recently opened.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 No prisoners are detained in disregard of generally accepted
 rights and safeguards pertaining to detention. Habeas corpus
 is respected. Preventive detention does not exist.
 Defendants must be charged no later than 24 hours after
 arrest. Persons can be kept in jail pending trial, if so
 ordered by a judge. Exile is not imposed.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Luxembourg has an independent judiciary, free from executive
 or military interference. There are military courts, but
 civilians are not subject to their jurisdiction. Defendants
 have the right to legal counsel. Charges are formally and
 clearly stated.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Police must have warrants, issued by the judiciary, to enter a
 private home. No cases of forced entry have been alleged.

 Statutes prohibit.other violations of the home such as
 electronic surveillance. The privacy of correspondence is
 respected.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and press.
 Except for restrictions against pornography, there is no media
 censorship. The Government neither threatens nor intimidates
 individuals or media critical of it, nor does it interfere
 with academic inquiry.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly is guaranteed by the Constitution and
 respected in practice. Unions have the right to organize,
 negotiate, and strike, although by tradition strikes are rare
 in Luxembourg. Unions participate in a tripartite arrangement
 with government and management in the decisionmaking process
 on major economic issues. Virtually the entire work force is
 unionized. Unions and professional groups freely maintain
 contacts with international bodies in their fields.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Luxembourg does not have a state religion, and there is no
 discrimination against practitioners of minority religions.
 However, thepopulation is statistically 99 percent Roman
 Catholic, and this faith is deeply intertwined with the
 conservative culture of the country. Thus, a Roman Catholic
 consensus often surfaces on social issues; e.g., there is no
 government funding for abortions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions regarding movement within
 Luxembourg, foreign travel, or emigration and repatriation.
 There are no barriers to immigrants from the European
 Community (EC) countries. The status of citizens of Spain and
 Portugal in Luxembourg is guaranteed by bilateral agreements
 and is similar to that accorded citizens of the EC. However,
 regulations governing admittance for permanent residence have
 been tightened. Although Luxembourg is not a country of first
 application for refugees, government officials believe that,
 on a per capita basis within the EC, relatively liberal
 numbers of refugees (notably Vietnamese) have been admitted.
 Once admitted, refugees benefit from state social programs and
 are well treated.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Luxembourg is a parliamentary democracy in which all citizens
 18 years of age and older can participate in national
 elections held every 5 years. In the elections of 1984, voter
 participation was 89 percent. The 64-member Chamber of
 Deputies is composed of members of five political parties,
 elected on the basis of proportional representation.
 Luxembourg's sizable foreign resident population (26 percent)

 does not have the right to vote. Its members may join
 organizations such as labor unions which exert considerable
 indirect influence on the political process. Significant
 numbers of women hold political office, including the Mayor of
 Luxembourg City.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Luxembourg governments have consistently supported
 international and non-governmental investigation of alleged
 violations of human rights. The Red Cross, Amnesty
 International, and the U.N. High Commission for Refugees have
 representatives in Luxembourg. Luxembourg is a strong
 advocate for the respect of human rights and consistently
 supports human rights in the Council of Europe, the EC, and
 the U.N. Freedom House rates Luxembourg *free.*
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Luxembourg haS adequate medical care, 99 percent literacy, an
 excellent school system with high enrollment ratios, and
 little poverty. Women participate freely in political and
 economic life. Although significant numbers of women hold
 political office, women by tradition are less active in
 business affairs.
 A notable feature of the economy is the importance of one
 industry, steel, which accounts for a high percentage of
 Luxembourg's exports. However, the steel industry is
 undergoing basic restructuring and is declining gradually in
 terms of overall economic importance. Vigorous efforts are
 underway to diversify the economy, partly through promotion of
 Luxembourg as a financial center and by establishing foreign
 industries in the country.
 Approximately 26 percent of Luxembourg's population of 366,000
 are foreigners, and although immigration is now low, the
 foreign population is growing gradually while the native
 Luxembourg population is declining. The net population growth
 rate is 0.1 percent. Despite economic recession and increased
 unemployment in a society accustomed to virtually full
 employment, Luxembourg continues efforts to treat its large
 foreign population fairly. Moreover, in spite of the current
 economic challenges, Luxembourg remains notably free from
 social and political instability.
