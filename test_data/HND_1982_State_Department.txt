 HONDURAS
 In January 1982 Roberto Suazo Cordova was inaugurated as the
 first constitutional president in Honduras in nearly ten years.
 The inauguration was the culmination of a transitional political
 process initiated in April 1980 with the election of a
 constituent assembly. General elections were held in November
 1981, from which Dr. Suazo and the Liberal Party emerged with
 clear majorities for the presidency and the national congress.
 The elections were praised for their honesty by a wide range of
 observers. The Suazo regime has continued Honduras' improving
 record of respect for the rights of freedom of religion, speech,
 assembly, movement, and travel. The Honduran military remains a
 power and retains considerable influence in the background.
 The return of democratic rule coincided with a period of serious
 political conflict in the Central American region, some of which
 has spilled over into Honduras in the form of externally-
 controlled terrorism. In 1982 Salvadoran guerrillas
 collaborating with Honduran leftist terrorists carried out
 several terrorist acts in major Honduran cities far from the
 Salvadoran border, including a domestic airline hijacking,
 bombing several US and Salvadoran business offices in Tegucigalpa
 in August, and taking 100 business and government leaders hostage
 in the San Pedro Sula Chamber of Commerce building in September.
 Other terrorist activity has included a series of bank robberies
 early in 1982, kidnappings of several prominent personalities,
 including the 16-year-old granddaughter of one of Honduras'
 leading publishers, and the assassination of that same
 publisher's son on the eve of Dr. Suazo's inauguration. During
 the year, Honduran police uncovered a number of safe-houses
 directly associated with Salvador's Farabundo Marti National
 Liberation Movement (FMLN) and containing important stocks of
 weapons, clandestine radio transmission equipment, and so-called
 people's prison cells.
 The year 1982 was one of transition for the extreme left, moving
 from an earlier strategy of an *Oasis of Peace' for Honduras to
 one of preparing the ground for local revolutionary violence in
 collaboration with Salvadoran and Nicaraguan Marxist
 revolutionaries. In addition to terrorist activity, elements of
 the extreme left have unsuccessfully sought to provoke civil
 strife and conflict between the government and key social groups
 such as school teachers.
 The Suazo government has dealt firmly with terrorist situations;
 nonetheless it has handled specific incidents with patience and
 restraint. Hostage incidents have been resolved without harm to
 the victims and the vast majority of terrorist suspects have
 been dealt with through the judicial process. There also have
 been incidents in which the poorly-trained public forces have
 abused their authority and there are credible allegations of
 extra-judicial action against terrorists. But there is no
 evidence of systematic violation of judicial procedures, and the
 Honduran Government has taken action to discipline police who
 violated legal procedures.
 Since January, 1982 the Suazo Administration has been grappling
 with Honduras' serious and endemic economic and social problems
 -- illiteracy, poverty, malnutrition, and inadequate health
 care. Some progress has been made on these problems.
 In addition to the growth of externally sponsored and coordinated
 terrorism within the country, Hondurans have expressed increasing
 concern about the military build-up in Nicaragua. Nicaraguan
 armed forces are twice the size of Honduras', not counting the
 growing Nicaraguan militia. The presence of over 2,000 Cuban,
 Soviet, Eastern European, and Palestinian Liberation Organization
 
 
 555
 military advisors in Nicaragua is another source of cgncern for
 Hondurans. Most Hondurans are particularly concerned about this
 military build-up on their border because they believe that the
 Sandiniata regime in Nicaragua has an active interest in
 weakening democratic Honduras and hurting its image through a
 combination of subversion, military intimidation, and malicious
 propaganda.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 During 1982 there were some ten incidents in which bodies of
 murdered persons were found in remote areas, but for which
 government investigations failed to establish responsibility.
 Political and labor organizations and Government officials have
 variously attributed the murders to vendettas among left wing
 groups, criminal action, or the police, but no evidence has been
 forthcoming to substantiate any of these allegations. There is
 evidence that Government authorities act to punish security and
 military personnel guilty of abuse of authority. For example, in
 a case in which an American citizen working with refugees was
 abused by military authorities while her colleague, a Guatemalan
 physician, was killed, five soldiers were arrested and are facing
 trial in a military court. Allegations that death squads have
 made their appearance in Honduras have not been substantiated.
 b. Disappearance
 One local human rights organization alleges that twenty-two
 Hondurans have mysteriously disappeared In Honduras in 1982. The
 organization attributes the majority of the disappearances to the
 police or the police investigative branch. Amnesty
 International's 1982 report, covering 1981, noted "increasing
 reports' of disappearances. The'Government has consistently
 denied any involvement by security services in these cases.
 However, there have been occasions in which persons, whom the
 Government denied detaining, have been later released.
 c. Torture
 There have been reports in the press and by local sources of the
 use of torture by local police forces during interrogation.
 Honduran officials assert that it is a common practice for
 persons held in connection with politically-motivated crimes to
 allege that they were tortured during the investigation and
 interrogation process. Such cases are difficult to substantiate,
 especially since some victims claim they were released on
 condition that they talk to no one about the alleged torture.
 The Honduran Government has shown sensitivity to these charges,
 as indicated by removal of some police officials accused of abuse
 of detained persons. A new Investigative Branch Chief in San
 Pedro Sula publicly pledged in October 1982 not to use inhumane
 interrogation techniques. Torture is specifically prohibited by
 the Honduran Constitution and by criminal legislation. While
 there may be individual instances of prisoner abuse, it is not
 sanctioned by the Government. The Honduran Armed Forces Chief of
 State Gustavo Alvarez recently issued a public statement denying
 that the government used torture and specifically stated that
 torture was not to be used on prisoners.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There were allegations during 1982 of summary executions of
 habitual criminals by the police. The Government of Honduras
 denied these allegations. The Honduran Constitution specifically
 prohibits capital punishment. The Honduran press continues to
 report freely on allegations of mistreatment by local police.
 The use of unnecessary force and brutality during the arrest
 process is sometimes alleged. Evidence for all of these charges
 is largely circumstantial, although there may be individually
 verifiable cases. Members of the police are subject to dismissal
 
 
 556
 for abuses against the public. In the second half of 1982 a
 number of police sergeants and transit police were dismissed for
 abuse of authority, including ten in one week in San Pedro Sula.
 In serious cases, police have been arrested. With few
 exceptions, jail conditions are poor. Access to prisoners is
 generally not a problem for relatives, attorneys, consular
 officers, or international humanitarian organizations. On
 occasion, press visits are allowed.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Legal guarantees exist against arbitrary arrest or imprisonment,
 and against torture or degrading treatment. Habeas corpus is
 guaranteed by the Constitution and Honduran law provides for
 arraignment within 24 hours of arrest. This appears to be the
 standard practice, although hearings are often delayed due to
 administrative backlogs. However, there have been some verified
 recent accounts of Honduran citizens being detained by local
 police forces for periods of a few hours to a week without
 warrants. When there is reasonable indication of an offense,
 Honduran legal procedures permit the judge to hold a person for
 up to six days for questioning before determining if formal
 charges are warranted. If the judge determines there is
 sufficient evidence, charges are specified in a court order. The
 individual may then be held pending further investigation.* Bail
 is allowed in many cases.
 Some civilian and military officials have expressed
 dissatisfaction with the leniency of release procedures
 established by the code of criminal procedure for dealing with
 both terrorist and common criminal cases. Because of these
 frustrations the police have sometimes held suspected criminals,
 particularly terrorists, for extended periods without presenting
 them to the court. In May, the National Congress passed a law to
 provide the law enforcement authorities with the authority to
 arrest persons accused of terrorist acts such as hijacking. The
 penal code, which dates from 1906, had not adequately dealt with
 these modern crimes. Some civilian and military officials have
 expressed dissatisfaction with the leniency of release procedures
 established by the code of criminal procedure for dealing with
 both terrorist and common criminal cases. Because of these
 frustrations the police do sometimes hold suspected criminals,
 particularly terrorists, for extended periods without presenting
 them to the court. Conversely, there have also been recent cases
 in which persons, whom there is substantial reason to suspect of
 terrorist activity, have been released for lack of admissible
 evidence. By international standards, judicial procedures for
 dealing with crime of all sorts, including terrorism, are
 cumbersome and maximum penalties for certain offenses are lenient.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Access to legal services usually varies with the socio-economic
 standing of the litigant. Inordinate delays are frequently
 encountered in the administration of justice, and the system is
 overburdened. With all of its problems, the judiciary does act,
 and it maintains substantial independence from the executive and
 legislative branches of government.
 
 
 557
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Sanctity of the home is guaranteed by the Constitution and
 generally observed. There reportedly have been incidents in
 which security forces searching for terrorists have searched
 homes without the proper judicial authorization. Policemen have
 been dismissed during 1982 for abusive behavior during house
 searches.
 2.   Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and the press are respected. The press plays a
 strong role in the defense of constitutional liberties. There is
 no censorship of the media, although books and other materials
 are sometimes confiscated from travellers returning from
 communist countries. These confiscations have often been
 vigorously denounced in the press. No incident of official
 interference with the media has been recorded for several years.
 The Honduran press conducts a lively national debate free of
 government control. The media criticize both government programs
 and civilian and military leaders frequently and freely.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Restrictions imposed since 1972 on freedom of peaceful assembly
 and association for. political parties were lifted in early 1980,
 and party activities have since continued without interference.
 A number of small radical groups, including the Honduran
 Communist Party, exist and are tolerated. The revised electoral
 law passed in 1981 was an effort to encourage all political
 groups to participate in the electoral process. It has made
 access to the ballot easier. Student, worker, peasant, and other
 interest groups have full freedom to organize and hold frequent
 public demonstrations without interference. The Honduran
 populace is among the most organized in Central America and has
 strong labor, cooperative, and sectoral movements.
 Honduras has a long tradition of effective and democratic trade
 union activities. The labor movement is highly developed and
 well organized, and has a history of delivering broad services to
 its constituency. Trade unions are not hindered by the
 GovePnment, which is charged, both by the Constitution and by
 legislation, with promoting free trade union development. Trade
 unions and their federations provide members with training
 opportunities, advisory services, and health and housing
 benefits. The usual reasons for strikes are economic, not
 political. Although unions are guaranteed the right to organize
 and bargain, the Honduran labor code includes a cumbersome
 procedure of negotiation and arbitration which must be followed
 before a union may strike legally. As a result, some strikes
 have been declared illegal because unions have not followed these
 procedures. Subsequent agreements generally render these
 declarations of illegality moot.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion although Catholicism is the most
 widely practiced religion. Complete freedom of religion is
 respected with all groups allowed to function freely.
 
 
 558
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 These rights are respected in Honduras. Previously-existing
 restrictions on travel to and from El Salvador were lifted in the
 aftermath of a peace treaty (settling the 1969 war), signed in
 December 1980. Largely as the result of its democratic
 institutions and its political stability Honduras has become the
 destination of tens of thousands of refugees from neighboring
 countries who are fleeing the effects of guerrilla insurgencies
 in Guatemala and El Salvador and Government oppression in
 Nicaragua. Starting in 1980, Salvadorans began seeking refuge in
 Honduras from the conflict in Salvador. In late 1982, 16,000
 Salvadoran refugees were receiving UN High Commissioner for
 Refugees assistance in Honduras. There are two main Salvadoran
 refugee camps. Refugees who were located in the La Virtud area
 along the Salvadoran border have been relocated to Mesa Grande
 which has a population of more than 9,000. Colomancagua located
 near the Salvadoran border has more than 7,000 refugees. UNHCR
 is planning to relocate those refugees in Colomancagua further
 inland to comply with UNHCR's worldwide requirement that refugees
 who receive assistance must be housed at a substantial distance
 from a disputed border. In the Mosquitia region of Honduras
 there are more than 12,000 Nicaraguan Miskito Indians who have
 fled Sandinista repression. More than 9,000 are in Mocoron
 awaiting relocation to sites along the coast and along the Rio
 Patuca. As many as 5,000 Nicaraguan non-Indian refugees have
 also fled Nicaragua in the past year. Some 3,000 of these are
 located in the Danli, El Paraiso area of Honduras. There is also
 a small contingent of about 600 Guatemalan refugees on the
 Honduran/Guatemalan border.
 Honduras continues to welcome refugees from neighboring countries
 despite the economic and administrative burdens involved for one
 of the poorest countries in the hemisphere.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The inauguration of President Suazo and the National Congress in
 January 1982 was an important event in the return to democratic,
 constitutional rule.. The Government had been operating under
 military rule since December 1972. The process began with
 constituent assembly elections in April 1980. In the November
 29, 1981 elections about 1,200,000 voters, a turnout of slightly
 over 80 percent of registered voters, freely elected a president,
 congress, and local officials under the terms of a revised
 constitution. Throughout 1982 the democratic process continued,
 as the opposition Nationalist Party prepared for nationwide
 internal party elections in late November and the liberals began
 campaigning for their party elections in 1983. Political
 parties, labor unions, trade organizations and other interest
 groups are free to organize and articulate their positions, and
 do so. Political parties and interest groups continue to have
 access to the media. The military play an important de facto
 part in the political process.
 While no parties are formally banned, only those which are
 legally recognized may appear on the ballot. Recognition is
 granted upon completion of a process provided for in the
 electoral law. Extreme left political groups, including the
 Communist Party, participated in the 1981 election as part of a
 coalition.
 
 
 559
 A sizable indigenous Moskito and black population enjoy full
 political freedoms. Although there are now several women members
 of the National Congress, as well as one cabinet minister, women
 in general do not play a major role in the political process.
 3.   Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 Honduras was one of the first countries to ratify the
 Inter-American Human Rights Convention. The Honduran Government
 cooperated fully with a 1976 Amnesty International investigative
 mission, as well as with one which visited in 1979 to look into
 the camps set up for refugees from Nicaragua's civil war. During
 1981, two groups representing Amnesty International visited
 Honduras to look into reports of arbitrary arrest and detention,
 torture, and disappearances of Honduran and foreign nationals.
 In 1982 Honduras received many church and other groups who came
 to Honduras to review its human rights record. These groups were
 received by government leaders and no restriction was placed on
 their access to private individuals of any area of the country.
 In its 1982 report, Freedom House characterized Honduras as
 'free.'
 4.   Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Honduran per capita gross national product is approximately
 $561. During the period 1976-79, the country enjoyed a growth of
 real gross domestic product averaging 7.5 percent per annum.
 Agricultural export gains resulting from high international
 commodity prices and expanded production were the most dynamic
 factors spurring the increase. However, during 1980, real growth
 dropped sharply to 2.5 percent, and this downward trend continued
 during 1981 and 1982. In 1981 real growth was .3 percent; 1982
 probably saw negative real growth; only slight recovery is
 forecast for 1983. Disappointing export performance, related in
 part to falling coffee prices, soaring petroleum costs, and a
 severe shortage of credit, together with a large domestically
 financed budget deficit, explain the decline.
 Agriculture is the mainstay of the Honduran economy.
 Historically, bananas dominated, but in recent years there has
 been considerable diversification of export crops. Since the
 late Seventies, coffee has vied with bananas as the principal
 foreign exchange earner. Coffee production is distributed among
 over 45,000 families, most of whom are small landowners. Meat,
 lumber, sugar, minerals, cotton and tobacco are other important
 -exports.
 About 62 percent of the population lives in rural areas. Most
 are small farmers producing at little more than subsistence
 level. Agrarian reform laws passed in 1962 and 1975 were
 originally implemented with relative success. Although more than
 30,000 families were resettled on agrarian reform land during the
 mid-Seventies, implementation of the program slowed in the late
 Seventies. The Suazo Administration is renewing the agrarian
 reform effort with emphasis on giving title to small land holders.
 Agrarian and labor unrest, with attendant land or building
 occupations, have historically been a frequent source of tension
 in Honduras. Pressure tactics, including protests, marches and
 land invasions have been used by peasant groups to force more
 rapid implementation of agrarian reform laws, and by urban
 squatters to press a claim to empty lots. Honduran civilian and
 
 
 560
 military officials seek, generally successfully, to handle
 agrarian, urban and labor incidents without violence and in most
 cases resolve land invasion cases through existing legal
 remedies, which may involve awarding the same or equivalent land
 to the occupiers. The anti-terrorism law passed in May 1982
 provided for imprisonment of land invaders who destroy property.
 Immediately after passage, there were incidents in which peaceful
 invaders were arrested under this law, but all have subsequently
 been released and there have been no recent incidents of this
 type of arrest.
 Despite the economic progress achieved in recent years, Honduras
 has many problems to overcome, including a 43 percent illiteracy
 rate, malnutrition (calories supply only 89 percent of
 nutritional requirements), inadequate health care, and a
 population growth rate approaching 3.5 percent. Life expectancy
 at birth was 58.3 years in 1980; the infant mortality rate was
 118 per 1000 live births in 1981. Total population was 3,779,000
 in 1981.
 Honduran Governments have been relatively ambitious in addressing
 the country's social and economic concerns. Government
 expenditures for economic and social development in agriculture,
 education and health have increased substantially in recent years
 and in 1979-82 represented about 40 percent of the total budget.
 In contrast, defense (including police and security forces)
 accounted for only 7 percent of the budget. Under the present
 five year plan (1979-83), investments are being made in basic
 infrastructure, including transportation, communications and
 energy, as well as health, education health care delivery and
 agrarian reform. The Ministry of Health continues a program
 begun in 1975 to extend basic health services to the rural area.
 Primary education is provided to an estimated 54 percent primary
 school-age children, although a high percentage of these never
 finish primary or begin secondary school. Only about 56 percent
 of the population can read and write. About 41 percent have
 access to safe water.
 Honduras is addressing its economic and social needs on a
 non-discriminatory basis. The major thrust of government
 programs in recent years is to improve the economic situation of
 the subsistence level campesinos and urban workers, who are the
 majority of the population. This initiative enjoys the
 wide-spread support of the population. There is no legally
 sanctioned racial or sexual discrimination. The Labor Code
 provides specific protection for women and minors, particularly
 pregnant and nursing women. By tradition and custom, most women
 participate in activities involving the home. Women aged 15 to
 60 constitute 18.4 percent of the labor force. Based on 1974
 census data, outside of the agricultural sector, women most often
 are employed as domestic servants, clerical workers, itinerant or
 market vendors, and in food processing or other manufacturing.
 In public service there are now several women members of the
 National Congress, a woman cabinet member, and a woman attorney
 general. Women also serve in the uniformed police force.
