 GREECE
 Greece is a constitutional republic and parliamentary democracy. In free and fair
 national parliamentary elections in October, the Panhellenic Socialist Movement
 (PASOK) won a comfortable majority, and its leader, Andreas Papandreou, became
 Prime Minister. The defeated New Democracy Party of former Prime Minister Con-
 stantine Mitsotakis assumed the role of the opposition. President Constantine
 Karamanlis, the largely ceremonial Head of State, was chosen by Parliament in
 April 1990.
 The police and security services are subject to a broad variety of legal and con-
 stitutional restraints. The Greek Parliament, a vigorous free press, the judiciary,
 committees and deputies of the European Parliament, and Greek and international
 human rights organizations monitor their activities. These institutions and groups
 brought to light cases of improper activities and pressed the Government to put a
 stop to such activities.
 The National Intelligence Service in an internal report (which was leaked to the
 press in August) pointed to non-Greek Orthodox persons and organizations as poten-
 tially dangerous to Greece and monitored their activities and maintained dossiers
 on them. The Mitsotakis Government stated that the report had been immediately
 withdrawn and that it did not represent its position (see Section 2.c.).
 The Greek economy has a very large state sector with a strong tradition of patron-
 age. To promote further economic development, Greece relies heavily on the Euro-
 pean Community (EC) for subsidies and loans. Political polarization and opposition
 from labor unions and other groups hamper government efforts to reduce the budget
 deficit and strengthen the private sector.
 The Constitution protects, and the authorities generally respect, fundamental
 human rights. There continued to be reports, investigated and mostly denied by the
 Government, of Greek border guards and military personnel abusing Albanian ille-
 gal aliens, resulting in the deaths of at least four Albanians. A bilateral dispute
 with Albania in June and July led to mass roundups of Albanians working in
 Greece-most but not all of them illegally-and their summary expulsion to Alba-
 nia.
 Other human rights problems in 1993 included prosecution of persons who dis-
 sented on sensitive foreign policy and minority issues or who "insulted authority,"
 restrictions on religious practice discrimination against Gypsies, and continued use
 of Article 19 of the Citizenship Code to revoke the citizens hip of Greek citizens who
 are not ethnic Greeks, despite assurance by senior government officials in 1991 that
 Article 19 would be repealed.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Neither government forces nor legal
 opposition groups engaged in political killing. In contrast to previous years, no le-
 thal terrorist attacks occurred in 1993. However, during 1993 there were allegations
 that Greek border guards and military personnel killed several Albanians who had
 
 
 illegally entered Greece. The Army is conducting an investigation to determine
 whether to court-martial a soldier who fatally shot an Albanian immigrant on Feb-
 ruary 27. In another case three Albanians reportedly fell over a cliff to their deaths
 when a Greek border patrol fired at them during a night chase through rugged ter-
 rain.
 As a result of the investigation into the case of accused drug dealer Suleyman
 Akyar, who was reportedly beaten to death in January 1991 while in official cus-
 to y, the prosecutor proposed that three police officers be charged with using exces-
 sive force leading to death, a felony. The three police officers were subsequently ex-
 onerated, however, and the official cause of death was ruled to be pneumonia.
 A German citizen, Ramon Joachim Schulz, died in a prison in Crete in August
 under questionable circumstances. The official cause of death was listed as a heart
 attack, but there was strong evidence that he had suffered a severe beating while
 in detention. The Ministry of Justice opened a further investigation into the case
 at the request of the German Government.
 b. Disappearance.-Amnesty International (A) reported the disappearance of two
 ethnic Greeks with Albanian citizenship who were detained by police in Zagora on
 March 4 and never seen again.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution specifically forbids torture, and a 1984 law makes the use of tor-
 ture an offense punishable by a sentence of from 3 years to life imprisonment. This
 law has never been invoked. Although reports of police abuse declined in 1993, de-
 fense attorneys and other sources continued to report that the police beat detainees
 in the initial arrest and investigative phase in order to extract information and con-
 fession, and then held detainees in harsh conditions in holding cells. Allegations
 persisted that police and military personnel beat and otherwise abused illegal Alba-
 nian aliens in the process of deporting them, including credible reports of such beat-
 ings during the mass expulsions in July (see Section 2.d.).
 Al issued a report in 1992 describing incidents occurring in 1990 and 1991 in
 which police and prison guards allegedly tortured or ill-treated individuals or groups
 of people in their custody. An appendix, summarizing cases raised with the Greek
 authorities since 1986, included 54 alleged victims in 1991. According to the report,
 methods of ill-treatment included punching, kicking, and beating with sticks, clubs,
 or truncheons. Beating on the soles of the feet was also reported. The Government
 conducted its own internal reviews and reported in 1993 that police and guards in
 most instances had been exonerated.
 Although concluding that most Al allegations were groundless, the Minister of
 Public Order, in public statements in 1992 about terrorism, acknowledged short-
 c ming in police discipline and promised corrective action. In further conversations
 about the Al report in September 1993, senior police officials stressed that they had
 instituted training programs to ensure that proper procedures are followed and that
 the human rights of detainees are respected. They said that the Ministry had or-
 dered police commanders to carry out serious investigations of reports of abuse, to
 inspect regularly conditions in poice holding cells, and to punish officers who break
 the law.
 In March a five-member delegation of the Council of Europe's (COE) Committee
 for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment,
 assisted by four professional consultants and COE staff, visited over 20 prisons, po-
 lice stations, and hospitals. The Committee's confidential report to the Government
 was in preparation at year's end.
 The Ministry of Justice acknowledged that conditions in many prisons are deplor-
 able. Most prisons are severely overcrowded, particularly the Korydallos prison near
 Athens, and medical care is inadequate. There were relatively few reports of phys-
 ical abuse in Greek prisons. According to one credible report, two Albanian prisoners
 who attempted to escape from a prison on the island of Kos were beaten severely
 after their recapture. An official of the Ministry of Justice said the case was under
 investigation.
 Prison conditions for conscientious objectors, in both civilian and military prisons,
 have given rise to special concern in recent years. The then minister of national de-
 fense acknowledged in a press interview in July that living conditions in the Avlona
 military prison, where most conscientious objectors formerly were held, were "objec-
 tionable and inadmissible." Investigations and visits by deputies of the European
 Parliament and other groups resulted in much adverse publicity. To begin correcting
 the situation the Government transferred about 200 prisoners to the military prison
 at Sindos, w~i~ch houses only conscientious objectors and where conditions are far
 better.
 However, Sindos prison has a maximum capacity of only 300 prisoners, whereas
 the number of imprisoned conscientious objectors normally ranges between 350 and
 
 
 400. As of October, about 35 conscientious objectors were still being held at Avlona,
 and over 90 were in Kassandra agricultural prison, which consists of a central unit
 and several outlying stations.
 A Belgian human rights group which visited parts of the Kassandra prison re-
 ported in 1992 that in one station the dormitory was a stable; it was cold and vir-
 tually unheated in winter with holes throughout the building. The group also re-
 ported abominable sanitary conditions, oor food, and limited and belated medical
 care of poor quality. The Ministry of Justice acknowledged that conditions at
 Kassandra prison remain unsatisfactory but claimed that many conscientious objec-
 tors sought a transfer to Kasandra despite its bad conditions in order to be able
 to work and thereby reduce the length of their sentences. The Ministry said it wan
 instituting a similar system of reduced sentences in exchange for work at the Sindos
 prison, although the Jehovah's Witnesses reported in October that work was avail-
 able at Sindos for only 65 of the 200 conscientious objectors imprisoned there.
 About 75 conscientious objectors are also held at the Kassevetia Volos agricultural
 prison. The same Belgian human rights group described conditions at this prison
 as far better. The conscientious objectors at Kassevetia Volos themselves described
 food and sanitary conditions, as well as medical facilities, as satisfactory.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution requires judicial war-
 rants for all arrests except during the actual commission of a crime. The legal sys-
 tern protects against arbitrary' arrest orders. Police must bring a person arrested on
 the basis of a warrant or while committing a crime before an examining magistrate
 within 24 hours. The magistrate must issue a detention warrant or order the release
 of the detainee within 3 days, unless special circumstances require a 2-day exten-
 sion of this time limit.
 Defendants brought to court before the end of the day following the commission
 of a charged offense may be tried immediately, under a "speedy procedure.* Al-
 though legal safeguards, including representation by counsel, apply in speedy proce-
 dure cases, the short period of time may inhibit the defendants ability to present
 an adequate defense. Defendants may ask for a delay to provide time to prepare
 their defense, but the court is not obliged to grant it. The effective maximum dura-
 tion of pretrial detention is 18 months for felonies and 9 months for misdemeanors.
 A panel of judges may grant release pending trial, with or without bail. A person
 convicted of a misdemeanor and sentenced to 2 years or less may, at the court's dis-
 cretion, pay a fine in lieu of being imprisoned.
 Despite these legal safeguards, both Al and the Lawyers Committee for Human
 Rights (LCHR) reported that actual practice frequently deviates from prescribed
 norms. For example, lawyers informed Al that the plice frequently interrogated
 suspects as witnesses, because witnesses do not have the right to legal representa-
 tion during police questioning. Statements made to the police in these circumstances
 may be used against these persons in court if they are later charged and brought
 to trial. Al and the LCHR also reported that detainees are frequently not informed
 of their rights and that access to a lawyer is denied until after interrogation, which
 allegedly in some cases included torture or ill-treatment and the signing of a state-
 ment.
 Exile is unconstitutional. However, Greek citizens not of ethnic Greek origin who
 travel outside the country may be deprived of their citizenship and refused readmit-
 tance to the country under Article 19 of the Citizenship Code (see Section 2.d.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judicial system is characterized by three lev-
 els of courts, appointed judges, an examining magistrate system, trial by judicial
 panel, and the right of appeal by both prosecution and defense. The Constitution
 provides for the independence of the judiciary, but there are credible charges that
 judges sometimes allow political criteria, including the desire to obtain promotion,
 to influence their judgments.
 The Constitution provides for public trials, and trial court sessions are open to
 the public, unless the court decides that privacy is required to protect victims and
 witnesses or national security matters. The latter provision is not abused. The de-
 fendant enjoys the presumption of innocence, the standard of proof of guilt beyond
 a reasonable doubt, the right to present evidence and witnesses, the right of access
 to the prosecution's evidence, the right to cross-examine witnesses, and the right to
 counsel Lawyers are provided to defendants who are not able to afford legal coun-
 sel.
 The antiterrorism law, enacted in 1990, which also covers murder, kidnaping, and
 some other crimes, foreshortens trial procedures and provides for mandatory life
 sentences for these crimes. The new Government announced its intention to repeal
 this law. Parliament voted to repeal it on December 9.
 
 
 There are no political prisoners in Greece. As noted above, however, there are at
 any given time from 350 to 400 persons imprisoned for refusing, mainly on religious
 grounds, to perform military service as Greek law requires (see Section 2.c.).
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits invasion of privacy and searches without warrants, and the
 law permits monitoring personal communications only under strict judicial controls.
 Judicial warrants showing probable cause are required for home searches, and there
 are limits on conducting such searches at night. However, the variety of persons and
 groups subjected to government surveillance in 1993 raised questions about safe-
 guards. Targets included human rights monitors, non-Orthodox religious groups,
 and members of minority groups who meet with members of the diplomatic commu-
 nity. In one case, the security forces interrogated the family of a controversial aca-
 demic who writes independently on such topics.
 In September, however, prosecutors indicted several persons, including a retired
 general who had served as national security advisor to the president of the New De-
 mocracy Party (the president of the party was also Prime Minister of Greece for part
 of the period in question) on charges of wiretapping political opponents from 1989
 to 1991. A Greek human rights monitor charged that a newspaper article, based ap-
 parently on a leaked police report of surveillance carried out against him and a vis-
 iting international human rights delegation, contained information that could only
 have been obtained by monitoring his telephone calls.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and press is provided for in
 the Constitution and generally respected in practice, but there are significant excep-
 tions. Some legal restrictions on free speech remain in force and have been invoked
 the last 2 years in five cases (see details below) concerning the politically sensitive
 topics of relations with the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia and the question
 of ethnic minorities within Greece. On these so-called national issues, under the pre-
 vious government, the authorities gave clear evidence of their intolerance of political
 dissent; the charges the prosecutors brought in court were based on what the de-
 fendants said or wrote, not on violent acts or other criminal behavior. In the main,
 however, Greece enjoys a tradition of outspoken public discourse and a vigorous free
 press. Satirical and opposition newspapers do not hesitate to launch scathing and
 vituperative attacks on the highest state authorities.
 The new Prime Minister, in his initial policy statement in Parliament, announced
 his Government's intention, as a matter of immediate priority, to repeal the laws
 that restrict freedom of speech and press. The law that Parliament approved on De-
 cember 9 repealed the antiterrorism law and-th  provision in the Criminal Code
 that forbade "insulting authority," and it definitively ended prosecutions of "offenses
 committed by or through the press." As a result of these changes, a number of trials
 concerning restrictions on freedom of speech initiated under the previous govern-
 ment were terminated.
 The Constitution allows for seizure (though not prior restraint), by order of the
 public prosecutor, of publications that insult the President, offend religious beliefs,
 contain obscene articles, advocate violent overthrow of the political system, or dis-
 close military and defense information. Seizures are rare, however, and did not
 occur in 1993.
 However, several Penal Code restrictions have been used to restrict free speech
 andpress. Article 141 of the Penal Code forbids "exposing the friendly relations of
 the Greek State with foreign states to danger of disturbance"; Article 181, repealed
 in December, forbade "insulting authority." Article 191 of the Code prohibits
 "spreading false information and rumors liable to create concern and fear among
 citizens and cause disturbances in the country's international relations and inciting
 citizens to rivalry and division, leading to disturbance of the peace." People were
 arrested for distributing leaflets or booklets denouncing government policy on Mac-
 edonia and asserting the existence and mistreatment in Greece of Macedonian and
 other minorities.
 In January 1992, a court sentenced six members of an organization to 6  months'
 imprisonment for putting up posters which read: "No to Patriots. Recognize Slav-
 Macedonia." They appealed their conviction, and the appeals court set a date to hear
 the case in December 1995. In April 1992, police in Athens arrested four students
 for distributing a leaflet entitled, "The Neighboring Peoples Are Not Our Enemies.
 No to Nationalism and War." The leaflet opposed the Government's domestic policy
 regarding Greece's ethnic minorities. A court sentenced them in May to a fine and
 19 months in jail. The charges were dropped due to the lifting, as noted above, of
 restrictions on freedom of speech and press.

 901
 In May 1992, police arrested five members of a Trotskyite group for distributing
 a book about "working class" perspectives on Balkan issues, denouncing the rise of
 Greek nationalism and asserting the existence of a Macedonian minority in Greece.
 A court acquitted them on May 7, 1993, after a week-long trial. The public prosecu-
 tor's office appealed the unanimous verdict, but the charges may be dropped due to
 the new law that ends prosecution of offenses 'committed by or through the press."
 This is the only known case of the prosecution appealing an acquittal on such
 charges.
 In December 1992, a court convicted a 17-year-old high school student on charges
 of attempting to incite citizens to divisions among themselves, disturbing the peace,
 and carrying a weapon. He distributed a leaflet that decried excessive nationalism
 on the Macedonian issue and referred to Alexander the Great as a "war criminal."
 The court sentenced him to a year in jail. An international human rights organiza-
 tion noted that he was accused of carrying an iron bar but stated that "it was not
 found, and no evidence was produced in court to corroborate the weapons charge."
 The student remains free pending appeal which is scheduled for November 1995.
 In March 1993, a court convicted two minoritiy activists from Greek Macedonia
 for saying that they "feel Macedonian" and for claiming the existence of a Macedo-
 nian minority of 1 million in Greece. This claim conflicts with official government
 policy, which denies the existence of any minorities other than the Muslim minority
 recognized in the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. The court sentenced them to 5 months
 in prison and a small fine. Both were free on appeal when the charges were dropped
 due to the changes in law discussed above.
 Police in September 1992 charged a leader of the Athens bus drivers' union with
 "insulting authority" because of remarks he made that questioned the independence
 of the Greek courts. The charges were dropped when Article 181 was repealed.
 In October 1992, three journalists with the newspaper 0 Locos were sentenced to
 jail terms of from 8 to 18 months, which could be satisfied by paying a fine, for in-
 sulting authority by suggesting that the Supreme Court improperly accepted guid-
 ance from the Government. The journalists remained free on appeal; the prosecution
 of this case was terminated when Article 181 was repealed.
 On April 2, the publisher of the left-of-center Athens daily Ethnos and one of the
 paper's journalists were convicted of insulting authority for a column written by the
 journalist and published in the newspaper which stated that not all Thracians had
 pure Greek blood. (Western Thrace is home to a substantial ethnic Turkish popu-
 lation.) They were sentenced to 7 months' imprisonment but are free pending ap-
 peal. Charges are expected to be dropped due to the repeal of Article 181.
 The antiterrorism law includes a section authorizing the Supreme Court prosecu-
 tr to prohibit publicizing specific statements by terrorist groups (specifically,
 groups acting in concert to commit certain serious felonies, including murder). In
 September 1992, six publishers and editors went on trial for violating this law in
 Athens. The court convicted one defendant and sentenced him to a fine and 6
 months in jail (which may be satisfied by paying another fine). He appealed his con-
 viction. Prosecution in all six cases ended with the December repeal of the
 antiterrorism law.
 The 1975 Constitution says the State exercises "immediate control" over radio and
 television. An independent, government-appointed body with the authority to enact
 rules governing private broadcasting established procedural regulations for radio
 several years ago. In 1993 it did so for television as well, issuing licenses to six pri-
 vate stations. The Government has not instituted any policy for dealing with the
 large number of private radio and television stations that are operating without li-
 censes.
 The only government effort to control an unlicensed station occurred just prior to
 the October elections when the government television station jammed the signal of
 a new, opposition-oriented television station. However, when the Council of State
 ruled that this was illegal, the former government ceased the jamming. State-run
 stations tend to emphasize the Government's views and positions but also report ob-
 jectively on other parties' programs and positions. In June the governing board of
 ETthe state-owned television and radio network, resigned in a move widely seen
 by 'the press as a overnment effort to take full control of state-owned broadcast
 media prior to the fall elections. The bard, which resigned, had criticized govern-
 ment officials for attempting to run ET and was considered politically independent.
 Throughout much of western Thrace, Turkish-language satellite television broad-
 casts are available to those with access to satellite ground stations. The mayors of
 two major towns in the region set up two such ground stations for their Turkish-
 speaking constituents. Fithen Turkish-language publications---l  weekly news-
 papers and 5 monthly magazinest-ar   published and circulate locally in Thrace,
 
 
 902
 while newspapers and other periodicals from Turkey are distributed only privately
 in small numbers when brought in by taxis and travelers.
 Academic freedoms are protected by democratically chosen faculty organizations,
 though such groups tend to be politicized. It is widely believed that those who en-
 gage in public dissent, even in scholarly publications, on sensitive issues like Mac-
 edonia and minorities will find it very difficult to pursue an academic career since
 all universities are state institutions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly. Police permits are routinely issued for public demonstrations,
 and there were no reports that the permit requirement was abused.
 The Constitution provides for the right of association, which is generally re-
 spected. In 1991 a "Macedonian Cultural Center" in Florina, organized by Greeks
 of Slavic descent, lost an appeal of a lower court decision denying it registration be-
 cause of the use in its title of the word "Macedonian," which the court held would
 cause "confusion." Government policy holds that Greek citizens of Slavic descent
 who identify themselves as Macedonans do not constitute a minority (see Section
 5). The decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, which has not yet heard the
 case.
 Greek authorities while recognizing a Muslim minority, do not recognize sepa-
 rately an ethnic TuAish minority (see Section 5).
 c. Freedom of Reli in.-The Constitution p rovides for freedom of religious con-
 science, but it also limits religious practice by prohibiting proselytizing. It estab-
 lishes the Greek Orthodox Church, to which perhaps 95 percent of the population
 at least nominally adhere, as the "prevailing" religion but prohibits discrimination
 against religious minorities. The Greek Orthodox Church wields significant influ-
 ence through its relationship with the Ministry of Education and Religion.
 Theoretically, Greek law prohibits proselytism by anyone, but it apparently is not
 applied to those spreading the Orthodox faith. The Mormons, who have an active
 missionary program in Greece report only occasional harassment by local police. In
 June however, police arrested four Mormons in Thessaloniki for proselytizing and
 ailed them overnight. The following day, the court found them not guilty and re-
 ieased them immediately.
 The Greek Jehovah's Witnesses organization reported that, as of late June, police
 had arrested 24 members for proseytizing. Police had detained, warned, and ha-
 rangued others but released them within a few hours. Of those formally arrested
 for proselytism/ 17 were tried and 4 were convicted and sentenced to bes.ween 10
 and 15 months imprisonment plus fines. The courts postponed the trials of the oth-
 ers charged with proselytism. All Jehovah's Witnesses were free while they appealed
 their sentences. They also had the option of paying a fine of less than $10 per day
 in lieu of serving their sentences.
 In May the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the 1986 conviction for
 proselytism of Minos Kokkinakis a Greek Jehovah's Witness, violated the European
 Convention on Human Rights. he Court overturned his conviction and 4-month
 sentence. It ordered the Government to pay him 400,000 drachmas (about $1,818)
 in damages and 2 789 500 drachmas (about $12,700) in costs and expenses. The
 Government paid the noney within the time limit specified by the Court.
 All Greek men, irrespective of religion, are subject to the military draft; the law
 does not provide for nonmilitary alternative service. (Noncombatant alternative mili-
 tary service has been available since 1977, but the Defense Ministry said in 1992
 that no one had ever requested that option.) The courts sentence conscientious ob-
 jectors, almost all Jehovah's Witnesses, to prison, usually for 4 years (the normal
 term of military service is from 15 to 23 months), for refusal to perform any kind
 of military service. As noted in Section l.c., as of October about 400 conscientious
 objectors were in Greek prisons. The European Parliament, in a human rights reso-
 lution of March 11, 1993, stated that it condemns, in particular, the practice in
 Greece which treats conscientious objectors as criminals and condemns them to long
 periods of imprisonment in military prisons."
 The previous government considered introducing nonmilitary alternative service
 in 1988 and 1991. However, it claimed it found no legal way to do so without
 amending the Constitution, which declares that "every Greek capable of bearing
 arms is obliged to contribute to the defense of the fatherland as provided by law.
 It relied on the legal counsel of an advisory legal body.
 In its March 1993 report on conscientious objectors in Greece, Al asserted that
 this legal body was not an independent authority and its impartiality was not guar-
 anteed; its opinions were not binding on the Government or the courts; and the Min-
 ister of Defense was under no procedural obligation to consult it. Al cited other legal
 counsel and referred to the constitutional provision that "freedom of religious con-
 science is inviolable.-
 
 
 Traditionally, Jehovah's Witnesses ministers were not granted the exemption
 from military service accorded under Greek law to clergy of "known religions and
 thus served prison sentences for refusing military service. Since 1990-91, the Coun-
 cil of State, the Supreme Court dealing with civil and adminstrative matters whose
 opinions are binding on the Government, has ruled that the Jehovah's Witnesses
 were a "known religion" and has ordered the release of ministers who had refused
 induction. However, the recruiting service of the armed forces regarded these rul-
 ings as applying only to individual appellants, not as binding precedents for subse-
 quent Jehovah's Witnesses' ministers who were called up. It thus continued to rely,
 in the first instance, on the opinion of the Ministry of Education and Religions,
 which in turn accepted the view of the Greek Orthodox Church that the Jehovah's
 Witnesses are not a "known religion." As a consequence for the past few years, min-
 isters of the Jehovah's Witnesses have been called up Ior military service and pros-
 ecuted for refusal; only after conviction could they appeal to the Council of State
 for exemptions as ministers of a "known religion." In practice, these ministers have
 spent periods of a few months to over a year in jail while appealing their cases to
 the Council of State.
 The situation appears to have improved in 1993. The first Jehovah's Witnesses
 minister called up was able, on an informal basis, to obtain a stay of his induction
 date until his appeal could be heard. A second such case was pending as the pre-
 vious government was leaving office in mid-October. The Ministry of Defense con-
 firmedthat the Ministry informally has sought to suspend such callups for 2 months
 to allow for appeals to the Council of State. It is not clear that this informal ar-
 rangement will provide enough time to prevent future imprisonment of ministers.
 Each house of worship in Greece requires the local Orthodox bishop's permission
 to open and operate. It is not uncommon for such permission to be delayed or even,
 at times, withheld, though some denominations are able to open and operate church-
 es in the guise of cultural centers. However, in 1993 a court sentenced three Jeho-
 vah's Witnesses to 1 month each for operating a house of worship without permis-
 sion. After losing appieals to the Supreme Court over the closure of two houses of
 worship, the Jehovah a Witnesses appealed to the European Court of Human Rights,
 seeking to overturn both the particular decisions of the Greek courts and the law
 requiring permission of the local Orthodox bishop for a non-Orthodox denomination
 or religion to open a house of worship.
 Several denominations report difficulties in getting residence permits for foreign
 members of their faiths who come to Greece to perform missionary or charity work.
 One denomination filed a suit in court to obtain the permits. Some denominations
 are also considering bringing only nationals of other EC countries to work in Greece,
 rather than Americans or other foreigners, since EC regulations would facilitate
 their ability to stay and work in the country.
 Mosques and other Muslim religious institutions operate in western Thrace,
 where most Greek citizens of the Muslim faith reside. Some Muslims  im that
 Greek law weakens the financial autonomy of the "wakfs," community funds used
 for maintaining mosques and for charitable works, by placing the wakfs under the
 administration of appointed muftis (Islamic judges and religious leaders). The Trea-
 ty of Lausanne contains language allowing minorities to control their charitable in-
 stitutions.
 In accordance with a 1990 presidential decree, the State appoints the three muftis
 in Greece, all resident in western Thrace. According to government policy, muftis
 must be appointed because, in addition to their reli ous duties, they perform judi-
 cial functions in many civil and domestic matters, for which the State pays them.
 The selection process includes formal consultations with loal Muslim leadenr. The
 Muslim minority is divided on the muni selection issue. Some Muslims accept the
 authority of the appointed muftis while others insist on their right to elect the
 muftis who will serve their communities. In February four muftis from Turkey were
 expelled for p reaching in western Thrace without the permission of the Greek Gov-
 ernment or the muftis appointed  y it.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution rotects freedom of movement within the country, for-
 travel, and emigration. ethnic Greeks intending to emigrate, and emigrants
 who return to Greece, experience no discrimination with respect to freedom of move-
 ment. However, Article 19 of the Greek Citizenship Code distinguishes between
 Grcek citizens who are ethnic Greeks and those who are not. Greek citizens who
 are not ethnic Greeks may be deprived of citizenship if it is determined that they
 left Greece with the apparent intent not to return. However, immigrants who are
 ethnic Greeks are normally recognized as Greek citizens and accorded full rights,
 dcspite years or even generations of absence from Greece. Most Article 19 cases in-
 volve primarily ethnic Turks from western Thrace.
 
 
 904
 The Interior Ministry initiates proceedings under Article 19 on the basis of re-
 ports by local authorities in Greece or by Greek embassies or consulates abroad. It
 holds a hearing at which the affected person is not present, nor is the affected per-
 son notified of the hearing. Those who lose Greek citizenship as a result of such
 hearings sometimes learn of this loss only when they seek to reenter Greece. Accord-
 ing to the Foreign Ministry, 123 persons lost Greek citizenship under Article 19 in
 1993; 3 of them have filed administrative appeals which are still pending.
 Despite the repeated assurances since 1991 of the previous government's senior
 officials that Article 19 would be abolished, the previous government did not intro-
 duce the requisite legislation in Parliament. The new Government has not yet stat-
 ed its intentions.
 Persons who lose their Greek citizenship under Article 19 have the right of "ad-
 ministrative appeal" to the Interior Ministry and may also appeal to the Greek
 Council of State and to the Council of Europe. Leaders of the Turkish-origin Greek
 community complain that the time and expense involved tend to discourage such ap-
 peals.
 Greece maintains a restricted military zone along its northern border with Bul-
 garia, in areas where many Pomaks (Muslims who speak a Bulgarian dialect) re-
 side. Since entry into the zone is strictly controlled, even for local inhabitants, some
 residents of the area complain that their freedom of movement is restricted. Foreign
 diplomats are allowed into the zone only under escort and with special authoriza-
 tion.
 Greece frequently offers temporary asylum, though rarely permanent resettle-
 ment, to a growing number of refugees from Eastern Europe, Africa, and the Middle
 East. Greece is increasingly a transit country for economic migrants. Increasing
 numbers of Pakistanis and Iraqi Chaldeans and Kurds are attempting to enter
 Greece illegally. Through June, Greece had received requests from 595 persons for
 asylum status. It granted such status to 53 persons and denied it to 909 persons
 (a number of whom had applied prior to 1993).
 Although a party to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees,
 Greece reserved on the provision that would allow refugees to work. Refugees may
 not enter the Greek labor market but may be self-employed. A recently enacted-
 Greek law, which lacks as yet the necessary implementing decree, would provide
 some professional rehabilitation and accommodations for refugees. Several 'United
 Nations and Greek organizations assist refugees with shelter, food, medical care,
 education, and legal counseling, but the funding and level of assistance of these
 agencies is very limited.
 Ethnic Greek immigrants, such as those who have come from the former Soviet
 Union since 1986 and those rescued from the civil war in Georgia, normally qualify
 for immediate citizenship and special assistance from the Government. The 1,000
 ethnic Greeks from Georgia were resettled in western Thrace, raising concerns
 among the ethnic Turkish minority that they would lose jobs to the newcomers. Per-
 manent resettlement in Greece is not usually available for nonethnic Greek refu-
 gees.
 Chains, ethnic Albanians who were deported from northern Greece in the late
 1940's, have requested reinstatement of their Greek citizenship and property con-
 fiscated at that time. The Government expressed a willingness to discuss compensa-
 tion for property but does not recognize their alleged historic claim to citizenship.
 Following the Albanian Government's expulsion of a senior cleric of the Greek Or-
 thodox Church, accused of meddling in Albanian internal affairs, a charge denied
 by both the Greek Government and the cleric, Greece responded with mass round-
 ups and summary expulsions of Albanians working in Greece, most of them illegaly.
 Credible reports suggest at least 10,000 were expelled. (Other reports say as many
 as 25,000.) Greek security forces reportedly beat some Albanians and gave them no
 chance to take their possessions with them. There were also unconfirmed allegations
 that some had money taken from them during the process of expulsion.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Greece is a multiparty democracy in which the Constitution guarantees full politi-
 cal rights for all citizens. (See Section 5 for allegations of limitations on the ability
 of some Gypsies to vote.) Members of the unicameral 300-seat Parliament are elect-
 ed to maximum 4-year terms by secret ballot.
 The government headed by Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis, leader of the
 New Democratic Party, lost its majority in Parliament in September and called new
 elections in October. The opposition Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) won
 the free and fair elections and formed a new Government headed by Prime Minister
 Andreas Papandreou. The transition was prompt, smooth, and orderly. Parliament
 
 
 905
 elects the President for a 5-year term. Universal suffrage for those over age 18 is
 compulsory and enforced by lres and administrative penalties. Opposition parties
 function freely and have broad access to the media.
 Under a 1990 electoral law, no candidate may be elected whose party does not
 receive 3 percent or more of the nationwide vote. This law also applies to independ-
 ent candidates. As a result, neither of Greece's former independent Muslim mem-
 bers of Parliament, both of whom proclaim their Turkish ethnic identity, was re-
 elected to Parliament in 1993. A third Muslim running as a member of PASOK re-
 signed from the party when it demanded he stop identifying himself as an ethnic
 Turk. In the province of Rodopi, the Muslim independent candidate received more
 votes than any other parliamentary candidate and yet could not be seated because
 he did not receive 3 percent of the total national vote. Although there was no lack
 of Muslim candidates in the ranks of the major parties in 1993 (10 altogether), no
 Muslim was elected. In the October national elections in Greece, a "Macedonian"
 independent parliamentary candidate from Florina received 369 votes out of a total
 of 44,855 votes cast in the district.
 There are no legal restrictions on the participation of women in government or
 politics. Women's representation at the higher levels of Greek political life is in-
 creasing but remains low. The head of the Communist party is a woman. Women
 hold 3 of the 45 ministerial and deputy ministerial seats in the Government that
 took office in October. Women are represented, though not yet widely, in the leader-
 ship of the two largest parties (New Democracy and PASOK).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Domestic human rights organizations are allowed to operate, although the Gov-
 ernment monitors their activities and may or may not cooperate with them. The
 Government did not obstruct human rights organizations' visits and investigations,
 although a delegation from Helsinki Watch did not come to a scheduled meeting in
 June with a deputy foreign minister once it became clear that a Greek associate of
 the delegation would be excluded from it. The Greek security services monitored the
 activities of the Helsinki Watch delegation and its Greek associates. Another inter-
 national human rights group said that the Government was not forthcoming with
 information about cases of alleged police abuse of detainees the group raised.
 The Government, in principle, respects the right of foreign diplomats to meet with
 Greek officials and other citizens, including critics of official policy and such con-
 tacts normally take place without adverse reaction. Occasionally, however, senior
 government officials make known their unhappiness over such meetings, particu-
 larly with activist members of minority groups or communities. It is also clear that
 the security services closely monitor such contacts.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-There are broad constitutional and legal protections for women, includ-
 ing equal pay for equal work. The General Secretariat for Equality of the Sexes, an
 independent government agency, charged that the law was not consistently en-
 forced. Official statistics show that the average wages of women in manufacturing
 establishments are 47 percent lower than those of men in comparable positions, and
 wages of women in wholesale trade are 24 percent lower that those of men in com-
 parable positions. Women are gradually entering traditionally male-dominated occu-
 pations, including the higher echelons of business. The General Secretariat for
 Equality of the Sexes coordinates efforts to remove barriers. Women's groups say
 that women in public service face a "glass ceiling" when considered for promotion.
 The Government elected in October listed progress on women's issues as a high pri-
 ority. Muslim women in western Thrace have the option of Islamic or civil marriage
 and Islamic or civil jurisdiction in domestic disputes.
 There is a strong cultural bias against reporting cases of rape, incest, or wife beat-
 ing, and police and local authorities generally do not intervene in domestic conflicts.
 Women's groups have identified violence against women as a significant problem.
 As a result ofpressur from these groups, a Center for Battered Women, run by
 the General Secretariat for Equality of the Sexes, started operating in Athens at the
 beginning of 1993. It is apparently the only such center in the country. It received
 250 women in 1993.
 The highly cohesive Greek society and family structure tolerate a high degree of
 verbal confrontation but do not tolerate violence. The level of physical violence,
 whether resulting from domestic conflict or common crime, is remarkably low. How-
 ever, verbal abuse of women in Greece is common. The General Secretariat for
 Equality of the Sexes claims that the courts are lenient when dealing with wife-
 
 
 906
 beating cases, but the Secretariat expects that to change due to the increasing num-
 ber of women who are entering the judiciary.
 Children.-Greece has legislation protecting children from all forms of maltreat-
 ment perpetrated by parents or others responsible for their care. However, there is
 a strong cultural bias against reporting cases of domestic violence. The State under-
 takes preventive and treatment programs for abused children and for children de-
 prived of their family environment, ensuring that alternative family care or institu-
 tional placement is made available to them. However, children's rights advocacy
 groups claim that protection of high-risk children in state residential care centers
 is inadequate and of low quality.
 Immunization and vaccination of children against tetanus, measles, whooping
 cough, and other children's diseases is mandatory, free of charge, and provided for
 by specific legislation. Polio and neonatal tetanus have been eradicated. The mortal-
 ity rate for children under 5 years of age, which was 64 per thousand in 1960,
 dropped to 11 per thousand in 1990. However, access of Gypsy children and illegal
 migrants to free state services, such as education and medical care, is very low, pri-
 marily due to their itinerant lifestyle.
 National /Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-There are communities in Greece which
 identify themselves as Turks, Pomaks, Vlachs, G psies, and Macedonians. Many are
 fully integrated into Greek society. Of these, ethnic Turks form the largest group.
 The only minority Greece formally recognizes is a "Muslim minority," which is re-
 ferred to in the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. The Government insists on the use of this
 rubric to refer to several different ethnic communities, most of which adhere to the
 Muslim faith. The Muslim minority is comprised primarily of ethnic Turks or Turk-
 ish speakers in western Thrace, which the Government estimates at roughly
 120,000 persons. In addition to people of Turkish origin, it includes Pomaks (Mus-
 lims who speak a language akin to Bulgarian) and Gypsies. Many Greek Muslims,
 including Pomaks, identify themselves as Turks and say that the Muslim minority
 as a whole has a Turkish cultural consciousness. The use of the word "tourkos"
 (^Turk') is prohibited in titles of organizations, though individuals may legally call
 themselves "tourkos." To most Greeks, the word "tourkos' connotes Turkish citizen-
 ship and loyalties, and many object to its use by Greek citizens of Turkish origin.
 Use of a similar adjective, "tourkoyennis" (of Turkish descent/affiliation/ethnicity),
 however, is allowed (see also Section 2.b.).
 Northern Greece is home to an indeterminate number (estimates range from
 under 10,000 to 50,000 or more) of Greek citizens who are descended from Slavs.
 Some still speak a Slavic dialect that some call Macedonian, particularly in the
 Florina district, where there is a substantial slavophone population. A small number
 of them consider themselves to be members of a distinct ethnic group which they
 identit as Macedonian, and assert their right to minority status. One activist who
 identified himself as Macedonian was subject to a punitive job transfer in his civil
 service career as a result of his activism. Organizations of self-identified Slavic Mac-
 edonians are not allowed to use the word "Macedonian" in their names. In 1991 the
 Thessaloniki appellate court upheld a ban against a cultural center in Florina on
 these grounds (see Section 2.b. . That organization appealed to the Supreme Court,
 which has not yet ruled on the case. Individual citizens are free to speak the Slavic
 dialect in public and perform Slavic dances and music openly. However some
 Greeks of Slavic descent reportedly do not proclaim themselves Macedonian for fear
 of losing their jobs in the public sector or being penalized, e.g., through a punitive
 job transfer.
 The Secretariat for Adult Education (a government agency) estimates the number
 of Gypsies in Greece is between 120,000 and 150,000. Gypsies (both Christian and
 Muslim) are scattered throughout the country. Most Greek Gypsies are at least
 nominally Greek Orthodox, with Greek names, who speak Romany at home but
 Greek in public transactions. In western Thrace, Gypsies tend to be Muslim, with
 Turkish names and some knowledge of the Turkish language. The Government esti-
 mates the Muslim Gypsy population to be 22,000. The official government policy is
 to encourage Gypsies to assimilate. For those who do not, illiteracy, poverty, crime,
 and social prejudice continue to be significant problems. Some municipalities at-
 tempt to prevent settlement by Gypsies, refusing to register them as citizens. (All
 Greek citizens are required to be registered in a municipality.) Without such reg-
 istration, Gypsies are not allowed to vote, cannot obtain papers required to start a
 business and are excluded from a range of government services.
 Some Muslims also live on Greek islands near the Turkish coast or in Athens and
 other industrial areas. Muslim villages usually elect Muslim-dominated local gov-
 ernments. In Komotini and Xanthi, both Muslims and non-Muslims hold seats on
 the town councils.
 
 
 907
 Employment of Muslims in the public sector is much lower than the Muslim share
 of the population. Some ethnic Turks claim that they are hired only in small num-
 level public sector employment and rarely, or not at all, at higher
 levels. The Government cites their lack of fluency in Greek, as well as the need for
 a university degree for high-level positions, as factors limiting the number of Mus-
 lims eligible for public employment.
 Public offices in Thrace do their business in Greek; the courts provide interpreters
 as needed. In the Komotini district in Thrace, where many members of the Muslim
 minority live, the office of the district governor (nomarch") has interpreters avail-
 able.
 The Treaty of Lausanne guarantees the Muslim minority the right to Turkish-lan-
 gu age education, with a reciprocal entitlement for the Greek minority in Istanbul.
 Western Thrace has both Koranic and secular Turkish-language schools. Govern-
 ment disputes with Turkey over teachers and textbooks caused these secular schools
 serious problems in obtaining sufficient numbers and quality of faculty and teaching
 materials. Over 9,000 Muslim children attend Turkish-language primary schools.
 Around 650 attend Turkish-language secondary schools, and approximately 1,000
 attend Greek-language secondary schools. Many Muslims reportedly go to high
 school in Turkey due to the limited number of places in the Turkish-language sec-
 onda   schools, which are assigned by lottery. Very few graduates of the Muslim
 secondary school system attend Greek universities.
 To address some of these problems, the Greek Government issued new Turkish-
 language elementary texts, prepared in Greece, on a variety of subjects in early
 1993. Texts on mathematics, science, and other subjects were also received from the
 Turkish Government. The Greek Government reviewed their content in time for the
 beginning of the school year in September. It accepted 14 science and mathematics
 texts, returned 2 texts for requested changes, and rejected 2 others. However, some
 Turkish-origin Greeks object to having their schools use teaching materials prepared
 in Greece and say the texts violate a 1968 Greek-Turkish educational protocol. In
 the wake of unlawful seizures of these texts by Turkish activists, two activists re-
 ceived sentences of 21 months in prison and one received 15 months, but all had
 their convictions reversed on appeal; six persons were sentenced to 17 months in
 jail but are free pending their appeal; and one was acquitted in his original trial.
 Some Turkish-origin  reeks complain that it is difficult to obtain permission to
 bring in teachers from Turkey or to hire Turkish-speaking teachers locally, particu-
 larly for the secular Turkish-language middle schools in Xanthi and Komotini.
 Under the 1968 educational protocol, Greece and Turkey may annually exchange up
 to 35 teachers each to serve, respectively, in Istanbul and western Thrace. In 1992
 Greece sent 16 teachers to Istanbul and admitted 16 of the 35 high school teachers
 whom Turkey nominated to teach in Thrace. The Foreign Ministry reports that the
 16 teachers from Turkey took part in February in a 1-week "Muslim" teachers'
 strike to protest the Turkish-language elementary textbooks that had been produced
 in Greece. Negotiations for a Greek-Turkish teacher exchange for the 1993-94
 school year are reportedly still under way.
 Religious Minorities.-Leaders of various non-Orthodox religious groups assert
 that their members face discrimination in reaching senior rank in government serv-
 ice, particularly in the security services. They allege that to avoid this glass ceiling
 some members of their faiths resort to declaring temselves Orthodox. Senior gov-
 ernment officials, when questioned about such allegations of discrimination, deny
 that it exists and point to certain persons not of the Orthodox faith who have had
 successful careers in government service. There appears to be no scholarly research
 on this issue.
 A number of Jehovah's Witnesses reported difficulties in employment. An account-
 ant who had earlier been imprisoned as a conscientious objector passed his account-
 ancy examination, but the appropriate regulatory board did not certify him because
 he had a conviction on his record. He took a factory job while awaiting the outcome
 of his 1989 appeal to the Council of State.
 Several fully certified Jehovah's Witnesses teachers have also faced difficulties in
 aining employment in recent years. In one well-documented case that began in
 991, a middle-ranking official of the Ministry of Education, in a memorandum to
 a local educational official on the ,issuance of a teaching permit to a member of the
 Jehovah's Witnesses or the Baha'i religion, stated that according to the Ministry's
 "legal onsultants . .. it was not permissible to endorse the appointment to Greek
 schools of educators who  o cnot believe in the Greek Orthodox religion. The local
 official in turn wrote the applicant, who wished to teach in a private school, that
 he could not have a teaching permit in accordance with the "attached document is-
 sued by the Ministry of Education and Religion."
 
 
 A public school principal was demoted to teacher, and another Jehovah's Witness
 was denied permission to open a private school. As a result of such difficulties, a
 total of six Jehovah's Witnesses have appeals pending with the Council of State.
 The European Parliament adopted a resolution on January 21 which, inter alia,
 criticized the decision of the Greek Government to require that Greek citizens de-
 clare their religion on the bilingual identity cards that allow Greeks to travel freely
 within the European Community. The resolution ascribed the decision to "pressure
 from the Orthodox clergy in particulai and referred to the "concern this decision
 has aroused among the Catholic and Jewish religious minorities." The resolution
 stated that the Parliament "disapproves of the . . . decision," termed it "a con-
 straint on individual freedom" and called on the "Greek Government to revoke this
 decision." The Government in May sought the authority to drop this requirement,
 but the Parliament refused to grant it.
 A sharp political controversy erupted in August when an opposition newspaper ob-
 tained a copy of, and printed excerpts from, an internal report of the National Intel-
 ligence Service about the dangers to Greece allegedly posed by non-Orthodox de-
 nominations. The report argued that "any Greek who is not Greek Orthodox is not
 a genuine, incorruptible, pure Greek," and that the leaders and adherents of non-
 Orthodox organizations are characterized for the most part as having a "lessened
 national conscience." The report suggested that "the State must take appropriate
 measures," specifically recommending steps to ensure that the "radio and television
 channels which are under the control of religious heretics will not be permitted to
 operate."
 The report claimed "the Vatican has not renounced . . . its firm aspirations to-
 ward a Latinization of the Greek people" and also evinced strong suspicions of
 Protestants, Pentecostals, and Jehovah s Witnesses; a companion report leaked to
 the press showed that the Intelligence Service was keeping them under surveillance
 and maintaining dossiers on their activities. The Conference of Catholic Bishops is-
 sued a strong letter of protest to the Prime Minister, denouncing the report's slurs
 on patriotic but non-Orthodox Greeks and asking that he disown the report of the
 Intelligence Service and the tactics it recommended.
 The former government replied that the report was undertaken by a low-ranking
 functionary, that it was withdrawn immediately when it came to the attention of
 higher authorities, and that it did not represent the official position of the Govern-
 ment. However the press, both secular and Catholic, published a facsimile of a let-
 ter of commendation from the then director of the National Intelligence Service to
 the author of the report, stating that it was "thorough, detailed, and well docu-
 mented."
 People with Disabilities.-Greece has specific legislation mandating hiring of dis-
 abled persons in public and private enterprises employing more than 50 persons.
 However, the law is inadequately enforced, particularly in the private sector. The
 law provides that disabled persons should comprise 3 percent of staff in private en-
 terprises. In the civil service, 5 percent of administrative staff and 80 percent of
 telephone operator psitions are reserved for disabled persons.
 Physical access for disabled persons to all kinds of private and public buildings
 is provided by the construction code, but the law is poorly enfored. In 1993 the
 Government started replacing old city buses with new ones with stairs specially de-
 signed for the disabled.
 Greece has special centers, both government-funded and privately funded, for
 handicapped and disabled children and adults, which provide education and training
 designed to help them achieve self-reliance and lead a full life in society. However,
 the number of such centers as well as the total number of disabled persons in
 Greece is not available. The Ministry of Health, Welfare, and Social Security and
 children's rights advocacy groups cite statistics showing a 93-percent increase of
 budgtary funds for welfare during the 1990-92 period, a 53-percent increase in the
 number of disabled persons who attended vocational training programs, and a 28-
 percent increase in allowances to disabled persons.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution, and subsequent legislation passed
 in 1987 and 1992, provide for the right of association. All workers, with the excep-
 tion of the military and the police, have the right to form or join unions.
 Approximately 35 percent of Greek workers (nearly 1.5 million persons) were or-
 gamzed in unions in 1993. Unions receive most of their funding from a Ministry of
 abor organization, the Workers' Hearth, which distributes mandatory contributions
 from employees and employers. Only the five most powerful public sector unions
 have dues-withholding provisions in their contracts, in addition to receiving Work-
 ers' Hearth subsidies. The International Labor Organization's (ILO) Committee of
 
 
 909
 Experts acknowledged in 1993 that Act No. 1915 of 1990 seems to give effect to ILO
 recommendations that the Government end its financial interference in trade union
 affairs and in the collection of union dues.
 Over 4,000 unions are grouped into regional and sectoral federations and two um-
 brella onfederations, one for civil servants and one for rivate sector employees.
 Unions are highly pontieized, and there are party-affiliatedfactions within the labor
 confederations, but they are not controlled by political parties or the Government
 in day-to-day operations. There are no restrictions on who may serve as a union offi-
 cial. Greek unions maintain a variety of international affiliations and are free to
 join federations and confederations.
 Legislation passed in 1990 mandates a skeleton staff during strikes affecting pub-
 lic services, such as electricity, transportation, communications, and banking. Dur-
 ing strikes in June and July, skeleton staffs did not completely ensure that essential
 services continued uninterrupted; however, there were no repercussions against the
 unions. The previous government's 1992 lawsuit against the electric company work-
 era' union, filed under the skeleton staff provision, is still pending in the courts. In
 1993 the ILO's Committee of Experts requested the Government to guarantee that
 workers' organizations participate in defining the minimum services to be main-
 tained in the event of a strike.
 More than 200 strikes occurred in 1993, including a number in July and August
 by public utility workers protesting privatization legislation. While numerous, elec-
 tric company strikes did not prove as disruptive as in the past. However, bus strikes
 in December and January in opposition to government moves to deprivatize the Ath-
 ens bus system proved extremely disruptive and were marred by violence. As of Jan-
 uary 4, 1994, the dispute between the Government and bus drivers had not been
 resolved. Major legal restrictions on strikes include a mandatory period of notice,
 which is 96 hours for public utilities and 24 hours for the private sector. Public cor-
 porations, including utility companies, state-owned banks, the postal service, Olym-
 pic Airways and the railroads are also required to maintain a skeleton staff during
 strikes. The size of the skeleton staff is determined by the Ministry of Labor in con-
 junction with the management of the particular public corporation.
 The courts have the power to declare strikes illegal, although such decisions are
 seldom enforced. Unions complain, however, that this judicial power serves as a de-
 terrent to some of their membership from participating in strikes. The courts de-
 clared a majority of the strikes illegal for a variety of reasons, without any repercus-
 sions. The Government may also declare "civil mobilization" of workers in case of
 danger to national security life or property, or the social and economic life of the
 country. The ILO Committee of Experts has criticized this power as violating the
 standards of ILO Convention 29 on forced labor. The Government did not resort to
 civil mobilization during 1993.
 Two ILO bodies expressed hope in 1993 that counterinflationary legislation
 passed in 1992, suspending collective bargaining and wage increases in the public
 sector for the duration of the year, had lapsed. In response to union complaints that
 most labor disputes ended in compulsory arbitration, legislative remedies were en-
 acted in 1989 providing for mediation procedures, with compulsory arbitration as a
 last resort. The legislation establishing a national mediation, reconciliation, and ar-
 bitration organization went into effect in January 1992 and applies to the public
 sector and public corporations (the military and civil service excluded). However, a
 government decree in early 1993 setting limits to wage and salary increases for pub-
 lic enterprises diminished the scope of the organization and was the basis for a com-
 plaint lodged with the 1WO by the Confederation of Greek Labor (GSEE) for viola-
 tion of I1W Conventions 98 and 87. The complaint is still pending with the ILO.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiuely.-Legislation passed in 1955
 and amended in 1990 ensures the right to organize and bargain collectively in the
 private sector and in public corporations. These rights are respected in practice.
 There are no restrictions on collective bargaining for private sector employees. Civil
 servants, who have no formal system of collective bargaining, collectively negotiate
 their demands wih the Office of the Minister to the Prime Minister, with which
 the final decision rests.
 Antunion discrimination is prohibited. The Labor Inspectorate or the courts in-
 vestigate and work to resolve complaints of discrimination against union members
 or organizers. Court rulings have mandated the reinstatement of improperly fired
 union organizers.
 Greece has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by the Constitution and is not practiced. The Ministry of Justice enforces
 this prohibition.
 
 
 910
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 in the industrial sector is 15, with higher limits for certain activities. The minimum
 age is 12 in family businesses, theaters, and the cinema. These age limits are en-
 f6rced by occasional Labor Inspectorate spot checks and are generally respected.
 i owever, families engaged in agriculture, food service, or merchandising often have
 younger family members assisting them, at least part-time. Education is free and
 compulsory for all children through the ninth grade.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Collective bargaining between the GSEE and
 the employers' association determines a nationwide minimum wage. The Ministry
 of Labor routinely ratifies this minimum wage, which has the force of law and ap-
 plies to all Greek workers. The minimum wage is sufficient for a decent standard
 of living for a worker and family. The minimum daily wage is approximately $19;
 the minmum monthly salary is approximately $430.
 The maximum legal workweek is 40 hours in the private sector and 372 hours
 in the public sector. A law that took effect in 1992 significantly extended legal oper-
 ating hours for retail establishments, provided that the average workweek did not
 exceed the legal maximum over a period of time. The law provides for at least one
 24-hour rest period per week, mandates paid vacation of 1 month per year, and sets
 limits on overtime.
 Legislation provides for minimum standards of occupational health and safety. Al-
 though the GSEE characterizes health and safety legislation as satisfactory, it
 charges that enforcement, the responsibility of the Labor Inspectorate, is inad-
 equate. In 1992 GSEE cited statistics indicating a fairly high number of ob-related
 accidents over the past two decades. Inadequate inspection, failure to enforce regu-
 lations, outdated industrial plant and equipment, and poor safety training of em-
 ployees contribute to the accident rate. Workers do not have the legal right to re-
 move themselves from situations they believe endanger their health. They have the
 right, however, to lodge a complaint with the Labor Inspectorate, and inspectors are
 prohibited from divulging the name of the worker who lodged the complaint. Inspec-
 tors have the right to close down machinery or a process for a period of up to 5
 days if they see a safety or health hazard they believe represents an imminent dan-
 ger to the workers.
