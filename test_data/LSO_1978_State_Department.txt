 LESOTHO
 Lesotho is a developing country with a highly
 literate population and a tradition of political
 activism. The present Government came to power
 when Lesotho gained its independence from Great
 Britain in 1966. In 1970 the Government annulled
 elections and suspended'the constitution, touching
 off violent protests which were harshly suppressed.
 An unsuccessful coup attempt in 1974 produced a
 further period of repression. While written
 guarantees of individual rights have been suspended,
 actual violations of rights have been mitigated by
 an independent and impartial judiciary. Furthermore,
 in recent years the Government has embarked on a
 strategy of rational reconciliation and reunification.
 This has included lifting the state of emergency
 and appointing members of the opposition to key
 cabinet positions and an interim legislative body.
 The free interplay of political forces remains
 restricted; however, the policy of reconciliation
 has created a climate increasingly sensitive to
 the need for political freedom, the rule of law
 and respect for human rights.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Includ-
 ing Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 No instances of torture have been alleged in
 recent years, and there is no evidence that it is
 either practiced or countenanced.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 No instances of treatment or punishment of this
 kind, which is forbidden by law, have been alleged
 in recent years. There is no evidence to contradict
 affirmations by the International Committee of the
 
 
 Red Cross that prisoners in Lesotho are treated
 humanely.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Under emergency security legislation adopted in
 1974, persons can be arrested without charges and
 detained for renewable periods of sixty days.
 Detention may not be challenged in the courts. The
 legislation contains no provisio'n for public
 acknowledgement of a person's detention. Some
 persons convicted and jailed for violence against
 the state are considered political prisoners by
 critics of the Government. Those imprisoned for
 participating in the 1974 coup attempt have nearly
 all been released.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 No trial is accorded to persons detained under
 the emergency security legislation referred to
 above. However, all other persons arrested are
 accorded a fair, public trial. The judiciary in
 Lesotho retains its independerfce and integrity and
 a public trial including rights of appeal was
 granted to the leaders of the unsuccessful 1974
 coup attempt.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 There have been no recent allegations of invasion
 of the home. Warrants are required for ordinary
 police officials to enter private homes, but
 senior police officers can enter homes without
 warrants at their own discretion.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care,
 and Education
 As one of the poorest countries in Africa, with a
 per capita income of approximately $150 per year,
 Lesotho is heavily dependent on foreign assistance
 to improve the economic well-being of its people.
 Its Government is sensitive to the needs of its
 poor, who constitute the great majority of its people.

 However, Lesotho's dependence on South Africa for
 virtually all its economic needs has made it
 intensely aware of its vulnerability to economic
 disruptions (e.g. UN sanctions against South
 Africa) or politically-inspired economic pressures
 from its powerful neighbor. It has therefore had
 to give priority in the near term to projects
 aimed at reducing its strategic dependence rather
 than at meeting the economic needs of its people.
 The Government is acutely aware of the dilemma
 this poses for development and of the danger of
 reducing the emphasis on attention to the needs of
 the poor. It has cooperated with donor efforts to
 focus aid increasingly on fundamental problems of
 agriculture, health and literacy. It has encouraged
 foreign investment and sought to concentrate it in
 labor-intensive industries in order to increase
 limited domestic employment opportunities.
 Public and private corruption exists in Lesotho,
 although it has not affected the implementation of
 U.S. assistance programs. There are indications
 that political loyalties are a factor in the
 provision of many government services and in
 obtaining employment in government.
 Lesotho's tax system is progressive. Taxes are
 collected primarily from those employed in the
 small cash sector, particularly the civil service,
 where real wages are considerably higher than in
 the rural subsistence sector.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Lesotho is free of restrictions on religion and
 thought, but limitations remain on freedom of
 speech, depending upon the subject and the speaker.
 The radio and some printed media are government-owned,
 but two independent newspapers are frequently
 critical of the Government's policies and practices.
 Freedom of assembly for purposes of political
 dissent is not assured. A permit is required
 which can be used to delay or prevent such assemblies.
 
 
 Labor unions are allowed to bargain collectively
 with employers and enter into contracts, but are
 discouraged from political activity. Women have
 equal suffrage rights, but in general are poorly
 represented in government and the modern sector.
 Because so many Lesotho men seek work in South
 Africa, the majority of farms in Lesotho are
 worked by women, who must also be responsible for
 domestic duties. There is no discrimination on
 ethnic or other grounds. Except for a small white
 minority who are citizens, the country is racially
 homogeneous. There is no racial discrimination in
 law or practice.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no restrictions on domestic travel and
 few on emigration. Special permission must be
 obtained to travel to Botswana, which has granted
 political asylum to Lesotho refugees who oppose
 the Government's policies. Obtaining the required
 police security clearance for the issuance of an
 international passport has proven difficult for
 some opponents of the Government. Lesotho has
 acceded to the 1951 convention on refugees and its
 1967 protocol and has not hesitated to take in
 refugees and exiles from South Africa.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Political activity has been restricted since
 1970, when the Government suspended the constitution
 and declared a state of emergency. However, in 1973
 an interim national assembly was established to act
 as a legislative branch. While all members are
 appointed by the Government, they include representatives
 from the opposition and important local interest groups
 as well as a number of traditional chiefs. This
 process has gradually been expanded until virtually
 all political groups have some representation
 in the government. No plans for elections, however,
 have been announced.

 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government of Lesotho has not tried to deny
 violations of human rights that have occurred
 and is willing to discuss past excesses openly.
 The Government has allowed outside investigations
 of alleged human rights violations. In mid-1978
 it met with representatives of Amnesty International
 to discuss the few persons still imprisoned for
 participation in the 1974 coup attempt.
