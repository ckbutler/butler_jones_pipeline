 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 The Dominican Republic is a constitutional, multiparty
 democracy with an elected President and bicameral
 legislature. The Supreme Court heads an independent judiciary
 whose members are appointed by the Senate. President Salvador
 Jorge Blanco's four-year term began in August 1982.
 The Dominican Republic went through periods of harsh tyranny
 before and during the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo from
 1930 to 1961. Political turmoil followed Trujillo's
 assassination, leading to a civil war and U.S. military
 intervention in 1965. Joaquin Balaguer won an open,
 competitive election in 1965, but the opposition refused to
 participate in the 1970 and 1974 elections. In 1978, the
 country had its first peaceful transfer of power from one
 elected government to another, and free and fair elections
 were held again in 1982.
 The Dominican Republic is a middle income, developing country
 with an economy based primarily on agriculture and services.
 Partly as a result of the Trujillo legacy, the Government
 accounts for 20 to 25 percent of the Gross Domestic Product
 and controls several major industries. The national income is
 unevenly distributed, but there is a significant growing and
 vigorous middle class.
 During 1984 Dominicans continued to exercise the broad range
 of human rights guaranteed them under the 1966 Constitution.
 During late April, violent protest demonstrations in the
 capital and several interior towns were controlled by security
 forces in actions which left over 60 people dead and several
 hundred wounded. The disturbances were a reaction to
 austerity measures implemented by the Government to cope with
 a severe economic crisis. On that and subsequent occasions,
 the Government detained Coymnunist political leaders as well as
 labor leaders on the grounds they were actively planning
 further illegal protest actions. Those detained were
 routinely released within the 48-hour constitutional limit for
 detention without charges.
 Despite the violence of the April disturbances and the
 Government's continued commitment to its economic program
 including implementation of additional adjustment measures,
 the political climate remained open. Public debate on the
 merits of the Government's policies was unrestricted, and
 political groups continued their organizational activities in
 expectation of the 1986 elections.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no known instances in 1984 of the killing of
 persons because of their political views. In April,
 discontent over sharp price increases and deteriorating
 economic conditions led to widespread violent disorders.
 Three days of disturbances left 60 to 80 people dead and two
 to three hundred people injured. Most deaths occurred when
 police dnd military fired on looters. During a protest
 demonstration over textbook price hikes at the Autonomous
 University of Santo Domingo on August 24, one student was
 killed and six were injured in confrontations with the
 
 
 496
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 police. The national police, following an extensive
 investigation by a special commission, arrested and formally
 charged a police lieutenant with the student's death.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances in 1984.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution specifically prohibits torture, and torture
 is not practiced. However, there have been reports of abusive
 treatment of prisoners. The press routinely reports these and
 any other abuses of police authority. In most instances, the
 Government is quick to redress any improper behavior by its
 forces. Eight members of the national police were disciplined
 by the chief of police for using excessive violence during the
 August student demonstrations. A police colonel who shot a
 motorcyclist during the tense calm following the increase in
 late August in the price of gasoline and petroleum derivaties
 was retired from the police force. The motorcyclist had been
 shot for failing to heed an order to stop.
 The inadequately financed prison system suffers from
 unsanitary conditions and overcrowding. The overcrowding
 results in part from the slowness of the judicial process
 under which many prisoners remain in custody while awaiting
 trial. Prisoners and their families have access to the press,
 which contributes to deterring cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 punishment and pressures the Government to take corrective
 action.
 Despite financial constraints, the Government has taken some
 steps to improve the prison situation. Penal and judicial
 authorities are devising measures to streamline and accelerate
 the trial process in order to release prisoners more quickly
 from the system and relieve overcrowding. In 1984 the
 Government introduced major penal reform legislation in the
 Congress.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There are no known cases of political prisoners being held in
 Dominican jails. On several occasions in mid-1984, following
 the April disorders, the Government detained hundreds of
 melauers of radical leftist parties, labor organizations, and
 the campesino movement alleging that they were instigating
 public disturbances in protest over anticipated gasoline price
 hikes. Those so detained were routinely released within 48
 hours, which is the period that suspects may legally be held
 tor purposes of investigation before arraignment.
 There appears to be no evidence of policies or practices of
 forced labor, although isolated incidents may occur involving
 Haitian canecutters employed in the country's sugar industry.
 The Haitian canecutters can quit their jobs and are free to
 leave the plantations. But those who are illegal residents
 and those under contract to the National Sugar Council who
 have abandoned their jobs are subject to deportation. They
 are not forcibly returned to the fields. While experienced
 canecutters have no problem in earning the Dominican minimum
 wage, those who do not meet minimum production standards may
 be returned to Haiti by the Sugar Council.
 
 
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution guarantees a public trial. There is no
 special court for political or national security cases.
 Civilians may not be tried by a military court nor members of
 the armed forces by civilian courts. The appeals procedure,
 which includes appellate courts and the Supreme Court, is
 widely utilized. Court-appointed lawyers are provided at
 public expense to indigents only in criminal cases. They are
 seldom provided in criminal misdemeanor cases where it is at
 the court's discretion to do so or not. Prosecuting attorneys
 are appointed by the executive branch. While the 48 hour
 limit on detention without arraignment is not scrupulously
 enforced in common criminal cases, defendants are generally
 cnarged very soon after arrest. The charges are clearly
 stated and made available to the defense counsel.
 Judges are selected by the Senate and are independent of the
 executive branch but subject to removal or transfer by a
 majority vote in the Senate. Their terms of office correspond
 to that of the President and other elected officials, ending
 on the last day of the incumbent administration regardless of
 date of appointment. Judges have displayed independence in
 their actions and have not been used to persecute opponents of
 the administration. However, judges earn a relatively low
 salary, and the fairness and speediness of some trials have
 been subject to influence and manipulation, with public
 allegations that some judges have accepted bribes.
 The Government has proposed constitutional reforms aimed at
 making the judiciary more independent from political pressures
 and less vulnerable to bribery. There is widespread agreement
 with this goal, but differences exist between the legislative
 leadership and the executive branch on the best way to achieve
 it.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There have been no reports of arbitrary governmental
 interference with the private lives of individuals or
 families. Constitutional safeguards against invasion of the
 home are normally observed. A residence may not be searched
 unless the search is made in the presence of a prosecutor or
 an assistant prosecutor, except in cases of 'hot pursuit' or
 when there is a probable cause to believe that a crime is
 actually occurring within the residence.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These liberties are guaranteed by law and respected.
 Dominican newspapers are privately owned and are rated by the
 Interamerican Press Association as among the freest in the
 hemisphere. The numerous privately owned radio and television
 stations air almost all political points of view, as does the
 Government-owned radio and television network. Moreover,
 there is a frequent exchange of views between the Government
 and all media elements.
 There is no Government censorship on political grounds.
 However, there have been cases in which the Government has
 taken action against media elements. On March 26, 1984, a
 
 
 498
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 privately owned radio station identified with the opposition
 Reformista Party was closed oy the telecommunications board
 because the station erroneously reported that students from
 the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo had thrown rocks at
 President Jorge Blanco's motorcade. Following private
 discussions between the President and the owner of the radio
 station, the station resumed broadcasting on July 9. Four
 stations which were closed during the April disturbances on
 the grounds that they had incited violence were reopened
 during the first week in May. While customs authorities from
 time to time confiscate pro-Communist literature, books of all
 political persuasions are readily available for public sale.
 University autonomy and academic freedom are respected by the
 Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association are guaranteed by
 the Constitution. Outdoor public meetings require official
 government permits which are routinely granted. Throughout
 1984 there were numerous such gatherings of parties and groups
 of diverse political orientations. Likewise, indoor
 gatherings of political parties, labor unions, and other
 associations are unrestricted.
 Labor unions have not historically played a significant role
 in the Dominican Republic, and only 12 percent of the labor
 force is organized. In the first year of the Jorge Blanco
 administration, however, over 70 new unions were officially
 recognized and over 50 collective bargaining pacts were
 negotiated. Two-thirds of the labor movement is included
 within the four main labor confederations, but the
 confederations exercise only a limited degree of control over
 their affiliates. The largest labor confederation is the
 General Union of Dominican Workers, which is affiliated with
 the governing Dominican Revolutionary Party, a member of the
 Social Democratic Socialist International.
 Approximately 30 percent of the Dominican labor union movement
 is Communist controlled or influenced. The politically
 affiliated labor organizations frequently pursue partisan
 political objectives rather than workers' economic demands.
 The Government has on occasion briefly detained labor union
 leaders in order to stop strikes or other labor actions it
 considered illegal.
 The continued deterioration of the nation's economy has
 hampered the growth of organized labor. Unions have the right
 to negotiate and go on strike, even though they operate under
 the handicap of a dated labor code written during the Trujillo
 dictatorship that gives unions few rights vis-a-vis
 management. For example, there is no effective protection for
 organizers or union officals. The current administration has
 however given unions more leeway under the existing
 legislation than previously and has initiated legislation to
 modernize and enhance universally recognized labor rights in a
 revised labor code.
 Professional organizations of lawyers, doctors, journalists,
 etc., function freely. Like the unions, these organizations
 are free to maintain relations with counterpart international
 bodies of diverse political philosophies..

 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Approximately 95 percent of the population is Roman Catholic.
 The Church's preeminent position is accepted by the populace
 at large and is recognized in the Concordat between the
 Dominican Republic and the Holy See. Discrimination on
 racial, religious, or ethnic grounds is prohibited by the
 Constitution. There are no religious requirements to hold
 public office, no restrictions on the practice of other
 religious faiths, and no social discrimination based on
 religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no unusual restrictions on travel within or outside
 the country. Many political exiles returned to the country
 after a 1978 amnesty, but a legal ban on the return of certain
 members of the Trujillo family still exists.
 The status and treatment of Haitians living in the Dominican
 Republic has been criticized by the press and the public, both
 in the Dominican Republic and abroad. The Haitian community
 of approximately 500,000 is composed mainly of illegal
 immigrants seeking employment and better living conditions.
 This figure also includes about 400 individuals, mostly
 opponents of Haitian President Duvalier and deserters from the
 Haitian armed forces, who have received 'political refugee'
 status from the Dominican Government. The illegal immigrants
 are routinely deported under Dominican immigration law, while
 those seeking political refuge are not repatriated if the
 Government determines that.they have a legitimate fear of
 persecution. Some individuals have been deported for failing
 to obey the provision in the Dominican Constitution that
 foreigners should not engage in-political activity directed
 against another country. Anti-Duvalier Haitians, when
 expelled, are sent to countries other than Haiti.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Dominican Republic is a functioning democracy in which
 governments are freely elected by the citizens. Opposition
 groups of the left, right, and center are allowed to operate
 freely. The change in ruling parties brought about in the
 1978 elections, and the free and fair elections held in 1982,
 demonstrate the established right of citizens to change their
 government via the ballot box. The ample participation of the
 opposition Reformista Party. and the pro-Cuban Dominican
 Liberation Party in the independent Dominican legislature has
 strengthened the climate for political participation.
 Political parties, other political movements, and the national
 organization for administration of elections have begun
 activities in preparation for the 1986 elections.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Dominican Republic partidipates actively in international
 and regional human rights bodies and supports human rights
 issues in international forums. In February 1984, it was host
 to the meeting of the Human Rights Committee of the Latin
 American Parliament. The Dominican Republic has ratified the
 
 
 500
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
 Racial Discrimination, and it is a party to the International
 Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, the
 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the
 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
 Against Women.
 International human rights organizations have been allowed
 free access to the country. The Government has cooperated
 fully with the investigation into the sensitive subject of
 the treatment of Haitian refugees and migrant workers.
 Local organizations which freely report and comment on those
 human rights violations which do occur include the Dominican
 Union of Solidarity with Latin America, the Ecumenical Center
 for Human Rights, and the Dominican Union for the Defense of
 Human Rights. The major allegations of these organizations in
 1984 were that the Government used excessive force during the
 April disturbances and that the detention of leftist and labor
 figures at that time was a means of harassment rather than
 investigation.    The Government has not harassed these
 organizations for their criticism of official actions or
 policies. The latest Freedom House report rated the Dominican
 Republic 'free.' The Amnesty International Report for 1984
 did not comment on the Dominican Republic.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Dominican Republic is a poor country with a population of
 approximately 6.2 million and an estimated annual population
 growth rate of 2.8 percent. Half of the population is under
 16 years of age. The low price of sugar, the country's
 principal export, and the high cost of energy imports have
 seriously hurt the economy. Unemployment, now estimated
 between 25 and 30 percent, is on the increase as economic
 growth has slowed and more individuals enter the labor
 market. At least another 20 percent of the labor force are
 believed to be underemployed. Poverty is widespread. Per
 capita income is estimated to be 1,365 pesos per year.
 Although the official exchange rate is one U.S. dollar equals
 one Dominican peso, the parallel exchange rate, which more
 accurately reflects the value of the peso, is approximately
 three to one. At the latter rate, per capita income is 455
 dollars per year.
 per capita calorie consumption meets minimum requirements, but
 only a little over half of the population enjoys access to
 potable water. Health conditions are poor, particularly in
 the rural countryside. Life expectancy at birth is 61.4
 years, and the infant mortality rate is 78 per 1,000 live
 births. Primary school enrollment is claimed to be over 90
 percent, but some observers estimate the rate to closer to 75
 percent. The literacy rate is 67 percent. In 1984, major
 vaccination and literacy campaigns were continued by the
 Government in order to attack some of these problems.
 While sexual and racial discrimination are prohibited by law,
 women have not traditionally shared equal social and economic
 status with men. Women's political rights have been
 recognized in legislation since 1942. Forty-seven percent of
 registered voters are women, and women hold.botti elective and
 appointed offices in the Government. The Jorge Blanco
 administration has established an office to encourage the
 advancement of women, and in 1983 the United Nations
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 501
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 International Research and Training Institute for the
 Advancement of Women set up its headquarters in Santo
 Domingo. Divorce is easily attainable by either party, and
 women can hold property in their own names apart from their
 husbands.
 There is subtle social discrimination against darker skinned
 Dominicans, although this has not prevented their success in a
 variety of fields. Dominicans, for historical reasons and
 because of sharp cultural differences, are in general strongly
 prejudiced against Haitians. This prejudice carries over to
 the minority in the population who are Dominicans of Haitian
 descent. Cultural'creativity and freedom are widely respected
 and allowed to flourish.
