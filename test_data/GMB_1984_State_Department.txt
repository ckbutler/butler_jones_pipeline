 THE GAMBIA
 A former British colony on the West African Coast, The Gambia
 is a parliamentary democracy with an elected President. The
 country is extremely small (slightly over 4,000 square miles)
 and is virtually surrounded by neighboring Senegal. Its
 population of 725,000 consists largely of subsistence farmers
 growing rice and the country's primary export crop--groundnuts
 (peanuts). The Gambia has functioning democratic institutions
 and, with the exception of disorders in 1980 and a bloody
 attempted coup in 1981, has had a history of political
 stability under the leadership of its first President, Sir
 Dawda Jawara. The ruling People's Progressive Party dominates
 the House of Representatives; the leading opposition party and
 independents also won seats in the May 1982 legislative
 elections.
 A state of emergency imposed after the July 1981 coup attempt
 continues in effect, giving the Government wide powers of
 detention. There were 1,091 persons originally detained in
 1981 after the bloody disorders, led by leftist elements and
 supported by a large part of the police field force, which
 resulted in the-deaths of over 800 people. Of those detained,
 903 were released and 188 were brought to trial, of whom 55
 were acquitted. Three died while under detention during their
 trial, 25 were sentenced to prison, and 63 were sentenced to
 death for treason. Of the latter, one was acquitted on appeal
 and another had his sentence reduced. To date, as the death
 sentences have been confirmed by appeal court, the President
 has been commuting them to either life or 20 years'
 imprisonment.  There are no outstanding cases left arising
 from the events of July 1981.
 The process of confederation with Senegal, formalized by the
 treaty of December 1981, continued during 1984, albeit at a
 slower pace. Important steps were taken during the year in
 implementation of the protocols on defense and security. The
 Gambia gendarmerie has been organized on the Senegalese model
 and is currently being trained and commanded by a Senegalese
 officer (a Gambian successor is currently undergoing training
 in a third country). The Gambian army is being trained by
 both Senegalese and British officers, with the former
 emphasizing the confederal component and the latter
 concentrating on the national contingent.
 Along with many of its neighbors, The Gambia was sorely
 affected by the world recession and a decrease in the demand
 and the market price for groundnuts. Drought affected both
 groundnut and rice production. The Government signed a
 stand-by agreement with the IMF to provide badly needed
 balance-of-payments and budgetary support, but has had to
 accept stringent spending and import limitations.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There have been no instances of political killing in The
 Gambia in 1984. To date, 61 persons have been sentenced to
 death--after lengthy public trials observing due process of
 law--for crimes committed in connection with the 1981 coup
 attempt. The cases have now gone through appeal and, in each
 
 
 128
 THE GAMBIA
 case brought to the President, executive clemency has been
 granted. No executions have taken place.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no known record or allegation of abduction or secret
 detention by any element of the Government or by any group in
 the country.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The constitutional prohibition against torture is observed in
 practice. No allegations of torture were noted in 1984. The
 Constitution also contains prohibitions against cruel,
 inhuman, and degrading punishment. Persons familiar with the
 operation of the legal system, and whose opinions are
 respected, believe that courts are alert to any allegation of
 mistreatment in prisons. These sources also acknowledge that
 there may be lapses in supervision resulting in individual
 instances of mistreatment of prisoners. There are segregated
 prison facilities for men and women of both maximum and
 minimum security types. The Government has allowed prison
 visits by representatives of the local Red Cross and by close
 family members. Sentences, including fines and imprisonment,
 are related to the severity of the crime committed and are
 based upon schedules set forth in statutes or regulations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There are well developed constitutional and legal procedures
 governing the arrest, detention, and bringing to trial of
 persons accused of crimes. These are based on British legal
 practice. However, under the Emergency Act still in force,
 the Government may order the detention of any person who is
 considered to have been involved in acts prejudicial to the
 public safety or public order, in the preparation or
 instigation of such acts, or in impeding the maintenance of
 supplies and services essential to the life of the community.
 Such persons may be held up to 14 days without a detention
 order. Detainees are free to exercise their right to legal
 counsel. The Emergency Act, which has been extended by the
 legislature several times, continues in force.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Three kinds of law operate in The Gambia: general, Shari'a,
 and customary law. Shari'a law, governing certain aspects of
 social interaction of rural Muslims, is observed, even in the
 capital of Banjul, in marriage and divorce proceedings.
 Customary law covers marriage, inheritance, divorce, land
 tenure and utilization, local government, and all other civil
 and social relations originating in the traditional religious
 and ethnic situation of the country. General law, based on
 English statutes and modified to suit the Gambian context,
 governs criminal cases and trials and most organized business
 practices. If there were a conflict between general and
 Shari'a law, general law would prevail. Trial procedures in
 general law are carefully regulated to insure protection of
 the rights of the accused. Under the law, a detained person
 must come to trial within one week. This waiting period,
 however, can be extended twice, making the total time of
 detention before trial allowed under the law 21 days. If an
 accused person is released on bail, the individual need not
 
 
 129
 THE GAMBIA
 come to trial until the investigation is completed, and there
 apparently is no time limit for investigations. Appeals
 normally proceed from the Supreme (trial) Court to the Court
 of Appeal, the country's highest tribunal. Jury trials are
 limited to certain specified cases such as murder.
 Trials for those persons detained by Presidential order under
 the Emergency Act were delayed because of the extraordinary
 measures the Government undertook to cope with the large
 number of detainees. The court system in this tiny nation was
 overwhelmed. The Government therefore established a special
 division of the Supreme (trial) Court, which included judges
 and prosecuting and defense attorneys from neighboring
 English-speaking countries, all of which have the same basic
 legal system as The Gambia. This unusual step was taken
 because of a shortage of trained legal personnel in The
 Gambia, to avoid overwhelming the regular judicial process,
 and to demonstrate publicly the Government's concern for
 impartiality. The Government has scrupulously observed the
 statute of limitation and has reportedly released numerous
 detainees
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 The Constitution provides guarantees against arbitrary search
 of person and property. It excepts the voluntary submission
 to a search by the individual, or a search that is reasonably
 required in the interests of national defense or other public
 interest. Under the criminal code, search warrants are issued
 by magistrates upon application by the police, based on
 probable cause. Under the Emergency Act, searches of premises
 or vehicles for suspected firearms or other enumerated
 articles are authorized by the Inspector General of Police or
 the Commander of Military Forces. There are a number of
 police and military checkpoints in and around Banjul. Drivers
 are stopped and vehicles searched from time to time.
 The rights of family are of extreme importance in this
 conservative Muslim society. Marriage, the raising of
 children, and religious instruction are regulated by a
 combination of individual preference and ethnic and religious
 tradition. The Government does not intrude in family matters
 except to protect public safety and morality. There is no
 effort to censor or control personal correspondence or
 communications.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides guarantees of press freedom. In
 practical terms, The Gambia, with its small, mainly rural,
 largely illiterate, and multilingual population, does not
 support an active press. There are no dailies. There is a
 government weekly paper and several intermittently published
 mimeographed news sheets. Le Soleil, a Dakar-based paper,
 publishes an English-language weekly, using Gambian staff and
 concentrating on Gambian news. There is a government radio
 station, as well as a private commercial station which
 broadcasts largely musical programs. Magazines and some
 newspapers from outside the country are available at a few
 outlets in the capital. There is no television in The Gambia,
 although Senegalese stations can be received.
 
 
 130
 THE GAMBIA
 The Government dominates the media through Radio Gambia, but
 there have been no reported instances of government
 interference with the commercial radio station. The
 Government does not attempt to censor published materials
 originating either within or outside the country. The
 Emergency Act, with its broad powers of detention, has had an
 inhibiting effect on criticism of the Government by
 independent news sheets; commentators are said to have been
 noticeably more outspoken in the past.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are no restrictions on freedom of association and
 assembly in the Constitution. Under the Emergency Act,
 however, public meetings are held only with prior notification
 to and permission from the police. According to the best
 information available, no permits for meetings have been
 denied, but the authorities require meetings to be public.
 Trade unions remain a minor element in Gambian economic and
 political life. Less than 20 percent of the work force is
 engaged in the industry, commerce, and service sectors where
 unions normally are active. Trade unions are small and
 fragmented. The Government has agreed in principle that the
 Gambian Workers Union may resume its functions provided it is
 re-registered, but the Union has not been willing to meet
 conditions on filing financial reports and rectifying alleged
 fiscal irregularities. Other unions continue to function
 under basic labor and trade union legislation. Union members
 have freedom of movement to attend meetings outside the
 country.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The constitutional guarantees of freedom of conscience,
 thought, and religion are observed in practice. The state is
 secular. Muslims constitute over 90 percent of the
 population; the schools provide instruction in the Koran for
 Muslim students. Christians, both Catholic and Protestant,
 freely and actively practice their religion. There is a small
 Bahai community in Banjul. Missionaries are permitted to
 carry on their work in the country. No evidence of
 discrimination on the grounds of religion has been observed in
 employment or education or in other areas of Gambian life.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution has provisions guaranteeing freedom of
 movement subject to conditions protecting public safety,
 health, and morals. There is no restriction on freedom of
 emigration or freedom of return. Internally, police and
 military checkpoints exist in and around Banjul; under the
 Emergency Act, travelers and their vehicles may be searched.
 There is no evidence that police harass travelers.
 Because of historic and ethnic ties with the people of
 Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, and Mali, people tend to move
 unregulated across borders, which are poorly marked and
 difficult to police. Under the Confederation Treaty of 1981,
 neither Gambians nor Senegalese require passports or visas to
 travel to the other's country. The border is essentially
 open, and movement across the border is constant. There is a
 high tolerance for foreigners and no effort is made by the
 Government to discriminate against them. There are no
 
 
 131
 THE GAMBIA
 refugees in The Gambia. Early in 1983, some 600 Gambians were
 among the vast number of illegal aliens expelled by Nigeria.
 Their return has caused no noticeable impact. With the change
 of regime in Guinea, there is evidence that many Guineans
 formerly resident in The Gambia are returning to Guinea.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Government is elected by citizens 18 years of age and
 older; the chief executive official (the President) and the
 members of the legislature (House of Representatives) are
 popularly elected, as are the district councils and the chiefs
 who exercise traditional authority in the villages and
 compounds.
 A functioning multiparty system exists in The Gambia. The
 principal opposition party, the National Convention Party,
 contests national and district elections. Other opposition
 parties contest the Presidency and other offices on a selected
 basis.
 Independents have run for and won legislative seats. In the
 1982 election, the Government party, the People's Progressive
 Party, won 35 seats in the House of Representatives, the
 National Convention Party 6, and independents 2. The
 opposition is not able to defeat or modify significant
 legislation because of its small size, but debate is open and
 accepted parliamentary procedures are observed.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 After the coup attempt in 1981, the Government adopted a
 policy of permitting visits of international human rights
 organizations to observe the conditions of the detainees and
 the trial process. Amnesty International sent an observer in
 January 1982 to attend two trials; an Amnesty mission in
 August 1982 then visited The Gambia and held discussions with
 high government officials, including President Jawara. The
 only humanitarian organization in The Gambia is the local Red
 Cross. There have been no requests for investigation of
 alleged human rights abuses in The Gambia by an international
 or non-governmental organization during 1984. The 1984
 Amnesty International Report focused on the status of the
 prisoners charged with the failed coup attempt of July 1981.
 Freedom House terms The Gambia "partly free.* Internationally,
 the Government has been a proponent of human rights in Africa
 and in January 1983 became the 17th OAU member to ratify the
 African Charter of Human Rights.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Gambia is a poor, almost overwhelmingly agricultural,
 nation with a population of 725,000 people (1984). The
 population growth rate is 3.5 percent a year. Per capita GNP
 (1984) is $359.60. The adult literacy rate is 20.1 percent
 (1984). Approximately 45 percent (1981) of eligible children
 attend primary school. The new Gambia College provides
 post-secondary training leading to certificates in teaching,
 agriculture, and nursing, but there is no university-level
 institution in The Gambia.
 
 
 132
 THE GAMBIA
 Life expectancy at birth is 42 years; the infant mortality
 rate in 1983 was 195.6 per 1,000. Only 12 percent (1970) of
 the population is believed to have access to safe water (the
 urban rate is 97 percent). The ratio of calorie supply
 available for consumption relative to nutritional requirements
 is 93 percent (1977).
 Almost 83 percent of the people live in rural areas. The
 principal ethnic groups are Mandinka, Woloff, Fula, Jola, and
 Serahuli. Most people are Muslim. Rural life is village and
 family oriented. While individual initiative and choices are
 valued, rights and privileges are generally perceived to
 reside in the group rather than in the individual. Traditional
 values remain strong but are changing. Education of women is
 increasingly accepted, and women participate in the professions
 and in political life. Marriages are still often arranged,
 but there is increasing freedom of personal choice. Family
 planning, focused on the health and welfare of mother and
 child, remains controversial but is gaining acceptance. There
 is a Women's Bureau in the Office of the President which
 actively promotes debate on women's issues.
 The strength of community practices and traditions has
 strongly influenced the high degree of tolerance in the
 diverse Gambian society. There is a deep respect for the
 tradition of living at peace with one's neighbors. The level
 of intercommunal violence is extremely low.
 The Gambia depends on one major crop, groundnuts, for foreign
 exchange; this is subject to the vagaries of weather and world
 market conditions. The population consists mostly of
 subsistence farmers who are not able to satisfy The Gambia's
 food requirements. As a result, the Government has relied on
 external food assistance for the last several years, and
 adopted a five-year development plan which emphasizes crop
 diversification and greater agricultural productivity.
 Practically all of the funding for the development plan must
 come from external sources--grants and loans. The
 Government's ability to absorb and administer the assistance
 has been hampered by a lack of facilities and trained
 personnel.
