 ITALY
 -Italy is a modern democratic state with a population
 of 57 million. The Italian people have played a
 central role in the history of western civilization,
 including developments in legal theory and practice
 and the protection of human rights and dignity. Italy
 has a strong labor union tradition, a well-developed
 educational system, and an extensive program of social
 services.
 The Italian constitution, a document drafted after
 World War II and influenced by Catholic social thought
 and social democratic theory, recognizes political and
 civil liberties and fundamental economic and social
 rights. Despite high levels of terrorist violence,
 political and civil liberties are honored in practice.
 The Italian government has an excellent record of
 fostering economic and social justice, a complex and
 difficult problem in a country of markedly unequal
 patterns of economic development and social change.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by Article 13 and
 by Article 27 of the constitution and is respected in
 practice. Accusations of torture appear from time to
 time in the press. For example, during a court hear-
 ing on November 19, 1980 Renato Curcio, accused leader
 of the terrorist "Red Brigade," protested the special
 prisons for terrorists and accused the government of
 practicing "mass torture".  such charges have not been
 substantiated by disinterested parties.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment
 is forbidden by Article 13 and by Article 37 of the
 constitution and is not practiced. No invidious
 distinctions generally are made among prisoners on
 the basis of social class, race, sex or religion.
 Summary executions are unknown.
 c.   Disappearances
 There have been no cases of disappearance in Italy
 linked to or condoned by the state or its agents.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Police procedures in Italy are carefully circumscribed
 by law and judicial oversight, and arbitrary arrest
 is not an Italian practice. Further, while habeas
 
 
 828
 corpus in the American sense is not a provision of
 Italian law, the rights of prisoners are protected by
 law and procedural safeguards. In order to deal with
 the continuing terrorist onslaught which caused some
 30 deaths and over 100 injuries in 1979 (many among
 police and judicial officers), parliament passed a
 law in February 1980 which modified arrest and pre-
 trial procedures for suspected terrorists in several
 important respects: pre-trial detention without charge
 was lengthened from 24 to 48 hours, the legal limit
 that anyone charged with terrorist crimes can be held
 before trial was lengthened from 8 years and 2 months
 to a maximum of 10 years and 8 months (in narrowly
 defined circumstances) and plea bargaining was intro-
 duced into the system. These and other innovations
 have resulted in apprehension of an increased number
 of identified terrorists. Plea bargaining in parti-
 cular reportedly has been a key factor in the success
 of the anti-terrorist effort during the past year.
 In the past, prisoners suspected of terrorism had
 little incentive to cooperate with the investigating
 magistrates. Since the changes in law, however,
 legally-sanctioned plea bargaining has induced a
 number of prisoners to assist police in their inves-
 tigations. There have been a few accusations of use
 of unjustified force in carrying out arrests of
 terrorist suspects.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A fair public trial is required by Title 2 of the
 Code of Penal Proceedings, Article 423. This right
 is respected in practice. Defendants have the right
 to effective counsel, which is provided gratis if
 necessary. The independence of the judiciary is
 protected by Article 104 of the constitution. Article
 102 provides for the possibility of judges speciali-
 zing in particular areas, but forbids appointment of
 special or extraordinary judges drawn from outside
 the magistracy. Article 103 limits jurisdiction of
 courts martial in time of peace to military crimes
 committed by members of the armed forces. With the
 exception of courts martial in time-of war, Article
 111 of the constitution provides that all cases can
 be appealed to the court of cassazione (the highest
 court of appeal).
 f.   Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from arbitrary invasion of the home is gua-
 ranteed by Article 14 of the constitution. The law
 provides that warrants can be issued by the indepen-
 dent magistracy, but the anti-terrorism law of
 February 7, 1980 provides for approval of search
 warrants by telephone including the issuance of
 search warrants for groups of buildings in cases of
 emergency. No reports of illegal searches or other
 violations of the home are known to have occurred
 during the past year, nor does the government
 
 
 829
 appear to practice demolition or unjustified sealing
 of doors or windows.
 2.   Government   Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health
 Care and Education
 Italy is committed to the protection andfostering of
 economic and social rights on a non-discriminatory
 basis by constitutional mandate and by the programs
 of all the major political parties. The constitution
 protects the institution of matrimony (Article 29),
 notes the rights and duties of parents to educate
 their children, legitimate or illegitimate (Article
 30), provides for protection of pregnant women, babies
 and youth (Article 31), provides for the general
 health care of the community with free treatment
 guaranteed to the indigent (Article 32), provides
 for freedom of the arts and sciences, establishment
 of public schools, and guarantees the right of pri-
 vate schooling which does not involve charges to the
 State (Article 33). Schooling is obligatory for
 eight years and is free through the university
 (Article 34). Women enjoy equal rights and the same
 wages for the same work as men (Article 37). Just
 conditions for work and fair remuneration are required
 by Article 36 and special provisions for the handi-
 capped and unemployed by Article 38. Private property
 and free enterprise are protected by a number of
 articles, particularly 41 and 42. Finally, Article 3
 provides that all citizens are of equal standing
 before the law without distinction as to sex, race,
 language, religion, political opinions and personal
 or social conditions.
 While conditions of women vary in Italy as elsewhere
 according to age, place, and social position, Italian
 women have full equality of civil rights, an equality
 which the great majority exercises. Women benefit
 from specific constitutional protection. Article 29,
 which recognizes the family, "founded on marriage as a
 natural unit of society," prescribes the moral and
 juridical equality of the partners. Article 37, in
 addition to providing for equal pay for equal work for
 women, insists that their conditions of labor be
 adapted to meet their family needs and assures special
 protection to the mother and child. Further protection
 is provided by the Family Rights Law of May 19, 1975,
 which provides inter alia for retention of Italian
 nationality should a woman marry a foreigner, provides
 that goods acquired during a marriage be considered
 community property rather than belonging, unless
 otherwise noted, only to the husband, and reconfirms
 the equality of rights and duties of the marriage
 partners. Social pressures against participation of
 women in most jobs are weak and declining.

 Article 6 of the constitution extends the special
 attention of the Republic to linguistic minorities,
 and Article 116 establishes five special regions,
 of which two, Valle D'Aosta and Trentino-Alto Adige,
 exist because they contain a large ethnic-linguistic
 minority -- French-speaking in the first instance
 and German-speaking in the second. In late 1980 the
 question of the German-speaking minority again came
 to public attention when the Austrian government
 raised the subject of civil service regulations which,
 in its view, appear to favor Italian speakers over
 German speakers. There is no evidence of bad faith
 on the part of the Italian government in meeting
 linguistic needs of this minority population.
 The current GDP per capita is $5,685. Real annual
 growth in industrial wages was 3.6 percent  in 1978
 and 3.1 percent  in 1979. Unemployment was approxi-
 mately 8 percent in January 1980. The inflation
 rate was 15.7 percent in 1979 and is currently (in
 October 1980) at 22 percent.   While the overall
 economic picture is impressive by many standards,
 southern per capita income is only 60 per cent of
 that in the north and unemployment in the south is
 over 10 per cent while elsewhere it is around 5 per
 cent.
 The government, political parties, unions, and church
 all remain actively concerned with the effort to pro-
 vide both economic growth and a more equitable dis-
 tribution of income. The government makes a special
 economic effort in the south, and public sector firms
 make continuous efforts to expand employment in
 underdeveloped regions. In 1978, 31.8 percent  of
 public sector industrial employment was in the south.
 3.   Respect for Political and Civil Liberties,
 Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly,
 The Italian press exercises its constitutional
 guarantees of freedom and gives full play to the
 entire spectrum of political views. The constitution
 (Article 21) forbids prior censorship or review of
 the press. Publications may be seized for violations
 of the laws against obscenity or defamation of state
 institutions or political or ecclesiastical leaders,
 but this provision is interpreted narrowly and does
 not constrict to any meaningful degree the exchange
 of political views or criticism.
 There is no governmental interference with academic
 inquiry. The Italian constitution protects the
 citizen's right to assemble publicly (Article 17),
 a right which may not be denied except for reasons of
 
 
 831
 security or of public safety. The rights of unions
 to organize, negotiate and strike is protected
 (Article 39), as is the right of free association
 of Italian citizenry in general.
 The constitution specifically provides that the
 state and the Catholic Church will each, in its
 proper sphere, be considered independent and
 sovereign and that the relationship between them
 be governed by the Lateran Treaties of 1929 (Article
 7); at the same time, all religious groups are held
 to be equally free and all religious groups have
 the right to organize according to their own require-
 ments so long as these do not offend public order.
 Individuals have the right to profess any religious
 faith, to proselytize for that faith and to exercise
 their religion in public or in private (Article 19).
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 The constitution guarantees to every Italian citizen
 the right to travel freely within the country, and to go
 abroad and to return (Article 16). Since Italy
 remains a country of emigration, the Italian govern-
 ment does not encourage settlement of a large number
 of refugees. Nonetheless, Italian policy concerning
 refugees is a relatively generous one. In 1979,
 Italy acted as way-station for approximately 40,000
 refugees in transit from the Soviet Union. Italy
 rescued and has undertaken to resettle some 1,600
 Indochinese and has decided to take a small number
 of Cubans as a contribution to the world-wide effort
 to meet the Cuban refugee crisis.
 On January 12, 1980, the government of Italy promul-
 gated restrictions on foreigners living and working.
 in Italy. This was prompted by reports that aliens
 were contributing to Italy's problems of terrorism
 and high unemployment. Under new rules, aliens who
 violate the conditions of their tourist or work
 visas can be sentenced to up to 1 year in jail or
 fined up to $1,250. Employers hiring aliens without
 work permits face heavy fines and possible withdrawal
 of their licenses to conduct business. They may also
 be required to pay for the foreigners' return home.
 It is estimated that 500,000 illegal aliens, many
 from North Africa, hold jobs in Italy.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 All Italians are encouraged to participate in the
 political process. Political parties represent the
 entire spectrum from left to right. In a typical
 parliamentary election, over 90% of eligible voters
 
 
 832
 "cast ballots. No major problems of nationality,
 citizenship or statelessness exist.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental Investigation
 of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Italian government has an excellent record in
 support of human rights throughout the world. within
 Italy, there are several organizations concerned
 with human rights questions. In addition to political
 parties and religious groups concerned with human
 rights, there are active branches of Amnesty Interna-
 tional. The Italian government welcomes the interest
 of and cooperates with international and regional
 human rights bodies of a wide variety.
