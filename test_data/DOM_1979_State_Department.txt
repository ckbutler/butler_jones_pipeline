 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 The Dominican Republic is a constitutional democracy
 with an elected president and vice president, an elected
 bicameral legislature and a judicial branch led by a
 Supreme Court appointed by the Senate. President Antonio
 Guzman is now in the second year of a four year term
 which commenced August 1978, following his defeat of
 ex-President Joaquin Balaguer in the May 16 National
 Election. The new president took up his duties with
 a strong commitment to the defense and advancement of
 human rights.
 The Dominican Republic has gone through periods of harsh
 tyranny with occasional interludes of political freedom
 since gaining independence from Haiti in 1844. Although
 its early leaders set high standards of democratic practice
 and respect for individual liberties, these values were
 systematically violated during the dictatorship of Rafael
 Trujillo (1930-1961). The excesses of his regime continue
 to live in the memory of most adult Dominicans. After
 Trujillo's assasination, succeeding governments generally
 respected basic human rights, and traditions of democracy
 gained strength. The peaceful transfer of power in 1978
 was a major landmark. Dominicans now enjoy in practice
 the broad range of human rights guaranteed in the 1966
 constitution.
 Steady improvement in the economic well-being of the
 Dominican people has been frustrated by world economic
 conditions, the low price of the country's principal
 export, sugar, and the high cost of the main import,
 fuel. Moreover, in September 1979 two hurricanes, David
 and Frederick, dealt the country a crippling blow. Unem-
 ployment in normal times is high, and since the hurricanes
 this level has risen sharply. Most Dominicans have little
 formal education and illiteracy is high. The last two
 decades have seen the growth of a middle class, but income
 distribution is still highly skewed. Per capita income
 is $872, which puts the country in the middle range of
 Latin American states.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is not officially condoned nor is it practiced.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The Guzman administration entered office with a commitment
 to reforming the notoriously bad prison system, and prison
 
 
 303
 conditions have been improved. Access of prisoners and
 their families to the press remains a deterrent to cruel,
 inhuman or degrading punishment. Nonetheless, during
 early 1979 a Dominican army sergeant who had held a hostage
 at gunpoint at the airport and who was captured by security
 forces, died under mysterious circumstances in prison.
 Although the death was originally labelled a suicide,
 it appeared to be the result of physical maltreatment
 following arrest. The Government said afterwards that
 procedures would be changed to avoid such occurrences
 in the future, and an investigation was launched. Although
 no charges have apparently resulted from the investigation,
 no similar incidents have occurred.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The Guzman administration has publicly assigned high
 priority to improving Dominican justice and increasing
 protection of human rights. During its first-year, amnesty
 legislation was passed that resulted in the release of
 over two hundred political prisoners and the return of
 all exiles desiring to do so. There are no allegations
 that any political prisoners remain in Dominican jails.
 The amnesty legislation concurrently annulled 1963 laws
 against "communist" and "subversive" activity.
 The Guzman Government, in general, has not engaged in
 politically-motivated arrests. However, several labor
 leaders and a key opposition figure were briefly detained
 during the July 1979 strike by taxi drivers' to protest
 sharply increased oil product prices. All were released
 within 48 hours which is the period that suspects may
 be legally held before arraignment. Most of the individ-
 uals arrested in connection with a recent coup plot have
 been released on writs of habeus corpus. Due process
 has been observed in all of these cases.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Laws calling for fair public trials are respected. Last
 year legislation was enacted to strengthen the right
 of habeas corpus and facilitate recourse to more rapid
 justice. Court-appointed lawyers are provided for the
 indigent. The judicial branch is substantially independent
 from the executive branch of government.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Safeguards against invasion of the home are observed.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 The Guzman Government is allocating a higher proportion
 of public resources than previous Dominican governments
 
 
 304
 to economic and social development programs designed
 to meet the basic needs of the poor majority. The increase
 in funding for the education sector is an especially
 noteworthy example. There is also an increased effort
 to assist rural areas, where half of the country's total
 population of over five million still lives. The devas-
 tation created by two severe hurricanes has greatly com-
 plicated this task. The Government will have to rely
 heavily on international assistance in order to undertake
 recovery and reconstruction programs.
 The Anti-Slavery Society alleged in 1979 that Haitian
 migrant workers (cane-cutters) in the Dominican Republic
 regularly work in near-slavery conditions under contracts
 negotiated with the Haitian government. Both governments
 strongly denied the charges. The intergovernmental agree-
 ment negotiated in 1979 provides for closer monitoring
 of working conditions in the cane fields.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion, and Assembly
 These liberties are guaranteed by law and are largely
 respected. Dominican newspapers engage heavily in polit-
 ical commentary and are rated by the Interamerican Press
 Association as among the freest in the hemisphere. The
 government has, however, been charged with intervening
 to a limited extent in radio and TV broadcasting; one
 political commentator opposed to the Government claims
 he was forced off the air by government pressures. Never-
 theless, the nations's many radio and TV stations collec-
 tively air almost all political points of view.
 While outdoor public meetings require official government
 permits, indoor gatherings of political parties, labor
 unions and other associations are unrestricted. Permits
 have not been awarded to Communist and other far-left
 groups, and authorities have dispersed public demonstra-
 tions by such groups. Discrimination on religious, racial,
 or ethnic grounds is prohibited. There are no restrictions
 on religious practice.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is no restriction on freedom to travel within the
 country. A law requiring prior governmental approval
 for travel to Communist countries was repealed earlier
 this year by the Congress and the President on grounds
 that the requirement was contradictory to the Dominican
 constitution. Following the amnesty of 1978, a substantial
 number of political exiles who had been deported by the
 previous government returned.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 
 
 Legal procedures were followed in national elections
 in 1962, 1966, 1970, 1974, and 1978. The 1966 election,
 which was won by President Balaguer, was vigorously con-
 tested by the major political parties, as was the 1978
 election. In the campaigns of 1970 and 1974 the then-
 leading opposition party, the Partido Revolucionario
 Dominicano, charged intervention and harassment by the
 military in favor of the reelection of Balaguer, and
 withdrew from the contest several days before the election.
 In 1978, the political campaign preceding the election
 was free and open. Early on May 17, when it became clear
 that the incumbent Partido Reformista was losing on the
 national level, the vote-counting was interrupted by
 elements of the Dominican Armed Forces. Although there
 were several days of acute political tension throughout
 the country followed by an extended period of uncertainty,
 President-elect Guzman was inaugurated on schedule on
 August 15.
 In all, a dozen parties, including the small Communist
 party, participated in the 1978 election, as did several
 "single-issue" political movements.
 The Guzman Government has successfully taken steps to
 remove the military from politics and to institutionalize
 and professionalize the armed forces and police. These
 organizations have historically played a decisive role
 in the political system of the country. The Government
 is attempting to carry out its campaign commitment to
 eliminate inefficiency and corruption.
 Labor unions are free to organize and operate, but remain
 handicapped by a Trujillo-era labor code favorable to
 management. Legislative efforts to modify or replace
 the code have not yet borne fruit, although the government
 is committed to a policy of expanded rights for workers.
 The Secretary of Labor has permitted unions, within the
 confines of the code, to exercise their rights more fully
 than they could under past governments.
 Women's political rights have been recognized in legisla-
 tion since 1942. Traditionally, women have not shared
 equal social and economic status with men. Although
 47 percent of registered voters are women, they hold
 only 10 percent of elected offices. Presently women
 hold positions in the government up to the sub-cabinet
 level, two women sit in the 27-member Senate, and ten
 in the 91-member Chamber of Deputies. President Guzman
 has announced a series of initiatives to "eradicate"
 traditional discrimination against women, and Santo Domingo
 has been chosen as the site for the headquarters of the
 United Nation's International Research and Training Insti-
 tute for the Advancement of Women.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights:
 In recent years international and non-governmental organi-
 zations have not sought to conduct any human rights inves-
 tigations in the Dominican Republic. Amnesty International
 noted in a 1978 report that, following President Guzman's
 inauguration, over 200 political prisoners were released,
 many political exiles returned, and progress was made
 in improving La Victoria Penitentiary.
