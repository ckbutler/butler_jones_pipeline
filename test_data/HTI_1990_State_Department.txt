 HAITI
 Haiti was governed in 1990 by two different regimes. A
 military regime, headed by Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril since
 September 1988, held power until mid-March. Avril's
 increasingly repressive policies provoked widespread hostility
 toward the military government. A combination of civil unrest
 and pressure from military, business, and political leaders
 culminated in Avril's departure from Haiti on March 11.
 Consultations among several political and civic groups
 resulted in a proposal, which the army accepted, to replace
 the Avril regime with a civilian Provisional Government led by
 a Supreme Court judge, Ertha Pascal Trouillot. President
 Trouillot took office on March 13 with the mission of
 overseeing election preparations. Together with the
 provisional Government, there was also established a State
 Council which was given consultative rights on major
 governmental decisions. However, after a series of disputes
 with the executive over its failure to take action against
 political violence, the State Council passed-a vote of no
 confidence in Trouillot and removed itself from active
 participation in the Government. Trouillot established, in
 conformity with the Constitution, an independent electoral
 council ta organize local, legislative, and presidential
 elections, which were carried out on, December 16.
 The Haitian army is responsible for state security. In urban
 areas, army units serve as police; in rural areas Section
 Chiefs, who are chosen by and technically serve in the army,
 act as the rough equivalent of loca-l sheriffs.
 Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and the
 most densely populated. Poverty, unemployment, and economic
 inequalities continue to plague all aspects of life for most
 Haitians. Economic opportunities remain severely limited for
 all but the wealthiest classes of society.
 The army, particularly its rural Section Chiefs and provincial
 units, committed serious human rights violations in 1990,
 including political and other extrajudicial killing,
 widespread torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, and
 violence against opposition political supporters and rural
 residents. Armed bands, some believed to be composed of
 active-duty or former soldiers or remnants of the Tonton
 Macoute militia (the security apparatus of the former Duvalier
 dictatorship), carried out a wave of common crimes and
 extrajudicial killings including a December bomb attack that
 killed seven people at a political rally for presidential
 candidate Jean Bertrand Aristide. In January the Avril
 government launched a crackdown on opposition figures that
 included numerous illegal arrests, beatings, and
 deportations. The military regime briefly declared a "state
 of siege" and restricted civil liberties. Although the number
 of human rights violations declined under the Trouillot
 Government, neither the army nor the Government itself made
 any serious effort to curb abuses. In 1990 the army remained
 virtually unaccountable to civilian authorities for human
 rights abuses. Throughout the year the judicial system was
 unable to protect even the most basic legal rights due to
 widespread corruption and continuing intimidation by the
 military and rightwing groups. Neither the military
 government of General Avril nor the intimidated Trouillot
 Government made even a pretense of prosecuting the
 perpetrators of political massacres and assassinations of
 recent years.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Several political killings and murders that appeared to have
 political motives took place in 1990. Two murders with
 indisputably political motives took place on June 21 when
 unidentified assailants in olive-green uniforms fired at a
 meeting that the State Council was holding with constituent
 groups, killing Council member Serge Villard and labor
 activist Jean-Marie Montas. The army and police made little
 attempt to identify the perpetrators, who were widely believed
 to be former soldiers or rightwing extremists. On July 2
 Mariano Delauney, director of a primary school and a witness
 to the St. Jean Bosco massacre of 1988, was killed by a man
 that eyewitnesses identified as an army sergeant. Reacting to
 a March 8 protest demonstration in front of the National
 Palace, several Presidential Guardsmen emerged from the palace
 and fired at the crowd killing two. Soldiers in Petit Goave
 on March 5 fired their weapons to disperse a crowd protesting
 the Avril regime, killing 11-year-old Roseline Vaval. In
 mid-1990, several military officers, including a colonel of
 the Presidential Guard, were killed by unknown assailants,
 possibly for political motives.
 Soldiers and rural Section Chiefs committed a number of
 extrajudicial killings of criminal suspects. On August 3 an
 accused thief, Meus Laroche, was arrested and tortured at army
 headquarters in Cap Haitien; he died in the Cap prison 9 days
 later. Section Chiefs and soldiers also committed murders for
 private reasons or on behalf of wealthy patrons, particularly
 rural landowners. During 1990 there were no known cases of
 disciplinary action taken against police or military personnel
 involved in extrajudicial killings.
 Many Haitians criticized the Government for failing to control
 a growing crime problem in Port-au-Prince, which often
 involved murders and robberies. There was a widespread belief
 that military and rightwing elements were sponsoring some
 criminal gangs to create a climate of fear and destabilize the
 electoral process. Despite charges of its own complicity, the
 army launched an aggressive and visible campaign to control
 the problem of lawlessness. There were credible reports that
 the army tortured and executed some professional killers and
 thieves known as "zenglados" during this campaign.
 "Popular justice" continued during 1990. Crowds summarily put
 to death a number of persons suspected of having committed
 crimes. During the course of a demonstration in Cabaret on
 April 19, a crowd stoned and then burned alive a soldier
 reviled for past brutality. On May 31, peasants in the
 Artibonite village of Perodin dismembered the abusive local
 Section Chief, Sylien Telo, after he and his deputies killed
 several villagers. Angry crowds killed suspected thieves in a
 number of cases during the year.
 Neither the Avril nor the Trouillot Government made any effort
 to arrest or prosecute perpetrators of the political violence
 of recent years, such as the 1987 assassinations of
 presidential candidates Yves Volel and Louis Athis, the
 election-day massacre on November 29, 1987, and the attack on
 the Saint Jean Bosco church in September 1988. The Trouillot
 
 
 HAITI
 Government in October issued a decree authorizing the creation
 of a commission of inquiry into these and other acts of
 political violence, but the composition and enforcement powers
 of the commission were left vague. At year's end, the
 commission still had not been formed.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no credible reports of politically motivated
 disappearances or clandestine abductions of persons by
 security forces in 1990.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture, beatings, and other cruel treatment of detainees
 remained common in Haiti despite a constitutional prohibition
 against the use of physical brutality by law enforcement
 personnel. In an outrageous incident on January 20, following
 Avril's declaration of a state of siege, elements of the
 Presidential Guard arrested, humiliated, and tortured several
 -prominent political figures in the courtyard of the National
 Palace. In April Elie Garsonville, mayor of Vallieres, was
 arrested, jailed, and beaten by soldiers for having- ordered an
 inquiry into military violence, according to the
 Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) report on
 Haiti. There were many credible reports from human rights
 monitors of police interrogations in which detainees were tied
 and beaten in- a "djak" position (feet and hands bound together
 around a stick).
 Weak admonitions by the Government and army command against
 such abusive behavior are almost never followed up with
 investigations or disciplinary measures against those
 soldiers, police, and Section Chiefs who continue to abuse
 detainees. After the Provisional Government took office in
 March, the army command dismissed the head of the traffic
 police, Major Isidore Pongnon, and a number of Presidential
 Guardsmen who had been implicated in beatings and other abuses
 under the Avril regime. Political leaders and human rights
 advocates argued that these persons should have been subjected
 to military court-martial rather than simply dismissed. The
 army does little to prevent or investigate human rights
 violations by rightwing elements such as ex-Duvalierists or
 Ton Ton Macoutes.
 Conditions in Haitian prisons and police detention centers
 remained abysmal. Prisoners suffer from beatings,
 overcrowding, a lack of hygienic facilities, inadequate food
 and health care, and other inhumane conditions. Standard
 practice at most provincial detention centers, generally
 located in military garrisons, is for detainees to be
 responsible for their own nourishment through friends or
 family outside the facility. Soldiers serving as guards in
 Haitian prisons routinely extort money from detainees in
 return for basic services. A Physicians' Committee for Human
 Rights report found that Haitian doctors are sometimes
 persecuted by the authorities for treating prisoners. The
 army currently operates the penitentiary system, although both
 the Avril and Trouillot Governments announced an eventual
 transfer of prisons to civilian authority, as mandated by the
 Constitution. However, by year's end no progress had been
 made in transferring prisons to civilian authority.
 
 
 658
 HAITI
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arbitrary arrest and illegal detention by the army and the
 police remain the most pervasive human rights violations in
 Haiti. Legally, a person may be arrested only if apprehended
 while committing a crime or if a judicial warrant has been
 issued based on evidence justifying the arrest. In practice,
 few of the many arrests that occurred in 1990 were in
 conformity with the law. Only a handful of those arrested
 were caught in the act of committing a crime, and the army and
 police rarely bothered to obtain a judicial arrest warrant.
 Moreover, in several well-publicized cases, the army refused
 to carry out arrest warrants issued by the state prosecutor,
 as in the cases of former Interior Minister Roger Lafontant
 and several ex-Presidential Guardsmen accused of beating
 prisoners.
 Numerous arbitrary arrests were carried out by Section Chiefs
 or rural soldiers who became involved in personal quarrels, or
 in land disputes-in which they sometimes served as hired
 gunmen for local landowners. There were also a few cases of
 illegal arrests which appeared to be directed against persons
 accused by local authorities of "communist" or "disruptive"
 activities.
 The frequently prolonged detention of arrestees by the army
 and police, often exacerbated by a corrupt or nonexistent
 judicial system, violates the Constitution, which requires
 that a detainee be brought before a judge within 48 hours of
 arrest to determine the legality of continued detention. If
 the judge determines that a legal basis exists for the arrest,
 the person may be held for further legal processing; otherwise
 the detainee must be released. In practice, most detainees
 are held for periods well in excess of 48 hours before being
 brought before a judge, and some detainees are never given the
 opportunity to challenge the legality of their imprisonment.
 There is no legal procedure for posting bail in Haiti. In
 those rare cases where a detainee is actually brought before a
 judge and legally charged with a crime, the judge may and
 sometimes does grant provisional liberty. In most cases,
 however, the release of a detainee comes about after the
 latter pays a ransom to the jailor-a frequent practice among
 some rural Section Chiefs and provincial army outposts known
 as "buying one's backside".
 The Constitution prohibits deportation or forced exile of
 Haitian citizens. Nonetheless, the Avril government in
 January briefly suspended the applicable articles of the
 Constitution and deported several prominent opponents,
 including Louis Roy, Hubert Deronceray, and Max Bourjolly.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution establishes an independent judiciary and
 provides for the right to a fair public trial. Both
 arraignments and trials are held in public and sometimes
 receive extensive media coverage. By law, defendants have the
 right to be represented by and meet with an attorney before
 trial, although the absence of a public defender often
 deprives suspects of this right. In practice, chronic
 weaknesses in the Haitian judicial system, compounded by
 interference and intimidation from the executive branch or, as
 is more often the case, the army, frequently denies the right
 to a fair trial. Many cases never reach the trial stage, and
 those that do go to trial are often unfair because of corrupt
 
 
 659
 HAITI
 or incompetent judges or outside pressures that predetermine
 the verdict. Lengthy delays further limit the accused
 person's exercise of the right to a fair trial. The
 Government acknowledges that prisons have long held and
 continue to hold numerous detainees who were never publicly
 tried or convicted of any crime.
 At the end of 1990, there were no political prisoners held by
 the Haitian Government.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 During 1%90 police and Section Chiefs continued to enter
 private homes without the required judicial warrant in search
 of suspects or illegal arms. The Government took no action to
 curtail such illegal searches or to punish those responsible.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of expression for all citizens is provided for by the
 Constitution. There are several privately owned newspapers
 and numerous radio stations, including influential stations
 owned and operated by the Protestant and Catholic churches. A
 privately owned cable television system also operates
 independently. The Government publishes a newspaper and
 operates a national radio and television station.
 Privately owned print and broadcast media in 1990 often
 expressed editorial views critical of the Government and
 freely reported the activities and declarations of government
 opponents. The Avril regime briefly imposed censorship of the
 media during a 2-week state of siege in early 1990. Several
 incidents of serious harassment of journalists took place
 during the same period, including the murder of popular radio
 announcer Jean-Wilfrid Destin by unidentified assailants. The
 Trouillot Government demonstrated greater respect for freedom
 of expression and generally placed no restrictions on the
 media, although a newspaper editor was briefly jailed after
 printing scurrilous personal accusations against Trouillot.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the freedom of peaceful assembly
 and association. Numerous political, human rights, and
 socioprofessional organizations were active in Haiti ia 1990.
 Police and army units used force in an attempt to suppress
 several demonstrations in February and early March. At least
 two demonstrators were killed when Presidential Guardsmen
 opened fire on a rally in front of the National Palace on
 March 8, and an 11-year-old girl died during soldiers'
 attempts to disperse a demonstration in Petit Goave on March 5
 (see Section l.a.).
 The right to freedom of assembly was restored when the
 civilian Provisional Government assumed power on March 13.
 Demonstrations require permits, which the army generally
 granted. Police protected a pro-Constitution demonstration on
 March 29, and numerous political rallies took place unhindered
 and with police protection during the preelection period.
 However, some rural military officials and Section Chiefs
 continued their attempts, often by the tactics of arbitrary
 
 
 660
 HAITI
 arrests and beatings, to prevent opposition political groups
 from organizing and demonstrating.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Religion is an integral part of Haitian life and culture and
 is practiced widely without interference from the Government.
 Roman Catholicism is embraced in varying degrees by about 75
 percent of the population. Voodoo, a mixture of African
 animism and Christianity, is also practiced by a majority of
 Haitians. Various Protestant denominations and foreign
 missionary groups openly proselytize in Haiti. There are no
 government restrictions on missionary activities, affiliations
 with overseas coreligionists, or religious instruction and
 publishing.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Although the Government does not normally restrict domestic
 travel of citizens or foreigners, an irregular network of
 military checkpoints operates across Haiti. On occasion,
 roadblocks are established, generally to check for possession
 of weapons or for vehicle and driver documentation.
 Foreigners and interurban travelers infrequently are asked to
 register when entering certain towns. There are no
 restrictions on persons changing their residences or places of
 employment. Every Haitian citizen is eligible for a passport,
 and travel documents are neither issued nor denied on the
 basis of political considerations.
 Migrants continue to leave Haiti bound for destinations in
 more prosperous areas of the Caribbean or the United States.
 Pursuant to a 1981 agreement with the Government of Haiti on
 the interdiction of undocumented migrants, 1,001 would-be
 illegal migrants to the United States were repatriated to
 Haiti from international waters by the U.S. Coast Guard in
 1990 (as of November 7). U.S..Immigration and Naturalization
 Service officers on board the Coast Guard vessels interviewed
 those interdicted to determine if any were potential
 applicants for political asylum. The overwhelming majority
 expressed only economic reasons for seeking to leave Haiti.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Constitution provides for the right of citizens to change
 their government through elections. After nearly 30 years of
 dictatorship and 4 years of military or military-backed
 governments that effectively suppressed the exercise of this
 right, the Trouillot Government oversaw preparations for free
 elections which took place in December 1990. The President
 established an independent Provisional Electoral Council
 (CEP) in accordance with the Constitution and collaborated
 closely with it, unlike previous regimes that had created
 CEP's but worked to undermine them. Trouillot also formally
 requested that international observers be sent by the United
 Nations and the Organization of American States, and provided
 adequate funding for electoral operations. The Haitian army
 made a visible effort to provide security for the electoral
 process.
 According to the 1987 Constitution, all male and female
 citizens 18 years of age or older have the right to vote.
 Voting is not mandatory but is noted in the Constitution as a
 
 
 661
 HAITI
 citizen's duty. A secret ballot is not explicitly provided
 for. The Constitution provides for a 5-year presidential term
 as well as checks and balances between the executive,
 legislative, and judicial branches of government.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Several local human rights groups operated in Haiti in 1990.
 They monitored violations of human rights, provided legal
 assistance to victims, and held seminars to educate the
 population on human rights. Two Haitian human rights
 organizations freely published and openly distributed monthly
 newsletters detailing human rights violations.
 In 1990 the Avril and Trouillot Governments generally did not
 restrict the activities of local human rights groups, although
 there were a few exceptions. Orr January 20 armed men
 identifying themselves as members of the Presidential Guard
 broke into the Ecumenical Human Rights Center in
 Port-au-Prince, vandalized the premises, and arrested and beat
 one member of -the group.
 During 1990, Haiti received visits from a U.N. Special
 Rapporteur on Human Rights, the IACHR, a representative of the
 International Committee of the Red Cross, and delegations from
 a number of nongovernmental human rights groups. They met
 with government officials and a wide variety of private groups
 and individuals without interference and were permitted to
 visit prison facilities.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion
 Language, or Social Status
 Some 95 percent of Haitians are descendants of African slaves
 who gained their independence from France through a revolution
 in 1804. Most of the rest are mulatto or of European or
 Middle Eastern descent. Under Haitian law, no distinctions
 are made with regard to race. Nonetheless, there are
 longstanding social, economic, and political tensions between
 blacks and mulattos which date back to Haiti's revolutionary
 period, and may result in some discrimination in the areas of
 jobs and education.
 Haiti has two official languages, French and Creole; virtually
 all Haitians speak Creole. Approximately 20 percent of the
 population, mostly members of the educated class, speak
 French. There is no official discrimination on the basis of
 language, but some social class divisions are drawn along
 linguistic lines. In many areas, upward economic mobility
 depends on an ability to speak and read French.
 There is no legal discrimination against women; they enjoy
 equal legal rights in education, property, and voting.
 Educated women are free to pursue careers of their choosing,
 and there are prominent women in many fields, including
 medicine, law, and journalism. Women dominate the
 secretarial, nursing, and teaching professions. However, in
 some social strata in Haiti their role has been limited by
 tradition. Peasant women remain largely in the traditional
 occupations such as farming, marketing, and domestic tasks.
 Violence against women occurs with some frequency, although a
 lack of statistical data makes it impossible to determine its
 
 
 662
 HAITI
 true extent. Such abuse is not sanctioned by the Government.
 Haitian law does not differentiate between domestic violence
 and general assault. Due to societal traditions, victims of
 domestic violence such as wife beating often are unwilling to
 press charges, thus leading to the likelihood that this abuse
 is significantly underreported.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution provides workers, including civil servants
 and public sector employees, the right to form unions.
 Workers do not need government authorization to establish and
 join trade unions. A union, which must have a minimum of 10
 members, is required to register with the Ministry of Social
 Affairs within 60 days of its establishment. Unions are free,
 legally, to organize. However, in practice, attempts to form
 trade unions are often frustrated by employers who prefer not
 having to deal with unions, and only about 10,000 full-time
 workers are estimated to be organized.
 Haitian labor unions remain weak; forbidden under the
 Duvaliers until 1981, they were then allowed to operate only
 within strictly circumscribed limits. It was not until after
 Jean-Claude Duvalier's departure in February 1986 that unions
 were allowed to organize freely.
 There are four major labor federations in Haiti: the
 Autonomous Central of Haitian Workers (CATH), the Federation
 of Unionized Workers (FOS), the Confederation of Haitian
 Workers (CTH), and the Independent General Organization of
 Haitian Workers. All have contact with international labor
 organizations. For example, the FOS is affiliated with the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and its Latin
 American group, the Inter-American Regional Organization of
 Workers; the CTH with the World Confederation of Labor. The
 federations depend largely on outside sources for their
 financial support. No Haitian unions are known to subsist
 solely on dues paid by their members.
 Tripartite (labor, management, and government) negotiations
 for revisions to the labor code began in 1986 and have yet to
 be concluded. Chapter VI of the existing code recognizes the
 right to strike, although it restricts the duration of certain
 types of strikes. A 1988 decree defines under what
 circumstances a strike is legal. Strikes are not uncommon,
 but their legality is usually contested by the employer.
 There were several strikes in the public sector in 1990
 including strikes at the port, telephone company, electricity
 company and Port-au-Prince City Hall. The legality of these
 strikes was not challenged; all were eventually settled
 without violence or police interference.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right of association is guaranteed by the labor code.
 Organizing activities are protected, and fines are provided
 for those who interfere with this right. In practice,
 however, the law has not been effectively enforced, and
 employers regularly violate its provisions. Informal,
 unofficial, mostly unwritten agreements, and in some cases,
 tacit acceptance, allow the presence of unions in plants.
 Although unions have become relatively more active in
 grievance negotiations, formal management recognition of
 
 
 HAITI
 unions as bargaining agents is not yet the norm. Even with no
 government interference, the relatively new phenomenon of
 trade unionism has developed erratically in Haiti, where
 unemployment is estimated to affect 50 percent or more of the
 available work force, and where many employers still question
 the legitimacy of unions. The court system, which offers the
 only avenue for workers to pursue claims of antiunion
 discrimination, has been notoriously slow and unreliable.
 However, in 1990 there was some improvement as a number of
 such cases were decided by the Labor Court.
 Haiti has no export processing zones, although it does offer
 tax incentives to firms, mostly assembly industries,
 manufacturing for export. The national labor legislation
 applies to all export-oriented firms. Few of the
 approximately 40,000 export industry workers are organized,
 but outside observers judge that their working conditions
 generally exceed the average for the wage economy.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The labor code prohibits forced or compulsory labor.
 A report by a major international human rights organization in
 1990 drew attention to the common practice of forced domestic
 labor of children in Haiti, which persists despite the labor
 code's prohibition against employing children as domestic
 servants. This practice, known as "restavek", involves
 thousands of young children from rural families who are
 "adopted" by more affluent urban households to serve as unpaid
 domestic laborers. These children are generally compelled to
 work long hours, receiving poor nourishment and little or no
 education. They are often cut off completely from their
 families. The report notes that many employers of "restavek"
 children beat and sexually abuse them. Referring to this
 practice, the ILO's Committee on the Application of Standards
 in its 1990 report on Haiti noted that the existing provisions
 against child labor were not adequately enforced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for factory employment is 12 years. Fierce
 adult competition for jobs ensures that child labor is not a
 factor in the industrial sector. In both rural and urban
 areas children often work at odd jobs to help supplement the
 family income. Many of the children who are victims of
 "restavek" (see Section 6.c.) are under 12 years old.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The labor code governs individual employment contracts,
 protects apprentices and women, and establishes minimum health
 and safety standards, particularly for hazardous occupations.
 The code sets the normal workday at 8 hours, and the workweek
 at 48 hours, with 24 hours of rest on Sunday. The code
 provides for paid annual leave of at least 15 consecutive
 working days. Workers may take up to 15 days of annual sick
 leave. The current daily minimum wage prescribed by law is
 $3.00 in Port-au-Prince and $2.64 in the rest of the country.
 The majority of the Haitian population subsists on much less
 than the minimum wage.
 
 
 664
 HAITI
 The Government has not systematically enforced labor laws
 regarding wages and minimum health and safety regulations.
 The industrial sector, which is concentrated more heavily in
 the Port-au-Prince area and is more accessible to outside
 scrutiny, appears to adhere generally to at least some minimum
 standards. Since October 1989, in order to increase the
 frequency and regularity of workplace inspections, the number
 of inspectors from the Labor Office of the Ministry for Social
 Affairs has increased, new vehicles have been put at their
 disposal and salaries have been improved.
