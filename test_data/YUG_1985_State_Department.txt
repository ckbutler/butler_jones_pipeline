 YUGOSLAVIA
 The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is a
 multinational, federal state comprising six republics, one of
 which has two autonomous provinces. The League of Communists
 of Yugoslavia (Communist Party) maintains a monopoly on
 political power. The ideology of Yugoslav communism and
 Socialist self-management differs substantially from the
 highly centralized and rigid Soviet model of Communist rule.
 The form of Marxism-Leninism that Yugoslavia professes is
 increasingly pragmatic, providing opportunities for open
 discussion and flexible decisions. In the Yugoslav political
 system, the party is decentralized so that the republic and
 provincial party authorities wield power that is seldom
 challenged by the central party bureaucracy. In the economic
 system, Socialist self-management theoretically and legally
 provides that the workers run their own enterprises.
 Extensive, private, small-scale farming is permitted, as are
 some private enterprises in services and small-scale
 manufacturing.
 State security and uniformed police are under the jurisdiction
 of Federal and Republic secretariats for internal affairs.
 Security and police forces are generally subject to, and
 heedful of, overall direction from the political level,
 although significant abuses have been alleged.
 Struggling through the very severe winter of 1984-85 and a
 drought in the summer of 1985, the Yugoslav economy was unable
 to deal effectively with its long-term problems of high
 unemployment, a large foreign debt, and persistent and rising
 inflation. Slowness in reaching agreement on reform measures
 to implement the stabilization program was partially to blame.
 Although the fundamental tenets of Socialist sdlf-management
 and the federal structure of the State are among the declining
 number of taboos which cannot be questioned, there is
 relatively open debate within and outside the League of
 Communists on the implementation of these concepts. Key
 topics frequently discussed in the open include the boundaries
 of permissible political and cultural expression, economic
 reform, and the functioning of the political system. Some
 issues, however, such as the rights of and the relations among
 ethnic groups, appear to be so sensitive that free speech is
 not tolerated. The multiethnic composition of the population
 and the tragic internecine strife between Croats and Serbs
 during World War II have made Yugoslav leaders wary of
 separatist sentiment. Various Yugoslav governments have taken
 stern measures to repress displays of "nationalism."
 The human rights situation in Yugoslavia improved marginally
 during the year but was still marred by several negative
 developments. The major political trial of the so-called
 "Belgrade Six," which concluded in February 1985, resulted in
 the effective release of three of six defendants and in light
 sentences for the three defendants who were convicted.
 Appeals courts further reduced these sentences and freed
 another of the accused entirely. Arrests and convictions for
 what in Yugoslavia are called "verbal crimes" continued at a
 lower but still significant level in comparison to 1984, most
 often on charges involving "nationalism."
 Continuing Serb-Albanian antagonism in south Serbia and the
 autonomous province of Kosovo produced a number of violent
 incidents, and a small but steady stream of Albanian
 
 
 1151
 YUGOSLAVIA
 'nationalists" and irridentists were jailed on a variety of
 charges. Nationalist incidents in other parts of the country
 also caused concern for authorities.
 In 1985, political and economic issues were debated more
 openly in the press and public. The Serbian Orthodox Church
 was permitted to resume construction of a major cathedral in
 Belgrade. Debate also continued on change in the political
 system, such as multiple candidates for political office, and
 on reform of the criminal justice system to eliminate some
 categories of political offenses.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no instances in Yugoslavia during 1985 of alleged
 killing by government forces. In the autonomous province of
 Kosovo, an ethnic Albanian policeman was killed by an ethnic
 Albanian teenager, who some said had been recruited to do so
 by an Albanian nationalist organization
 In the past, Serb-Albanian ethnic tensions in the Kosovo have
 resulted in violence and sometimes fatalities. Attacks by
 members of one nationality on another continued at a low but
 steady level in 1985, but no deaths were reported.
 b. Disappearance
 No instances of prolonged or permanent disappearance of
 persons inside Yugoslavia were reported in 1985.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Although both Yugoslav law and the Constitution forbid
 torture, various sources report that people have been beaten,
 maltreated, or threatened during pretrial detention or while
 serving sentences. A number of witnesses at the "Belgrade
 Six" trial charged police with using threats, physical
 intimidation, and beatings to obtain testimony. Sarajevo
 sociology professor Vojislav Seselj, serving a sentence for
 hostile propaganda, was reportedly beaten by his jailers.
 "Belgrade Six" defense attorney Vladimir Seks charged Yugoslav
 prison authorities with widespread abuse of prisoners' rights
 and dignity through beatings and other degrading and cruel
 practices. Some ethnic Albanian prisoners from Kosovo
 complained of physical and mental abuse by authorities during
 pretrial detention and while serving their sentences.
 The Yugoslav press has reported instances of police misconduct
 for which police officials have been reprimanded, suspended,
 and subjected to criminal prosecution on charges of excessive
 use of force and abuse of citizens' rights. One case of
 alleged police misconduct in 1985 was the manhandling of
 London Observer and Daily Mail correspondent Peter
 Hadzi-Ristic by police in Mostar incidental to his arrest on
 charges of making hostile statements. No charges were brought
 against the police.

 YUGOSLAVIA
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, and Exile
 "Political crime", as defined by the Yugoslav Criminal Code,
 consists of attempts to overthrow the constitutional order or
 to undermine the country's territorial integrity, unity, or
 basic constitutional system. "Political crime" includes a
 number of broad, imprecise categories, such as
 "counterrevolutionary acts," "association (for the purpose of)
 hostile activity", "insulting the reputation of the President
 of the Republic," "fostering national hatred," and "hostile
 propaganda." Enforcement of these laws varies widely from
 republic to republic, with the result that people have been
 jailed in some parts of Yugoslavia for acts which in other
 parts of the country rarely, if ever, result in criminal
 sanctions. Authorities remain particularly sensitive to
 manifestations of nationalism and to contacts with a range of
 emigre groups considered subversive.
 Pretrial confinement in political cases does not usually
 occur, and the system of bail used for other criminal offenses
 remains applicable.
 Yugoslav legal procedures derive from Napoleonic law and are
 generally followed in all, including political, cases.
 Arrests are conducted pursuant to warrants, defendants are
 brought before a judge within 24 hours of arrest, individuals
 arrested for political reasons are usually charged with the
 specific sections of the Criminal Code dealing with political
 crimes, and defendants have the right to independent counsel.
 The Criminal Code allows the arrest and imprisonment of
 Yugoslav citizens for acts considered political offenses under
 Yugoslav law, even though they were committed abroad and were
 not crimes in the country in which they took place. Such
 cases are often based on the expression of views hostile to
 the Yugoslav regime or association with anti-Yugoslav groups.
 In 1985 such instances involved Yugoslav dual nationals or
 guest workers resident in the Federal Republic of Germany,
 Austria, and Switzerland.
 There is no information to indicate that forced labor is
 practiced in Yugoslavia.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Although ordinary criminal trials are almost always open to
 the public, not all political trials are. Yugoslav political
 authorities usually do not actively interfere in judicial
 proceedings concerning political cases. However, substantial
 evidence exists that in some cases Federal, Republic, and
 provincial political authorities have sought to orchestrate
 the trials of those charged with political crimes. Some human
 rights organizations believe that the outcome in political
 cases in Yugoslavia is predetermined. Others, including some
 critics of the Government, hold that the courts have
 considerable independence, particularly in determining the
 length and type of sentences, if not innocence or guilt.
 Developments in 1985 evinced considerable evidence of
 appellate court independence. In several important political
 cases, appellate courts either altered the charges or reduced
 sentences, particularly in the cases of Vojislav Seselj and
 the "Belgrade Six." In these cases, appellate courts threw
 
 
 1153
 YUGOSLAVIA
 out convictions on two charges by lower courts, in one case
 freeing the defendant entirely.
 Although many persons accused of political offenses are able
 to find able, energetic counsel, there are cases in which
 government authorities seek to intimidate or chastise
 attorneys who take political cases. Several of the defense
 counsel for the "Belgrade Six" have suffered reprisals from
 the authorities. For example, although Vladimir Seks was
 convicted in 1981 for "hostile propaganda", government
 determination that he serve his sentence in 1985 probably
 stemmed from his active participation in the defense at the
 Belgrade trial.
 The precise number of current political prisoners is very
 difficult to determine. Official figures are hard to obtain
 and frequently contradictory. According to last July's report
 by the public prosecutor covering calendar year 1984, the
 authorities brought charges against 466 persons in political
 cases, a decrease from 1983. Only in Kosovo did the number of
 political cases rise--by some 39 percent; 275 persons, or 59
 percent of the total accused of political crimes were of
 Albanian nationality. Nearly two-thirds of the political
 cases were so-called "verbal crimes", that is, charges arising
 from something the accused said or wrote.
 The Yugoslav Federal Secretariat for Internal Affairs (i.e.
 the security and police apparatus) reported that in 1984
 police brought 809 criminal (i.e. felony) complaints and 4,268
 misdemeanor charges against persons accused of "acting in a
 hostile fashion," including those accused of espionage or
 terrorism. Figures for 1985 are not yet available, but the
 trends show a drop in political cases in Slovenia and Serbia
 proper, and a slight rise in political crimes, particularly
 nationalist activity, in Kosovo and parts of Dalmatia
 (Croatia) and Bosnia-Hercegovina.
 At present, there may be some 450 to 500 political prisoners
 in Kosovo. Countrywide, the number of political prisoners may
 be between 600 and 1,000.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Yugoslav authorities are widely believed to interfere in the
 private lives of citizens. Allegations of such interference
 are most common from those citizens actively engaged in
 nonofficial political activity. Although the judicial system
 provides elaborate safeguards concerning procedures for
 conducting searches, these safeguards are sometimes abused.
 The most widely publicized charges of illegal searches during
 1985 were made by defendants and lawyers at the "Belgrade Six"
 trial. Many Yugoslavs also believe that authorities eavesdrop
 on conversations, read mail, and tap telephones.
 Yugoslav citizens are generally free to receive and read
 foreign publications. Infrequently, the import or sale of a
 particular issue of a foreign publication will be banned,
 usually because the issue contains a story which the
 authorities believe presents false or hostile information
 about Yugoslavia. The publications of certain Yugoslav emigre
 groups are considered hostile in themselves, and their
 importation, possession, or sale is frequently subject to
 criminal charges.
 
 
 1154
 YUGOSLAVIA
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 During 1985 Yugoslavia continued its slow and at times
 halting, but generally acknowledged, movement toward greater
 openness and freedom of speech and press. In theory, both the
 Yugoslav Constitution and Yugoslav law affirm these freedoms.
 The Government grants some latitude to what it considers
 non-nationalist and nonthreatening oral expressions of
 disagreement with government policy. The authorities tolerate
 considerable commentary and criticism in academic and some
 quasi-official public forums. Nonetheless, a few subjects
 remain taboo, such as changing the political status of the
 autonomous province of Kosovo and interpreting the history and
 present state of relations between Serbs and ethnic
 Albanians. Ethnic Albanian professors at Pristina University
 have been criticized in the press, and several have been
 dismissed, for alleged Albanian "nationalism" in their
 teaching and writing.
 The authorities also seek to punish allegedly derogatory or
 inflammatory ethnic statements which they consider
 incendiary. Such "hostile" oral statements and other forms of
 personal expression (e.g., painting slogans) are grounds for
 criminal prosecution. For example, "Belgrade Six" defense
 lawyer Vladimir Seks served a 7-month sentence in 1985 for
 alleged pro-Nazi statements made in an Osijek cafe in 1981.
 He allegedly complained that everything was rotten in
 Yugoslavia, insulted Tito, and suggested that Yugoslavia
 needed someone like Hitler to restore order. He was also
 disbarred for 10 years. British journalist Peter
 Hadzi-Ristic, although in the end charged only with disturbing
 the peace, was arrested and charged in August 1985 for
 "hostile statements" made to two strangers in a Mostar
 restaurant.
 In general, the autonomy of newspaper publishing houses has
 increased markedly in recent years. A new Federal press law
 was adopted in July 1985 which its authors widely touted as
 facilitating popular access to more abundant and varied
 information. Press criticism of government policies and
 proposals concerning domestic political and economic issues is
 frequent. There is also ample criticism of the Federal �
 Cabinet and of the League of Communists at all levels, but
 criticism of the state Presidency is rarer.
 However, both Yugoslav law and practice impose some
 restrictions on freedom of the press and freedom to publish.
 Public prosecutors have the authority to ban the publication
 and sale of books or periodicals if their content is deemed
 "hostile." Yugoslav authorities claim that this power is
 rarely used and that only seven books were banned in
 Yugoslavia during 1984. However, this figure can be
 misleading, as some publications have been restrained or
 discouraged without resort to formal legal procedures. For
 example, in early 1985 two Belgrade publishing houses dropped
 plans to issue collections of the work of Slobodan Jovanovic,
 historian and minister in the pre-World War II Yugoslav
 Government, after both government and party officials
 denounced the proposed publications. Banning of books is
 often a local option, and standards of what is unacceptable
 vary widely throughout Yugoslavia. For example, the popular
 
 
 1155
 YUGOSLAVIA
 novel "Noz" (the knife) by Vuk Draskovic remains banned in
 Sarajevo, Bosnia-Hercegovina, but is freely sold in Serbia.
 Although there is no prepublication censorship of the print
 and broadcast media, the authorities exercise indirect
 oversight through publication boards, and the editorial staff
 relies on self-censorship. Nevertheless, journalists and
 writers have tried to breach previous limits with mixed
 results. For example, a new, irreverent and iconoclastic
 magazine, Dinar, failed after only one issue in April 1985
 because of a barrage of political criticism. In October 1985,
 Knizevne Novine, the organ of the Serbian Writers Union, was
 criticized by the Belgrade party organization 'for publishing
 materials which allegedly undermined the basic values of the
 Yugoslav system. The editors of the publication responded
 that its critics were falsifying the charges and were guilty
 of predictable repressiveness.
 Similarly in book-publishing, the authorities generally
 provide only loose political oversight. Police and
 prosecutors intervene rarely. Although works by some authors,
 such as Milovan Djilas, have long been banned, many publishers
 and writers have been testing the limits of the permissible, a
 process which has resulted in occasional clashes with the
 authorities. The works of Soviet and other Eastern European
 dissidents are published in large press runs and sold widely.
 The Polish Nobel Prize winner Czeslaw Milosz was feted by the
 Yugoslav Union of Writers when he visited Belgrade in mid-1985
 to promote a new edition of his works. In early 1985 the
 publication of Serbian writer Dobrica Cosic's novel, "The
 Sinner", became an issue because of its allegedly unfavorable
 treatment of the Communist Party between the two world wars.
 Although senior politicians attacked the book sharply, Cosic
 suffered no reprisals. In late 1985 the publication, with a
 government subsidy, of Veselin Djuretic's "The Allies and the
 Yugoslav Wartime Drama", a revisionist history of World War II
 in Yugoslavia, aroused controversy. Diuretic was accused of
 rehabilitating the Cetniks, Serbian national opponents of
 Tito's partisans during the war. Despite the furor caused by
 the book, Djuretic has thus far suffered only minor reprisals
 (loss of party membership), and his work remains in
 circulation.
 During 1985 there continued to be considerable discussion in
 the Yugoslav press and public over the desirability of
 reforming the Criminal Code to eliminate so-called verbal
 crimes. Despite their discussion, it appears that such reform
 will not occur soon.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public political demonstrations are permitted only by official
 organizations and generally only in support of government
 policies. Others are usually suppressed. Public gatherings
 and meetings of private organizations are permitted but must
 be registered with the authorities. Regular meetings of the
 Serbian Philosophical Society, which has been critical of the
 authorities' handling of domestic dissent and other domestic
 policies, continued to be tolerated in 1985. When police
 interrupted a meeting of the Serbian Writers' Union in early
 1985 in which government policies had been harshly criticized,
 there was widespread press support for the Union's protest,
 and local police later admitted an error. In May 1985,
 Slovene authorities tolerated a brief march in Ljubljana
 
 
 1156
 YUGOSLAVIA
 protesting the Government's military parade in honor of V-E
 Day.
 The future of private gatherings remains problematical. The
 acquittal of some, and light sentences for others, of the
 "Belgrade Six" left the status of Belgrade's so-called "Open
 University" up in the air, but the gatherings reportedly have
 continued. Intellectuals critical of the Government have
 expressed confidence that it will not soon again attempt to
 disrupt or raid peaceful gatherings in private homes.
 However, authorities have taken other steps to harass critical
 intellectuals or so-called "dissidents", such as police
 questioning of colleagues and supervisors at their workplaces.
 Trade unions are organized geographically by republic and
 province, and-by trade within these boundaries. They are,
 however, no longer simply "transmission belts" of party
 authority and control. Under Yugoslavia's system of
 self-management, unions play a significant role in
 representing workers' interests in the management of
 enterprises, including the distribution and levels of income,
 the determination of working conditions, and the settlement of
 disputes. Union leaders play a significant role in the
 political system in advocacy of worker interests on such
 matters as the impact of inflation, standard of living, and
 wage policies.
 Strikes, often referred to as "work stoppages," are neither
 explicitly legal nor illegal. They occur with increasing
 frequency, usually for local reasons. Most strikes involve
 either the amount or distribution of personal incomes within
 the work force of a particular enterprise. They usually are
 settled quickly, after consultation between the workers or
 their representatives in the larger enterprises and the
 management
 In 1985 the number of strikes in Yugoslavia almost doubled (to
 about 600) and involved one-third more workers. The
 authorities were especially concerned that strikes at several
 large enterprises would result in greater economic hardship, a
 continuing fall in the standard of living, and more extensive
 labor unrest.
 The Confederation of Trade Unions of Yugoslavia is a member of
 the International Labor Organization (ILO). In early 1985 the
 ILO released a report, resulting from a 1983 visit to
 Yugoslavia, on the status of labor and trade unions in
 -Yugoslavia with the major focus being on the implementation of
 the self-management principle. The Yugoslavs accepted the
 study with few reservations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.
 Yugoslavia is a multireligious state. Most Yugoslav believers
 are members of the Roman Catholic Church, of the Serbian or
 Macedonian Orthodox Churches, or of the Islamic faith. Since
 World War II, the religiously observant Jewish community has
 numbered only several thousand persons. There is no official
 or favored religion; the Government officially encourages
 atheism. Freedom to practice religion is guaranteed under
 Yugoslav law, but proselytizing is outlawed. Religious
 communities have their own publications sold by subscription
 or at churches, although not at public kiosks. Their contacts
 with coreligionists abroad are not restricted.
 
 
 1157
 YUGOSLAVIA
 The building of new churches and mosques requires government
 permission. Muslims have succeeded in erecting or renovating
 many mosques in Bosnia and have recently obtained permission
 to construct a large new mosque in Zagreb. In Belgrade, the
 Serbian Orthodox church in 1985 received authorization after
 40 years to recommence construction of St. Sava Cathedral,
 originally begun before World War II. The rededication of the
 site of the cathedral was marked in May 1985 with a gathering
 of at least 10,000 church officials, believers, government
 representatives, and curious onlookers. The Government
 allowed several other religious gatherings of equal size in
 various parts of Yugoslavia during 1985, including a major
 Roman Catholic gathering in Djakovo at which Cardinal Casaroli
 of the Holy See spoke before an assemblage of European
 Cardinals, Yugoslav Government officials, and thousands of
 ordinary believers. Authorities also continued to tolerate
 large-scale pilgrimages by domestic and foreign Catholics to
 Medjugorje, a small village in Bosnia-Hercegovina where the
 Virgin Mary is said to have appeared before several children.
 There is some discrimination against religious believers of
 all faiths; for example, a party member who has his children
 baptized risks expulsion from the party. Some party officials
 have criticized this punishment. Constraints on occasional
 attendance at services and religious instruction of children
 vary from region to region. All three major faiths make
 vigorous efforts to provide religious instruction to youth.
 Conflicts between the State and Yugoslav religious communities
 develop when the latter attempt to engage in what the
 authorities consider "nationalist" or political activities.
 The authorities regard ties between Yugoslav Muslims and
 Islamic fundamentalist groups with suspicion. They regularly
 criticise Catholic Church organizations in Yugoslavia for
 alleged support of Croatian nationalism and political
 activism. They have also criticized the Serbian Orthodox
 Church, less intensely, for Serbian nationalism. They
 occasionally charge individual priests and Muslim imams with
 political offenses, usually related to "nationalism."
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within the country is guaranteed by the
 Constitution and permitted in practice. However, many ethnic
 Serbs believe that the out-migration of ethnic Serbs from the
 predominantly ethnic Albanian Kosovo province is the result of
 anti-Serbian behavior on the part of ethnic Albanians
 (including personal threats or occasional violent acts, forced
 sale of property, or vandalism). This has been the subject of
 public debate among political figures.
 Almost all Yugoslavs are able to emigrate, seek temporary
 employment abroad, and visit foreign countries at will. Half
 of the country's population possesses valid passports, and no
 exit permits are required to visit the more than 135 countries
 with which Yugoslavia has diplomatic or consular relations.
 Yugoslav Jews (and many non-Jews) freely visit Israel, with
 which Yugoslavia has no diplomatic relations. Some Yugoslavs
 are denied passports either temporarily or permanently on
 national security, political, or criminal grounds. Over
 600,000 Yugoslav workers, some with family members, are
 employed as "guest workers" in Western Europe.
 
 
 1158
 YUGOSLAVIA
 The law on the entry of foreigners to Yugoslavia notes the
 right of permanent asylum and provides for government
 assistance to persons granted that right. In addition,
 Yugoslavia extends temporary asylum to refugees who, with the
 assistance of the Belgrade office of the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees, seek permanent resettlement in
 third countries. At present, there are about 1,700 refugees
 temporarily in Yugoslavia. There were no known cases of
 forcible repatriation of a refugee to his home country in 1985.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: the Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The 2-million-member League of Communists of Yugoslavia
 maintains a monopoly on political power, but that authority is
 dispersed because the party is decentralized to the level of
 the six republics and two provinces. Yugoslav politicians and
 the press regularly note that the country's eight regional
 party organizations hold widely differing views on key policy
 issues. Because of such differences, the authority of the
 party in the Yugoslav Government is not absolute.
 Governmental bodies are responsible in theory and in fact for
 administering and drawing up policies, especially economic
 policies. At the top of the government structure are the
 collective state Presidency (chief of state), the Federal
 Executive Council (Cabinet), and the Federal Assembly
 (Parliament). The Presidency is responsible for overall
 policy direction. The Cabinet is responsible for running the
 governmental machinery and proposing specific legislation.
 The Federal Assembly is responsible for enacting legislation.
 It operates sometimes by majority vote and sometimes by
 consensus among delegations representing the country's six
 republics and two autonomous provinces. The Federal Assembly
 in recent years has been quite active and contentious. It has
 several times rejected or drastically altered proposals
 endorsed by the Federal Presidency and Cabinet, and it is
 often the scene of sharp debates which are generally reported
 fully in the press and on television. Federal laws must also
 be adopted separately by Republic and Provincial Assemblies
 before they can be implemented, and thus these local
 assemblies wield considerable power, amounting at times to an
 actual veto of federal authority. In certain~cases, delegates
 to the Federal Assembly must have authorizing instructions
 from their respective Republic or Provincial Assembly before
 engaging in negotiation or compromise on federal legislative
 measures.
 Selection to party bodies is accomplished by the party bodies
 themselves. Methods range from secret ballot and majority
 vote to cooptation. In late 1985 there was considerable
 discussion in the party over the desirability of having
 multiple candidates elected by majority vote.
 Selection to government bodies occurs via a delegate system.
 Nominations originate in the various socio-political
 organizations which are parts of the mass umbrella
 organization, the Socialist Alliance of the Working People.
 This includes the trade unions, the League of Socialist Youth,
 and the Union of Veterans. On the local level, ordinary
 workers can and do play an active role'in the selection
 process. Only one candidate is usually nominated for each
 office, although as of late 1985 there had been several
 elections involving more than one candidate, particularly in
 
 
 1159
 YUGOSLAVIA
 the Republic of Croatia and the city of Zagreb. The concept
 of multiple candidates has received much public attention.
 virtually all government offices mandate a rotation of
 officials once every year or 2 years, usually with the
 possibility of extension for one additional term.
 Yugoslavia's many ethnic groups generally have equal access to
 political and government positions, especially through their
 respective republics and provinces. Various senior executive
 government and party positions rotate annually from one
 nationality to another according to a predetermined national
 "key." There are some allegations of political
 discrimination, particularly from ethnic Albanians, that Serbs
 are overrepresented in the party and government organs of the
 autonomous province of Kosovo. However, in terms of
 percentages and visibility, these allegations are not borne
 out by the situation as of late 1985. Although the current
 Federal Prime Minister is a woman, there are still allegations
 that women cannot participate fully in government and
 political life. While full and unimpeded oppoxrtunities for
 women are mandated by law, women are underrepresented at
 higher levels, reflecting longstanding social attitudes and
 customs.
 Section 4 Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigations of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is sensitive to Western charges of human rights
 violations within Yugoslavia and often attempts to dismiss
 such charges as efforts to bring pressure on Yugoslavia to
 alter its social, economic, or political system. The
 Government issues visas to representatives of international
 human rights groups, but its officials may refuse requests for
 appointments. On at least one occasion in 1985, however, the
 Prime Minister received a representative of a foreign human
 rights group to discuss the human rights situation within
 Yugoslavia. Representatives of Western human rights
 organizations and the Western press were permitted to attend
 the trial of the "Belgrade Six" through to its conclusion.
 In its 1985 Report (concerning the year 1984), Amnesty
 International was concerned about the imprisonment of over 200
 prisoners of conscience. It received allegations of
 ill-treatment during investigation from several political
 prisoners and was also concerned about ill-treatment and
 conditions in some prisons where political prisoners were
 held. It called for the release of two prisoners of
 conscience forcibly confined to psychiatric institutions.
 Freedom House rated Yugoslavia "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The population of Yugoslavia in 1985 was approximately 23.1
 million, with an annual growth rate of 0.7 percent. According
 to World Bank statistics, per capita gross national product in
 1983 was $2,570.
 In 1985 the largely decentralized Yugoslav economy performed
 less well than in 1984. Economic performance got off to a
 weak start in the early months of the year as Yugoslavia
 experienced one of the worst winters in the past 25 years.
 Performance began to improve in the second quarter, but export
 growth was less than expected, and agricultural and industrial
 
 
 1160
 YUGOSLAVIA
 output growth both lagged. A drought from July to September
 resulted in smaller crops than the record levels of 1984.
 Yugoslavia was again compelled to reschedule a portion of its
 nearly $20 billion in foreign debts, but interest payments
 were maintained without interruption.
 In an attempt to cope with its economic problems, Yugoslavia
 has maintained a domestic austerity program since 1980, and
 the Long-Term Economic Stabilization Program lasting until
 1990 was approved by the Federal Parliament in mid-1983.
 Development of reform measures has taken longer than
 originally anticipated, and inflation has continued to mount,
 reaching an all-time record in excess of 75 percent in 1985.
 Since 1980, real incomes have fallen more than 30 percent, but
 most Yugoslavs have been able to maintain their standard of
 living at higher levels than the fall in real incomes
 suggests. Official statistics indicate that overall personal
 consumption fell only 3 percent between 1979 and 1984, but
 some Yugoslav experts have indicated that the standard of
 living in 1985 had fallen back to the level of 1967.
 There is an extensive system of social and medical insurance
 for those who are old, disabled, and unemployed. The
 Government provides a network of day-care nurseries for
 working mothers. Life expectancy at birth in 1985 was 71.7
 years, and the infant mortality rate was 30.0 per 1,000 live
 births. Education is extensive, government-run, and free
 through high school. The adult literacy rate was 90.5 percent
 in 1981, with 95.9 percent of males and 85.3 percent of
 females literate. In January 1985, the Federal Committee for
 Labor, Health, and Social Affairs announced that 2.5 million
 citizens could be considered socially endangered due to low
 incomes. Of these, 1.2 million were pensioners drawing
 monthly pensions of roughly $80 or less.
 Almost 85 percent of all land is privately owned. Farmers may
 own up to 10 hectares of arable land plus additional hectares
 of mountainous terrain as pasturage. Small-scale private
 enterprise is permitted, and republican and provincial laws
 limit the number of employees in private enterprises to 5 to
 10 workers, plus family members.
 Factories in theory are owned by society as a whole and
 administered by their workers, organized in enterprise-level
 workers' councils. In practice, the influence of workers'
 councils varies, but they are actively involved in determining
 worker incomes, fringe benefits, and working conditions.
 Through their trade union organizations, workers participate
 in decisions affecting housing, transportation, continuing
 education, and other living and working conditions.
 The standard workweek is 42 hours. Common practice is to work
 five 8-hour days per week, and one Saturday per month. Most
 workers have the right to 1 month's paid vacation per year, as
 well as extensive sick leave. The minimum age for the
 employment of children is 16 years. In practice, young people
 from developed, urban areas usually wait a long time for their
 first job because the unemployment rate among young people is
 particularly high. Working conditions and safety are
 regulated by republican and provincial law.
 The Constitution guarantees the equality of citizens
 regardless of sex, and the Government has taken steps to
 improve the status of women. Maternity leave for employed

 women is very liberal and is routinely granted for periods
 between 9 and 12 months. Depending on the republic, working
 mothers are given day-care allowances based on their salaries
 and the number of children to be cared for. Also, for up to 2
 years after the birth of a child, a working mother may take
 sick leave when her child is ill.
 The role of women in Yugoslavia's work force has slowly
 improved as a result of increased education and urbanization
 in the society as a whole. According to statistics for 1984,
 37.3 percent of the Yugoslav work force was composed of women,
 as opposed to 34.5 percent in 1974. However, women still hold
 relatively low positions in their respective fields of
 employment.
 The Constitution charges government authorities at all levels
 with protection of the cultural rights of all the peoples of
 Yugoslavia. The use of the major local language is required
 in official communications between Belgrade and the various
 republics, and local languages are used in the schools,
 courts, and local media. Each citizen has the right, in
 theory and practice, to address courts and government agencies
 in his own language. Despite government efforts, some social
 discrimination continues, however, particularly against ethnic
 Albanians and Gypsies.
