 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 The Constitution provides for a popularly elected president and a bicameral con-
 gress. President Leonel Fernandez of the Dominican Liberation Party (PLD) took of-
 fice in 1996 after a free and fair election. The opposition Dominican Revolutionary
 Party (PRD), after free and fair congressional elections in May, dominates the Sen-
 ate, holding with its allies 24 of the 30 seats, and has the largest presence in the
 lower house, occupying 73 of the 149 seats. Although judicial reform efforts have
 led to a more effective judiciary, there have been attempts from other public and
 private entities, including the executive branch, to undermine judicial independence.
 The National Police (PN), the National Department of Investigations (DNI), the
 National Drug Control Directorate (DNCD), and the military (army, air force, and
 navy) form the security forces. The PN is under the Secretary of the Interior and
 Police; the military is under the Secretary of the Armed Forces; and the DNI and
 the DNCD, which have personnel from both the police and the military, report di-
 rectly to the President. The security forces generally are responsive to civilian exec-
 utive branch authority. However, some members of the security forces continue to
 commit human rights abuses, sometimes with the tacit acquiescence of the civil au-
 thorities.
 The economy, once heavily dependent on sugar and other agricultural exports,
 continues to diversify; tourism, telecommunications, and free trade zones (FTZ's) are
 major sources of income and employment. Remittances from abroad, estimated to
 exceed $1 billion, are equivalent to approximately 10 percent of the $1,800 per cap-
 ita gross domestic product. On September 22, Hurricane Georges caused major
 losses in the country's agricultural and tourism sectors, as well as severe damage
 to power and transportation infrastructure. State-owned firms such as the State
 Sugar Council, the Corporation for State Enterprises, and the Dominican Electricity
 Corporation impede economic growth because of inept financial and administrative
 practices.
 The Government's human rights record improved slightly, although serious
 abuses remain. Principal human rights problems include an increase in extrajudicial
 killings by police, police beatings of suspects, poor prison conditions, arbitrary de-
 tention of suspects and suspects' relatives, and the security forces' refusal to obey
 judicial orders. Most reports of human rights abuses involved the police, rather than
 the DNCD or the military. Other serious problems include lengthy pretrial deten-
 tion, interference with the judiciary, and administrative corruption.

 The administration and effectiveness of the justice system improved somewhat, as
 the Supreme Court replaced most judges. There were instances in which the police
 used force to disperse demonstrators. The Government restricts the movement of
 Haitian sugar cane workers. Discrimination and violence against women, trafficking
 in women and girls, prostitution, abuse of children, discrimination against the dis-
 abled, abuse of Haitian migrants and their descendants, and instances of forced
 labor and child labor are serious problems. Workers in the state-owned sugar plan-
 tations and mills continue to work under unfair and unsafe conditions.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings by government officials, but there were reports of 75 extrajudicial killings
 by the police, a sharp increase from 1997. The Dominican Human Rights Committee
 and the National Human Rights Commission stated publicly that the police often
 attempt to justify unwarranted killings by claiming that they are the result of ex-
 changes of gunfire with suspects. There is no coherent policy on the use of deadly
 force. Late in the year, police spokespersons alarmed civil rights advocates by pub-
 licly confirming the existence of an informal policy to shoot persons in the legs when
 they attempted to flee from police. This policy and the general climate of violence
 in which the police operate contribute to the problem of extrajudicial killings. There
 were no reports of extrajudicial killings by the DNCD, unlike during the previous
 year.
 In July the police fired live ammunition to disperse a crowd of university student
 demonstrators and killed law student Franklin Bortolo Fabian Mejia. The authori-
 ties detained the police officers implicated in the incident, and they faced trial at
 year's end. Also in July, the police killed a man suspected of robbing a Santiago
 pharmacy, alleging that he had threatened them with a knife. In August police in
 anto Domingo killed a priest after allegedly mistaking him for a murder suspect.
 At least one witness said that the officers killed the priest while he sat in his car.
 Police killed at least one demonstrator and wounded a number of others in Septem-
 ber (see Section 2.b.).
 The authorities provisionally arrested 20 policemen in Santiago in connection with
 a triple homicide on November 25; they subsequently released 18 of them and kept
 2 in pretrial detention. The three young male victims may have been killed because
 of their refusal to share the proceeds of a recent robbery with the police. The ar-
 rested policemen, all of whom were agents of the Crimes Against Property Division,
 were on duty the night the murders occurred.
 The authorities made progress in the investigation of the 1975 murder of journal-
 ist Orlando Martinez Howley, who had been critical of the administration of former
 President Joaquin Balaguer. The case went to trial in November but was postponed
 to January 1999. The Government is seeking the extradition of the alleged killer,
 Mariano Cabrera Duran-The -authorities also charged five other individuals, includ-
 ing three retired general officers of the armed forces, in connection with the crime.
 In November-the judge denied defense motions to remove Balaguer's name from
 the lists of potential witnesses, who are vulnerable to future charges of complicity
 and obstruction of justice in this case. In his 1988 memoirs, Balaguer stated that
 he left instructions with an unnamed person to publish what the former president
 knew about the case some years after his death. In a 1998 interview with journal-
 ists, Balaguer said that he had nothing to add and that his memoirs contain his
 opinion. The frail but lucid Baaguer has recognized the courefs jurisdiction by re-
 uesting that his.participation in the trial be through a deposition to be taken at
 hshome, although no date had been agreed upon by year's end.
 Military courts try military personnel charged with extrajudicial killings. Police
 tribunals on occasion have tried, convicted, and sentenced personnel charged with
 extrajudicial killings. Police officers may be tried by police courts or remanded to
 civilian court jurisdiction. Police courts sentenced 50 members of the police (39 en-
 listed persons and 11 officers) for serious crimes, while the authorities dismissed a
 number of other members of the police and remanded their cases to the civilian
 court system.
 Election campaigning was relatively peaceful, although there were isolated inci-
 dents of violence. For example, opposition political parties accused activists working
 for the ruling PLD of beating air force reserve General Luis Santiago on April 10,
 causing his death a few days later. The police investigated the murder, arrested
 eight persons, and charged them with murder; they remained in custody pending
 trial at year's end.
 
 
 According to press reports in May, a juvenile named Juan Valverde was killed by
 machete blows in the Quisqueya neighborhood north of Santo Domingo, allegedly by
 progovernment activists, On Apr1 28, the press reported that unknown assailants
 killed two persons during protests over the cost of liing.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports ofpoliticaly motivated disappearances.
 The authorities made progress in the case of arciso Gonzalez, a university profes-
 sor and critic of the Balaguer government who disappeared in May 1994. In August
 a team of armed forces and National Police specia investigators submitted their re-
 port to President Fernandez, who sent it to the Attorney General for criminal pros-
 ecution. Subsequently, the Santo Domingo district attorney formally charged former
 air force intelligence chief General Rafael Reyes Benscme with the disappearance.
 He was detained at year's end and expected to face trial in 1999.
 On February 25, members of the nongovernmental Truth Commission investigat-
 ing the Gonzalez case testified before the Inter-American Commission on Human
 Rights (IACHR) that the Government refused to cooperate with the joint committee
 established at the IACHR's request. They also testified that the Government has not
 granted the joint committee sufficent power to call witnesses or to issue directives
 to the investigating judge. The Government promised to cooperate with the Truth
 Commission and to intensify its own investigation.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.--
 Torture and other forms of physical abuse are illegal, but instances in which secu-
 rity service personnel physically abused detainees continue. Lack of supervision,
 training, and accountabilty thoughout the law enforcement and corrections sys-
 tems exacerbate the problem of physical abuse. Human rights groups and the press
 reported various incidents of physical abuse of detainees while in custody. For ex-
 ample, police allegedly beat a farmer while he was detained in handcuffs in
 Cabrera. Following the dismissal of the DNCD Director in September 1997, there
 were no further reports that members of the DNCD abused suspects.
 A 1994 DNCD videotae of the beating of a suspect generated significant media
 coverae in 1998. The vie sowed a DNCD agent slapping the ears of suspect Luis
 Manuel Matos Felix in the presence of Colonel Luis Humeau Hidalgo, now an admi-
 ral and the country's top antinarcotics official. Many DNCD officials had known of
 the video's existence in 1994, yet no action was taken against the offending agent
 until the video was shown on national television. Human rights advocates cite the
 impunity of the agent in the interim years as evidence of still inadequate DNCD
 internal controls to prohibit such practices and punish perpetrators. The authorities
 discharged the DNCD agent in December.
 Police on occasion used force-at times deadly force (see Section 1.a.)-t disperse
 demonstrators. In addition, according to the press, the police reportedly wounded at
 least 13 persons with gunfire and arrested several dozen when they removed peas-
 ants squatting on private land in the community of La Horca.
 The prosecutor's office continued to p lace lawyers in high-volume police stations
 and several DNCD offices to monitor the investigative process and assure that de-
 tainees' rights are respected (see Section 1.d.). Most National Police and DNCD in-
 vestigators responded positively to this new oversight, but the initiative largely re-
 mains limited to the Santo Domingo metroolitan area, with a lesser presence in
 Santiago. Less qualified prosecutors assigued to the rest of the country have not yet
 assumed stronger roles in managing criminal investigations and ensuring the rights
 of suspects. Human rights courses are an integral part of military and DNCD train-
 ing, both for enlisted personnel and officers.
 Civilian prosecutors sometimes file charges against police and military officials al-
 leging physical abuse, torture, and related crimes. Penalties for torture and physical
 abuse were toughened by a law passed in 1997 that provides for sentences ranging
 from 10 to 15 years in prison. However, these provisions were not fully known or
 applied by prosecutors and judges, and some sentences were less than what the law
 stipulates.
 Prison conditions are poor. The prisons are grossly overcrowded, and health and
 sanitary conditions are poor. A warden is supposed to run each prison and report
 to the Attorney General through the Directorate of Prisons. A police or military colo-
 nel (or lieutenant colonel) reports to the warden and is responsible for providing se-
 curity. However, in practice the colonel is in charge of the prison, and neither the
 Directorate of Prisons nor the individual wardens have much power.
 Prisons controlled by the military generally are administered better than those
 controlled by the National Police. Conditions at La Victria prison, run by the PN,
 pose a serious threat to life and health. The Government added almost 1,200 beds
 to La Victoria, raising its capacity to 2,600, but as many as 3,200 inmates wex'e held
 there at one point. The 46-year-old prison flooded as a result of Hurricane Georges,
 making difficult conditions temporarily even worse. One police officer and an uin-
 
 
 known number of inmates died when some inmates attempted to escape during the
 flooding. Najayo prison, also run by the PN, was built for 700 inmates, yet housed
 1,800 prisoners in September. Medical care suffers from a lack of supplies and avail-
 able physicians. Prisoners immobilized by and dying of AIDS are not transferred to
 a hospital, but some terminal-stage inmates were released early to spend their last
 days at home.
 In July inmates at the SanFrancisco de Macoris prison seized 119 hostages, in-
 cluding their own relatives, who were prevented from leaving after visiting hours.
 The inmates later released 38 persons but held 81 others to press for improvements
 in prison conditions, for the removal of the warden and several guards, and for fast-
 er processing of their cases by the courts. The inmates released the remaining hos-
 tages within 30 hours. The Government agreed to move back to San Francisco de
 Macoris some prisoners who had been moved to other prisons and agreed to increase
 prisoner privacy in order to facilitate conjugal visits.
 Female prisoners are separated from male inmates. In general, conditions in the
 female prison wings are superior to those found in male prison wings, and there
 have been few reports of abuse by guards.
 The law requires that juveniles be detained separately from adults. However, in
 a September report, the Government's Commissioner for the Support of Justice Re-
 form and Modernization found a high incidence of violations, with 156 minors jailed
 with adults at Najayo prison.
 The Government permits prison visits by independent human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution stipulates that the au-
 thorities may detain suspects for a maximum of 48 hours before arraignment, after
 which they must charge or release them, although in special circumstances suspects
 may be detained for longer periods with the approval of the prosecutor's office. How-
 ever, the security forces continue to violate constitutional provisions by detaining
 suspects for investigation or interrogation beyond the prescribed 48-hour limit. The
 security forces traditionally detain all suspects and witnesses in a crime and use
 the investigative process to determine which ones are innocent and merit release,
 and which ones they should continue to hold. After the prosecutor's office placed its
 lawyers in several police stations in 1997, the police began to curtail the practice
 of arbitrary detention in those precincts. However, progress has been slow, and this
 pilot program has been limited largely to the Santo Domingo metropolitan area.
 The police imprisoned drivers associated with the National Federation of Trans-
 portation-the New Option labor union-after a protest against new public buses
 on January 29. The drivers were jailed for blocking traffic, not for expressing
 antigovernment views. Nonetheless, the authorities held the drivers for several days
 before charging them with crimes. After the 48-hour period lapsed, several promi-
 nent persons-including opposition leader Jose Franciso Pena Gomez-complained
 publicly. The authorities charged and released the drivers on February 2, about 96
 ours after their arrest.
 The National Police continued to engage in indiscriminate roundups of persons in
 poorer neighborhoods. The security forces also continued to detain relatives and
 en   of suspected criminals with the aim of forcing suspects to surrender (see Sec-
 tion 1.f.).
 Many suspects suffer long pretrial detention. In September over 75 percent of the
 national prison population was .awaiting trial,- an increase of about 5 percent from
 the end of 1997. However, while suspects nationwide still suffer long pretrial deten-
 tion, judicial statistics show reduced delays for the last 2 years in the Santo Do-
 mingo ,NationalJDistrict (an area that represents approximately 45 percent of all
 criminal cases in.the country). In this area, the average pretrial detention dropped
 from 13.8 months in 1996 to 10 months in 1997 and 6.5 months in 1998. However,
 the rest of the country apparently has experienced only modest decreases in judicial
 delays.
 Because of the inefficiency of the courts (see Section i.e.), the granting of bail
 ,serves as the de facto criminal justice system. As a rule, defendants awarded bail
 rarely face an actual trial; those denied bail can serve their entire sentences while
 awaiting trial. kTime-already served counts toward. a sentence.) This situation im-
 proved somewhat as a result of the steps taken by the Santo Domingo District At-
 torney and the judiciary, in cooperation with the Director of Prisons, to introduce
 a prisoner registry system whose goal is to ensure that prisoners receive a timely
 -trial. The prison system (see Section 1.c.) remains underfunded and sometimes un-
 able to account for prisoners who are scheduled for release. As a result, some pris-
 oners remain incarcerated even after a court orders their release.
 The law prohibits forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Although the Constitution stipulates an independ-
 ent judiciary, interference from other public and private entities, including the exec-
 
 
 utive branch, undermines judicial independence. In August 1997, the National Judi-
 ciary Council chose members of the Supreme Court for the first time, beginning a
 new independence from the executive and legislative branches.
 The judiciary, based primarily on the French judicial system, includes a 16-mem-
 ber Supreme Court,.appeals courts, courts of first instance, and justice of the peace
 courts. There are also specialized courts that handle administrative, labor, traffic,
 land registration, and juvenile matters.
 Military or police courts have jurisdiction over members of the security forces.
 Public pressure has resulted in military or police boards remanding some cases in-
 volving serious crimes to civilian courts for review, after the boards ordered the per-
 petrators to be dishonorably discharged.
 Judges, rather than juries, render all verdicts. Under the 1994 constitutional
 amendments, the Supreme Court is responsible for naming all lower-court judges
 in accordance with a judicial career law, which entered into force in August. The
 National Judiciary Council selects new justices of the Supreme Court. The Council
 consists of the President, the President of the Senate, the President of the Chamber
 of Deputies, two at-large members they designate, and two current justices des-
 ignated by the Supreme Court.
 The Supreme Court continued to combat judicial corruption and incompetence by
 holding public hearings to evaluate all 480 sitting judges, and it replaced about two-
 thirds of them. The new judges were selected using more professional and less polit-
 ical criteria. The Supreme Court set up a system to evaluate allegations and inves-
 tigate charges of corruption by judicial branch employees. At year's end, based on
 investigation of corruption charges, the Court had dismissed several of the new
 judges it selected in January.
 The Constitution provides for public trial and for representation by counsel. Dur-
 ing the closed pretrial investigative phase of the criminal justice process, the State
 traditionally provides no counsel to imprisoned indigents. In August the Govern-
 ment inaugurated a small (13-person) public defender organization to provide serv-
 ice to indigent defendants in the Santo Domingo metropolitan area. Where no public
 defender is available, the judges assign indigent cases to 70 part-time, private attor-
 neys, whose services are paid for by the State.
 The judicial system is still plagued by delays, and many suspects suffer lengthy
 pretrial detention (see Section I.d.). The Government's 5-year program to modernize
 courts in Santo Domingo, begun in September 1997, made some progress in reduc-
 ing the judicial backlog.
 A screening mechanism for Santo Domingo National District public prosecutors
 was established, and the Government replaced a number of less competent prosecu-
 tors with others with better credentials. However, since appointees of the ruling
 party essentially perform the screening, this process was not entirely free of political
 influence.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution contains provisions against invasion of the home. Although the Govern-
 ment does not arbitrarily use wiretapping or other surreptitious methods to inter-
 fere with the private lives of persons or families, it tolerates an active private wire-
 tapping industry.
 The law permits the arrest of a suspect captured in the act of committing a crime,
 and police may enter a residence or business in hot pursuit. Otherwise, judges must
 authorize arrests and issue search warrants. However, the National Police and occa-
 sionally the DNCD continue to violate these requirements. Some prosecutors confess
 that out of "tactical necessity to combat criminality" and "With great reluctance,"
 they tolerate the illegal search practices. They justify their actions by arguing that
 the Government has not provided sufficient resources or attention to criminal inves-
 tigation and that, given the cumbersome and antiquated criminal procedures, adher-
 ing to the letter of the law would make enforcing the law nearly impossible.
 The security forces continued to detain relatives and friends of suspects to try to
 compel suspects to surrender (see Section 1.d.). The police allegedly followed a lead-
 er of a human rights group on several occasions in late 1997 (see Section 4).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for these freedoms, and the
 Government respects them in practice.
 Citizens of all political persuasions exercise freedom of speech. Newspapers and
 magazines freely present a diversity of opinion and criticism. However, self-censor-
 ship is practiced, particularly when coverage could adversely affect the economic or
 political interests of media owners.
 
 
 The numerous privately owned radio and television stations broadcast all political
 points of view. The Government controls one television station but no major news-
 paers.
 bic and private universities enjoy broad academic freedom. The main public
 university, the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo, with approximately
 100,000 mostly part-time students, has no restrictions on enrollnent and maintains
 a policy of nonintervention (other than on curriculum development) in classroom af-
 fairs. The Government exerts no control over private universities, except for the
 preservation of standards, and teachers are free to espouse their own theories with-
 out government oversight,
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly, and the Government generally respects this right in practice.
 Outdoor public marches and meetings require permits, which the Government usu-
 ally grants. However, there were incidents in which the police used force to break
 up demonstrations. In July the police killed one demonstrator while dispersing a
 crowd (see Section L.a.) There were a number of clashes between police and protest-
 ers in September in Licey and Salcedo, which resulted in at least one death and
 several injuries attributed to police. These protests were largely prompted by power
 shortages, rising prices, and the deteriorating infrastructure.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association, and the Government gen-
 erally respects this right in practice. Political parties freely affiliate with their for-
 eign counterpart organizations. Professional organizations of lawyers, doctors, teach-
 ers, and others function freely and can maintain relations with counterpart inter-
 national bodies of diverse political philosophies.
 Judicial branch statistics concerning use of the criminal charge of "association
 with criminal elements" suggest improvement in conditions for political dissent
 under the Fernandez administration. This charge traditionally was used against dis-
 sidents and those involved in street demonstrations against the Government. From
 1990 to 1996, this charge represented 13 to 16 percent of all criminal charges filed
 in the Santo Domingo National District. In 1997 and 1998, this figure dropped to
 less than 2 percent.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution prohibits discrimination on religious
 grounds, and the Government does not interfere with the practice of religion. How-
 ever, attendance at Catholic Mass for.members of the National Police is compulsory.
 The Catholic Church, which signed a concordat with the Government in 1954, en-
 joys special privileges not extended to other religions. These include the use of pub-
 lic funds to underwrite some church expenses, such as rehabilitation of church facili-
 ties, and a complete waiver of customs duties when importing goods into the coun-
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens face no unusual legal restrictions on travel within or outside
 the country; however, Haitian sugar cane workers face restrictions on their freedom
 of movement (see Section 6.c.).
 Haitians continue to migrate in great numbers to the Dominican Republic, some
 legally but most without legal documents, in search of economic opportunity.
 Throughout the year, the security forces, particularly the army, deported undocu-
 mented Haitian nationals believed to be in the country illegally. International ob-
 servers estimated that the Government deported approximately 10,000 Haitians be-
 tween January and September. In many cases, the Government denied those de-
 ported the opportunity to demonstrate that they resided legally in the Dominican
 epublic. Haitian Government officials complained that Haitians often were de-
 tained with little or no food and then deported without notice to Haitian authorities.
 NGO representatives working in rural areas reported that decisions to deport
 often were made by lower ranking members of the security forces, sometimes based
 upon the racial characteristics of the deportees.
 According to a 1984 presidential decree, an applicant for refugee status must be
 referred to the Technical Subcommission of the National Commission for Refugees
 by the National Office of Refugee Affairs. The 'Subcommission, which makes a rec-
 ommendation to the Commission, is made up of members from the Foreign Ministry,
 the DNI, and the Immigration Directorate. The Commission, which makes a final
 decision on the application, comprises the three members of the Subcommission; the
 legal advisor to the President; and members of the PN, the Secretariat of Labor, and
 the Attorney General's office.
 In practice, the National Office of Refugee Affairs is not yet functioning. Instead,
 the Immigration Directorate issues documentation to refugees certified as such by
 the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). While these docu-
 ments are accepted routinely by the police and immigration officials, the process by
 which they are issued does not comply with the decree.
 
 
 The UNHCR recognized two persons, a Haitian and a Chinese, as refugees, bring-
 ing the total of UNHCR-recognized refugees to 634. It is not known how many un-
 documented refugees actually are living in the country.
 The Government cooperates with the UNHCR and other humanitarian organiza-
 tions in assisting refugees. The Government provides first asylum and resettlement.
 In March, by agreement with the Cuban Government, it readmitted the two Cubans
 who were returned to Cuba from the Dominican Republic in 1997.
 There were no reports of the forced return of persons to a country where they
 feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Dominican Republic is a constitutional democracy, and its citizens last exer-
 cised this right in free and fair congressional elections in May. The President and
 all 179 members of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies are elected freely every
 4 years by secret ballot. There is universal adult suffrage; however, active duty po-
 lice and military personnel may not vote. The President appoints the governors of
 the 29 provinces. Opposition groups of the left, right, and center operate openly.
 In August the Senate, dominated by the opposition PRD, appointed the five mem-
 bers of the Central Electoral Board (JCE), the body that organizes and supervises
 elections. The ruling PL) and the opposition Social Christian Reformist Party have
 questioned the legitimacy of the selections, claiming that electoral law requires that
 board members be apolitical or apportioned among the three major parties. The dis-
 Sute remained unresolved at year's end, and the Government intentionally delayed
 dsbursement of funds to the JCE in order to impede it.
 The nation has a functioning multiparty system. In practice the President can
 dominate public policy formulation and implementation. He can exercise his author-
 ity through the use of the veto, discretion to act by decree, and influence as the
 leader of his party. Traditionally, the President has predominant power in the Gov-
 ernment, effectively making many important decisions by decree. President
 Fernandez reduced the reliance on rule by decree during the first 2 years of his ad-
 ministration.
 Congress provides an open forum for the free exchange of views and debate. The
 main opposition party holds with its allies 80 percent of the upper house and almost
 half of the lower house.
 Women and minorities confront no serious legal impediments to political partici-
 pation, but they are underrepresented. Under the law 25 percent of positions on vot-
 ing lists must be reserved or women. However, the parties often place women so
 low on the lists as to make their election difficult or impossible. Women hold 2 seats
 in the 30-member Senate and 25 seats in the 149-member Chamber of Deputies.
 Women continue to be represented in appointed positions, albeit to a limited degree.
 Two of the 15 cabinet secretaries are women, but none of the 29 provincial gov-
 ernors are female. Women fill 5 of the 16 seats on the Supreme Court.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Nongovernmental human rights organizations operate freely without govern-
 mental interference. In addition to the Dominican Human Rights Committee, the
 National Human Rights Commission, and the nongovernmental Truth Commission
 (dealing with the Narciso Gonzalez case), several Haitian, church, women's, and
 labor groups exist. There is no ombudsman's office.
 In late 1997, a human rights advocate alleged that police had followed him on sev-
 eral occasions in late 1997. After he voiced his concerns in the media and to the
 National Police leadership, the alleged harassment ended.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination based on race and sex. Such discrimination ex-
 ists in society, but the Government has seldom acknowledged its existence or made
 efforts to combat it.
 Women.-Domestic violence and sexual harassment are widespread. Under the
 1997 Law Against Domestic Violence, the State can prosecute a suspect for rape,
 even if the victim does not file charges. This law also allows a rape victim to press
 charges against her husband without having her marriage annulled. However, be-
 cause the law was passed relatively recently, its effectiveness in enhancing women's
 lives could not yet be determined. The Government's Office of Women's Issues as-
 sists women with outreach programs on domestic violence and legal rights. In May
 the Government opened a center for the forensic examination of abused women,
 
 
 which handled 10 to 15 cases a day, most of them involving minors. However, there
 still are no shelters for battered women.
 The Government does not vigorously enforce prostitution laws. Sex tourism is a
 growing industry throughout the country as the number of international visitors in-
 creases. NGO's have ongoing HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted disease prevention
 programs for male and female prostitutes, as well -as for hotel and industrial zone
 workers. Women and girls are also victims of rings trafficking women and children
 to work as prostitutes in Europe in conditions rife with exploitation and mistreat-
 ment. One NGO counsels women planning to accept job offers in Europe and the
 eastern Caribbean about immigration, health, and other issues. The program also
 provides services to returning women. The 1997 Law against Domestic Violence pro-
 hibits acting as an intermediary in a transaction of prostitution, and the Govern-
 ment has used the law to prosecute third parties who derive profit from prostitution.
 Divorce is easily obtainable by either spouse, and women can hold property in
 their own names apart from their husbands. Traditionally, women have not shared
 equal social and economic status or opportunity with men, and men hold the major-
 ity of leadership positions in all sectors. In 1991 12.3 percent of managers and ad-
 ministrators were women; in 1996 women held 21 percent of such positions. In 1996
 9 percent of women over the age of 16 had some higher education, compared with
 only 7 percent of men. In many instances women are paid less than men in jobs
 of equal content and equal skill level. Some employers in industry reportedly give
 pregnancy tests to women before hiring them, as part of a required medical exam-
 ination. Union leaders and human rights advocates report that pregnant women
 often are not hired.
 Children.-Despite the existence of government institutions dedicated to child
 welfare, private social and religious organizations carry the principal burden. The
 private institutions receive no government financing. The 1994 Minor's Code re-
 quires only 6 years of formal education.
 The most serious abuse involving children is the failure of the judicial system to
 protect the status of minors in criminal cases. The authorities sometimes treated
 minors as adults and incarcerated them in prison rather than juvenile detention
 centers. In 1997 the Government began to implement the 1994 Minor's Code, laying
 the groundwork for the juvenile court system that the code mandated. The Supreme
 Court inaugurated the first of 11 juvenile courts in August and chose judges for the
 other 10 courts. These juvenile courts are to be organized with a focus on rehabili-
 tating offenders. There are legal defenders for juveniles in Santo Domingo and La
 Vega.
 The Minor's Code contains provisions against child abuse, -including physical and
 emotional mistreatment, sexual exploitation, and child labor. It also provides for re-
 moval of a mistreated or delinquent child to a protective environment. According to
 local monitors, instances of child abuse were underreported because of traditional
 beliefs that family problems should be dealt with inside the family..However, child
 abuse is receiving increasing public attention.
 Some in the tourist industry have facilitated the sexual exploitation of children.
 Tours are marketed overseas with the understanding that boys and girls can be
 found as sex partners.
 Trafficking in girls for prostitution is a problem. There are no shelters providing
 refuge to children who break free from the prostitution trade. However, the Govern-
 ment made some progress in combating child prostitution. In January the authori-
 ties closed 4 motels that were being used as brothels, removed 24 women and 4
 girls, and arrested the motel administrators. In July the Santo Domingo prosecu-
 tor's office rescued five girls under the age of 15 from a prostitution ring and ar-
 rested two individuals. In September police arrested two foreign citizens in connec-
 tion with an investigation of child pornography.
 People With Disabilities.-Disabled persons encounter discrimination in employ-
 ment and in the provision of other services. Although the law contains provisions
 for physical access for the disabled to all new public and private buildings, the au-
 thorities have'not enforced this law uniformly. To improve opportunities for disabled
 citizens, in 1997 the Government created a Subsecretariat for Rehabilitation under
 the Secretariat of Public Health, established a new recreation center for the disabled
 in Las Caobas, and founded a new department in the Sports Secretariat to facilitate
 athletic competition for the disabled. Also in 1997, the Government instructed the
 Secretariat of Education to begin a pilot project to integrate mentally retarded chil-
 dren and other children with special needs into the public school system. In 1998
 the Government tok its first steps to implement the project, integrating children
 with special needs into five public schools in marginal areas of the Santo Domingo
 National District.
 
 
 A private entity founded in 1962, the Dominican Rehabilitation Association (ADR)
 has grown from a 1-room operation to a large complex with 17 affiliates throughout
 the country. It provides services for 2,500 persons daily. The Government provides
 about 25 percent of the ADR's budget.
 National/Racial lEthnic Minorities.-A strong prejudice against Haitians runs
 through society, disadvantaging many Haitians andDominicans of Haitian ancestry.
 The Government has not acknowledged the existence of this discrimination nor
 made any efforts to combat it. Darker-skinned Dominicans also face informal bar-
 riers to social and economic advancement.
 Perhaps 500,000 Haitian ineigrants-or 7 percent of the country's population-
 live in bateyes, or shantytowns, in harsh conditions with limited or no electricity,
 running water, or schooling. Human rights groups regularly charge the Government
 with unlawful deportations of and police brutality toward these legal and illegal im-
 migrants.
 dible sources charge that the Government at times, in violation of the Con-
 stitution, refuses to recognize and document as Dominican citizens individuals of
 Haitian ancestry born in the country. Children born to Haitian parents are caught
 in a bureaucratic dilemma: Since many Haitian parents have never processed docu-
 mentation for their own birth, they are unable to demonstrate their own citizenship.
 As a result, they cannot declare their children's births at the civil registry and
 thereby establish Dominican citizenship for their offspring. Some civil registry of-
 fices do not accept late declarations of birth for children of Haitian immigrants, al-
 though they routinely accept late declarations for children of Dominican parents.
 Lack of documentation often hinders the ability of children of Haitian descent to at-
 tend school where there is one available. Some parents fail to seek documentation
 for fear of being deported.
 Haitian parents encounter difficulties registering their children for school. It falls
 to the discretion of public school principals whether children may attend, since im-
 migrant parents usually have no identity cards or birth certificates to register chil-
 dren formally. Even when   ermi    to attend primary school, it is rare that the
 offspring of Haitian parents progress beyond sixth grade.
 thou     the Government largely has eliminated the use of children for cutting
 sugar cane, poor Haitian and Dominican parents sometimes arrange for Dominican
 families to "adopt and employ their children (The adopting parents can simply reg-
 ister a child of any age as teir own.) In exchange, he parents receive monetary
 payment or a supply of clothes and food. They beieve that this ensures their chil-
 dren a more promising future. In many cases, adoptive parents do not treat the
 adoupgtees as fll family members and expet them to work in the households or fam-
 ily businesses rather than attend school There were reports that Haitian girls be-
 tween the ages of 10 and 14 were the most sought after, especially in border areas.
 The Government is doing little to improve the conditions of Haitian immigrants
 and generally relies upon relief organizations. A number of NGO's and other agen-
 cies provide assistance in the shantytowns.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the freedom to orga-
 nize labor unions and for the right of workers to strike (and for private sector em-
 ployers to lock out workers). All workers, except the military and the police, are free
 to organize, and workers in all sectors exercise this right.
 Requirements for calling a strike include the support of an absolute majority of
 all company workers whether unionized or not, a prior attempt to resolve the con-
 flict through mediation, written notification to the Labor Secretariat, and a 10-day
 waiting period following notification before proceeding with the strike. The Govern-
 ment respects association rights and places no obstacles to union registration, affili-
 ation, or the ability to engage in legal strikes.
 There were fewer strikes during the year than in 1997. University employees
 struck in January for more than 2 months. Leaders of the National Federation of
 Transport Workers and 30 drivers held a short hunger strike in April to protest the
 Governmenfs new line of buses. In January police had imprisoned drivers associ-
 ated with this union for blocking traffic during protests. Doctors held a 1-day work
 stoppage in September following a strike by hospital employees.
 The 1992 Labor Cede provides extensive protection for worker rights and specifies
 the steps legally required to establish a union, federation, or confederation. The code
 calls for automatic recognition of a union if the Government has not acted on its
 application within a specific time. In practice, the Government has facilitated rec-
 ognition of labor organizations readily. Organized labor represents only an esti-
 mated 10 percent of the work force and is divided among four major confederations
 and a number of independent unions. Unions are independent of the Government
 
 
 606
 and generally independent of political parties. However, there were reports of wide-
 spread discreet intimidation by employers in an effort to prevent union activity. For
 example, unions in free trade zones (FTZ's) report that their members hesitate to
 discuss union activity at work, even during break time, for fear of losing their.jobs.
 Labor unions can and do affiliate freely regionally and internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is law-
 ful and may take place in firms in which a union has gained the support of an abso-
 lute majority of the workers. Only a minority of companies have collective bargain-
 ing pacts. The Labor Code stipulates that workers cannot be dismissed because of
 their trade union membership or activities.
 The Labor Code establishes a system of labor courts for dealing with disputes.
 After a recent overhaul by the Supreme Court, these courts have proven more effec-
 tive at enforcing the law.
 The State Sugar Council (CEA) employs workers from more than 100 unions, 2
 of them predominantly Haitian. The CEA long has maintained a negative attitude
 toward additional organizing efforts.
 The Labor Code applies in the 40 established FTZ's, which employ approximately
 200,000 workers, mostly women. Workplace regulations and their enforcement in
 the FTZ's do not differ from those in the country at large, although working condi-
 tions are sometimes better. Some FTZ companies have a history of discharging
 workers who attempt to organize unions, but there also have been reports of union
 organizers extorting money from business owners. Although there are approximately
 70 unions in the FTZ's, many exist only on paper. The majority of the unions in
 the FTZ's are affiliated with the National Federation of Free Trade Zone Workers
 or the United Federation of Free Trade Zone Workers.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, including that performed by children; however, there were instances
 of such practices. Poor Haitian and Dominican parents sometimes arrange for Do-
 minican families to "adopt" their children, in exchange for money or goods. Such
 children often are not treated as full family members and are expected to work in
 households or businesses (see Section 5). In addition, trafficking in women and girls
 for purposes of prostitution is also a problem (see Section 5). There were also nu-
 merous credible reports of coerced overtime in factories and of workers being fired
 for refusing to work overtime. Union officials state that newly hired workers are not
 informed that overtime is optional.
 Haitian sugar cane workers continued to encounter restrictions on their freedom
 of movement. These include armed guards on the plantations; some plantations
 withhold wages until the end of the harvest season, then pay workers on the condi-
 tion that they depart the premises.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Rmployment.-The
 Labor Code prohibits employment of children under 14 years of age and places re-
 strictions on the employment of children under the age of 16. These restrictions in-
 lude a limitation of no more than 6 hours of daily work, no employment in dan-
 gerous occupations or in establishments serving alcohol, and limitations on night-
 time work. Children between the ages of 14 and 16 may work in apprenticeship and
 artistic programs. The law requires 6 years of formal education. Children who do
 not continue in school often seek illegal employment before reaching the minimum
 working age. The law prohibits forced or bonded labor by children; however, poor
 Haitian and Dominican parents sometimes arrange the adoption of their children
 by Dominican families in exchange for money or goods, and such children generally
 are expected to work in households or businesses (see Sections 5 and 6.c.).
 The high level of unemployment and lack of a social safety net create pressures
 on families to allow children to earn supplemental income. The International Labor
 Organization estimated in August 1997 that 169,000 children between the ages of
 7 and 14 hold jobs. The Government did not sanction the parents of these children.
 Child labor takes place primarily in the informal economy, small businesses, clan-
 destine factories, and prostitution. Conditions in clandestine factories are generally
 poor, unsanitary, and often dangerous.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Constitution provides the Government
 with legal authority to set minimum wage levels, and the Labor Code assigns this
 task to a national salary committee. Congress also may enact minimum wage legis-
 lation. The minimum monthly salary is $125 (1,932 pesos) in the FTZ's and ranges
 from $101 (1,555 pesos) to $157 (2,412 pesos) outside the FTZ's depending upon the
 size of the company and the nature of the business. The minimum wage does not
 provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family. It covers only a fraction
 of the living costs of a family in Santo Domingo, but many workers receive only the
 minimum wage.
 
 
 The Labor Code establishes a standard work period of 8 hours per day and 44
 hours per week. The code also stipulates that all workers are entitled to 36 hours
 of uninterrupted rest each week. In practice, a typical workweek is Monday through
 Friday plus a half day on Saturday, but longer hours are not unusual. The code
 grants workers a 35 percent differential for work totaling between 44 hours to 68
 hours per week and double time for any hours above 68 hours per week.
 Conditions for agricultural workers are in general much worse, especially in the
 sugar industry. Many sugar cane worker villages have high rates of disease and
 lack schools, medical facilities, running water, and sewage systems. On sugar plan-
 tations, cane cutters usually are paid by the weight of cane cut rather than the
 hours worked. Employers often do not provide trucks to transport the newly cut
 cane at the conclusion of the workday, causing workers to receive lower compensa-
 tion because the cane has dried out and become lighter.
 When the cane finally is weighed, workers are given tickets indicating the weight
 of cane cut (often rounded in favor of the employer) and the amount of money due.
 These tickets, issued to a specific person but payable to the bearer, may be turned
 in to the employer and redeemed for cash every 2 weeks. Many cane cutters earn
 less than $4.00 (60 pesos) per day. Because workers earn so little and sometimes
 cannot wait until payday to redeem their tickets, an informal barter system has
 evolved in which the tickets also are used to purchase items at private stores lo-
 cated on the plantations. These private stores make change by giving back a com-
 bination of tickets and cash. However, it is not unusual for these stores to retain
 10 percent of the cash due a customer. The conditions are somewhat better at some
 of the privately owned sugar plantations.
 The Dominican Social Security Institute (IDSS) sets workplace safety and health
 conditions. The existing social security system is grossly underfunded and applies
 to only about 9 percent of the population. Approximately 13,000 employees work in
 the IDSS bureaucracy to support fewer than 20,000 retirees.
 Both the IDSS and the Labor Secretariat have small corps of inspectors charged
 with enforcing standards. Inspector positions customarily are filled through political
 patronage, and bribes from businesses are common. In practice, workers cannot re-
 move themselves from hazardous working situations without jeopardy to continued
 employment.
