 ZIMBABWE
 Zimbabwe is governed by President Robert Mugabe and his Zimbabwe African
 National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) which has dominated the legislative and
 executive branches of government since independence in 1980. The Constitution al-
 lows for multiple parties; in addition to ZANU-PF, there are several smaller parties.
 In 1993 they were deeply divided, poorly financed, and faced periodic intimidation
 by government security forces. The Forum Party was launched in March and quick-
 ly became the largest and best organized opposition party.
 The Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) is responsible for maintaining law and order.
 The size of the Police Internal Security and Intelligence (PISI) unit, a branch of the
 ZRP was reduced in 1993. The Central Intelligence Organization (CIO) falls under
 the Ministry of Security. Since 1991 the CIO and PIS1 have not been permitted to
 arrest, detain, or interrogate suspects in internal security cases. In the past, the
 CIO was accused of human rights abuses, including the use of torture; however,
 there were no new reports of torture by the CIO or the ZRP in 1993. The Air Force
 and Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) also have intelligence staff structures, which
 perform a variety of intelligence and security functions.
 Zimbabwe's economy has strong agricultural and mining sectors and a diversified
 manufacturing base. The Government remained committed to the Economic Struc-
 tural Adjustment Program (ESAP), despite severe hardships the Program caused
 average Zimbabweans. Although Zimbabwe began to recover from the effects of the
 devastating 1991-92 drought, which caused a decline of between 8 and 9 percent
 in the gross domestic product, the unemployment rate was almost 45 percent. Thou-
 sands remained chronically dependent on food support 1 year into a good post-
 drought agricultural season. Although the need for land reform is widely accepted,
 the 1992 Land Acquisition Act has been implemented along racial lines.
 There were several positive developments in 1993; however, human rights abuses
 continued, notably deplorable prison conditions, police brutality, and some irregular-
 ities in local and by-elections. A white paper on the draft inheritance law, which
 will clarify (particularly women's) inheritance rights, was widely circulated and com-
 ment requested from a cross-section of Zimbabweans. Public education and vigorous
 prosecution reduced the incidence of such traditional practices as refusing to bury
 a woman's body until her lobola (bride price) is paid and forcing a widow to marry
 her brother-in-law. Supreme Court instructions directed magistrates to determine
 for the record that unrepresented defendents fully understand their rights and that
 mitigating circumstances are considered even if they are not part of the defense. In
 
 
 334
 August, the Minister of Justice announced the establishment of an Inter-Ministerial
 Committee on Human Rights. However, by year's end the Committee had not taken
 any concrete action. The Government has failed to investigate fully atrocities com-
 mitted during the "1982-87 Matabeleland Dissident Crisis" or to prosecute fully
 those involved. In general, the Government was unable or unwilling to try, convict,
 and punish those responsible for human rights abuses. Prison conditions were de-
 plorable. On occasion the Government acted to restrict freedom of assembly and as-
 sociation, and traditional, often illegal, discrimination against women continued. It
 used its majority in Parliament to weaken the Bill of Rights, the courts, and the
 authority of Parliament itself. The Government put checks on Zimbabwe's independ-
 ent judiciary, and it passed a political parties financing law from which onl the
 ruling party can benefit. There were incidents of intimidation and problems with the
 voters' rolls in local and by-elections.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no confirmed political
 killings or summary executions by government security forces in 1993. In 1990 a
 15-year-old boy, Happy Dhlakama, died mysteriously in police custody. Following in-
 q uiries, in July 1993 the Attorney General opened an inquest into Dhlakama's
 eath. An April inquest into the 1992 death of Forum forDemocratic Reform Trust
 (FDRT) official Mthiandao Ndema Ngwenya ruled out foul play and concluded that
 the accident in which he died was caused by driver negligence. Although rumors
 still circulate that the Government was involved in the June 1992 fatal car crash
 of FDRT youth leader Chris Giwa, Zimbabwean human rights groups except for the
 FDRT and the political party it spawned, were satisfied that the crash, like
 Ngwenya's, was an accident and that the investigation of the incident was properly
 handled.
 A number of cases raised in the 1992 Human Rights Report were concluded:
 Flight Lieutenant Michael Banana, son of former President Canaan Banana, was
 convicted of wrongful death (manslaughter) in the shooting of Donald Kalinda and
 sentenced to an effective 18 months' imprisonment. In late 1993, he was out on bail
 pending appeal. Two CIO officers were convicted of attempted murder for the March
 990 shooting of candidate for Parliament Patrick Kombayi and sentenced to 7
 years in jail. The judgment was highly critical of the CIO and ZRP, accusing them
 of biased reporting favoring ZANU-PF. The judgment suggested further investiga-
 tions were requred to determine if Vice President Simon Muzendas bodyguards and
 driver shouldbe tried for possible involvement in the shooting. Although the Catho-
 lic Commission for Justice and Peace (CCJP) came forward with new evidence indi-
 cating that Lieutenant Shepard Chisango's June 7, 1991 "fall" from a ZNA vehicle
 was not an accident, observers considered it unlikely that the Government would
 reopen the case it dismissed in 1992 for lack of evidence. The Chisango case likely
 dampens even further any tendency for military officers publicly to denounce cor-
 ruption in the armed forces.
 According to Minister of Home Affairs Dumiso Dubengwa, forensic scientists de-
 termined that human remains found during construction at CIO headquarters in
 1992 were over 40 years old. However, human rights groups suspect that there may
 be a cover-up. While eyewitnesses report seeing "bodies," the Government first re-
 ported the discovery of "bones" and then a "bone."
 A commission established in 1984 to investigate atrocities committed during the
 1982-87 Matabeleland Crisis, the Simplicius Chihambakwe Commission, conducted
 interviews in Bulawayo for 2 days in mid-1993. According to human rights groups,
 the information collected in that brief time was so damning that the investigation
 was suspended. Chihambakwe's report was submitted to President Mugabe but has
 not been made public. Human rights groups are not optimistic that the investigation
 will be continued until after Zimbabwe's 1995 parliamentary elections. The Govern-
 ment has declared that victims of the Matabeleland Crisis can now be declared le-
 gally dead under the Missing Persons Act, but many victims' relatives are too fright-
 ened to come forward. In November the Organization of African Unity's Human
 Rights Committee reportedly pressed the Government to compensate the victims of
 the Matabeleland Crisis; Government officials replied that President Mugabe had
 already declared in October 1992 that no compensation would be paid because any
 atrocities committed were perpetrated during a "state of war."
 b. Disappearance.-There were no disappearances in 1993. The man allegedly re-
 sponsible for the 1990 disappearance of Rashiwe Guzha, her boyfriend and Deputy
 Director of the CIO Edson Shirihuru, died in July. It is, therefore, unlikely that the
 
 
 335
 case will be reopened despite calls from the CCJP and the Zimbabwe Human Rights
 Association (ZIMRIGHTS) for a new investigation.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 In a landmark decision, in June the Supreme Court commuted the death sentences
 of four death row inmates, ruling that the death sentence, though legally imposed,
 had been rendered unconstitutional (cruel and inhuman punishment) by the long
 delay between conviction and planned execution dates and the harsh, degrading con-
 ditions of confinement. The Government accepted the ruling and went on to com-
 mute the death sentences of 32 other long-time residents of death row. Within
 months, however, Constitutional Amendment 13, declaring, inter alia, that long
 delays in the carrying out of sentences do not constitute cruel and unusual punish-
 ment, was passedby Parliament.
 There were no credible reports of torture in 1993. However the family of
 Nhlanhla Dlodlo demanded an inquest into his death. The family alleges Dlodlo was
 beaten to death in police custody. The Government did not actively pursue allega-
 tions that torture was used in the past; no CIO or ZRP officials were prosecuted
 for such abuses in 1993.
 Police brutality remained a problem. In several police shooting incidents in 1993,
 the police launched their own investigation, called on witnesses from the public to
 come forward, and charged officers involved with wrongful death (manslaughter).
 One was convicted of murder and sentenced to death in February, and several oth-
 ers remained in custody at year's end. In an effort to professionalize the police force,
 the ZRP extended its 6-month training course for recruits to 2 years. In 1993 the
 Legal Resources Foundation (LRF) worked on the design of a legal and human
 rights syllabus to be incorporated into the recruits' training curriculum. The LRF
 also conducted human rights training workshops for senior police officers and
 planned to conduct similar workshops for the police rank and file in 1994. In addi-
 tion there were workshops for community relations officers on dealing with cases
 of rape and wife beating.
 Overcrowding is a serious problem in Zimbabwean prisons. In September Minister
 of Justice, Legal, and Parliamentary Affairs Emmerson Mnangagwa confirmed that
 223 prisoners died in the first 8 months of the year, primarily from outbreaks of
 cholera, diarrhea and AIDS-related illnesses aggravated by squalid, overcrowded
 conditions. A CCJP report released in August revealed that 22,600 inmates were in-
 carcerated in a prison system built to accommodate 16,000. The Government an-
 nounced an amnesty for 6,000 prisoners in April to ease overcrowding, but by July
 the prison population had returned to its preamnesty levels. In some prisons, this
 meant that prisoners were allowed less than .65 square meters per person. Because
 the Mlondorozi Prison, which is supposed to accommodate mentally ill prisoners,
 was full, mentally disturbed prisoners were scattered throughout the regular prison
 system.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The police must by law inform an ar-
 rested person of the charges against him before he is taken into custody. A person
 arrested on a criminal charge is supposed to have a preliminary hearing before a
 magistrate within 48 hours, but the law is often disregarded if a person is not le-
 gally represented. A 1992 amendment to the Criminal Procedures and Evidence Act
 substantially reduced the power of magistrates to grant bail without the consent of
 the Attorney General or his agents. Although the rule has been decried by legal
 practitioners and magistrates, in practice a circular issued by the Attorney General
 giving a general authority to grant bail has lessened the negative impact of the
 change. High court judges still grant bail independently.
 The Government may still apply a wide range of legal powers under the Official
 Secrets Act or the Law and Order (Maintenance) Act (LOMA). Originally promul-
 gated 30 years ago and widely used in the past to prosecute political opponents, the
 LOMA has extremely wide and vague sections on political and security crimes and
 gives extensive powers to the police, the Minister of Home Affairs, and the Presi-
 dent. The Government has not invoked the LOMA frequently, fearing that its op-
 pressive provisions might be declared unconstitutional. It was usually invoked to
 prevent gatherings or demonstrations rather than to arrest or prosecute individuals.
 Although Minister of Home Affairs Dumiso Dabengwa said in February that the
 LOMA would be repealed, in November he announced that it would not be repealed
 in 1993. He also cautioned that certain LOMA provisions might be part of new legis-
 lation to be introduced in Parliament. In June, six trade unionists who were ar-
 rested for taking part in a 1992 Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) proces-
 sion in defiance of a government ban, challenged the constitutionality of the LOMA
 in the Supreme Court, but the case was postponed indefinitely.
 Long court delays and a critical shortage of magistrates and court interpreters re-
 sult in detainees spending long periods in prison without trial. For example, in Sep-
 
 
 336
 tember, the Harare regional and provincial courts had backlogs of 1,400 and 1,900
 cases respectively. Overall, 17 percent of Zimbabwean prisoners in late 1993 had not
 yet been tried or convicted. The CCJP report cited the case of Bulawayo Prison,
 where on the day the CCJP researcher visited, 317 of the prison's 758 inmates were
 unconvicted. An extreme example was the case of Daniel Machabe whose murder
 trial began on July 24 after his being held in the remand center for 7 years. Ofi-
 cials blamed the delay on a general shortage of judicial officers that caused delay
 in completion of investigations.
 There were no known political detainees being held at year's end.
 Exile is not used as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Zimbabwe's legal system is based on a mixture
 of Roman-Dutch law, English common law, and customary law. Every defendant has
 the right to select a lawyer of his or her choosing. In criminal cases an indigent may
 apply to have the Government supply an attorney, while in capital cases the Gov-
 ernment will provide an attorney for all defendants unable to afford one. Litigants
 in civil cases can request legal assistance from the LRF or from the Citizens Advice
 Bureau.
 Nearly 92 percent of defendants in magistrates courts are unrepresented. Human
 rights groups have recently highlighted the problem of poor representation for indi-
 pent clients, particularly in capital cases. The Supreme Court has instructed mag-
 istrates to ensure for the record that unrepresented defendants fully understand
 their rights. In addition, the Supreme Court instructed magistrates to determine
 themselves if there are mitigating circumstances in criminal cases, whether or not
 the accused presents them as part of his defense. The right to appeal exists in all
 cases and is automatic in cases in which the death penalty is imposed. Trials are
 open to the public except in certain security cases.
 The Customary Law and Local Courts Act of 1990 created a unitary court system,
 consisting of headmen's courts, chiefs' courts, malisteral courts, the High Court,
 and the Supreme Court. With the restructuring of the courts, customary law cases
 can be heard at all levels of the judiciary, including the Supreme Court. In March
 chiefs' and headmen's courts, which can hear limited categories of customary law
 cases in disputes not exceeding $100 and $200 respectively, were reactivated. These
 courts provide much greater access to the legal system to people in remote areas
 unfamiliar with the general law.
 Training for magistrates and chiefs conducted by the Chief Magistrate and the
 Legal Resources Foundation was widely reported in the press and went a long way
 toward ending human rights violations acceptable under customar law. For exam-
 ple, press coverage of the vigorous prosecution of families who refuse to bury their
 daughters until the widower pays lobola (bride price) led to a reduction in the prac-
 tice. During widely publicized training sessions for chiefs, the Chief Magistrate
 warned that the "ukungena," the custom of forcing a widow to marry her late hus-
 band's brother, was illegal. He also declared that the practice of paying compensa-
 tion and slaughtering a cow to appease the spirits in cases of incest was no longer
 acceptable.
 Although the judicial system lacks structures to guarantee its independence, such
 as life terms for judges, Zimbabwe's judiciary has a well-deserved reputation for
 independence. Judges are not fired or transferred for political reasons, and the Gov-
 ernment generally abides by court decisions even when it is strongly opposed to the
 rulings. However, the Government has submitted constitutional amendments to un-
 dermine major Supreme Court rulings or anticipated rulings. For example, Amend-
 ment 11 changed the Constitution to allow corporal punishment of minors after the
 Supreme Court ruled that caning of minors constituted cruel and inhumane punish-
 ment, and asserted the constitutionality of hanging in anticipation of a CCJP test
 case challenging hanging as a method of execution. Amendment 12 declared that the
 courts did not have jurisdiction to determine questions of compensation for compul-
 sory acquisition of land. Amendment 13, tabled just weeks after the Supreme Court
 ruled that long incarceration on death row constituted cruel and and inhumane pun-
 ishment, declared that neither treatment of prisoners nor delays in carrying out
 their sentences entitle prisoners to a stay or remission of sentence. The Amenment
 will apply retroactively. It was the third amendment in a row drafted to undermine
 a Supreme Court ruling or anticipated ruling. In addition, President Mugabe in-
 vokedthe Presidential Powers Act to overturn a High Court eviction order in a civil
 case. Legal practitioners feared the use of the Act in a civil case set a dangerous
 precedent. In July President Mugabe declared that if the courts sought to interfere
 with implementation of the Land Acquisition Act, the Government would ignore the
 ruling and "declare a unilateral declaration of independence" on the land.
 
 
 337
 There were no political prisoners at year's end. However, the CCJP remained con-
 cerned about 32 former PF-ZAPU guerrillas convicted of particularly serious crimes,
 such as murder who were not beneficiaries of the 1990 general amnesty.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution formally protects citizens from arbitrary search or entry, and after the
 lifting of the state of emergency (SOE) in June 1990, these protections have been
 generally respected. It is widely known, however, that the Government monitors pri-
 vate correspondence and telephones, particularly international communications.
 Although the need for land reform in Zimbabwe is almost universally accepted,
 implementation of the 1992 Land Acquisition Act denies farmers whose lands have
 been designated for acquisition adequate due process; they may only appeal the
 amount of compensation in administrative courts, not the decision to acquire their
 farms.
 Commercial farmers are overwhelmingly white; as a result the Act has been im-
 plemented de facto along racial lines. Designations of most black "emergent farm-
 ers" have been dropped, and President Mugabe referred to white farmers as "racist
 settlers." Questioned on implementatiom of the Act, he attacked representatives of
 concerned governments as "racial bigots from countries whose red Indians, Eskimos,
 and blacks are discriminated against." In some cases, land has been designated for
 acquisition to achieve political goals. The designation of former Member of Par-
 liament (M.P.) Henry Ellsworth's farm is a particularly egregious example. His farm
 (and home) were designated shortly after press reports alleged that he required 24
 women caught stealing firewood on his property to remove their clothes as punish-
 ment. Minister of Lands, Agriculture and Water Development Kumbirai Kangai
 publicly defended the decision to designate Ellsworth's farm by terming it "due pun-
 ishment" and stating that it was the "quickest tool to achieve the desired result."
 The farms of Ndabaningi Sithole and James Chikerema, political opponents of the
 ruling party, were designated in April. However, a commission on land tenure was
 established in November, and the Government and commercial farmers began a con-
 structive dialog on land issues.
 The Government evicted over 2,500 squatter families in 1993, often without pro-
 viding adequate alternative arrangements. In October the ZRP moved in force to
 evict the 4,000 residents of opposition ZANU-Ndonga leader Ndabaningi Sithole's
 Churu Farm. The Government made almost no provision for their alternative settle-
 ment. Senior Minister of Local Government, Rural and Urban Development Joseph
 Msika said Churu Farm residents should "go and join their homeless colleagues in
 the streets" and then apply to his Ministry for aid. With the assistance of
 Zimbabwean human rights groups, Churu Farm residents appealed against the Gov-
 ernment's eviction order. The High Court ruled that the evictions were illegal be-
 cause the Government had not given residents 90 days' notice. At year's end, the
 situation was a stand-off: Police remained encamped at the farm, and nearly 1,000
 families were living in makeshift huts along the road, afraid to return to their
 homes.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion but allows for legislation to limit this freedom in the "interest of defense, public
 safety, public order, state economic interests, public morality, and public health." In
 practice, there are significant restrictions. At public events it is generally assumed
 that speakers are under surveillance and may be subject to follow-up questioning
 by the CIO if their remarks are judged too controversial.
 Zimbabwe's major print media (seven English-language newspapers and one ver-
 nacular broadsheet) belong to the Mass Media Trust, a holding company heavily in-
 fluenced by the Government and ruling party. In May the Government ruledout
 the possibility of privatizing the cash-strapped Zimbabwe Inter-Africa News Agency
 (Ziana Wire Service). The Government influences mainstream media through indi-
 rect ownership, editorial appointments, directives to editors, and removal of way-
 ward editors. There is no opposition press per se, but a small independent press,
 consisting primarily of a daily, an economic weekly, two Sunday tabloids, and three
 monthly magazines, carefully monitors government policies and opens its pages to
 opposition critics. Other minor independent publications exist, with circulations
 under 3,000 and varying frequencies. Despite its harsh public attacks on many of
 these publications, the Government has taken no overt punitive measures against
 them, but there is a high degree of self-censorship aggravated by antidefamation
 laws which make no distinction between public and private persons.
 Radio and television are entirely government owned and controlled. In May the
 Zimbabwe Broadcast Co    ration (BC) refused to run p aid Forum Party advertise-
 ments and announcements of meetings. When pressed or a written reason why the
 
 
 338
 advertisements could not be purchased, the ZBC reversed the decision. Opposition
 party rallies and press conferences receive only limited television or radio coverage.
 In July President Mugabe rejected the possibility of allowing an independent broad-
 casting station, stating "you don't know what propaganda they are going to broad-
 cast."
 Academic freedom remained curtailed by the University of Zimbabwe and the Na-
 tional University of Science and Technology Amendment Acts (1990) which greatly
 restrict the independence of these universities from government influence and ex-
 tend the disciplinary powers of the university authorities against staff and students.
 However, in April the Supreme Court ruled that three Umversity of Zimbabwe stu-
 dents expelled for their part in May 1992 student demonstrations should be rein-
 stated. There were no major student demonstrations in 1993. Students at the Na-
 tional University of Science and Technology in Bulawayo protested the slow dis-
 bursement of government finds for campus expansion, but the demonstrations were
 poorly organized and supported.
 b. Freeom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution formally pro-
 vides for the right of assembly and association for political and nonpolitical organi-
 zations, including a broad spectrum  of economic, social, professional, and rec-
 reational activities. There are several active political parties and human rights orga-
 nizations, as well as 35 trade unions. The formation of unions and political parties
 is not restricted. In law and in practice, however, serious obstacles prevent the full
 exercise of this right, particularly in the case of political associations. The broadest
 authority for restricting these freedoms is contained in the LOMA. Since the lifting
 of the SOE, the Government has relied on the LOMA to limit freedom of association
 or assembly, invoking the Act five times in the first 2 months of 1993. Organizations
 are generally free of governmental interference as long as their activities are viewed
 as nonpolitical.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is respected in Zimbabwe.
 There is no state religion. Denominations are permitted to worship openly, pursue
 social and charitable activities, and maintain ties with affiliates and coreligionists
 abroad.
 Religious belief is neither a handicap nor an advantage in terms of professional
 or political advancement.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Travel at home and abroad is not generally subject to official restric-
 tions although in the past restrictions were occasionally applied to prevent antici-
 pated criticism of the Government before foreign audiences. There were no reports
 of restrictions in 1993. Zimbabwean-born people do not have automatic right of re-
 turn. Zimbabwean women may not confer citizenship or even apply for automatic
 residence registration for their spouses and children.
 According to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), in
 1993 the registered   refugee  population  was estimated   at 140,000, mostly
 Mozambicans. The Government permitted UNHCR officials unrestricted access to
 Mozambican refugee camps. Another 100,000 Mozambicans, many of them migrant
 farmers, were self-settled in rural areas in the east. The Government announced in
 September that it intended to repatriate 70,000 Mozambican refugees, but only
 9 300 had been repatriated by year's end. The refugees are being screened by the
 LfNCR. No instances of refoulement (summary repatriation to a country where a
 refugee claims to fear persecution) were reported in 1993.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the legal right to change their government through democratic
 means, but the March 1990 presidential and parliamentary elections--with intimi-
 dation by the security forces, lopsided media coverage, inaccuracies in the voters'
 rolls, and irregularities in some constituencies-called into question their ability to
 exercise that right. The ruling party captured 117 of the 120 seats in those elec-
 tions; as a result, there is still no effective parliamentary opposition.
 President Mugabe and his Cabinet are the preeminent political figures, and the
 ruling party, ZANU-PF, is the dominant political organization in the country. Fol-
 lowing the amendment of the Constitution in 1987 to create a strong executive pres-
 idency, Robert Mugabe, who previously served as Prime Minister, became in 1988
 both the Head of State and the Head of Government. The Executive President was
 elected in 1990 to a term of 6 years. The President appoints both vice presidents
 and the rest of the Cabinet, who serve at his pleasure.
 The Political Parties Funding Act inhibits the development of opposition parties
 by providing government funding only to those parties which have more than 15
 parliamentary seats. No other party will be able to secure 15 seats before the 1995
 
 
 339
 national elections; opposition parties currently hold only 3 of the 150 seats in
 Zimbabwe's Parliament. The 1993-94 budget provides $4.6 million in public funding
 for ZANU-PF, up from $3.1 million in 1992-93.
 The net result of several constitutional amendments was to concentrate power in
 the executive branch of government. As in many countries with a Westminster sys-
 tem, if an M.P. "crosses the floor," e.g., changes his party allegiance, or is declared
 by his party to have ceased to represent its interests in Parliament by being critical
 o itsplicies, or is expelled from that party (perhaps for activities totally unrelated
 to performance as a parliamentarian), such an M.P. immediately loses his seat and
 a by-election has to be held. This provision makes M.P.'s more submissive to the
 party line. However, a small group of backbenchers in the Parliament vigorously
 confronted the Government on a number of issues ranging from corruptin to
 parastatal management and water projects in 1993.
 Problems with the voter rolls and intimidation of voters and candidates marred
 pariamentary by-elections and district council elections in 1993. Credible reports
 held that CIO agents told voters in Matabeleland that the infamous 'Fifth Brigade"
 (which left a trail of murder and torture there in the mid-1980's) would return if
 they did not vote for ZANU-PF. Rural dwellers reported that government agents
 told them      would not be eligible to receive drought relief if they supportedthe
 opposition. ZIMRIGHTS expressed concern over allegations of intimidation by secu-
 rity forces of an independent candidate i the Matobo by-election. The Mimatry of
 Local Government, Rural and Urban Development stated it was investigating com-
 plaints that several rural district council elections were conducted improperly. How-
 ever, no report had been issued by year's end.
 Problems with the voter rolls meant that hundreds were turned away during the
 by-elections. The Registrar General of Voters' Office worked to update the voter rolls
 before the 1995 election; according to Ministry of Home Affairs officials, there were
 1 million eligible voters whose names had not been added to the rolls, and as many
 as 30 percent of those on the current rolls were redundant. Members of Parliament
 and opposition party members complained that copies of the voter roll were not
 made available to them.
 Opposition party members were subject to occasional CIO harassment. Several op-
 position party leaders lost, or were threatened with losing, their jobs. The discovery
 of a listening device at the Forum's national convention in March was widely re-
 ported in the press.
 The Constitution provides for one person, one vote, and any one over the age of
 18 is eligible to register to vote in general elections. The Government amalgamated
 rural and district councils in an attempt to end white farm owner domination of the
 councils in rural areas.
 In metropolitan areas save Bulawayo, in the wealthy suburbs only homeowners
 may vote, though in high density urban areas renters may vote in city council elec-
 tions. Wealthy areas are accorded 1 council representative per 3,000 voters, while
 high density districts have 1 council person per 8,000 voters.
 Women participate in politics without restriction. Eight female ministerial-level
 appointees servedin 1993, but of the 150 M.P.'s, only 16 were women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government permits private local human rights groups to operate in
 Zimbabwe. However, it monitors their activities, in particular those of the CCJP
 which investigates complaints from private persons about human rights abuses and
 conveys its findings to the Government. Other groups which promote human rights
 include ZIMRIGHTS, the Southern African Human Rights Foundation (SAHRF),
 and the Harare-based Legal Resources Foundation which oversees the operation of
 the Bulawayo, Gweru, and Masvingo Legal Projects Centers with their libraries and
 information centers legal aid clinics, and paralegal programs.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) operates a regional office
 in Harare and cooperates with the UNHCR to assist Mozambican, South African,
 and other refugees.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Since independence the Government has enacted major laws aimed at
 enhancing women's rights and countering certain traditional practices, some of
 which are based on the view of women as dependents or minors. For example, the
 Legal Age of Majority Act and the Matrimonial Causes Act recognize the capacity
 of women to act independently of their husbands or fathers to own property. Judges
 on the High Courts have adjudicated cases upholding women's rights, including the
 
 
 340
 right to inherit property. The Government and women's rights groups circulated a
 white paper on a draft inheritance law, soliciting comments from a cross-section of
 Zimbabweans and holding meetings to inform (particularly rural) women about
 their rights. The right of a woman to procure or receive government-provided con-
 traceptives without her husband's written permission was recently accepted.
 Nevertheless, many women remain disadvantaged in Zimbabwean society. Igno-
 rance of reforms, illiteracy, economic dependency, and prevailing social norms pre-
 vent rural women in particular from benefiting equally from these changes. Despite
 legal prohibitions, women are still vulnerable to entrenched customary practices
 which operate against their personal rights. Among these persistent practices are
 "kuzvarira," the practice of pledging a young woman to marriage with a partner not
 of her choosing; "ukungena," the custom of forcing a widow to marry her late hus-
 band's brother; "lobola, the customary obligation of a groom to pay a bride price
 to the parents of a would-be wife; and "ngozi," the customary practice of offering
 a young girl as compensatory payment in interfamily disputes.
 As noted above, legal education and vigorous prosecution of offenders significantly
 reduced the practices of ukungena and refusing to bury a woman until lobola is
 paid.
 A considerable expansion of the nation's educational system resulted in an in-
 crease in the absolute number of girls being educated but did not alter the pattern
 of male domination of the higher levels of education. Though legislation prohibits
 discrimination in employment on the basis of gender, women are concentrated in the
 lower echelons of the work force and in urban areas face harassment in the work-
 place. Fear of losing employment often prevents women from reporting sexual har-
 assment at work.
 Domestic violence against women, especially wife beating, is common and crosses
 all racial and economic lines in Zimbabwe. Consequently, several social welfare or-
 ganizations, including the Harare-based Musasa Project, organized counseling and
 researh programs aimed at stemming violence against women. Women's rights
 monitors have noted that every police station in Zimbabwe has handled at least one
 case of a woman killed by her husband. In 1992, 4,437 official complaints of wife
 battering were filed. The Government assigned to police precincts community rela-
 tions liaison officers to counsel victims of battering and sexual assault. Press reports
 indicated, however, that community relations officers sometimes attempted to dis-
 suade women from pressing charges against their husbands. The Women's Action
 Grou      ed police to improve their services by giving women who have been raped
 aful ?expanation of court procedures and possble defense attorney tactics before
 they appear in court.
 Chidren.-The Government has a Ministry of Health and Child Welfare. The
 Children's Protection and Adoption Act, as well as the Guardianship of Minors Act,
 the Infant Act, and the Deceased Person's Maintenance Act, were all enacted to pro-
 tect the legal rights of minor children. The criminal justice system has special provi-
 sions for dealing with juveniles. Although there is no compulsory age for education,
 primary school attendance increased by more than 400 percent since independence.
 However, with the reintroduction of school fees in urban schools and rural second-
 ary schools enrollment has declined. In 1993 the Government began to take steps
 to combat the increasingly serious "street kids" problem.
 The most recent police figures show that, during 1992 964 reports of rape we.e
 made to the police countrywide the majority involving girls under 14.
 According to press reports, tie initiation rites still practiced by the small Remba
 ethnic group include infibulation, an extreme form of female genital mutilation.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Government services are provided on a non-
 discriminatory basis, and the Government has sought to expand and improve the
 previously "whites only" infrastructure in urban areas to provide health and social
 services to all citizens. In many rural areas, however, the neglect of the
 preindependence period continued to inhibit provision of minimal care. In social
 terms, Zimbabwe remains a racially stratified country despite legal prohibitions
 against official discrimination. Schools, churches, and clubs are all integrated. Social
 interaction among racial groups is limited but increasing.
 People with Disabilities.-The Disabled Persons Act passed in April specifically
 prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in employment, admission
 to public places, or provision of services. In practice, however, lack of resources for
 traiiing and education severely hamper the ability of disabled people to compete for
 scarce jobs. Although the Act stipulates that access for disabled persons should be
 provided to government buildings after a request for access facilities has been made
 to the Disabled Persons Board and the Board has inspected the building and rec.
 ommended adjustments for disabled access, few government buildings now provide
 accessto the disabled.

 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Labor Relations Act (LRA) provides private sec-
 tor workers freedom of association, the right to elect their own representatives, pub-
 lish newsletters, and set programs and policies which reflect the political and eco-
 nomic interests of labor. Workers are free to form or join unions without prior au-
 thorization. The LRA allows for the existence of multiple unions per industry. pro-
 vided that each is registered with the Ministry of Public Service, Labor, and Social
 Welfare (MPSLSW). While the Government may deregister individual unions,
 Zimbabwe's High Court has ruled that the LRA does not give the Minister the
 ower to suspend or deregister the national umbrella labor confederation, the
 imbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU). According to the LRA, any "interested
 person" may apply for the reconsideration of a trade union's registration. According
 to the Act, such an application may be lodged if a union "no longer represents the
 interest or area for which it was registered" or "has failed to perform any of its func-
 tions" in terms of the Act. After holding required hearings on the complaint, the reg-
 istrar may vary, suspend, or rescind the union's registration.
 Less than 20 percent of the salaried work force belongs to the 35 unions which
 form the ZCTU. Its officers are elected by the delegates of affiliated trade unions
 at congresses held every 5 years. While the ZCTU's formation was encouraged by
 the Government to be the labor arm of ZANU-PF, the Government no longer influ-
 ences its actions. Few of its founding members are still active in the trade union
 movement, and the ZCTU and the Government have increasingly clashed on eco-
 nomic and political issues. Although the LRA allows for the formation of multiple
 national federations none but the ZCTU exists. Some unions, however, choose not
 to affiliate with the CTU.
 Public servants and their associations (the Public Service Association (PSA), the
 Zimbabwe Teachers Association, and the Zimbabwe Nurses Association) are not cov-
 ered by the provisions of the LRA (according to section 3 of the Act) since their con-
 ditions of employment are provided for under the Constitution. They are thus con-
 stitutionally barred from forming unions, and their associations are likewise forbid-
 den from affiliating with the ZCTU.
 One year after the passage of the controversial Labor Relations Amendment Act
 (LRAA) the Government circulated copies of a new labor act drafted by the Inter-
 national Labor Organization (ILO). The draft is intended to streamline provisions
 of the Labor Relations Act while extending its coverage to the public sector.
 The LRA specifies that workers may establish worker committees, which exist
 side by side with unions, in each plant. Worker committees must also be registered
 with the Ministry, which is free to refuse registration. Trade union officials and oth-
 ers hold that the existence of workers' committees, which were strengthened by the
 1992 amendments, dilutes the unions' authority. Nonetheless, the ZCTU grew
 stronger in 1993, and the Government appeared less inclined to challenge it directly.
 The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) has criticized
 "Zimbabwean labor legislation" for giving "wide scope to the authorities to declare
 that a given enterprise or industry constitutes an essential service, and then impose
 a ban on it.' Workers in sectors deemed "nonessential" have the right to strike pro-
 vided the union advises the Government 2 weeks in advance of its intention to do
 SO.
 Only a handful of short-lived strikes took place during 1993. A dispute over work-
 ing conditions and management at Dalny Mine in April resulted in the deaths of
 four persons after police fired on a crowd of protestors.
 The ZCTU and its officials are free to associate with international labor organiza-
 tions and do so actively. The ZCTU is affiliated with the ICFTU and the Southern
 African Trade Union Coordinating Council. The African American Labor Center
 (AALC) maintains a regional office based in Harare. The AALC's American rep-
 resentative was granted a 2-year temporary employment permit as he had re-
 quested.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The LRA provides workers
 with the right to organize. As originally enacted, the Act was silent on the right
 to bargain collectively. However, 1992 amendments permit worker committees to
 perform functions normally reserved for trade unions, e.g., negotiating collective
 agreements and codes of conduct. The worker committees, which are by law not or-
 ganically part of the unions or the ZCTU, are empowered to negotiate with the man-
 agement of a particular plant the conditions of labor in the workplace, except for
 wages.
 The LLRA prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers against union members.
 Complaints of such discrimination are referred to labor relations officers and may
 subsequently be adjudicated by the Labor Relations Tribunal. Such complaints are
 handled under the mechanism for resolving cases involving "unfair labor practices."
 
 
 342
 The determining authority may direct that workers fired due to antiunion discr.-"*
 nation be reinstated.
 Wage negotiations take place on an industrywide basis between the relev".-
 union and employer organization sitting in joint employment boards or councils.
 These bodies submit their agreements to the Registrar in the Ministry for approval
 and the Government retains the power to veto agreements it believes would harm
 the economy. As part of its economic recovery program, the Government announced
 in 1990 the commencement of free collective bargaining between workers and em-
 ployers. In 1992 the Ministry endorsed the wage and sal ary recommendations of all
 46 employment boards. However, as noted above, the role of the worker committees
 impges on traditional trade union bargaining rights.
 mg 1993 public and private sector workers criticized Minister of Public Service
 John Nkomo for calling for wage restraint in his annual wage policy statement.
 Workers argued that the Minister's statement interfered with the collective bargain-
 ing process.
 When no trade union represents a specific sector, representatives of the organized
 workers, i.e., the professional associations meet with the employers' association
 under the mediation of labor officers from the Ministry. Public sector wages are de-
 termined by the Salary Service Department of the Ministry, subject to the approval
 of the Public Service Commission (PSC). Each year, representatives of the PSC (em-
 ployers) and the PSA (employees) hold consultations on wages and benefits. These
 consultations result in a recommendation which is forwarded to the Minister of Pub-
 lic Service, Labor, and Social Welfare. The Minister is not required by law to accept
 the recommendation and, in fact, in both 1992 and 1993 granted wage increases sig-
 nificantly lower than the PSC/PSA recommendation.
 So-called managerial employees are excluded from union membership and thus
 from the the collective bargaining process. The presence of the ZCTU or specific na-
 tional unions in individual shop-floor negotiations is not mandated.
 The Labor Relations Amendment Act streamlined the procedure for adjudicating
 disputes by abolishing the hearing officer level and the Labor Relations Board and
 strengthening the Labor Relations Tribunal (LRT). Now, labor relations officers
 hear a dispute; their judgment may be appealed to regional labor relations officers;
 then the LRT may hear the case- and ultimately it may be appealed to the Supreme
 Court. In 1993 the Government Alled long vacant positions on the LRT, but the LRT
 boards were not fully staffed and faced a substantial backlog at year's end.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Compulsory labor is prohibited by
 law and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Zimbabwean law affords little pro-
 tection to working children. There is no specific legal prohibition of child labor, the
 LRA only states that contracts of employment shall not be enforceable against any
 person under the age of 16 years. The Government is working with the ILO on new
 child labor legislation. While child labor is most prevalent in the agricultural sector,
 an increasing number of children can be found working in the informal sector. In
 the manufacturing sector, minimum age regulations are generally enforced by the
 Ministry of Public Service, Labor, and Social Welfare.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The maximum legal workweek is 54 hours, and
 the law prescribes a minimum of one 24-hour rest period per week. Workinq condi-
 tions are regulated by the Government according to industry. The Constitution em-
 powers the PSC to set conditions of employment in the public sector. Government
 regulations for each of the 22 industrial sectors specify minimum wages, hours, holi-
 days, and required safety measures. In recent years, as part of its effort to opt out
 of the wage bargaining system, the Government mandated wage parameters and
 specified minimum wage increases only for domestics and gardeners. Due to an inef-
 fective monitoring system, however, many such workers are remunerated below the
 minimum wage. The minimum wage for domestics and gardeners is the de facto
 minimum wage for Zimbabwe. As of November 15, it was set at $26 (Z$177) per
 month.
 The employer usually provides housing and food to workers. On commercial
 farms, the employer may provide schooling for the workers' children. The minimum
 wage is not sufficient to sustain a decent standard of living, and the lowest paid
 workera received a 1993 wage increase which covered less than one-half of the 28-
 percent inflation rate. Minimum wage rates in those sectoral collective bargaining
 agreements for 1993 which had been concluded by mid-December range from $26
 (Z$177) to $71 (Z$484) in the manufacturing sector. Labor relations officers from the
 Ministry are assigned to monitor developments in each plant to assure that govern-
 ment minimum wage policy and occupational health and safety regulations are ob-
 served.
 
 
 343
 Safety in the workplace is a major problem, due primarily to too few inspectors.
 Furthermore, many of the basic legal protections do not apply to the vast majority
 of the farm, mine, and domestic workers. Unions charge that there are no general
 standards for the work environment, such as threshold limits for manually lifted
 weights or conditions for pregnant workers. Health and safety standards are deter-
 mined only on an industry-specific basis. The Government intervenes on a selected
 basis and sets standards by regulation in some industries. In theory workers have
 a legal right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy
 to continued employment.
