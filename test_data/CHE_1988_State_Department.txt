 SWITZERLAND
 Switzerland is a constitutional democracy with a federal
 structure. Federal legislative power is vested in a bicameral
 legislature. The Constitution ensures all basic freedoms.
 Initiative and referendum procedures provide avenues for
 significant changes in policy through direct action. Given
 its linguistic and religious diversity, Switzerland has
 developed a political system based on considerable autonomy
 for individual cantons and on local and national political
 consensus.
 Switzerland has a mature free enterprise industrial and
 service economy highly dependent on international trade.
 There has been virtually full employment, and labor peace, for
 many years. The standard of living is very high, and there is
 little poverty. While not prepared to accept t'he limitations
 on its international relations and internal constitutional
 practices that European Economic Community (EEC) membership
 would entail, Switzerland seeks harmonious and close relations
 with the EEC in the framework of a general policy of
 international free trade.
 There were no domestic human rights problems of any
 significance during 1988. Switzerland traditionally serves as
 host for many international organizations and conferences
 concerned with humanitarian law and human rights, including
 the International Labor Organization and the International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which is staffed by Swiss
 nationals.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of abductions, secret arrests, or
 clandestine detention.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution provides freedom from all of the above; there
 were no allegations of any violations. In November 1987,
 Switzerland signed the European Convention Against Torture;
 the Federal Council in 1988 recommended ratification by
 Parliament, and no objection is anticipated.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile is provided
 by law. A detained person may not be held longer than 24
 hours without a warrant of arrest issued by the magistrate
 conducting the preliminary investigation. A suspect must
 immediately be shown the warrant and has the right to contact
 legal counsel as soon as a warrant is issued. A suspect may
 be detained with a warrant until an investigation is
 completed, but the length of investigative detention is always
 reviewed by higher judicial authority, and investigations are

 SWITZERLAND
 typically completed quickly. Bail, or release on personal
 recognizance, is granted unless the examining magistrate
 believes the person is a danger to society or will not appear
 for trial. There is no summary exile, nor is exile used as a
 means of political control, although non-Swiss convicted of
 crixres may receive sentences which include denial of reentry
 for a specified period following completion of a prison
 sentence.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for public trials. All courts of
 first instance are cantonal courts, with right of appeal to
 the Federal courts and freedom from interference by other
 branches of government. Minor cases are tried by a single
 judge, difficult cases by a panel of judges, and murder or
 other serious crimes by a public jury. Even the most serious
 cases are usually brought to trial within a few months. There
 are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There were no allegations of violations of this nature by
 Swiss authorities.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a
 functioning democratic political system combine to ensure
 freedom of speech and press. The only limitation on freedom
 of speech or press would involve groups or associations
 determined to be a potential threat to the State; no groups or
 associations are so designated at the present time. Broadcast
 media are government funded but possess editorial autonomy,
 and foreign broadcast media are freely available. Press and
 publishing are private enterprises operated without government
 intervention. Academic freedom is unimpaired by any official
 restrictions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The only restriction on peaceful assembly and association is a
 requirement to obtain permits from police authorities before
 holding public meetings. These are rarely refused unless
 authorities have reason to believe the meeting will lead to
 violence. There was continuing critical discussion in public,
 including an adverse report of a parliamentary inquiry,
 concerning an incident in 1987 when an antinuclear
 demonstration in Bern became violent and resulted in the
 widespread use of tear gas, clashes between police and
 demonstrators, and property damage in downtown Bern. Police
 response to demonstrations during 1988 was much more
 restrained and engendered no similar criticism.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.

 c. Freedom of Religion
 Switzerland enjoys religious freedom. The legal requirement
 for universal male military service thus far provides no
 exemption for conscientious objectors. They may apply for
 military service which does not entail bearing arms, but
 refusal to serve has in the past nearly always led to
 conviction. Efforts continued during 1988 to develop
 alternative service for those claiming exemption for reasons
 of conscience. Amnesty International has expressed concern at
 the practice of prosecuting conscientious objectors.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Swiss citizens have freedom to travel in or outside the
 country and can emigrate without difficulty. Switzerland was
 traditionally a haven for refugees, but concern over demands
 upon public services by growing numbers of asylum seekers has
 tempered public support for liberal asylum. Laws approved in
 1987 and implemented in 1988 were intended to improve
 procedures for processing asylum requests and expediting the
 departure of unsuccessful applicants. However, flows of
 asylum seekers who are economic migrants, in particular large
 numbers of Turks in 1988, have continued to make these
 government efforts difficult. Once they gain entrance,
 refugees are treated well pending disposition of their
 applications for asylum and permanent residence. Occasionally,
 immigrants attempting to enter illegally were intercepted at
 the Swiss borders and sent back to countries they passed
 through (especially Turks seeking to enter via Italy).
 The Swiss public generally remains willing to assist political
 refugees. Federal and cantonal actions reflect a popular
 consensus that Switzerland should continue to adhere to a
 narrow definition of the eligibility criteria for asylum, and
 that the Government should maintain its efforts to limit the
 influx of foreigners. The issue was not the subject of
 significant political debate in Switzerland during 1988.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Switzerland is a highly developed constitutional democracy.
 There is universal adult suffrage by secret ballot in Federal
 elections. Elections are free and contested actively by four
 major national parties and at least a dozen significant
 regional or minor parties. Initiative and referendum
 procedures provide unusually intense popular oversight of, and
 involvement in, the legislative process. Participation by
 women in politics historically has been limited but continues'
 to expand slowly. Thirty-three of 246 members of the Federal
 Assembly (parliament) are women, and since 1984 a woman has
 served on the 7-member Federal Council, the nation's executive
 body. One of the smallest and most rural of the 26 cantons
 still excludes female suffrage at the cantonal level.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Switzerland cooperates with international and nongovernmental
 groups in all areas of human rights. The ICRC is made up of
 Swiss nationals, and Swiss play prominent roles in other
 humanitarian nongovernmental organizations. Local chapters of
 
 
 1196
 SWITZERLAND
 Amnesty International and other human rights advocacy groups
 are active but concern themselves almost exclusively with
 lobbying the Swiss and other governments about human rights
 situations in other countries. During 1988 the European Court
 of Human Rights found against Switzerland in a case of a
 complaint by a woman who alleged that her legal rights had
 been violated by an investigating magistrate.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based On Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Participation by women in the business world has been limited
 historically but continues to expand slowly. Women are still
 subject to a diminishing number of legal disabilities, but
 discrimination is typically social, not legal. Women are
 often paid less than men for equal work and remain
 underrepresented in senior positions in industry, banking, and
 trade.
 Italian and Romansch linguistic minorities (respectively about
 10 and 1 percent of the population) express concern that the
 limited resources made available to them by the Federal
 Government endanger the continued intellectual vitality of
 these languages. Some argue that this amounts to deprivation
 of freedom of speech. The Federal Government's announced
 policy is to ensure, through careful apportionment of funds,
 that all linguistic groups have commensurate facilities and
 means to carry out cultural activities in their own
 languages. Employment opportunities and residence permits are
 limited for foreigners; some assert that this reflects racial
 prejudice and discrimination, but these limitations apply to
 all non-Swiss. There is no discrimination on religious
 grounds.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have freedom to associate freely, to join unions of
 their choice, and to select their own representatives. Unions
 are free to publicize views and determine their own programs
 and policies to represent member interests without government
 interference. The right to strike is legally unfettered, but
 a unique labor peace agreement between unions and employers
 has provided a nearly strike-free environment for over 50
 years.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Swiss law provides workers the right to organize and bargain
 collectively and protects workers from acts of antiunion
 discrimination. The industrial sector is generally unionized;
 in the service sector, union membership is less general. The
 Government encourages voluntary negotiations between employer
 and worker organizations, although for the most part employers
 and workers alike (in common with most Swiss institutions)
 seek successfully to exclude the Government from involving
 itself in their affairs. Labor law and practice are uniformly
 applied throughout the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced or compulsory labor.

 d. Mimimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment of children is 15 years.
 Children over 13 may be employed in light duties (e.g.,
 helping in retail stores) for not more than 9 hours a week
 during the school year and 15 hours otherwise. Employment
 between ages 15 and 20 is strictly regulated; for example,
 youths may not work at night, on Sundays, or under hazardous
 or dangerous conditions. These laws are observed in practice.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no national minimum wage. Employer associations and
 unions negotiate industrial wages during the collective
 bargaining process. The Labor Act established a maximum
 45-hour'workweek for blue- and white-collar workers in
 industry, offices, and retail trades, and a 50-hour workweek
 for all other workers. The workweek for blue-collar workers
 in most industries is 43 hours and for white-collar workers 40
 to 43 hours. Overtime is limited by law to 120 hours annually.
 The economy is normally at or near full employment. The
 conjunction of wage rates and hours worked results in enough
 income to provide Swiss workers and their families with a
 standard of living among the highest in the world. There is
 little poverty except in unusual situations such as those of
 certain foreign residents. The Labor Act and the Federal Code
 of Obligations contain extensive regulations to protect worker
 health and safety. Special provisions exist for female
 workers, who may not be employed for dangerous work or, in
 industrial enterprises, at night or on Sundays. There were no
 allegations of worker rights abuses from any domestic or
 foreign source.
