 ST. KITTS AND NEVIS
 St. Kitts and Nevis, a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, is a small two-
 island state with a democratic, parliamentary form of government. The Constitution
 provides the smaller island of Nevis considerable self-government, as well as the
 right to secede from the Federation if certain enumerated procedures are followed.
 The country is governed by a Prime Minister, a Cabinet, and a Legislative Assem-
 bly. General elections must be called at least every 5 years. The Governor General,
 with largely ceremonial duties, is the titular Head of State. In national elections
 held on November 29, Prime Minister Kennedy Simmonds and his People's Action
 Movement won four parliamentary seats. The St. Kitts Labor Party, led by Dr.
 Denzil Douglas, also won four seats and polled a majority of the popular votes. How-
 ever, Prime Minister Simmonds formed a coalition with the Nevis Reformation
 Party to retain control of the Government.
 Security forces consist of a small police force, which includes a 50-person Special
 Services Unit that receives some light infantry training, and a small coast guard.
 The police were unable to contain violence after the disputed elections, but members
 of the Regional Security System (RSS) from neighboring Eastern Caribbean islands
 restored order.
 St. Kitts and Nevis has a mixed economy based on sugar cane, tourism, and light
 industry. Most commercial enterprises are privately owned, but the sugar industry
 (the country's largest economic enterprise) and 85 percent of all arable land are
 owned by a state corporation. Economic growth continued at about 6 percent, due
 partly to agricultural exports and to investor confidence in plans to develop further
 a deep water port facility and the southeastern peninsula of St. Kitts.
 Human rights continued to be generally respected during 1993. However, the Gov-
 ernor General imposed a state of emergency following violent protest demonstra-
 tions over the appointment of the minority coalition Government. The 12-hour cur-
 few also imposed was gradually lifted, and the state of emergency was withdrawn
 after 14 days. The Government continued to restrict access of the political opposition
 to government-controlled media.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Derading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Law enforcement authorities abide by the constitutional prohibitions against the use
 of torture or other forms of inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Family
 members, attorneys, and clergy are permitted to visit detainees regularly.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention, and this provision is respected in practice. The law requires that
 persons detained be brought before a court within 48 hours. Even under the special
 powers granted during the 14-day state of emergency, detainees were afforded their
 constitutional rights to a court appearance within 48 hours. Few curfew violators
 were detained and less that 10 people were arrested in connection with the dem-
 onstrations.
 There were no reported cases of exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides that every person ac-
 cused of a crime must receive a fair, speedy, and public trial, and these require-
 ments are generally observed. The judiciary, a part of the Eastern Caribbean legal
 system  is highly regarded and independent. Final appeal ma. be made to the Privy
 Council in the United Kingdom. There are no military or political courts. Legal as-
 sistance is available for indigent defendants.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Neither
 the Government nor the police interfere arbitrarily in the private lives of individ-
 uals. Judicially issued warrants are required to search private homes.
 Section 2. Respect For Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and these provisions are, for the most part, respected in practice.
 However, the Government owns the only radio and television station on St. Kitts
 and these media generally did notpublicize adequately rallies and conventions held
 by the opposition political party.There is a religious television station and a pri-
 vately owned radio station on Nevis.
 St. Kitts and Nevis does not have a daily newspaper; each of the major political
 parties publishes a weekly or biweekly newspaper. The papers are free to criticize
 the Government and do so regularly and vigorously. International news publications
 are readily available.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly. Organized demonstrations, rllies, and public meet-
 ings sponsored by political parties occur regularly, usually taking place without gov-
 ernment interference. However, during 1993, opposition parties complained of gov-
 ernment intimidation at political rallies in the form of excessive police presence or
 armed nonparty supporters. After a postelection demonstration turned violent, the
 Government imposed a state of emergency. The state of emergency, aimed at crowd
 control and violence avoidance, prohibited public gatherings of more than two people
 and all political rallies. The state of emergency successfully quelled the violence and
 was suspended after 14 days.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for the free exercise of religion,
 and religious practices are not restricted. All groups are free to maintain links with
 coreligionists in other countries.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Travel inside and outside the country is unrestricted.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens are able to change their government by peaceful means. A vigorous
 multiparty political system exists in which political parties are free to conduct their
 activities. Periodic elections are held in which all citizens 18 years of age and older
 may register and vote by secret ballot.
 The Legislative Assembly has 11 elected seats; 8 for St. Kitts and 3 for Nevis.
 Before the November 29 elections, Prime Minister Kennedy Simmonds' People's Ac-
 tion Movement (PAM) held a majority of seats, but the dismissal of the Deputy
 Prime Minister following charges of corruption and growing support for the opposi-
 tion St. Kitts Labour Party created a hotly contested race for political leadership.
 The PAM won only four of eight seats at stake in St. Kitts and came in second in
 the popular vote. The St. Kitts Labour Party, led by Dr. Denzil Douglas, won the
 
 
 544
 remaining four seats and also polled a majority of the popular votes. The Concerned
 Citizens' Movement (CCM) won two of the three Nevis seats; the Nevis Reformation
 Party won the remaining one. Prime Minister Simmonds formed a coalition with the
 Nevis Reformation Party to retain control of the Government. However, since that
 coalition represents less than half of the total seats in parliament, it is vulnerable
 to a vote of no confidence by the combined opposition parties.
 The island of Nevis has considerable self-government and its own legislature. In
 1992 Vance Amory and the CCM won control of the Nevis Assembly by defeating
 the Nevis Reformation Party which was closely allied with the PAM. The two na-
 tional parliament seats won y the CCM in the November 29 election gave Amory
 the options of forming a government with either St. Kitts party or joining the
 Labour Party to support a successful no-confidence vote.
 Although there are no de facto or de jure impediments to the participation of
 women in leadership roles in government or political parties, St. Kitts and Nevis
 has only one female member of parliament. Women also hold such high government
 offices as permanent secretary and are active within the political parties.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While there are no governmental restrictions, no local human rights groups have
 been formed. There were no requests for investigations or visits by international
 human rights groups in 1993.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-The role of women in society is not restricted by law but is cir-
 cumscribed by culture and tradition. The Government created the Ministry of Wom-
 en's Affairs to help redefine the role of women in society, to ensure that women's
 rights are promoted and to provide counseling for abused women. According to a
 Ministry official, violence against women is a problem, but many women are reluc-
 tant to file complaints or pursue them in the courts. Despite this reluctance, there
 were publicly reported cases of both domestic violence and rape in 1993 and a few
 convictions. A special police unit works closely with the Ministry of Women's Affairs
 to investigate domestic violence and rape cases. The Government does not condone
 abuse of women and it is not a common practice.
 Children.-The Government has adopted through legislation most of the provi-
 sions of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child. An estimated 20 percent
 of national revenue is allocated to child development issues.
 People with Disabilities.-Although there is no legislation to protect the disabled
 or to mandate accessibility for them, the Government and the Constitution prohibit
 discrimination in employment, education, and other state services.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of all work-
 ers to form and belong to trade unions. The police, civil service, and other organiza-
 tions are permitted to have associations which serve as unions. The major labor
 union, the St. Kitts Trades and Labour Union, is affiliated with the opposition St.
 Kitts Labour Party and is active in all sectors of the economy. There is also an inde-
 pendent teachers' union, a union representing dockworkers in the capital city, and
 a taxi-drivers' association.
 The right to strike, while not specified by law, is well established and respected
 in practice. There were no major strikes in 1993. Unions are free to form federations
 or confederations and to affiliate with international organizations. The islands'
 unions maintain a variety of international ties.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively. -Labor unions are free to orga-
 nize and to negotiate for better wages and benefits for union members. Antiunion
 discrimination is prohibited, but employers found guilty are not required to rehire
 employees fired due to antiunion discrimination. However, the employer must pay
 lost wages and severance pay. There is no legislation governing the organization
 and representation of workers, and employers are not legally bound to recognize a
 union, vut in practice employers do so if a majority of workers polled wish to orga-
 nize. Collective bargaining takes place on a workplace-by-workplace basis, not in-
 dustry wide. The Labour Commission is prepared to mediate all types of disputes
 including over wages, rights, or interests, between labor and management on an ad
 hoc basis. In practice, however, few disputes actually go to the Commission for reso-
 lution. If neither the Commission nor the Minister of Labour can resolve the dis-
 pute, legislation allows for a case to be brought before a civil court.
 There are no export processing zones.
 
 
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution forbids slavery
 and forced labor, and they do not exist in practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Emploment of Children.-The minimum legal working age
 is 14. The Labour Ministry relies heavily on school truant officers and the Commu-
 nity Affairs Division to monitor compliance, which they do effectively. Local law
 mandates compulsory education up to the age of 16.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-iinimum wage rates for domestic servants
 and retail store employees were established by law in 1984 and updated in 1989.
 The minimum wage is $37.04 per week for domestic workers and $33.33 per day
 for skilled workers. These provide an adequate, though Spartan, living for a wage
 earner and family- many workers supplement wages by keeping small animals such
 as goats and chiciens. Most people live in extended families where there may be
 more than one wage earner. The Labour Commission undertakes regular wage in-
 spections and special investigations when complaints are received; employers round
 in violation are required to pay back wages.
 The law provides for a 42- to 44-hour workweek, but the common practice is 40
 hours in 5 days. Although not required by law, workers receive at least one 24-hour
 rest period per week. Workers are guaranteed a minimum annual vacation of 2
 weeks. While there are no specific health and safety regulations, the Factories Law
 provides general health and safety guidance to Labour Ministry inspectors. Disputes
 over safety conditions are settled by the Labour Commissioner.
