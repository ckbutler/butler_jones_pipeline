 CANADA
 Canada is a constitutional monarchy with a federal parliamentary form of govern-
 ment and an independent judiciary. Citizens periodically choose their representa-
 tives in free and fair multiparty elections.
 Elected civilian officials control the federal, provincial, and municipal police
 forces. The armed forces have no role in domestic law enforcement except in na-
 tional emergencies. Laws requiring the security forces to respect human rights are
 strictly observed, and violators are punished by the courts.
 Canada has a highly developed, market-based economic system. Laws extensively
 protect the well-being of workers and provide for workers freedom of association.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens. However,
 there were occasional complaints in some areas, primarily regarding discrimination
 against aboriginals, the disabled, and women. The Constitution and laws provide
 avenues for legal redress of such complaints. The Government and private organiza-
 tions seek to ensure that human rights are respected in practice at all levels of soci-
 ety and take steps to convict and punish human rights abusers. The Government
 has taken serious and active steps to address violence against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 An investigation was continui   at year's end into the 1995 police killing of an
 aboriginal activist at Ipperwash. Ontario (see Section 5).
 A civilian inquiry is continuing into the activities of a now disbanded Canadian
 militay regiment during its 1993 peacekeeping mission in Somalia. The inquiry is
 reviewing the entire mission, with its current focus on allegations of a coverup of
 regiment activities, including the 1993 killing of a Somali teenager in its custody.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits such practices, and the Government observes the prohibition in
 practice.
 Prison conditions generally meet minimum international standards, and the Gov-
 ernment permits visits by human rights monitors. As a result of an inquiry into a
 
 
 888
 1994 incident at the women's prison in Kingston, Ontario, the Federal Government
 announced steps it will take to protect the privacy of female prisoners and the ap-
 pointment of a deputy commissioner for corrections of women. The correctional serv-
 ice also changed its policy to ensure that no men will participate in strip searches
 of female inmates.
 Inmates of Toronto's Don jail complained of inhuman conditions resulting from
 overcrowding and inadequate health facilities. A report identified the following prob-
 lems: inadequate fire prevention controls; health hazards (including the risk of con-
 tracting tuberculosis and HIV) resulting from overcrowding, insufficient exercise
 and recreation facilities; and a lack of contact visits. Conditions were described as
 so depressing that some inmates purportedly pled guilty in order to be sent to other
 facilities and thus avoid awaiting trial in the jail.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest, deten-
 tion, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition. Lawyers for a Tamil
 refugee detained for over a year in a Toronto jail claimed that international stand-
 ards of fair trial and detention were contravened. The refugee is being held under
 the Immigration Act, which allows for the detention of an individual the Minister
 of Justice certifies is a possible member of a terrorist organization.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The law provides for an independent judiciary,
 and the Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary provides citi-
 zens with a fair and efficient judicial process and vigorously enforces the right to
 a fair trial.
 The court system is divided into federal and provincial courts, which handle both
 civil and criminal matters. The highest federal court is the Supreme Court, which
 exercises general appellate jurisdiction and advises on constitutional matters. The
 judicial system is based onEnglish common law at the federal level as well as in
 most provinces; in the province of Quebec, it is based on the Napoleonic Code.
 Throughout Canada judges are appointed. In criminal trials, the law provides for
 a presumption of innocence and the right to a public trial, to counsel (free for
 indigents), and to appeal.
 In October the Quebec provincial Government announced a wide-ranging public
 inquiry into the Quebec police force. The inquiry's mandate is to examine allegations
 of evidence tampering, witness intimidation, and bungled investigations. It was an-
 nounced after the judge who headed an internal investigation of the Quebec force
 resigned, terming inadequate a closed-door inquiry into a drug case that had been
 thrown out of court after allegations that police officers fabricated and tampered
 with evidence.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibi-
 tions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for freedom of speech and of
 the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An independent
 press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine
 to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.
 Journalists are occasionally banned from reporting some specific details of court
 cases until a trial is concluded, and these restrictions, adopted to ensure the defend-
 ant's right to a fair trial, enjoy wide popular support. Some restrictions on the
 media are imposed by provincial-level film censorship, broadcasters' voluntary codes
 curbing graphic violence, and laws against hate literature and pornography. The Ca-
 nadian Human Rights Act prohibits repeated communications by telephone that ex-
 pose a person or group to hatred or contempt. Human rights groups are exploring
 the possibility of extending this prohibition to the Intrnet.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.--The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom oReligion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 nractice.
 he Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees and extends first
 asylum. Canada is a resettlement country, and in 1995 the Government granted ref-
 ugee status and accepted for resettlement 9,611 persons (56 percent of all applicants
 for this status). From January to September 1996, the Government granted refugee
 
 
 889
 status to 7,409 applicants (47 percent of applicants). There were no reports of forced
 expulsion of those an a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, fre% and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 The Quebec superior court allowed a suit to proceed that would prevent the Que-
 bec government from holding another referendum on the sovereignty issue. The suit
 maintained that such an act would violate the Canadian Constitution and the filer's
 rights as a Canadian citizen. The suit was opposed by the Quebec government on
 grounds that the sovereignty question was a purely political one that could be de-
 cided only by the pple of Quebec and their National Assembly. In September the
 federal Minister of Justice referred to the Supreme Court the question of whether
 Quebec can unilaterally separate from Canada.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operate without government restriction,
 investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government offi-
 cials are very cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Charter of Rights and Freedoms provides for equal benefits and protection
 of the law regardless of race, national or ethnic origin, color, religion, sex, age, sex-
 ual orientation, or mental or physical disability. These rights are generally re-
 spected in practice, but there are occasional charges of discrimination within this
 multicultural society.
 Affirmative action (employment equity) legislation is a topic of some national and
 provincial debate. Federal employment equity legislation was passed by Parliament
 in December 1995, but the Ministry of Labor is still consulting on the regulations
 required by the act, and it has not yet entered into force. The legislation is designed
 to strengthen employment equity provisions for employees under federal jurisdic-
 tion.
 The Ontario Human Rights Commission was criticized for its enormous backlog
 of cases, three-quarters of which are employment based, and for the procedures used
 to reduce the backlog. The criticism included charges that cases were dismissed
 after commission-caused delays, that basic rules of evidence were not followed by
 commission staff, and that the investigative process was neither open nor account-
 able. The Commission was hampered by a 6 percent cut in its budget by the provin-
 cial government, despite the ruling Conservative Party's promise to increase the
 Commission's funding.
 The Constitution protects the linguistic and cultural rights of minorities. Despite
 Canada's federal policy of bilingualism, English speakers in Quebec and French
 speakers in other parts of Canada must generally live and work in the language
 of the majority.
 In Quebec language laws restrict access to English-language publicly-funded
 schools through grae 11 to children whose parents were educated in English in
 Canada and to short-term residents. The law stipulates that French is the working
 language of most businesses and must be predominant in bilingual commercial
 signage.
 In the summer, English-speaking activists successfully pressed several chain
 stores in Montreal to display more English signs. Some of these activists called for
 an end to all restrictions on the language of commercial signs and on access to Eng-
 lish-language public schools. French-speaking activists called on the provincial gov-
 ernment to do more to promote the use of French, e.g., by reinstituting a pre-1993
 law limiting commercial signs to French only, or by extending language laws relat-
 ing to schooling to grades 12 and 13. In the fall, the Quebec government considered
 legislation that would reconstitute a French-language inspection office abolished in
 1993.
 Provinces outside Quebec often lack adequate French-language schooling, which
 is of concern to local Francophones, although French-language schools are reported
 to be thriving in all three prairie provinces.
 Women.-The law prohits violence against women, including spousal abuse. The
 health and economic costs of violence against women have been calculated at $3.15
 billion (Can $ 4.2 billion) annually. Nevertheless, according to Statistics Canada, 3
 
 
 890
 in 10 women currently or previously married or living in a common-law relationship
 have experienced at least one incident of physical or sexual violence.
 In November the federal agency Status of Women Canada reported on Canadian
 initiatives to address violence against women, and in 1995-9W, Status of Women
 Canada provided approiately $1.9 million (Can $ 2.5 million) to women's groups
 to address the root causes of violence. A 5-year federal initiative on family violence
 begun in 1991 provided over $102 million (Can $ 136 million) for the funding of
 nearly 3,000 projects and the establishment of emergency shelters and longer-term
 housing for battered women.
 In June the federal/provincial-territorial ministers responsible for the status of
 women released a resource guide of provincial and territorial initiatives aimed at
 empowering women, youth, and children.
 The Criminal Code prohibits criminal harassment (stalking) and makes it punish-
 able by imprisonment for up to 5 years. In 1995 police departments reported 4,260
 charges of criminal harassment. IApril the Minister of Justie proposed amend-
 ments to the Code that would stregen the criminal harassment provisions. The
 proposals would require that a person convicted of stalking while under a restrain-
 ing order should have that fact treated as an aggravating aor in sentencing. Also,
 a person who commits murder while stalking and intends to make the victim fear
 for her safety or that of others could be found guilty of first murder without
 proof that the murder itself was planned and deliberate,
 Women are well represented in the labor force, including business and the profes-
 sions. The law prohibits sexual harassment, and the Government enforces this pro-
 vision.
 Women enjoy marriage and property rights equal to those of men. Over 85 percent
 of single parent households are headed by Women. Child support reforms that will
 take effect in 1996 and 1997 include: Amendments to the income tax act to elimi-
 nate child support from the custodial parent's taxable income and the tax deduction
 available to payers of child support; amendments to the divorce act to establish fair-
 er and more consistent child support payments; new measures to strengthen en-
 forcement; and an enhanced income supplement for lower-income families.
 Children.-The Government demonstrates its strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare through its well-funded systems of public education and medical
 care. Federal and provincial regulations protect children from abuse, overwork, and
 discrimination and duly penalize perpetrators of such offenses. There is no societal
 pattern of abuse of children.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no discrimination against disabled persons in
 employment, education, or in the provision of other state services. The law man-
 dates access to buildings for people with disabilities, and for the most part the Gov-
 ernment enforces these prvisions. However, human rights groups report that a sig-
 nificant percentage of their complaints come from those with disabilities. Disabled
 persons are underrepresented in the work force; for example, they make up 2.6 per-
 cent of the federally regulated private sector work force, but those capable of work-
 ing total 6.5 percent of the population.
 The national strategy for the integration of persons with disabilities concluded its
 5-year mandate in March. In 1995 the parliamenta  Committee on Human Rights
 and the Status of Disabled Persons concluded that the strategys programs had not
 had as much impact as they should have, in part because federal spendig on em-
 ployment programs and services for the disabled declined by $9 m on (Can $ 12
 million) since 1991.
 Indigenous People.-Canada's treatment of its aboriginal people continued to be
 one of the most important human rights issues facing the country. Disputes over
 land claims, self-government, treaty rights, taxation, duty-free imports, fishing and
 hunting rights and alleged harassment by police continued to be sources of tension
 on reserves. Aboriginal people remained underrepresented in the work force, over-
 represented on welfare rolls, and more susceptible to suicide and poverty than other
 population groups.
 r     years of work, the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples released its
 final report in November. The 3,537 page report proposes a 20-year strategy for re-
 building First Nations through restoring aboriginal communities and restructuring
 their relationship with the Government. The report's recommendations include the
 passage of parliamentary acts to address broken treaty promises, the establishment
 of an aboriginal legislative body that would function alongside the House of Com-
 mons and Senate, and the creation of an independent tribunal to monitor land
 claims.
 Although aboriginal leaders welcomed the report's recommendations, the Minister
 for Indian Affairs said that he believes current government policies are achieving
 change and that it is doubtful that Canada can afford the high cost that would be
 
 
 necessary to implement all the recommendations. The federal and provincial govern-
 ments are examining the report and are expected to provide an official response in
 1997.
 Concern continued over the problem of teen suicides on the Big Cove Reserve in
 New Brunswick. Between 1992 and 1994, 10 youths on the reserve committed sui-
 cide, and observers predicted that deeply rooted social problems and inadequate
 housing would lead to more self-inflicted deaths. On the positive side, more youths
 sought counseling for their prblems.
 The Minister for Indian Affairs announced an increase of $105 million (Can $ 140
 million) in funding for on-reserve housing over the next 5 years. In July the Govern-
 ment announced that it will spend $74 million (Can $ 98.5 million) in 1996-97 for
 water and sewage repairs on reserves. Department of Indian Affairs statistics show
 that 95 p.rcent of houses on reserves have running water and 90 percent have sew-
 age facilities.
 Treaty rights for aboriginals are recognized in the Canadian Constitution, and the
 Federal Government is currently engaged in four sets of discussions with First Na-
 tions on various treaty issues. The Federal Government is also currently involved
 in self-government negotiations with 350 First Nations.
 An investigation was ongoing at year's end into the 1995 police killing of an ab-
 original activist at Ipperwash, Ontario. Family members of the slain man filed a
 $5.25 million ($ Can 7 million) wrongful death suit against the Ontario Premier, two
 cabinet ministers, the provincial government, and the Ontario Provincial Police, but
 said that they will drop the suit if a full public inquiry is held. The Premier main-
 tains that a public inquiry cannot be held during an ongoing investigation. Indians
 still control Ipperwash provincial park, which they claim is on a sacred burial
 ground. A federal negotiator was appointed in January and has held monthly nego-
 tiating meetings with all concerned  parties.
 In March the Nisga'a tribal council signed an historic agreement in principle with
 the Federal and British Columbia Governments encompassing the disposition of for-
 estry, fishing, environmental, and water claims. The agreement also includes proce-
 dures for taxation, governance, revenue sharing, and establishment of a justice sys-
 tem. Negotiation of the final treaty is under way but final agreement is pending
 pubic heaings bya provincial legislative select ommittee. First Nation representa-
 tives believe that pubic support in the province for a political settlement o aborigi-
 nal claims has subsided significantly from its high water mark in the early 1990s.
 Quebec's Indians continue to regard the separatist provincial government with
 deep misgivings. The Pontiac tribe voted to demand that their territories remain
 part of Canada even if Quebec declares itself independent. A group of the Ottawa
 with lands in Quebec are petitioning their local municipality and the Federal Gov-
 ernment for the same kind of guarantee.
 Friction was generated when Quebec police arrested the Mohawk organizers of a
 "charity casino" set up to fund scholarships for Mohawk children, on the grounds
 that the organizers di not have a provincial permit to operate a gambling establish-
 ment. When Mohawk police refused to intervene, provincial police (without entering
 the reservation) arrested six suspects and took them into custody outside the res-
 ervation.
 The last of several court cases involving a dispute over native fishing rights in
 New Brunswick concluded in August. Seventeen members of the Eel Grouna band
 who fish the northwest Miramichi River were sentenced on a variety of fishing vio-
 lations and assault charges. The 17 had staged a protest in June 1995 over the
 terms of a fishing agreement with the Federal Government, contending that the
 agreement's prohibition of nets on the river violated their right to fish using tradi-
 tional methods.
 A Micmac native in Nova Scotia was convicted in June of illegally netting eels
 and selling them. Micmac and Maliseet natives contended that 18th century treaties
 with the British guaranteed them the right to fish and hunt commercially without
 licenses; the Government argued that aboriginals may fish and hunt only for suste-
 nance and ceremonial purposes.
 Religious MinorWes.-In March the B'nai Brith League for Human Rights re-
 ported that anti-Semitic harassment was up by 12.1 percent over 1995. Anti-Semitic
 vandalism dropped slightly for the second consecutive year, but harassment in-
 creased. Total incidents in 1995 numbered 331, up from 290 last year. B'nai Brith
 attributed the rise in part to the spread of hate propaganda on the Internet.
 In April Jewish groups in Montreal expressed concern that Quebec government
 measures to promote compliance with Quebec language laws requiring French label-
 ling on goods threatened Jews' access to imported "kosher for Passover" foods. In
 August the Quebec government formally exempted "kosher for Passover' products
 
 
 892
 
 from Quebec's French labelling regulations under an agreement reached between
 the Canadian Jewish Congress and the Quebec French language office.
 National/Racial/Ethni Minorities.-The narw defeat of the 1995 Quebec sov-
 ereignty referendum left unresolved the concerns of French-speaking Quebeckers
 about their minority status in Canada, while sharpening the concerns of English-
 speaking Quebeckers about their minority status in Quebec.
 There have been visible efforts in Quebec by Parti Quebecois (PQ) leadership to
 lower tensions since the referendum and refocus attention on the economy. The PQ
 leader has repeatedly stated that there is a role for the Englsh-speaking community
 in a sovereign Quebec and has made several overtures to the Anglophone business
 community. An English-language publication in Quebec City, however, recently de-
 scribed the Anglophone community there as "depressed" and "in decline."
 There was increased tension in Nova Scotia's black community following the con-
 viction of six young black men in February for their involvement in the beating of
 three white students in 1995. The black youths received sentences of 7 to 10 years.
 The black community believed that the sentences were racially biased and excessive.
 One of the youths has been granted a new trial after successfully arguing that his.
 defense attorney did not have prior access to statements made by a key witness.
 A report of the Commission on Systematic Racism in the Ontario criminal justice
 system showed that blacks and other racial minorities are more likely to be charged
 and imprisoned than whites in Ontario. Commission members stated that the sys-
 tematic racism they found is based largely on discretionary decisions made by law
 enforcement personnel and attorneys. The Commission recommended training and
 education to alleviate the situation; minority community leaders said that they hope
 for an improved dialogue between police and community members.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Except for members of the armed forces, workers in
 both the public and private sectors have the right to associate freely. The Labor
 Code protects these rights for all employees under federal jurisdiction, while provin-
 cial legislation protects all other organized workers.
 Trade unions are independent of the Government. They are free to affiliate with
 international organizations. Of the civilian labor force, 29.2 percent is unionized.
 All workers have the right to strike, except those in the public sector providing
 essential services.
 During the first 6 months of 1996, there were 91 work stoppages, 7 of which were
 illegal, and 33 unresolved labor disputes. The remainder were settled through direct
 bargaining or mediation.
 The law prohibits employer retribution against strikers and union leaders, and
 the Government enforces this provision.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers in both the public
 (except for some police) and the private sectors have the right to organize and bar-
 gain collectively. While the law protects collective bargaining, for some public sector
 workers providing essential services there are limitations, which vary from province
 to province.
 The law prohibits antiunion discrimination and requires employers to reinstate
 workers fired for union activities. There are effective mechanisms for resolving com-
 plaints and obtaining redress.
 All labor unions have full access to mediation, arbitration, and the judicial sys-
 tem.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is illegal, and there
 were no known violations.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Child labor legislation varies from
 province to province. The Federal Government does not employ youths under 17
 years of age while school is in session. Most provinces prohibit those under age 15
 or 16 from working without parental consent, at night, or in any hazardous employ-
 ment. These prohibitions are effectively enforced through inspections conducted by
 the federal and provincial Labor Ministries. The statutory minimum school-leaving
 age in all provinces is 16.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Although it was common practice among most
 federal jurisdiction employers (who employeless than 10 percent of the work force)
 to use the higher provinciallterritorial minimum wage rates, in 1996 the Federal
 Government passedlegislation to align the federal rate heretofore with the provin-
 cial/territorial rates. Ontario, Alberta, and the Northwest Territories have a mini-
 mum wage for youths and students lower than their respective standard minimums.
 A family whose only employed member earns the minimum wage would be consid-
 ered below the poverty line.
 
 
 893
 Standard work hours vary from province to province, but in all the limit is 40 or
 48 a week, with at least 24 hours of rest.
 Federal law provides safety and health standards for employees under federal ju-
 risdiction, while provincial and territorial legislation provides for all other employ-
 ees. Federal and provincial labor departments monitor and enforce these standards.
 Federal, provincial, and territorial laws protect the right of workers with "reason-
 able cause" to refuse dangerous work.
