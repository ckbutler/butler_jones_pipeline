 VENEZUELA
 Venezuela is a republic with an active multiparty democratic system, a bicameral
 congress, and a popularly elected president. Former president Rafael Caldera was
 elected in 1994 with the support of a coalition of small and medium-sized parties.
 The Congress comprised 20 political parties, although two traditional parties domi-
 nated it until November. In December Hugo Chavez Frias, the leader of an at-
 tempted coup in 1992, was elected President with 57 percent of the vote after cam-
 p aigning on a promise of radical reform, including constitutional change. Chavez's
 election was the result of deep popular dissatisfaction with the traditional parties
 and frustration with the country's continued economic crisis. As a result of the No-
 vember regional elections, the traditional Democratic Action (AD) Party remained
 the largest party in the National Congress, but Chavez's Fith Republic Movement
 (MVR) Party became the second largest. These elections were held successfully
 under the 1997 Election Law, which provided for increased electoral transparency
 through automation of the electoral process and the inclusion of citizens to monitor
 the voting process at the election tables. The judiciary is legally independent, but
 judges are subject to influence.
 The security apparatus comprises civilian and military elements, both accountable
 to elected authorities. The Justice Ministry controls the Judicial Technical Police
 (PTJ), which conducts most criminal investigations. The Interior Ministry controls
 the State Security Police (DISIP), which is primarily responsible for protecting pub-
 lic officials and investigating cases of subversion and arms trafficking. The General
 
 
 790
 Directorate for Military Intelligence, under the Defense Ministry, is responsible for
 collecting intelligence related to national security and sovereignty. The national
 ourdan activebranch of the military, has arrest powers and is largely responsible
 the exterior  prisons and key government installations, maintaining
 public order, monitoring frontiers, conducting counterdrug operations, and providing
 a   enforcement in remote areas. It also suppies the top leadership for the Metro-
 politn Police, the main civilian police force in and around Caracas, and for various
 state and municipal police forces. Both police and military personnel were respon-
 sible for human rights abuses.
 Venezuela has abundant natural resources and its per capita gross domestic prod-
 uct (GDP) is $3,838. However, income is unevenly distributed and 70 percent of the
 population live at or below the poverty line. Oil accounted for 28 percent of GDP,
 61 percent of government revenues, and 77 percent of the country's exports in 1997.
 The decline in world oil prices led the Government to make successive budget cuts.
 Public sector iron, steel, aluminum, and petrochemical products constitute one-third
 of the country's non-oil exports. The Government s third attempt to privatize the
 aluminum industry filed in September when the only prequalified bidder withdrew.
 The Governments human rights record continued to be poor in certain areas and
 includes extrajudicial killings of criminal suspects by the police and military, torture
 and abuse of detainees, failure to punish police and security officers guilty of abuse,
 arbitrary arrests and excessively lengthy detentions, illegal searches, and corruption
 and severe inefficiency in the judicial and law enforcement systems. Overcrowding
 and violence in the prisons were so severe as to constitute inhuman and degrading
 treatment. The Government maintained some restrictions on freedom of movement.
 Constitutional provisions for citizens' rights apply nationally, except in some border
 areas where guerrilla activity, drug trafficking, and kidnaping were a continuing
 problem. In these areas, suspension of freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention
 and search without warrant, as well as freedom to travel, have remained in effect
 since June 1994. Violence against women, abuse of children, discrimination against
 the disabled, and inadequate protection of the rights of indigenous people continue
 to be problems. Vigilante justice is also a problem.
 The Government made limited progress in addressing these problems since the
 formulation of a national human rights agenda at a July 1997 high-level symposium
 held with nongovernmental organizations (NGO's). The newly created National Po-
 lice Committee monitors police conduct and receives complaints of misconduct. The
 new human rights office in the Defense Ministry trains personnel in basic human
 rights norms. In December 1997, Congress enacted the Organic Criminal Procedures
 Cede (COPP), which provides for open public trials with oral proceedings and jury
 participation. On March 25, three provisions of the COPP entered into force: Elimi-
 nation of the secret stage of the trial, establishment of the right to plead guilty, and
 the ability to make reparation agreements. These three elements were designed to
 reduce the judicial backlog before the rest of the COPP reforms go into effect, sched-
 uled for July 1999. In August Congress passed legislation that outlaws domestic vio-
 lence.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of targeted
 political killings, but extrajudicial killings, primarily of criminal suspects, by the se-
 curity forces continued. The Venezuelan Program of Action and Education in
 Human Rights (PROVEA), a highly respected nongovernmental human rights orga-
 nization, documented 104 extrajudicial killings from October 1997 through Septem-
 ber 1998, a decline from the 151 cases documented between October 1996 andSep-
 tember 1997 of killings. These involved summary executions of criminal suspects,
 indiscriminate or excessive use of force, and death resulting from mistreatment
 while in custody. According to PROVEA, the state police forces were responsible for
 36 of the killings; the metropolitanpolice of the Federal District, 12; the PTJ, 12;
 the national guard, 12; the municipal police forces, 19; the armed forces, 8; and the
 DISIP, 5.
 The perpetrators of extrajudicial killings act with near impunity, as the Govern-
 ment rarely prosecutes such cases. The police often fail to investigate crimes alleg-
 edly committed by their colleagues and characterize incidents of extrajudicial
 killings as "confrontations," even though eyewitness testimony and evidence strong-
 ly indicate otherwise. In addition, the civilian judicial system remains highly ineffi-
 cient and sometimes corrupt, and military courts often are biased in favor of mem-
 bers of the armed forces accused of abuse. A pretrial summary phase called "nudo
 hecho," which is used in cases involving public officials and is conducted in secret,
 
 
 often shields members of the security forces from prosecution, since cases can lan-
 guish in that phase for several years. In the small number of prosecutions in which
 the courts convict perpetrators of extrajudicial killings and other abuses, the sen-
 tences issued are frequently light or the convictions are overturned on appeal. Un-
 like common criminals, members of the security forces charged with or convicted of
 crimes rarely spend much time in prison.
 Security forces committed a number of killings in prisons, and 460 prison inmates
 died as a result of riots, fires, and other harsh conditions in prison facilities (see
 Section 1.c.).
 In January the Metropolitan Police detained Harold Michael Zambrano Gonzalez
 and Arturo Jose Hernandez Ramirez without explanation. Later they both appeared
 at a hospital with gunshot wounds, from which both died. The police claimed that
 the two men belonged to a criminal gang that had attacked them. Family members
 and witnesses denied that version.
 In May Carlos Alberto Colmenares Garcia, Richard David Palacios Garcia, and
 Avelino Rafael Vega died after the Sucre municipal police opened fire on their car.
 The police claim that the three men had weapons in their possession and had tried
 to flee when the police tried to pull them over. Witnesses said that the three men
 had pulled their car over and had not even left the car before the police opened fire.
 Two of the men died from wounds suffered during this confrontation. Witnesses
 claim that the third, Palacios, only had suffered injuries to his arms. However, the
 police delivered him to the hospital, dead, with gunshot wounds on his arms and
 chest. The PTJ was still investigating the incident at year's end.
 In January 1997, members of the metropolitan police arrested and led away two
 young men in Guatire, Miranda state. Witnesses heard gunshots and later found
 one of the men, Freddy Rafael Toro Ramirez, dead from bullet wounds. The case
 was still being investigated at year's end.
 In August a court sentenced the two off-duty policemen charged with the 1996
 shooting death of Barton Wilder to 15 years each for intentional murder in the first
 deree. One of the officers, who was drunk, had fired into a group of roller-bladers,
 killing Wilder and injuring another person. The two policemen appealed the sen-
 tence.
 The four PTJ members imprisoned for the 1995 execution-style killing of 21-year-
 old Hector Rojas stilJ had not been tried at year's end.
 There were no prosecutions or new information surrounding the 1996 death of 25
 inmates from a fire started by prison guards at La Planta prison, the 1994 discovery
 of a common grave in the Sierra de Perija region of Zulia state, the 1992 killing
 of at least 63 prisoners at Catia prison, or the 1992 killing of reporters Maria Veron-
 ica Tessari and Virgilio Fernandez by members of the security forces.
 Minimal progress was made towards resolving some 300 alleged extrajudicial
 killings by security forces during and after the civil unrest of early 1989. There has
 been only one prosecution: a police officer was found guilty in 1991 of killing 18-
 year-old Eleazar Ramon Mavares, who was shot by security force members some 20
 times at close range. The courts released the officer from prison 1 year later. In ne-
 gotiations held with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) in
 1995, the Government agreed to initiate a new investigation of the Mavares case,
 punish those responsible, and provide indemnities to the victim's family, later deter-
 mined to be $30,000 (15 million bolivars). The IACHR gave Venezuela until April
 1997 to comply with the agreement, and in October 1997 it again called on the Gov-
 ernment to investigate this case, provide compensation to the victim's family, and
 bring to justice those responsible for the death. By the end of 1998, the Government
 had complied partially; it had investigated and made a payment, but it had not pun-
 ished any of those responsible. In 1995 the Committee of Family Members of Vic-
 tims of the Unrest referred 45 cases surrounding the 1989 killings to the IACHR,
 asserting that the Government had not ensured justice. In December the IACHR no-
 tified the Government that it would issue an opinion on the cases early in 1999.
 In September 1996, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights awarded $722,332
 in damages to two survivors and the families of 14 fishermen killed in 1988 by mil-
 tary and police officers near the border town of El Amparo, Apure state. The Gov-
 ernment began to make payments in September 1997 but hanot finished paying
 the award by the end of 1998. The military originally claimed that the deaths were
 the result of military action taken against Colombian guerrillas, but the Govern-
 ment later acknowledged culpability and agreed to pay indemnities to the survivors
 and the victims' families. In August 1994, a military tribunal had overturned the
 conviction of 16 defendants in the case despite strong evidence that they had partici-
 pated in a planned ambush.
 Mob lynching of supposed criminals is a problem. The victims are almost always
 known criminals who prey on residents of poor neighborhoods. Between October
 
 
 792
 1997 and September 1998, PROVEA recorded 2 lynchings and -24 attempted
 lynchings. In addition, vigilante groups known as "brigadas" continued to increase
 their activity in various parts of the country such as Lara state.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reliable reports of persons who disappeared
 after being detained by the police or the armed forces.
 There were no developments in connection with the 1995 disappearances of Julio
 Rafael Tovar, Fidel Ernesto Croes Aleman, Luis Martin Sanchez Vargas, Juan Dan-
 iel Monsalve, or Jose Ramos; or the 1994 disappearances of Elsida Ines Alvarez,
 Benjamin Vasquez, and Fidel A. Sanabria. Members of the security forces reportedly
 had detained each of them prior to their disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture, but credible human rights groups report that the security
 forces continue to torture and abuse detainees physically. This 'abuse most com-
 monly comprises beatings during arrest or interrogation, but there have been inci-
 dents when the security forces used near suffocation and other forms of torture that
 leave no telltale signs. Most victims come from the poorest and least influential
 parts of society.
 PROVEA documented 21 cases of torture from October 1997 through September
 1998. A large number of cases were never reported because the victims feared ret-
 ribution. According to PROVEA, the DISIP was responsible for 4 of the reported tor-
 ture incidents; the PTJ, 4; the armed forces, 5; the state police forces, 5; and the
 national guard, 3. Some of these cases were in border areas where constitutional
 protections were suspended.
 Torture, like extrajudicial killings, continues because the Government does not
 ensure the independent investigation of-complaints needed to bring those respon-
 sible to justice. In addition to lack of vigor by the judiciary, the fact that the Insti-
 tute of Forensic Medicine is part of the PTJ also contributes to a climate of impu-
 nity, since its doctors are unlikely to be impartial in their examinations of cases
 that involve torture by members of the PTJ. Very few instances of torture have re-
 sulted in convictions.
 Some 50 Baruta municipal police officers, in search of the killer of a colleague,
 attacked residents of the ,poor working class Caracas suburb of Petare in the pre-
 dawn hours of December 25, 1997. The police fired shots, broke into homes, and
 beat, shot at, and threatened with death residents in their path. The operation re-
 sulted in 43 persons injured, 8 of whom had gunshot wounds. At year's end, a crimi-
 nal court 'was still investigating the incident. The chief of the Baruta municipal p0-
 lice also ordered an internal investigation and promised to punish any officers guilty
 of brutality. However, the victims declared that responsibility for the incident had
 not been determined nor had any compensation been made.
 In August national guardsmen used tear gas and plastic bullets to disperse a
 group of Pemon Indians, who were blocking access to a construction site (see Section
 5).
 In the-Colombian border area where-some constitutionalprotections have been
 suspended, the national guard and army act with-near impunity. :The Support Net-
 work for Justice and Peace 'has documented many- human rights-abuses in this re-
 gion by amassing detailed witness testimony. There has been-no-resolution of the
 border-area cases from 1995, in which members of the- military,. in separate inci-
 dents in reaction to guerrilla attacks, tortured 23 rural workers near Cararabo and
 19 peasant farmers in La Victoria, both in Apure state.
 Throughout the summer, a rash of small pipe bombs, one of which contained polit-
 ical pamphlets, were set off in several government buildings, including the Ministry
 of Justice. No one was hurtin any of the incidents, no one ever claimed responsibil-
 ity, and no responsibility was ever assigned.
 Prison conditions continued to be extremely harsh due to underfunding, poorly
 trained and corrupt prison staff and national guard nembers,.and overcrowding so
 severe.as to constitute inhuman and-degrading treatment:. As of July, the 32 prison
 facilities administered by the Ministry of'Justice held 24,929 inmates, of whom the
 courts had sentenced only 8,468.
 In July the -Ministry "of Justice reported that the prison system was 54 percent
 above its planned capacity. Some prisons held three to five times the number of
 prisoners for which they were' designed.:For example, Sabaneta- pris n in-Maracaibo
 was designed for 800 prisoners but holds 2,574, and. La Planta prison in Caracas
 was designed for 400 but holds 1,584. The Justice Ministry claims that since July
 overcrowding declined due tb.the release of prisoners who have benefited from the
 three provisions of the COPP that entered into force on March 25 and the expansion
 of the prison system. In January the authorities opened a prison in Merida that has
 a capacity of 839; in August they reexpanded the capacity of El Dorado prison in
 Bolivar from 200 to 1,796; and in December, a prison in Lara opened with a capacity
 
 
 793
 
 of 877. However, 3 months after the reopening of El Dorado prison, considered a
 major step in addressing the problem of overcrowded and violent prisons, conditions
 in the prison deteriorated significantly and on December 8, prisoners started a
 major riot which resulted in 10 deaths and 83 injuries. Overall, violence in the pris-
 ons increased compared with 1997.
 In letters written to the Justice Minister in December 1997, the Prosecutor Gen-
 eral called attention to excessive use of force by prison guards, inadequate medical
 care for prisoners, and failure to meet the nutritional needs of inmates with the food
 provided by prison kitchens. Inmates often have to pay uards as well as each other
 to obtain necessities such as space in a cell, a bed, an ood. Because of its low qual-
 ity and insufficient quantity, only about 30 percent of inmates consume prison food.
 Most prisoners get their food from their families, from paying prison guards, or from
 bartering with other prisoners. The Justice Ministry is experimenting with the pos-
 sibility of privatizing prison food services. Guns, knives, and illegal drugs are easily
 smuggled into most prisons, and violence among prisoners is very common.
 PROVEA documented 460 deaths from violence in the prisons from October 1997
 through September 1998. Other prisoners perpetrated the majority of killings, but
 eight inmates were killed by the authorities: two by prison guards under the Min-
 istry of Justice, two by prison directors, and four by the national guard. Hundreds
 more died as a consequence of poor sanitary conditions, poor diet, and inadequate
 medical care. In Tocuyito, the largest and most violent prison, there were 70 deaths
 from violence in the period between October 1997 and September 1998. Although
 the Government repeatedly acknowledged the poor state of the prisons and stated
 its intention to improve the situation, funding for prisons remained extremely low,
 preventing significant improvement in most penitentiaries.
 There were no prosecutions of public officials for the corruption and neglect that
 contributed to the January 1994 riot at Sabaneta prison, in which inmates killed
 105 fellow prisoners and wounded scores of others.
 The Government permits prison visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-In 1995 the Government reinstated the
 constitutionally protected freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention in all but 16
 municipalities along the Colombian border where guerrilla activity, drug trafficking,
 kidnaping, and extortion were a continuing problem. However, the security forces
 arbitrarily arrested and detained citizens throughout the country.
 Outside the military theaters of operation, especially during anticrime sweeps in
 impoverished sections of major cities, there continued to be arbitrary detentions by
 the Metropolitan Police, the DISIP, the national guard, and the PTJ. The authori-
 ties detained persons during the sweeps for up to 2 days while they checked crimi-
 nal records; most were released without charges. PROVEA documented 12,308 per-
 sons detained in sweeps from October 1997 through September 1998. The DISIP
 also occasionally detained political radicals who had committed no crimes.
 The law provides for the right to judicial determination of the legality of deten-
 tion; however, the police may hold persons without an arrest warrant for up to 8
 days, and the courts may hold them for up to an additional 8 days in court custody.
 In many cases, the police abused detainees physically and psychologically during the
 initial 8-day period and illegally held them incommunicado. During the second 8-
 day period a judge may, on the basis of the police investigation, order either the
 formal arrest or the release of the suspect. Arbitrary arrests are common, and the
 authorities sometimes exceed the time limits for holding suspects. Prison officials
 often illegally demand payment from prisoners for transportation to judicial pro-
 ceedings at which formal charges are made. Those who are unable to pay often are
 forced to forgo their judicial hearings.
 Forced exile is illegal and is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The civilian judiciary is legally independent, but
 judges are subject to influence from a number of sources.
 The judicial sector consists of the Supreme Court, which is the court of final ap-
 peal; the Prosecutor General, who provides opinions to the courts on prosecution of
 criminal cases and acts as public ombudsman to bring public employee misconduct
 or violations of the constitutional rights of prisoners or accused persons to the atten-
 tion of the proper authorities; the Ministry of Justice, which manages the national
 police force and prisons and files complaints in criminal courts; and the Judicial
 Council, which oversees the lower courts as well as the selection and training of
 judges. The lower court system includes district and municipal courts as well as
 trial and appeal courts that deal with civil and criminal matters.
 When the COPP goes into effect, if members of the security forces'(with the excep-
 tion of the military) are prosecuted, they would stand trial under the new open pub-
 lic trial system. Members of the military would be tried under the military court
 system, which also has adopted most of the reforms in the COPP.
 
 
 794
 
 Military courts can try civilians in cases of armed subversion and whenever
 armed forces members are involved. Military courts are subject to a requirement for
 a speedy trial and a statute of limitations similar to that of civilian courts. Persons
 convicted by a military court have the same right of appeal to the Supreme Court
 as do those convicted by the civilian system. However, military courts are signifi-
 cantly different from civilian courts'in that by law the President must review every
 case after the initial secret investigation stage and decide if that case is to go to
 trial. In addition, the Supreme Court selects military judges from a list of can-
 didates provided by the Minister of Defense, a process that links the careers of mili-
 tary judges to the high command. The tendency of military judges to be responsive
 to the views of their military leaders, to maintain procedural secrecy, -and to act
 slowly in high-profile cases in which -the military is implicated make impartial or
 timely trials for defendants unlikely. As a result, military offenders evade punish-
 ment for extrajudicial killings and other human rights abuses.
 The law provides for the right to a fair trial and considers the accused innocent
 until proven guilty in a court. However, the presumption of innocence has been inef-
 fective in the justice system, which is overburdened and inefficient, suffers from
 widespread corruption, and lacks public credibility. Judges are underpaid, poorly
 disciplined, and susceptible to political influence. The judicial process is paper inten-
 sive, requiring the costly and time-consuming production of voluminous reports at
 every stage by judges, attorneys, and witnesses. Case backlogs and lengthy pretrial
 detention averaging 4  years are the norm.
 In December 1997, Congress passed the new Organic Criminal Procedures Code
 (COPP) that is to introduce for the first time open, public trials with oral proceed-
 ings and participation by juries. The new adversarial system of justice is expected
 to give practical effect to the presumption of innocence. Three sections of the COPP
 went into effect on March 25: Elimination of the "secret sumarial" or secret stage
 of the trial, establishment of the right to plead guilty, and the ability to make rep-
 aration agreements. These sections were designed to clear out the overwhelming
 backlog of cases before the code goes into full effect in July 1999.
 The law provides for public defenders for those unable to afford an attorney, but
 there are not enough t handle the caseload. The Judicial Council reported that
 there are 159 public defense attorneys for the entire country.
 There were no reports of poitical prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.--Con-
 stitutional provisions prohibit arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, and
 correspondence. However, from June 1994 to July 1995, the Government suspended
 the constitutional protection of freedom from search without a warrant, along with
 other freedoms. This suspension remained in effect in some border areas throughout
 1998. Even after reinstatement of the provision in urban areas, security forces often
 conducted searches of homes without warrants, especially during anticrime sweeps
 in impoverished neighborhoods. In recent years, there have been some complaints,
 especially by human rights monitors, of illegal wiretapping by the security forces.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government generally respects these rights in practice.
 Individuals criticize the Government publicly.
 The charge of criminal defamation sometimes was used against the media to limit
 coverage of sensitive issues. In July 1997, a judge in Guarenas, Miranda state, or-
 dered the arrest of the publisher of the Caracas newspaper El Mundo, Lus Oscar
 Pont, and of one of its editors, Miguel Arcangel Calderon, because a PTJ official had
 accused them of criminal defamation. This case was toosed at the end of 1997. Pont
 was not detained and the Supreme Court and the Third Superior Judge of Miranda
 later ruled in favor of Pont. However, Calderon spent 6 days in prison and was re-
 leased only on condition that he not comment on the case.
 The print and electronic media are independent. However, a 1994 law forbids per-
 sons without journalism degrees to practice the profession and requires journalists
 to be members of the National College of Journalists. Media owners, acting as the
 Venezuelan Press Bloc, brought a case to the Supreme Court in November 1995
 challenging the law as a violation of the freedom of expression provided for in the
 Constitution and international agreements on human rights that have the force of
 law. The Court had not ruled by year's end.   e         d              -
 The Government respects academic freedom.        -
 h. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government generally re-
 spects the constitutional prvision for freedom of peaceful assembly. Public meet-
 ings, including those of all political parties, generally are held unimpeded. The Gov-
 
 
 795
 ernment requires permits for public marches but does not deny them for political
 reasons.
 However, as in earlier years, some demonstrations turned violent and were
 quelled by security forces. According to PROVEA, 6 persons were injured during
 demonstrations and 118 detained from October 1997 through September 1998. The
 student and teaching sectors carry out the largest number of protests and the larg-
 est number of their demonstrations end up being quelled by security forces. In May
 the police dissolved a teachers' march in Barquisimeto on the grounds that it was
 not authorized, even though the teachers had submitted a request within the req-
 uisite 48 hours and had not received a reply. The police used dogs and, as a result,
 five marchers suffered bites.
 The Government respects the constitutional provision for freedom of association.
 Professional and academic associations operate without interference.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, pro-
 vided that a faith does not threaten public order or violate good custom. The au-
 thorities respect this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for the right of citizens and legal residents
 to travel within the country and to go abroad and return. However, the Government
 can suspend the freedom to travel, as it did from June 1994 to July 1995. Although
 the Government generally respects these rights, freedom to travel remains sus-
 pended in some border areas and is restricted through the use of curfews. The Gov-
 ernment also restricts foreign travel for persons being investigated for criminal ac-
 tivities.
 The law includes provisions for granting refugee and asylee status in accordance
 with the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and
 its 1967 Protocol. However, there are no legal provisions for the determination of
 refugee status. Instead, the Government allows the Venezuelan Bishops' Conference
 to coordinate with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
 in assisting refugees. Since 1990, the UNHCR registered 2,032 asylum-seekers, and
 of these, 1,630 persons were granted refugee status by the UNHCR. In 1998 there
 were a total of 158 persons still in the country who had been granted refugee status.
 The Government provides first asylum and granted it to three persons in 1998.
 There were no reports of the forced return of persons to a country where they
 feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right through periodic, free, and fair elections
 held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 In December 1997, Congress passed a new election law to replace the previous
 antiquated and inefficient system for counting votes, which had led to numerous
 and-in some cases-credible allegations that the political parties that dominated
 electoral councils committed fraud. The law contained three major reforms: Removal
 of political party representatives from all electoral organs, mechanization of the vot-
 ing process, and prohibition of campaign financing by anonymous sources. Although
 the newly established National Electoral Council was the subject of controversy con-
 cerning its ability to implement the new law effectively, the smoothness of the elec-
 toral process during the December 6 presidential election and the rapid reporting
 of the results were evidence of the electoral reform. Most legislators from all levels
 of government continued to be elected from party lists (which, under the new law,
 are supposed to have at least 30 percent women). The top election officials, although
 not party members, continued to be selected by negotiation among the political par-
 ties in Congress.
 Women and nonwhites participate fully in government and politics but remain
 underrepresented in senior leadership positions. A bicameral Congressional Com-
 mittee for Women's Rights focused on promoting political office-holding opportuni-
 ties for women. In the November 8 regional elections, women won 26 seats as depu-
 ties in the 207-member lower house of Congress (whose president is a woman), and
 5 seats in the 53-member Senate. They held 3 of 27 ministerial positions in
 Caldera's Cabinet.
 Indigenous people traditionally have not been integrated fully into the political
 system due to their limited knowledge of politics, low voter turnout, geographic iso-
 lation, and fewer economic and educational opportunities. Few indigenous people
 are in the Government, and only one is in Congress as an alternate deputy.
 
 
 796
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups generally operate without government re-
 striction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Both
 international and local human rights organizations were provided ready access to
 the prison system. However, government officials were critical of some human rights
 groups, accusing them of seeking to discredit the State and undermining the coun-
 try's image. One human rights group reported receiving, death threats while inves-
 tigating human rights abuses committed by the police.              -
 In July 1997, the Government held its first formal meeting with NGO's to begin
 to formulate a national human rights agenda. The Interior, Justice, and Family
 Ministers took an active part in the discussion of some 40 proposals dealing with
 preventive detention, prison conditions, and other human rights problems. The Inte-
 rior Minister announced the creation of a National Police Committee to monitor po-
 lice. conduct, receive complaints, and ensure implementation of disciplinary meas-
 ures. In September 1997, the Minister of Defense created a human rights office to
 promote respect for-human rights in the armed forces. During the year, NGO's com-
 plained that the Government had done little to advance any of the proposals dis-
 cussed at the meeting.
 In July presidential candidates met with human rights NGO's to answer ques-
 tions about their platforms.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination based on ethnic origin, sex, or disability. How-
 ever, the Government does not safeguard adequately the rights of indigenous people,
 protect women against societal and domestic violence, or ensure disabled people ac-
 cess tjobs and public services. Very few resources are devoted to children s welfare;
 young delinqents are locked in institutions that are unsafe.
 Women-Women face substantial institutional and societal prejudice with respect
 to rape and domestic violence. The law makes rape extremely difficult to prove, re-
 guring at a minimum medical examination within 48 hours of the violation. A pro-
 vsion mn the Penal Code provides that anyone guilty of rape can avoid punishment
 if, before sentencing, he marries the victim. Few police officers are trained to deal
 responsibly with rape victims. However, women's organizations assert that such fig-
 ures are very low and do not accurately portray the probem of rape and sexual as-
 sault. They claim that many victims do not report th~e incident or press charges due
 to societal pressure and their own feelings of guilt.
 Domestic violence against women is very common and has been aggravated by the
 country's economic difficulties. Over 14,000 cases of domestic violence were reported
 to the authorities in 1997. According to local monitors, the police generally are un-
 willing to intervene to prevent domestic violence, and the courts rarely prosecute
 those accused of such abuse. In addition, poor women generally are unaware of legal
 remedies and have little access to them. In August Congress passed the Law
 Against Violence toward Women and Children. It requires the police to receive re-
 ports of domestic violence and obligates hospital personnel to advise authorities of
 abuse.
 Women and men are legally equal in marriage. Women account for roughly half
 the studentbody of most universities, have advanced in many professions, including
 medicine and law, and gradually have surmounted many of the barriers to their full
 participation in politi  an  economic life. rNonetheless, women stll are underrep-
 resented in the higher ranks of labor unions and private industry.
 The Labor Code specifles that employers must not discriminate against women
 with regard to pay or working conditions, must not fire them during preguancy or
 for a year after giving birth, must grant them unpaid leave and benefits for 6 weeks
 before the birth of a child and 12 weeks after, and must provide them with 10 weeks
 of unpaid leave if they legally adopt children under 3 years of age. According to the
 Ministry of Labor and the major labor federation, these regulations are enforced in
 the formal sector, although social security payments often are delayed.
 The National Women's Council, an agency of the presidency with representation
 from the Ministries of Justice, Education, Family, Health, and Labor, in 1996 pre-
 pared a manual on violence against women and children, which includes informa-
 tion on where the victims might obtain assistane. Therei  as number of NGO's
 concerned with domestic violence, sex education, and economic discrimination. How-
 ever, the recommendations of these groups have not been implemented widely by
 the police or other concerned governmental agencies.
 Children.--The Government continued to scale bek its expenditure on education,
 health, and social services. While the law provides for universal free education,
 
 
 about one-third of the Ministry of Education budget was dedicated to post-secondary
 education, leaving both primary and secondary education chronically underfunded.
 According to the United Nations Children's Fund, only 76.5 percent of eligible chil-
 dren enter the first grade. This means that over 750,000 children remain outside
 the educational system. In addition, the 1998 annual report of the Community Cen-
 ters for Learning (CECODAP) stated that over 400,000 children are not eligible to
 receive government assistance, including public education, because their bi  is not
 documented properly. The Government is attempting to remedy this problem with
 new regulations to standardize the registration of children's births.
 According to CECODAP's study, 500,000 children, most under the age of 5, have
 an average of 2 episodes of gastroenteritis a year, a sickness that is the ninth lead-
 ing cause of death in the country. A total of 40 percent of the population under the
 age of 17 suffer from malnutrition and 76 percent live in poverty. These conditions
 contribute to the increase in preventable diseases that are leading causes of infant
 mortality.
 An increase in poverty has raised the level of stress within families and led to
 a rise in the number of abandoned children and to more child abuse. A survey by
 the National Institute for Minors in 1994 determined that 206,000 children were in-
 volved in illicit activities, principally begging but also petty theft, prostitution, and
 drug trafficking. Some 40,000 children were exploited sexually, according to a 1994
 study. There were also reports of trafficking in children from other South American
 countries to work in Caracas as street vendors and housemaids.
 The authorities in Caracas and several other jurisdictions tried to cope with the
 phenomenon of street children by imposing curfews for unsupervised minors. Chil-
 dren's rights advocates claim that curfews permit the police to act arbitrarily in de-
 taining persons who have committed no crime. Because reform institutions are filled
 to capacity, hundreds of children accused of infractions are confined in jails -where
 they are crowded into small, filthy cells, fed only once a day, and forced to sleep
 on bare concrete floors.
 In October 1997, Amnesty International reported past incidents in which minors
 were subjects of extrajudicial killings and abuse, as well as deficiencies in law and
 practice with regard to the detention of children. In particular, the 1980 Minors'
 Protection Act requires them to be brought before a judge within 8 days of deten-
 tion, but this may be extended to 3 months. In addition, security forces and law en-
 forcement authorities often detain children together with adults.
 Reports of child abuse are rare due to a fear of entanglement with the authorities
 and ingrained attitudes regarding family privacy. The overburdened judicial system,
 although very slow, generally ensures that in most situations children are removed
 from abusive households once a case has been reported. Iowever, public facilities
 for such children are inadequate and have poorly trained staff.
 People With Disabilities.-The physically disabled have minimal access to public
 transportation, and ramps are practically nonexistent, even in government build-
 ings. According to local advocates, the disabled are discriminated against in many
 sectors, including education, health care, and emploment.
 In 1993 the Government passed the first comprehensive law to protect the rights
 of the disabled. That law requires that all newly constructed or renovated public
 parks and buildings provide access for the disabled. Among other important provi-
 sions, the law forbids discrimination in employment practices and in the provision
 of public services. However, the Government did not make a significant effort to im-
 plement the new law, to inform the public of it, or to try to change societal prejudice
 against the disabled.
 Indigenous People.-Although the law prohibits discrimination based on ethnic or-
 igin, members of the country's indigenous population frequently suffer from inatten-
 tion to and violation of their human rights. Many indigenous people are isolated
 from modern civilization and lack access to basic health and educational facilities.
 High rates of cholera, hepatitis-B, malaria, and other diseases plague their commu-
 nities. There are about 316,000 indigenous people in 28 ethnic groups, according to
 a special 1992 census.
 The Constitution provides for special laws governing "the protection of indigenous
 communities and their progressive incorporation into the life of the nation." None-
 theless, local political authorities seldom take account of the interests of indigenous
 people when making decisions affecting their lands, cultures, traditions, and alloca-
 tion of natural resources. As farmers and miners intrude on their habitat, indige-
 nous communities are threatened by deforestation, water pollution, and the intro-
 duction of deadly diseases. Few indigenous people hold title to their land.
 At year's end, the Supreme Court had not yet ruled on a lawsuit filed by environ-
 mental and indigenous organizations challenging a 1997 decree that permitted the
 expansion of legal mining actiities in the Imataca Forest Reserve. The groups
 
 
 798
 charged that only Congress can change the nature of the reserve, that there was
 an inadequate public review process prior to the change, and that expanded mining
 activities would adversely affect the health of the Warao, Arawako, Karina,
 Akawaio, and Pemon indigenous communities that inhabit the Imataca watershed
 area. In November 1997, the Supreme Court ordered the Government not to issue
 any new mining concessions in the Imataca reserve until the Court ruled on the
 constitutionality of the presidential decree.
 The controversy over infrstrucure development and the maintenance of tradi-
 tional Indian lifestyles is most evident in Bolivar state, where the Pemon Indians
 protested the building of power lines in August. About 80 Pemons blocked access
 to a construction site, using bows and arrows against the national guard, and chil-
 dren as shields. The national guardsmen used tear gas and plastic bullets to dis-
 perse the Pemons. After capturing the leader, the national guard was able to nego-
 tiate a 48-hour truce.
 The Yanomani, among the most isolated of the indigenous people, have been sub-
 ject to persistent incursions into their territory by illegal gold miners. The miners
 have not only introduced new diseases but social ills as well. In December 1996, a
 number of human rights organations, acting on behalf of the Yanomami commu-
 nity of Haximu, petitioned the IACHR in connection with the 1993 massacre of 16
 members of the community by Brazilian miners. The petition alleges that the Gov-
 ernment failed in its obligation to protect the Yanomami and to seek appropriate
 punishment of the killers, who were released by the Brazilian authorities after 3
 months' detention. In May the Government agreed t work with the NGO's under
 IACHR mediation to resolve the case. In September the army conducted an oper-
 ation to dislodge illegal miners. At year's end, the matter remained unsettled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Both the Constitution and labor law recognize and
 encourage the right of workers to organize. The comprehensive 1990 Labor Code ex-
 tends the right to form and join unions of their choosing to all private sector and
 public sector employees (except members of the armed forces). The Code mandates
 registrtion of unions with the Ministry of Labor, but it reduces the Ministrys dis-
 cretion by specifyting that registration may not-be denied if the proper documents
 (a record of the founding meeting, the statutes, and the membership list) are sub-
 mitted. Only a judge may dissolve a union, and then only for reasons listed in the
 law, such as the dissolution of a firm or by agreement of two-thirds of the member-
 ntne major union onnfederation, the Venezuelan Confederation of Workers (CTV),
 three small union confederations, and a number of independent unions operate free-
 ly. About 28 percent of the national labor force is unionized. The CTes top leader-
 ship includes me bers of several political parties but the majority are affiliated
 with one of the traditional parties, Democratic Action. The CTV and the AD influ-
 ence each other.-
 The law recognizes the right of public and private sector employees to strike.
 However, public servants may exercise it only if it does not cause irremediable
 damage to the population or to institutions." The Labor Code allows the President
 to order public or private sector strikers back to work and to submit their dispute
 to arbitration if the strike "puts in immediate danger the lives or security of alor
 part of the population." During 1998 most strikes occurred among government em-
 ployees such as university professors, teachers, judicial workers, telephone workers,
 and physicians in public hospitals and clinics. In the health sector, a series of
 strikes occurred beginning in May. In September doctors called a complete halt to
 medical attention, including emergencies, which lasted 17 days. The Government
 launched a media campaign against the doctors and announced punitive measures.
 The President eventually ordered them back to work and submitted the conflict to
 arbitration.
 There are no restrictions on affiliation with international labor organizations, and
 many union organizations are active internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code protects and
 encourages collective bargaining, w   is racticed freely. According to the code,
 employers must negotiate a collective contract with the union that represents the
 majority of their workers. The code also contains a provision stating that wages may
 be raised by administrative decree, provided that the Congress approves the decree.
 The law prohibits employers from interfering with the formation of unions or with
 their activities and from stipulating as a condition of employment that new workers
 must abstain from union activity or must join a specified union.
 Ministry of Labor inspectors hear complaints regarding violations of these regula-
 tions, and can impose a maximum fine of twice the minimum  monthly wage for a
 
 
 799
 -first infraction. Under the code, union officials enjoy special protection from dismis-
 sal. If a judge determines that any worker was fired or union activity, the worker
 is entitled to back pay plus either reinstatement or payment of a substantial sum
 of money, which varies according to his years of seniority.
 Labor law and practice is the same in the sole export processing zone, located in
 Punto Fijo, as in the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code states that no one
 may "obligate others to work against their will" and such practices are not known
 to occur. Apart from the general prohibition of compulsory labor, the law does not
 specifically prohibit forced and bonded labor by children, but such practices are not
 known to occur.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The
 Labor Code and the Tutelary Law for Minors contain provisions to protect children
 from exploitation in the workplace. The Ministry of Labor and the National Institute
 for Minors enforce child labor policies effectively in the formal sector of the economy
 but much less so in the informal sector, which accounts for the vast majority of child
 laborers. A plan formulated by the National Institute for Minors in 1996 to reach
 and better protect children who work in the informal sector has not been imple-
 mented because of a lack of funding.
 Primary school education is compulsory, free, and universal. However, 64 percent
 of children leave school before the ninth grade. In a 1996 survey of working children
 conducted by the National Institute for Minors, 45 percent of those polled stated
 that they were not in school. The actual figure is probably much higher considering
 that those who stated that they attended school also reported that they worked on
 average 7V2 hours a day 4 to 7 days a week.
 The Labor Code allows children between the ages of 12 and 14 to work only if
 the National Institute for Minors or the Labor Ministry grants special permission.
 It states that children between the ages of 14 and 16 may not work without permis-
 sion from their legal guardians. Minors may not work in mines or smelters, in occu-
 pations that risk life or health, that could damage intellectual or moral develop-
 ment, or in public spectacles.
 Those under 16 years of age must by law work no more than 6 hours a day or
 30 hours a week. Minors under the age of 18 may work only between the hours of
 6 a.m. and 7 p.m. The estimated 1.2 million children who work in the informal sec-
 tor, mostly as street vendors, generally work more hours than the total permitted
 under the law. In the National Institute for Minors 1996 survey of working children,
 half the children worked both morning and afternoon, and 64.5 percent worked 6
 or 7 days a week. Apart from the general prohibition of compulsory labor, the law
 does not specifically prohibit forced and bonded labor by children, but such practices
 are not known to occur (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The monthly minimum wage was $178
 (100,000 bolivars) in the private sector for urban workers and $160 (90,000 bolivars)
 for rural workers effective May 1. Total take-home pay in the public sector, the
 product of collective bargaining, was at least equal to that received by private sector
 minimum wage workers. Fringe benefits are added to these minimum figures; they
 vary with the workers' individual circumstances, but in general increase wages by
 about one-third. However, even with these benefits, the minimum wage is not suffi-
 cient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker and family. Unions point
 out that a worker's income is often less than the cost of a family's basic food basket,
 estimated by the Government at year's end at $218 (122,902 bolivars). Under the
 Labor Code, the minimum wage rates are set by administrative decree, which Con-
 gress may either suspend or ratify but may not change. The law excludes only do-
 mestic workers and concierges from coverage under the minimum wage decrees. The
 Ministry of Labor enforces minimum wage rates effectively in the formal sector of
 the economy, but about half of the population works in the informal sector, where
 labor laws and protections generally are not enforced. The 1990 Labor Code reduced
 the standard workweek to a maximum of 44 hours and requires 2 "complete days
 of rest each week." Some unions, such as the petroleum workers, have negotiated
 a 40-hour week. Overtime may not exceed 2 hours daily, 10 hours weekly, or 100
 hours annually, and may not be paid at a rate less than time and a half. The Min-
 istry of Labor effectively enforces these standards in the formal sector.
 The authorities have yet to promulgate regulations to implement the 1986 Health
 and Safety Law, which is not enforced. The delay is due largely to concern that the
 law provides penal sanctions against management when violations of health and
 safety occur and that there is ambiguity in the law over what constitutes a viola-
 tion. The Labor Code states that employers are obligated to pay specified amounts
 (up to a maximum of 25 times the minimum monthly salary) to workers for acci-
 dents or occupational illnesses, regardless of who is responsible for the injury.
 
 
 800
 It also requires that workplaces maintain "sufficient protection for health and life
 against sicknesses and accidents," and it imposes fines ranging from one-quarter to
 twice the minimum monthly salary for first infractions. However, in practice Min-
 istry of Labor inspectors seldom close down unsafe job sites. Under the law, workers
 can remove themselves from dangerous workplace situations without jeopardy to
 continued employment.
