 ZIBABWE
 Zimbabwe is governed by President Rbert Mugabe and his Zimbabwe African
 National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF), which have dominated the legislative
 and executive branches of government since independence in 1980. The Constitution
 allows for multiple parties; in addition to ZANU-PF, there are a large number of
 smaller parties. However, they are poorly organized and led, poorly financed, and
 subject to periodic intimidation by the ruling party and government security forces.
 The Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) are responsible for maintaining law and
 order. The Zimbabwe National Army and Air Force are responsible for external se-
 
 
 302
 curity. The Central Intelligence Organization (CIO) under the Ministry of State Se-
 curity is responsible for internal and external security but no longer has powers of
 arrest. Members of the security forces committed human rights abuses.
 The economy is primarily agricultural but has a strong mining sector and a diver-
 sified manufacturing base. Over 60 percent of the population is engaged in subsist-
 ence agriculture. The formal sector unemployment rate remains above 45 percent.
 Both domestic and foreign investment are well below what is needed to spur solid
 economic growth and job creation. Annual per capita gross national product is ap-
 proximately $650. Zimbabwe's Economic Structural Adjustment Program, now in its
 fifth year, has led changes such as the removal of subsidies for staple foods, that
 have caused living standards to fall.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens; however,
 there were significant problems in some areas, including incidents of police brutal-
 ity, harsh prison conditions, the Government's refusal to abide by several court rul-
 ings, and the President's vocal campaign against homosexuals. Although the legisla-
 tive and campaign climate remained tilted in favor of the ruling party, impartial
 election monitors found the April general elections to be generally free and fair. The
 electronic media, the major source of information for most Zimbabweans, remained
 government controlled. Although the small independent press was increasingly open
 and critical of the Government, the Government's arrest of three publishing execu-
 tives on charges of criminal defamation demonstrated its willingness to intimidate
 the media. Domestic violence against women remained widespread, and traditional,
 often illegal, discrimination against women and the disabled continued.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings by government security forces. However, throughout the year, police killed
 5 people in shooting incidents. In September a policeman shot a constable who chal-
 lenged him for urinating in public; the policeman was arrested and charged with
 murder. On November 3, a policeman fired his rifle at a group of thieves, who had
 raided an office equipment store in Harare, and killed two bystanders and seriously
 injured a third. Outraged onlookers attacked the police anda riot ensued, causing
 property damage and two injuries. Police dispersed rioters by using tear gas and
 arrested 15 people in connection with the riot and related looting. In response to
 the incident, the Government apologized and promised that the ZRP would com-
 pensate the victims and their families. The other two incidents occurred in the
 course of a robbery and when a mob attempted to free a suspect and wrestle a gan
 from a police officer. There was at least one incident in which a person died while
 in plice custody (see Section 1.c.).
 There were no developments in the cases concerning the 1992 death in custody
 of 15-year-old Happy Dhlakama, the 1988 death of Captain Edwin Nyela, or the
 1991 death of Lieutenant Shepard Chisango. No action has been taken on the 1993
 Simplicius Chihambakwe Commission investigation into atrocities committed during
 the 1982-87 Matabeleland crisis. Human rights groups continued to collect informa-
 tion on reports of deaths and disappearances. Despite calls by the Catholic Commis-
 sion for Justice and Peace (CCJP) or an investigation, the Government took no fur-
 ther action on the bodies discovered at Antelope Mine in Kezi in 1992; the remains
 have not been identified or properly buried.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 There were no developments in the 1990 disappearance of Rashiwe Guzha.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and cruel and inhuman treatment. There were
 no reports of torture; however, despite improved ZRP training, low-ranking police
 and poorly trained parapolice called special constables continued to beat criminal
 suspects and detainees. In June ZRP forces injured students while putting down vio-
 lent demonstrations (see Section 2.a.). Also in June, in Kwekwe police severely beat
 a criminal suspect, Mukhetiwa Chirenje, who subsequently died of unrelated causes.
 The policemen involved were charged with assault causing grevious bodily harm.
 The Government has not actively pursued past allegations of torture, nor pros-
 ecuted CIO or ZRP officers for suc abuses. The CIO continued to refuse to pay
 court-ordered damages to a 1990 torture victim.
 Prison conditions remained harsh and have improved little since the CCJP issued
 its 1993 report describing extreme overcrowding, shortages of clothing, and poor
 sanitary conditions. Over 21,000 prisoners are incarcerated in a system built to ac-
 commodate 16,000. In some prisons, prisoners are allowed about one-half square
 meter per person. Overcrowding and poor sanitation aggravated outbreaks of chol-
 
 
 303
 era, diarrhea, and AIDS-related illnesses. An average of 25 prisoners a month died
 in custody, 18 from AIDS-related illnesses. Zimbabwe has established a successful
 community service sentencing program to try to alleviate prison overcrowding. Pris-
 on service officials who mistreat prisoners are routinely punished. The Government
 permits international human rights monitors to visit prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest, detention, or exile, and the Government observes these prohibitions. The law
 requires that police inform an arrested person of the charges against him before he
 is taken into custody. Although a preliminary hearing before a magistrate is re-
 quired within 48 hours (or 96 hours over a weekend), the law is often disregarded
 if a person does not have legal representation. A 1992 amendment to the Criminal
 Procedures and Evidence Act substantially reduced the power of magistrates to
 grant bail without the consent of the Attorney General or his agents. In practice,
 however, a circular issued by the Attorney General giving a general authority to
 grant bail has lessened the negative impact of the rule. Hih Court judges grant
 bail independently.
 The Government still enjoys a wide range of legal powers under the Official Se-
 crets Act and the Law and Order Maintenance Act (LOMA). Originally promulgated
 30 years ago and widely used in the past to prosecute political opponents of the Gov-
 ernment, the LOMA gives extensive powers to the police, the Minister of Home Af-
 fairs, and the President to address political and security crimes that are not clearly
 defined. The Government has not invoked the LOMA frequently, fearing that its op.
 pressiveprovisions might be declared unconstitutional.
 Pretrial detainees, who make up 20 per cent of the overall prison population,
 spent an average of 6 months in prison before their trials because of a critical short-
 age of magistrates and cout interpreters. Daniel Machabe remained in custody
 after more than 8 years without going to trial.
 The Government does not use exile as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the judiciary has a well-deserved reputation for independence. Judges are
 appointed for life and can be removed from the bench only for grss misconduct.
 They are not disharged or transferred for plitical reasons. Magistrates, who are
 part of the civil servic rather than the judiciary, hear the vast majority of cases
 and are sometimes subject to political pressure. However, all levels of the judiciary
 often make rulings unpopular with the Government.
 The Customary Law and Local Courts Act of 1990 created a unitary court system,
 consisting of headmen's _courts, chiefs' courts, mnagistrates' courts, the High Court,
 and the Supreme Court. With this restructuring, civil and customary law eases may
 be heard at all levels of the judiciary, including the Supreme Court.
 The Constitution provides for the right to a fair trial, and the judiciary rigorously
 enforces this right. Every defendant has the right to a lawyer of his or her choosing.
 However, wll over 90 percent of defendants in magistrates' courts go unrepre-
 sented. In criminal cases, an indigent defendant may apply to have the Government
 provide an attorney, but this is rarely dne and rarely granted. In capital cases, the
 Government will provide an attorney for all defendants unable to afford one. Liti-
 gants in civil cases can requet lega assistance from the Legal Resources Founda-
 tion or the Citizens Advice Bureau. All litigants are represented in the High Court.
 The Supreme Court has instructed magistrates to ensure that unrepresented de-
 fendants fully understand their rights and to weigh any mitigating circumstances
 in criminal cases, whether or not the accused presents them as part of his defense.
 The right to appeal exists in all cases and is automatic in cases in which the
 death penalty is imposed. Trials are open to the public except in certain security
 cases, Defendants enjoy a presumption of innocence and the right to present wit-
 nesses and question witnesses against them. Defendants and their attorneys gen-
 erally have access to government-held evidence relevant to their cases. The legal
 system does not discriminate against women or minorities. Trials in military and
 .pDolice courts meet internationally accepted standards for fair trials; defendants in
 these courts have the right to appeal to the Supreme Court.
 The Government generally abided by court decisions even when it was strongly
 opposed to the rulings. However, the Government routinely delayed payment of
 court costs or judgments awarded against it. For example, the CIO continued its re-
 fusal to pay damages awarded by the High Court to a former opposition party offi-
 cial whom CIO agents tortured in 1990. The Attoey Generals office was unable
 to force CIO compliance with the judgment. In addition, the Ministry of Home Af-
 fairs refused to comply with a 1994 Supreme Court ruling declaring that women
 should have the same  rights as men to confer residency and citizenship on their
 aeuses, and on December 19, the Government tabled a constitutional amendment
 tat would overturn the rulingd
 
 
 The Government invoked the rarely used LOMA in October when it arrested two
 suspects in an alleged assassination attempt against President Mugabe. There were
 reprts that one of the two suspects was beaten severely following his arrest. On
 October 14, opposition ZANU-NDONGA party leader and Member of Parliament
 (M.P.) Ndabadingi Sithole, was arrested in connection with the plot and at year's
 end remained out on bail pending trial.
 Legal and human rights activists continued to criticize the Government's efforts
 to pass constitutional amendments in order to undermine Supreme Court rulings.
 For example, Amendment 11 (1992) changed the Constitution to allow corporal pun-
 ishment of minors after the Supreme Court ruled that caning of minors constituted
 cruel and inhuman punishment; the Government also asserted that death by hang-
 ing was not cruel and inhuman in anticipation of a case challenging hanging as a
 method of execution. Similarly, Amendment 13 (1993), passed just weeks after the
 Supreme Court ruled that long incarceration on death row constituted cruel and in-
 human punishment, declared that neither treatment of prisoners nor delays in car-
 rying out sentences entitled prisoners to a stay or remission of sentence.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or cor-
 respondence. Although the Government authorities generally respect these prohibi-
 tions and violations are subject to legal sanction, it is widely known that the Gov-
 ernment sometimes monitors private correspondence and telephones, particularly
 international communications.
 The need for land reform in Zimbabwe is almost universally accepted; however,
 problems have arisen with implementation of the 1992 Land Acquisition Act. Farm-
 ers whose lands have been designated for acquisition may only appeal the amount
 of compensation in administrative courts, not the initial decision to acquire their
 farms. Although there were no new designations in 1995, in the past this act was
 implemented largely along racial lines; the Government stated that black-owned
 commercial farms would not be subject to designation. In a few cases, land was des-
 ignated for acquisition to achieve political goals. Opposition party leader M.P.
 Ndabaningi Sithole continued to fight the Government over its 1993 acquisition of
 his farm.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion but allows for legislation to limit this freedom in the "interest of defense, public
 safety, public order, state economic interests, public morality, and public health." Al-
 though the independent press is increasingly open and critical of government, there
 is a high degree of self-censorship in both the government-controlled and independ-
 ent press.
 Self-censorship is aggravated by antidefamation laws which make no distinction
 between public and private persons and an extremely broad Official Secrets Act
 which makes it a crime to divulge "any information acquired in the course of official
 duties." In May the editor in chief of the Financial Gazette, his deputy, and the
 chairman of Modus Publications were arrested on charges of criminal defamation re-
 lated to their refusal to retract a story on the President's alleged marriage. Their
 Friday night arrest, necessitatimg 3 days' detention before their first hearing, was
 widely believed to have been calculated to intimidate the press.
 Zimbabwe's major print media (seven English-language newspapers and one ver-
 nacular broadsheet) belong to the Mass Media Trust, a holding company heavily in-
 fluenced by the Government and ruling party; the Ministry of Information controls
 the Zimbabwe Inter-Africa News Agency wire service. The Government influences
 mainstream media through indirect ownership, editorial appointments, directives to
 editors, and removal of wayward editors. The small independent press consists pri-
 marily of an economic weekly, a Sunday tabloid, and three monthly magazines.
 They carefully monitor government policies and open their pages to opposition crit-
 ics; other minor independent publications exist wit circulations under 3,000.
 Radio and television are entirely government owned and controlled. Journalists
 report that ZANU-PF Secretary for Information Nathan Shamuyarira is often in-
 volved in determining what news is broadcast. The Broadcasting Act currently gives
 the Zimbabwe Broadcast Corporation (ZBC) monoply status, and the Government
 has repeatedly refused to license independent rai o and television stations. How-
 ever, in August, the Supreme Court ruled that the Government's monopoly on tele-
 communications was unconstitutional because it interfered with the constitutional
 right to freedom of expression.
 Although the ZBC granted free air time to each party contesting the April general
 elections, opposition party allies and press conferences received only limited tele-
 
 
 305
 vision and radio coverage. In addition, the Bulawayo Chronicle edited a pai.d adver-
 tisement placed by the Forum Party without the party's consent because the editor
 deemed its mention of compensation for the victims of the Matabeleland Crisis
 (1982-87) "inflammatory."
 Books and films are subject to review by the Zimbabwe Board of Censors.
 Academic freedom is curtailed by the University of Zimbabwe Amendment Act
 and the National Council for Higher Education Act, both of which together greatly
 restrict the independence of universities, making them subject to government influ-
 ence and extending the disciplinary powers of the university authorities against
 staff and students. Following student demonstrations in June and July the Minister
 of Higher Education dissolved the University Council and suspended the Student
 Representative Council's board (11 of its 12 members were later reinstated). On
 June 26, the ZRP forcefully suppressed violent student demonstrations, resulting in
 scores of injuries. In the aftermath of the demonstrations, the senior officer in
 che of the operation was transferred to another division. In December the Uni-
 versity Council expelled four student leaders for their role in the demonstrations.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of assembly and association for political and nonpolitical orgamzations, in-
 cluding a broad spectrum of economic, social, professional, and recreational activi-
 ties. The formation of unions and political parties is not restricted. Organizations
 are generally free of governmental interference as long as their activities are viewed
 as nonpolitical. However, under the Welfare Organizations Act of 1995, the Minister
 of Social Welfare, Labor and Public Service is empowered to suspend the executive
 body or "any member of the executive committee of an organization and to appoint
 persons to manage the affairs of the organization for a specified time." The Minister
 invoked this act in November, removing members of a women's nongovernmental or-
 ganization (NGO) executive body. The press subsequently alleged that the members
 were removed for tribal reasons. As a result of this act, several newly established
 NGO's decided to establish their organizations as "associations" connected with es-
 tablished NGO's so that their executive bodies would not be subject to government
 interference.
 Permits are no longer required for meetings or demonstrations. However, opposi-
 tion parties complained that during the April elections public halls they booked
 were often double-booked or not opened as scheduled. In December President
 Mugabe threatened to outlaw all demonstrations and the Minister of Home Affairs
 said that a draft Public Order Act would tighten government control over dem-
 onstrations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriaton.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government gen-
 erally respects them in practice.
 The new Zimbabwean Citizenship and Immigration bill, presented to Parliament
 in mid-1994 but not yet law, tightens prohibitions against dual citizenship. Human
 rights groups are concerned that these provisions will most affect white
 Zimbabweans, many of whom hold dual citizenship, and will interfere with citizens'
 right of return.
 The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and
 other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. There were no reports of
 forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status. There were approxi-
 mately 350 refugees in Zimbabwe from a variety of African nations.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the legal right to change their government through democratic
 means. However, the political process continued to be tilted through various means
 in favor of the ruling party. President Mugabe and his ZANU-PF party remained
 the dominant political force within the count. In the April general elections,
 ZANU-PF captured 118 of the 120 elected seats. The 10 chiefs who sit as M.P.'s are
 elected by their peers. The President also appoints 8 provincial governors, who sit
 as M.P.'s, and 12 nonconstituency M.P.'s. The net result of several constitutional
 amendments has been to consolidate the power of the executive branch and to limit
 M.P.s' independence. There is no effective parliamentary opposition, and the legisla-
 ture remained subordinate to the executive branch.
 There are many small opposition parties. However, their growth is inhibited by
 a variety of factors including the Political Parties Finance Act (PPFA) and the gov-
 ernment monopoly on the electronic media. The PPFA provides government funding
 only to those parties that have more than 15 parliamentary seats, effectively giving
 
 
 306
 all public funding to the ruling party. Several opposition parties boycotted the elec-
 tions, claiming that until the PPFA, the Electoral Act, and the Broadcast Act were
 substantially revised, they would be unable to surmount the hurdles placed before
 them by the electoral system. However, the opposition parties' lack of coherent plat-
 forms, poor leadership and infighting played an equally important role in their poor
 showing in the general elections.
 Voting in the general election was peaceful and generally free and fair. In con-
 trast to the 1990 general election senior ruling party officials and the Commissioner
 of Police did not tolerate political violence. en violence erupted in Harare South
 district several weeks before the election, the ringleaders were arrested and charged
 with public violence. The Government enacted regulations allowing volunteer elec-
 tion monitors to act as agents of the Electoral Supervisory Commission. Over 1,500
 NGO poll watchers were deployed nationwide to monitor voting and vote counting,
 and human rights organizations praised the conduct of the ZRP during the elections.
 There were no reports of bias or intimidation by election officials.
 In the election campaign, however, government officials and members of the rul-
 ing party attempted to influence the outcome of the elections through various
 means, including harassment of voters and opposition party members. The cam-
 paign was marked by lopsided media coverage, inaccuracies in the voters' roll, and
 widespread irregularities during the ZANU-F primaries. There were credible re-
 ports that ruling party officials threatened voters that their constituencies would re-
 ceive no development assistance and no government food aid if they did not support
 the ruling party. Monitors in Kwekwe reported that voters were told that if they
 did not support the ruling party, the atrocities of the 1982-87 Matabeleland crisis
 would be repeated. The CIO occasionally harassed and threatened opposition party
 members.
 There are institutional problems with the management and supervision of elec-
 tions. Although the Ministry of Justice technically administers the Electoral Act, the
 Registrar General's Office falls under the Ministry of Home Affairs. With a meager
 budget and a tiny staff seconded from the Ministry of Justice, the Electoral Super-
 visory Commission lacks the institutional capacity to oversee properly Zimbabwe's
 2,200 polling stations. Nor do commissioners have the executive authority to order
 that an irregularity be corrected. Despite an attempt to computerize the voters' roll
 before the general election, the roll contained over I million redundancies or errors,
 includingmisspellings, multiple entries, and names of the deceased. This occurred
 despite the Rgistrar General's earlier announcement that the Delimitation Com-
 mission would not count voters when defining constituency boundaries unless they
 reregistered. There was no mechanism provided for the public to comment on the
 newly defied boundaries or for adjustment of the boundaries.
 Thousands of voters were turned away at pollin stations because their names
 were missing from or improperly listed on the roll. fn addition, several independent
 and opposition candidates and one ruling party primary winner were disqualified
 because their nominators' names did not appear or were misspelled on the roll.
 The High Court nullified the election results from Harare South district. An oppo-
 sition party also challenged the results of the July by-election in Gweru on the
 grounds that registration irregularities affected the outcome. At year's end the case
 was still pending in the High Court, as was the Forum Party of Zimbabwe's case
 aleng elction    elaties in the mayoral and urban ouncil elections.
 There were similar allegations of voting irregularities during the ZANU-PF pri-
 maries for Pariament and local government posts. For example, lists of party offi-
 cials eligible to vote were lost or incomplete and several candidates created "phan-
 tom party districts to increase the number of their suppoters eligible to vote. Fol-
 lowing the July local government primaries, the pay politburo nullified the results,
 scheduled newprimaries, declared that primaries were postponed indefinitely, and
 then announced in September that the elections would be held the following day.
 Women participate in politics without legal restriction. However, according to
 local women's groups husbands-particularly in rural areas--commonly force their
 wives to vote for the husband's preferred candidates. Twenty-three of the 150 M.P.s
 are women, including the Deputy Speaker of Parliament. There are two female cabi-
 net ministers and three deputy ministers. All major ethnic groups are represented
 in Parliament and in the Government.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Although the Government permits local civic and human rights groups to operate,
 it monitors their activities closel  *  articular those of the Catholic Commission
 for Justice and Peace and ZIMR  GT. Other groups that promote human rights
 include the Legal Resource Foundation and the Southern African Federation of the
 
 
 Disabled. In 1995 Amnesty International and Transparency International opened in
 Harare. The International Committee of the Red Cross operates a regional office in
 Harare. The Government does not discourage representatives from international
 human rights groups from visiting Zimbabwe.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides that "every person in Zimbabwe" is entitled to fun-
 damental rights whatever his race, tribe place of origin, political opinions, color,
 creed or sex. In August President Mugabe attacked homosexuality in a series of
 speeches and urged Zimbabweans to "arrest homosexuals and turn them over to the
 police." At the insistence of the Government, the Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe
 (GALZ) group was forced to withdraw its participation in the 1995 Zimbabwe Inter-
 national BookFair. However, the police have not harassed GALZ members.
 Women.-Domestic violence against women, especially wife beating, is common
 and crosses all racial and economic lines. Women's groups have noted that every po-
 lice station in Zimbabwe has handled at least one case of a woman killed by her
 husband. According to Women in Law and Development in Africa (WILDAF), do-
 mestic violence accounts for more than 60 percent of murder cases in the Harare
 High Court. In 1992, the last year for which official statistics are available, 4,437
 official complaints of wife beating were filed. Human rights groups have noted that
 increased training has improved police community relations officers' handling of
 these cases. There were 964 reports of rape (the majority involving girls under 14)
 in 1992, the last year for which police statistics are available. When cases come to
 court, the courts generally impose stiff sentences for rape and wife beating.
 Since independence, the Government has enacted major laws aimed at enhancing
 women's rights and countering certain traditional practices that discriminate
 against women. However women remain disadvantaged in Zimbabwean society. Il-
 literacy, economic dependency, and prevailing social norms prevent rural women in
 particular from combating societal discrimination. Despite legal prohibitions, women
 are still vulnerable to entrenched customary practices, including "kuzvarira," the
 practice of pledging a young women to marriage with a partner not of her choosing;
 nhaka," the custom of forcing a widow to marry her late husband's brother;, and
 the customary practice of offering a youn girl as compensatory paent in
 interfamily disputes. Many doctors and hospitals routinely require the husband'a
 consent for women sevkin, long-term contraception.
 The Legal Age of Majoity Act and the Matrmonial Causes Act recognize womens
 right to own property independently of their husbands or fathers. However, while
 unmarried women may own property in their own names, women married under
 customary law are not allowedt own property jointly with their husbands. Despite
 a 1994 Supreme Court ruling that the practic of allowing only men, not women,
 to confer citizenship or permanent residence status on their spouses and children
 was discriminatory, the migation Service did not institute the change (see Sec-
 tion i.e.), and the overnment has tabled a constitutional amendment which would
 overturn the ruling. Inheritance laws remain unfavorable to widows. The Govern-
 ment took no legisative action on a draft inheritance law that would address the
 issue of unfair and unequal distribution of inherited assets. Divorce and mainte-
 nance laws are favorable toward women, but women generally lack awareness of
 their rights under the law
 Although labor legislation prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of
 gender, women are concentrated in the lower echelons of the work force and com-
 monly face sexual harassment in the workplace.
 Several active women's rights groups in Zimbabwe, including WILDAF, the
 Musasa Project, and the Women's Action Group, concentrate on improving women's
 knowledge of their legal rights, increasing women's economic power, and combating
 domestic violence. There is no office specifically responsible for women's affairs; the
 Government eliminated the office of Minister of State for Women's Affairs in May.
 Children.-The Government continued to demonstrate its strong commitment to
 children's rights and welfare through a aSe m of  rimary health care and education
 overseen by the Ministry of Heal    e and  ld Welfare. The Chldren's Protection
 and Adoption Act, the Guardianship of Minors Act, and the Deceased Person's Main-
 tenance Act all protect the legal rights of minor children. Zimbabwe ratified the
 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction in May.
 While there is no compulsory education, Zimbabwe has made considerable progress
 in prviding education for girls, and overallprimaryschool attendance has increased
 by more than 400 percent since independence. Ninety-three percent of children
 reach grade five. With the reintroduction of school fees in urban schools and rural
 secondary schools, however, enrollment has declined. If a family is unable to pay
 
 
 308
 tuition costs, it is most often female children who leave school. Child abuse, as such,
 does not appear to be widespread. However, incest, long taboo in Zimbabwean soci-
 ety, is increasing, and there are increasing reports of instances of infanticide, child
 abandonment, and rape.
 The Ministry of Justice established a Vulnerable Witnesses Committee composed
 of representatives from the ZRP, NGO's, and the courts. The Committee launched
 a training program and has two pilot projects to improve the judicial system's han-
 dling of child victims of rape and sexual abuse. The criminal justice system has spe-
 cial provisions for dealing with juvenile offenders.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is rarely per-
 formed in Zimbabwe. However, according to press reports, the initiation rites prac-
 ticed by the small Remba ethnic group in Midlands province include infibulation,
 the most extreme form of FGM.
 People With Disabilities.-Fulfilling a campaign promise to give the disabled rep-
 resentation in Parliament, in April President Mugabe appointed a disability activist
 to Parliament. The Disabled Persons Act of 1992 specifically prohibits discrimina-
 tion against people with disabilities in employment, admission to public places, or
 provision of services and is viewed by advocates of the disabled as model legislation.
 In practice, however, the lack of resources for training and education severely ham-
 pers the ability of disabled people to compete for scarce jobs. Although this act stip-
 ulates that government buildings should have access for disabled persons, for budg-
 etary reasons this is rarely provided. Disabled people face particularly harsh cus-
 tomary discrimination. According to traditional belief, people with disabilities are
 considered bewitched, and reports of disabled children being hidden when visitors
 arrive are common.
 National /Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Shona ethnic group makes up 77 per-
 cent of the population, Ndebele 14 percent, Kalanga 5 percent, whites 1 percent, and
 other ethnic groups 3 percent. Government services are provided on a nondiscrim-
 inatory basis, and the Government has sought to expand and improve the previously
 "whites only" infrastructure in urban areas to provide health and social services to
 all citizens. Nevertheless, in social terms, Zimbabwe remains a racially stratified
 country. While schools and churches are all integrated, social interaction among ra-
 cial groups is still limited. Although intertribal relations are generally very good,
 the disproportionate number of Shona-speaking teachers and headmasters in
 Matabeleland schools remained a sensitive issue.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Labor Relations Act (LRA) provides private sec-
 tor workers with freedom of association and the right to elect their own representa-
 tives, publish newsletters, and set programs and policies which reflect the political
 and economic interests of labor. Workers are free to form or join unions without
 prior authorization. The LRA allows for the existence of multiple unions per indus-
 try, provided that each is registered with the Ministry of Public Service, Labor, and
 Social Welfare (MPSLSW). While the Government may deregister individual unions,
 the High Court has ruled that the LRA does not give the Minister the power to sus-
 pend or deregister the national umbrella labor confederation, the Zimbabwe Con-
 gress of Trade Unions (ZCTU).
 Less than 20 per cent of the salaried work force belongs to the 33 unions that
 form the ZCTU. ZCTU officers are elected by the delegates of affiliated trade unions
 at congresses held every 5 years. While the Government encouraged the ZCTU's for-
 mation, anticipating that it would form the labor arm of ZANU-PF, it no longer di-
 rectly influences ZCTU actions. The Government and the ZCTU often clash on eco-
 nomic policy, particularly the Economic Structural Adjustment Program. The Gov-
 ernment routinely does not consult either the ZCTU or employers before implement-
 ing policy decisions affecting the workplace. This lack of consultation often results
 in reactions which disrupt labor relations, promoting uncertainty and even strikes.
 At its 1995 Congress, the ZCTU called for the formation of a standing committee
 consisting of labor, government, and industry representatives that would comment
 on all government policy decisions affecting labor. Although the LRA allows for the
 formation of multiple national federations, none but the ZCTU exists.
 Public servants and their associations, the Public Service Association (PSA), the
 Zimbabwe Teachers Association, and the Zimbabwe Nurses Association, are not cov-
 ered by the provisions of the LRA. Their conditions of employment are provided for
 under the Constitution, and they are constitutionally barred from forming unions.
 The Government took no action on proposals to join the public and private sectors
 under one LRA.

 The Labor Relations Amendment Act (LRAA) of 1992 specifies that workers may
 establish independent worker committees, which exist side by side with unions, in
 each plant. Worker committees must also be registered with the MPSISW, which
 is fre-e to refuse registration. Trade union officials believe that the formation of
 worker committees was an attempt to dilute union authority. However, the ineffec-
 tiveness of worker committees demonstrated the need for the experienced worker
 representation of the established trade unions.
 The International Conference of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) has criticized
 Zimbabwean labor legislation for giving "wide scope to the authorities to declare
 that a given enterprise or industry constitutes an essential service, and then impose
 a ban (on strikes) on it.7 This authority was not used during 1995. Workers in sec-
 tors deemed "nonessential* have the right to strike provided the union advises the
 Government 2 weeks in advance of its intention to do so. If the MPSISW finds that
 administrative requirements were not met for a strike, it can issue a disposal order
 that gives the employer the right to dismiss striking workers. This occurred only
 once in 1995, and was subsequently withdrawn. There were fewer than 20 strikes,
 none lasting more than a week.
 The ZCTU and its officials are free to associate with international labor organiza-
 tions and do so actively. The ZCTU is affiliated with the ICFTU and the Southern
 African Trade Union Coordinating Council The African American Labor Center
 maintains a regional office based in Harare.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The LRA provides workers
 with the right to organize. As originally enacted, this act was silent on the right
 to bargain collectively. However, the 1992 LRAA permits unions to bargain coliec-
 tively over wages. Worker committees, which are   law not organizationally part
 of the unions or the ZCTU, are empowered to negotiate with the management of
 a particular plant the conditions of labor and codes of conduct in the workplace, ex-
 cept for wages.
 Collective bargaining wage negotiations take place on an industrywide basis be-
 tween the relevant union and employer organizations sitting on joint employment
 boards or councils. These bodies submit their agreements to the registrar in the
 MPSISW for approval The Government retains the power to veto agreements it be-
 lieves would harm the economy. However, it did not directly involve itself in labor
 negotiations unless requested to do so by one of the two parties. When no trade
 umon reprem nts a specific sector, representatives of the organized workers, i.e., the
 professional associations, meet with the employer associations, under the mediation
 of labor officers from the MPSISW. Public sector wages are determined by the Sal-
 ary Service Department of the MPSISW, subject to the approval of an indendent
 Public Service Commission (PSC). Each year, PSC officials meet with %A rep-
 resentatives to review wages and benefits. These reviews result in a recommenda-
 tion which is forwarded to the MPSLSW. The Minister is not required by law to
 accept the recommendation.
 Employees designated as being in manaerial positions are excluded from union
 membership and thus from the collective bargaining process. The presence of the
 ZCTU or specific national unions in individual shop floor or worker committee nego-
 tiations is not mandated.
 The LRA prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers against union members.
 Complaints of such discrimination are referred to labor relations officers and may
 subsequently be adjudicated by the Labor Relations Tribunal (LRT). Such com-
 plaints are andled under the mechanism for resolving cases involving "unfair labor
 practices." The determining authority may direct that workers fired due to
 antiunion discrimination should be reinstated, although this has yet to be tested in
 practice.
 The LRAA streamlined the procedure for adjudicating disputes by strengthening
 the LRT. Now, labor relations officers hear a dispute; their decision may be ap-
 pealed to regional labor relations officers, at which point the LRT may hear the
 case. Ultimately, it may be appealed to the Supreme Court. In 1993 the Government
 filled long vacant positions on the LRT, but at yeai's end the LRT boards were still
 not fully staffed and faced a backlog of over 630 cases awaiting hearing.
 The Export Processing Zones Act was promulgated in August. The act states that
 the LRA shall not apply to workers in export processing zones (EPZ's). Due to inten-
 sive ZCTU lobbying efforts, however, President Mugabe agreed to have this changed
 by regulation or amendment so that the LRA will apply. At year's end, EPZ's had
 not yet been established.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Compulsory labor is prohibited by
 law, and there were no reports that it was practiced.
 d. Minimum Age of Employment of Children.-The law affords little protection to
 working children. There is no specific legal prohibition of child labor, the LRA only
 
 
 310
 states that contracts of employment shall not be enforceable against any person
 under the age of 16. Although schooling is not compulsory, over 90 percent of chil-
 dren attend school through grade five (see Section 5).
 The presence of child labor in industry is marginal since a ready supply of adult
 labor at relatively low wages gives firms little incentive to employ children. Children
 are most often employed as casual farm workers, domestics, or in the informal sec-
 tor only a tiny percentage of children work full-time. In the communal areas, finan-
 cia necessity often dictates the use of child labor during the harvest season and for
 tending livestock. There were anecdotal reports of an increase in the number of chil-
 dren working full-time in the informal sector and small-scale alluvial gold panning.
 The Government formed a task force in late 1993 to define child labor, determine
 problem areas, and suggest legislation to alleviate these problems. It has yet to re-
 ease its report or a draft law or regulations based on its findings.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The maximum legal work week is 54 hours,
 and the law prescribes a minimum of one 24-hour rest period per week. Working
 conditions are regulated by the Government according to industry. The Constitution
 empowers the PSC to set conditions of employment in the public sector. Government
 regulations for each of the 22 industrial sectors continue to specify minimum wages,
 hours, holidays, and required safety measures. In recent years, in an effort to opt
 out of the wage bargaining system, the Government mandated wage parameters and
 specified minmum wage increases only for domestics and gardeners. Due to an inef-
 fective monitoring system, many such workers are remunerated below the minimum
 waeminimum monthly wage for domestics and gardeners of $28.08 (Z$242.89) is
 the de facto minimum wage for Zimbabwe. In most instances the employer must
 provide housing and food to workers or allowances for such. On commercial farms,
 the employer may provide schooling for workers' children. The minimum wage is not
 sufficient to sustain a decent standard of living. Workers in those sectors covered
 under collective bargaining agreements received wage increases averaging a few
 percentage points be ow the 23 percent inflation rate. Minimum monthly wage rates
 ranged from $33.50 (Z$290) in the agricultural sector to a pproximately $70 to $83
 (Z$600 to Z$720) in the various manufacturing sectors. In theory, labor relations of-
 ficers from the MPSISW are assigned to monitor developments in each plant to as-
 sure that government minimum wage policy and occupational health and safety reg-
 ulations are observed. In practice, these offices are understaffed, cannot afford to
 routinely inspect workplaces, and must rely on voluntary compliance and reporting
 by employers.
 Safety in the work place is a continuing problem. Over the past 4 years, an aver-
 age of 17,500 work-r ated accidents (including 224 deaths) were reported each year.
 Many of the basic legal protections do not apply to the vast majority of farm, mine,
 and domestic workers. Unions charge that there are no general standards for the
 work environment, such as threshold limits for manually li-fted weights or conditions
 for pregnant workers. Health and safety standards are determined only on an indus-
 try-specific basis. The Government intervenes on a selected basis (and often seem-
 ingly in response to the most recent accident) and sets standards by regulation in
 some industries. In theory, workers have a legal right to remove themselves from
 dangerous work situations without jeopardy to continued employment; in practice,
 they risk the loss of their livelihood.
