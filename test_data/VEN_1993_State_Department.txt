 VENEZUELA
 Venezuela is a republic with an active multiparty democratic system, a free press,
 well established unions, and a longstanding commitment to democracy. These fac-
 tors enabled the country to withstand the impeachment of a president in 1993 and
 two attempted coups in 1992. For more than 35 years, power passed peacefully be-
 tween two large political parties through open elections. Two-party dominance
 ended on December 5, however, when former President Rafael Caldera was elected
 President with the support of a diverse coalition of small and medium-sized parties.
 The new Congress due to convene in January 1994 will be comprised of four major
 political groupings. The December 5 elections were generally characterized as air
 and open, although allegations of fraud cast doubt on results for some state and na-
 tional legislative contests.
 The security apparatus has civilian and military elements, both accountable to
 popularly elected authorities. One of the branches of the military, the National
 Guard, has arrest authority and supplies the top leadership for one of the country's
 police forces. The National Guard is also responsible for guarding the exterior of
 prisons, maintaining order during times of civil unrest, and monitoring frontiers. In
 addition, independent police forces are operated by the Ministry of Justice, state
 governments, and many municipalities. Both police and military personnel were re-
 sponsible for human rights abuses.
 The public sector dominates Venezuela's economy, particularly the petroleum in-
 dustry, which accounts for some 22 percent of the gross domestic product. The Gov-
 ernment undertook major economic restructuring to reduce its dependence on oil ex-
 ports, prvatize many public sector firms, and enable domestic business to compete
 mor e lectively in international markets.
 Venezuelans traditionally have enjoyed a wide range of freedoms and individual
 rights, including a free press, active unions, and free elections, but serious human
 rights abuses continued in1993. They included arbitrary and excessively lengthy de-
 tentions, abuse of detainees, extrajudicial killings by the police and military, the
 
 
 568
 failure to punish police and security officers accused of abuses, corruption and gross
 inefficiency in the judicial and law enforcement systems, deplorable prison condi-
 tions, a lack of respect for the rights of indigenous people, and discrimination and
 violence against women. In addition, the courts made no progress in prosecuting
 those responsible for many extrajudicial killings during the two 1992 coup attempts,
 the November 1992 massacre at Reten de Catia prison, or the 1989 urban riots.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrojudicial Killing.-There were no reports of targeted
 political killings, but extrajudicial killings by the security forces continued. The Ven-
 ezuelan Program for Action and Education in Human Rights (PROVEA), one of Ven-
 ezuela's most respected human rights organizations, reported 187 extrajudicial
 killings from October 1992 through September 1993. At least eight of the victims
 were under 15 years of age. According to PROVEA, 66 of the killings were carried
 out by the metropolitan police, 33 by state police, 22 by the Intelligence Police
 (DISIP), 21 by the National Guard, 16 by the Judicial Technical Police (PTJ), 11
 by the armed forces, 8 by municipal police, and 10 by other branches of the security
 apparatus. The perpetrators act with near impunity, as the Government rarely
 brings charg against them. If the perpetrators are prosecuted, sentences issued
 are frequenqty i t, or, more commonly, the convictions are overturned during the
 appeal process. Unlike common prisoners, police charged with crimes rarely spend
 much time in prison.
 In the La Vega borough of Caracas, a group of five hooded men, alleged by wit-
 nesses and family of victims to be local police officers, committed seven killings in
 a 2-week period, four of them in one night. In a sweep through La Vega near mid-
 night on May 16 the men moved from house to house, fatally shot Orlando
 Aliendre, wounded two passersby, and then killed 17-year-old Jorman Saavedra.
 Two witnesses, Douglas Guevara and Jordan Perdomo, were also shot and killed as
 they ran from the scene. Surviving witnesses, although reluctant to speak to au-
 thorities out of fear of reprisals, identified a specific sergeant in the local metropoli-
 tan police as leader of the group and matched the killers' clothing and equipment
 with that of the police. The local police chief reportedly dismissed the allegations
 by simply stating that no one in his unit belonged to such a group. An investigation
 by the Ministry of Justice Police moved slowly and failed to identify any suspects
 by the end of the year.
 Simple interactions with local police often proved fatal. In February in the city
 of Maracaibo an officer of the Zulia State Police allegedly shot 17-year-old evan-
 gelist Juan 6abriel Rincon in broad daylight. According to witnesses, the officer
 stopped the youth on the street and asked to see his identity card. The officer re-
 portedly brandished a loaded hand gun and, in the ensuing conversation, threatened
 to kill Rincon's sister who was accompanying him. Rincon intervened and was fa-
 tally shot. The police officer was jailed, and criminal proceedings were initiated
 against him.
 No one was prosecuted for the 34 extrajudicial killings that occurred during two
 attempted coups in 1992. Investigations of the killings moved slowly, impeded by
 a resistant bureaucracy. Likewise, no one was prosecuted or even held responsible
 for the November 1992 killing of at least 63 prisoners at Reten de Catia prison. The
 National Guard stormed the prison and allegedly fired indiscriminately after having
 heard that coup leaders had distributed arms there (a police investigation noted
 that only one gun and numerous knives were later inventoried). While the Govern-
 ment officially reported 63 prisoners killed at Reten de Catia, human rights groups
 asserted that the fate of 25 additional prisoners remained unknown.
 Although almost 5 years had elapsed, no progress was made on charges of
 extrajudicial killings by security forces during the riots of February and March of
 1989. The Government maintained that 276 people died, while human rights groups
 documented some 400 cases of persons who were killed or disappeared during  e
 disturbances. At least 68 of those killed were buried anonymously in mass graves
 in a Caracas cemetery. Some human rights organizations accused the authorities of
 intentionally disposing of the bodies in unmarked graves to conceal the identity,
 cause and manner of death of the victims and thus protect the perpetrators from
 prosecution. Although the bodies were exhumed in 1991, only three have been posi-
 tively identified. Approximately 300 cases regarding the 1989 killings remained
 under consideration in both military and civilian courts, but only 1 has been adju-
 dicated: a police officer was found guilty in 1991 of homocide and sentenced to 1
 year's imprisonment. The Committee of Family Members of Victims of the Riots
 (COFAVIC) continued to seek a thorough investigation and prosecution of the cases.
 
 
 569
 
 The Government and the courts, however, made no substantial effort to hasten pro-
 ceedings.
 A military court of appeals ruled in March that the 1988 shooting deaths of 14
 fishermen by Venezuelan security forces in the town of El Amparo near the Colom-
 bian border was an excessive use of force, not a deliberate massacre as alleged by
 2 survivors. Fourteen of the police and military officials responsible for the deaths
 were sentenced to 7Y2 years in prison, roughly half of which they had already
 served. Local and international human rights groups and the victims' representa-
 tives expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict, asserting that the court had dis-
 regarded crucial evidence and testimony demonstrating that the event was a delib-
 erate massacre.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances
 in 1993. The press and human rights groups however, reported the unrelated dis-
 appearances of two members of the military. Military authorities claimed both were
 cases of desertion, while family members asserted the soldiers had been killed as
 a result of foul play on the part of the military. One of the disappeared soldiers al-
 legedly had information that his superiors were involved in narcotics trafficking.
 No progress was made towards resolving the cases of military personnel who dis-
 appeared around the time of the November 1992 coup attempt. Likewise, there were
 no prosecutions resulting from the unrelated disappearances in 1992 of Jonathan
 Salazar Rojas or Junior Rafael Barco, both of whom allegedly disappeared while in
 police custody.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture is prohibited by law, but physical abuse of detainees continues. This abuse
 reportedly includes the use of electric shock, beatings, rape, and near suffocation,
 usually during the interrogation of detainees. In its annual report on Venezuela re-
 leased in November, Amnesty International maintained that torture and ill-treat-
 ment are widespread and sometimes resulted in death. Most of the victims come
 from the poorest and least articulate parts of society, but political activists, student
 leaders, and members of grassroots organizations have also reportedly been victims
 of torture and ill-treatment as a result of their activities. PROVEA documented 105
 cases of torture from October 1992 through September 1993. Red de Apoyo por Ia
 Justicia y Ia Paz, another human rights organization, reported 90 incidents of tor-
 ture from March through May alone. All of the major human rights groups asserted,
 however, that these numbers are low because many victims remain silent about
 abuse due to fear of retribution.
 According to PROVEA, 32 of the reported torture incidents were carried out by
 DISIP, 18 by the Technical Judicial Police (PTJ), 17 by the National Guard, 17 by
 the armed forces, 13 by state police, 7 by the metropolitan police, and I by munici-
 pal police. Amnesty International asserts that torture continues in Venezuela, pri-
 manly because the courts failed to investigate complaints of torture properly and
 bring those responsible to justice. In addition, a number of human rights groups re-
 port that the lack of independence of the Institute of Forensic Medicine, which is
 part of the PTJ, prevents forensic doctors from being impartial in their examina-
 tions of cases where torture may have been involved. Very few cases of torture have
 resulted in convictions.
 Prison administration is very poor due to underfunding, poorly trained staff, and
 corruption among prison officials. There are 33 prisons for an inmate population
 that numbered 25,610 in August. Of this number only 9,747 had been sentenced.
 In 1991 the Attorney General's office assigned representatives to the 14 worst pris-
 ons to monitor conditions. The increase in violence and the persistence of deplorable
 living standards in the prisons, however, indicate that these representatives faced
 severe difficulties in improving conditions. Funding for prisons remained extremely
 low.
 Numerous prison riots occurred in 1993 due to poor prison conditions such as ex-
 treme overcrowding, inadequate diet, minimal health care, and physical abuse by
 guards and other prisoners. Weapons and illegal drugs are easily smuggled into
 mostprisons, and violence within the prison system is growing. PROVA reported
 that from October 1992 through September 1993, 195 prisoners were killed and an-
 other 387 wounded by other prisoners (these figures do not include victims of the
 November 1992 Reten de Catia massacre). PROVEA acknowledged, moreover, that
 these figures were onservative, reflecting only incidents covered in the press or re-
 ceived fthand by PROVEA. At least one expert on Venezuela's prisons asserted
 that the total number of violent prison deaths or the year approached 600.
 In June a brutal revolt took place at the Barcelona prison when two grous of
 inmates, armed with pointed sticks and guns, fought each other for control o the
 prison. As a result of the bloody confrontation, 6 inmates were killed and about 20
 wounded. According to the police report, the bodies of the dead were found decapi-
 
 
 570
 tated. On January 3, 1994, a riot in Sabaneta prison in Maracaibo left at least 104
 prisoners dead and another 80 wounded. Sabaneta had come to be known as "the
 prison of death," since throughout 1993 at least 71 prisoners were killed and 100
 wounded in almost daily incidents of violence.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Although the right to judicial determina-
 tion of the legality of detention is provided by law, arrested persons or those under
 investigative detention legally can be held for as Iong as 8 days without a formal
 detention order. During this time detainees may be held incommunicado and, ac-
 cording to human rights groups, are sometimes physically and psychologically
 abused. On the eighth day of detention, a judge, taking the police investigation into
 account, issues a formal arrest order; if no evidence is found, the police release the
 person. Arbitrary arrests and arrests without proper warrants are common, and
 time limits for holding persons are frequently exceeded.
 Prisoners often have to pay fees extorted by prison officials for transportation to
 judicial proceedings at which formal charges are made. Detainees without money to
 pay such unauthorized charges are sometimes unable to get to their judicial hear-
 ings. In addition, the 1939 Vagrancy Law permits the detention for up to 5 years,
 without warrant, trial, or judicial appeal, of people deemed by the police to be a
 danger to society but against whom there is no evidence of a punishable crime. Ac-
 cording to human rights groups, the law is open to arbitrary and discriminatory in-
 terpretation and practices. It was used in the past to detain political dissidents, and
 in November 1992 the head of the Caracas Metropolitan Police threatened to use
 this law against two human rights activists if they persisted in their activities. The
 more common application of the law, however, is against poor people with criminal
 records who are detained during police sweeps. Amnesty International noted that
 detainees under this law, placed in jail merely on the basis of suspicion, are fre-
 quently victims of torture.
 e. Denial of Fair Public 7Tria.-Although the right to a fair trial is provided by
 law and some procedural safeguards exist, the accused bears the burden of proof re-
 garding innocence. Lengthy pretrial detention of 2 to 4 years and case backlogs are
 the norm. The justice system is overburdened, corrupt, and inefficient. The law pro-
 vides public defenders for those unable to afford a defense attorney, but there are
 not enough public defenders in the country to meet this obligation. The Judicial
 Council, the governing body of the judicial branch, stated that there are 150 public
 defense attorneys with an average of 170 active cases each. Because of the unequal
 distribution of cases, some defenders handle as many as 250 cases.
 The judicial process is written, requiring the costly and time-consuming produc-
 tion of voluminous reports by judges, attorneys, and witnesses at every stage. Some
 Venezuelan leaders and legal experts also blame delays and other irregularities on
 corruption and the use of personal influence. The civilian judiciary is legally inde-
 pendent, but connections to the established major political parties are important in
 the judicial selection process, and political parties can and do influence judicial deci-
 sions in particular cases. This overburdened justice system also suffers from a lack
 of public credibility.
 Civilians charged with armed subversion can be tried by military courts as insur-
 gents. There is neither a statute of limitations nor a requirement for a speedy trial
 for cases in military courts, although persons convicted under the military justice
 system have the same right of appeal to the Supreme Court as those prosecuted
 under the civilian system. Military judges are appointed by the Supreme Court. The
 lack of deadlines in the military system, combined with its procedural secrecy and
 tendency to "close ranks," makes it unlikely that defendants undergo an impartial
 or timely prosecution. These factors resulted in military offenders receiving impu-
 nit for extrajudicial killings and other human rights abuses.
 In March the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional the decree which estab-
 lished accelerated military tribunals for persons allegedly connected to the Novem-
 ber 1992 coup attempt. The cases of the 87 individuals (both military and civilian)
 convicted by the special tribunals were placed in regular military courts (where the
 cases remain), while the 109 acquitted were not retried.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Ven-
 ezuela has constitutional safeg ards protecting citizens against arbitrary inter-
 ference with privacy, family, home, and correspondence. in general, these safe-
 guards are effective and were respected in 1993. After the 1992 coup attempts, how-
 ever, the following constitutional safeguards were briefly suspended: freedom of
 travel, freedom of speech, the right to strike, personal security and liberty, invio-
 lability of one's home, the right to assembly, and the right to demonstrate. In recent
 years, there were many complaints of telephone surveillance, although there were
 few reported cases in 1993. Both private individuals and the security forces have
 been accused of illegal wiretapping.
 
 
 571
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Venezuela has a free and lively press, which
 frequently criticizes the Government and denounces instances of government inter-
 ference in the media. The Constitution provides for freedom of the press and free
 speech, and in 1993, these liberties, along with academic freedom, were widely hon-
 ored, although some restrictions exist.
 Particularly in the months prior to the suspension from office of President Carlos
 Andres Perez, the Government met regularly with media owners to discuss issues
 considered sensitive, resulting in some self-censorship. Journalists claimed that the
 Government indirectly practiced censorship throughout the year by denying report-
 ers access to many government buildings and officials. Journalists and local human
 rights groups also asserted that security forces specifically targeted and used exces-
 sive force against reporters covering public demonstrations.
 In April the Government suspended two satirical television programs for allegedly
 broadcasting scenes with 'explicit sexual connotations" in a time frame when that
 type of programming is not allowed. Most in the media argued, however, that the
 suspension was aimed more at the political satire and parodies of government ineffi-
 ciency featured in these programs. A week after the suspension, the Supreme Court
 overturned the Government's action, and the programs returned to the air. Bombs
 damaged the homes of two journalists known for being highly critical of the Govern-
 ment, one of whom received a series of telephone threats. Subsequent police inves-
 tigations failed to identify those responsible for the bombings. In June the Govern-
 ment banned for alleged security reasons the broadcast of an interview by a popular
 journalist with former coup plotter Hugo Chavez.
 The media continued to criticize the Government for abuse and restrictions that
 occurred in reaction to the two 1992 coup attempts. In the aftermath of the Feb-
 ruary 1992 attempt, the Government temporarily imposed censorship, seized some
 publications, screened articles, and briefly impeded the distribution of newspapers.
 During the November 1992 attempt, the Government temporarily closed a radio sta-
 tion which it charged had broadcast messages of support for the coup forces. Two
 journalists were allegedly killed by security forces and others reportedly beaten
 while covering the coup attempts and related civil unrest. Investigations and court
 cases regarding the abuse of journalists moved slowly. In February a group of jour-
 nalists formed the Committee of Human Rights of the National Association of Jour-
 nalists to monitor the investigations and court cases and promote respect for human
 rights and the freedom of information.
 Venezuela has 4 nationwide television networks (2 of which are government
 owned, although only 1 was functioning), 2 cable companies, 9 regional television
 stations, over 300 radio stations, and numerous newspapers and magazines, with
 12 dailies in Caracas alone. The Government is a significant source of advertising
 revenue for the media, but there appear to be no recent instances in which govern-
 ment advertising was channeled for political ends.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The constitutional provision
 for freedom of peaceful assembly and association is normally respected in Ven-
 ezuela; however, this provision was suspended after the February 1992 coup at-
 tempt although it was restored the following April. Public meetings, including those
 of all political parties, are held generally without interference, but demonstrations
 often attract police intervention. Professional and academic associations operate
 without interference. Permits are required for public marches but are not denied for
 political reasons.
 PROVEA reported 1,047 peaceful demonstrations from October 1992 through Sep-
 tember 1993. Of these, 157 were reportedly either stopped or repressed by security
 forces. During these demonstrations, about 720 people were detained, 308 wounded,
 and 5 killed. All of these casualties were attributed to government security forces.
 In January security forces in Caracas were criticized for throwing tear gas canisters
 into a school bus full of children caught in a university student demonstration.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The population is predominantly Rom .n Catholic, al-
 though other religious groups enjoy freedom of worship and proselytize actively. For-
 eign missionaries, both Catholic and Protestant, are active throughout the country.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--Citizens and legal residents are free to travel within the country and
 to go abroad and return. Venezuela traditionally has been a haven for refugees, ex-
 iles, and displaced persons from many European, Caribbean, and Latin American
 countries. They are given normal residence status and may be expelled only because
 of criminal activities.
 
 
 572
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Venezuela is a multiparty democracy with a government freely elected by secret
 ballot. Suffrage is mandatory for all those 18 years of age or older, and the political
 process is open to all. Elections for President and the Congress were held success-
 fully on December 5. For the first time, half of the members of the House of Depu-
 ties were elected by name, based upon the provisions of an electoral reform law ap-
 proved in 1989; the rest were elected proportionately from party slates. Elections
 for the President, Congress, and state legislative assemblies are held every 5 years.
 Charges of irregulanties and fraud as well as delays in proclaiming the winners
 marred the 1992 state and local elections and the 1993 national elections. The Su-
 preme Court ordered new gubernatorial elections in two states (these elections took
 place in May); however, Supreme Court decisions are still pending in the cases of
 4 other state gubernatorial contests. In addition, individuals and political parties
 have alleged voting irregularities in several congressional contests in the 1993 elec-
 tions which may result in ballot recounts or new elections in some districts. The
 domination of the electoral institutions by the traditional political parties and the
 absence of automated vote counting machines have undermined public confidence in
 the fairness and transparency of the election process.
 In May President Carlos Andres Perez was removed from office through constitu-
 tional means due to allegations of corruption, the first time an incumbent President
 had been so removed in modern Venezuelan history. Congress named Ramon J.
 Velasquez as President until the February 1994 inauguration of the new President.
 Political views are freely expressed, and persons from the entire political spectrum
 contend for positions ranging from municipal council seats to the presidency. The
 two largest parties are centrist: the Democratic Action (AD) and the Social Christian
 (COPED parties. Although AD and COPEI remain the two largest political parties,
 the results of the December elections represented a major defeat for the traditional
 parties (which lost considerable ground in the national Congress). The principal vic-
 tors in the 1993 elections were the political alliance supporting President Caldera
 (Convergencia/MAS) and the working class-oriented CAUSA R Party. Due to the
 number of presidential candidates and the nature of the voting system, President
 Caldera was able to win with only about 31 percent of the vote.
 Women and minorities participate fully in government and politics, albeit not in
 preportion to their representation in society. There are no legal impediments to
 their free participation, but traditional attitudes produce some de facto impedi-
 ments. Women and minorities are promoted into high-level positions at a slower
 rate than nonminority men. Indigenous people have traditionally not been fully inte-
 grated into the political system owing to lack of knowledge of how it works, low
 voter turnout, and residency in areas far from the capital and other cities. Indian
 rights advocates have noted that few indigenous people work in government agen-
 cies responsible for Indian affairs.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A number of local human rights groups are active throughout the country and vig-
 orously criticize perceived government inadequacies in redressing grievances. The
 groups operate free of government restriction and interference, although some have
 complained of police harassment in the past. Two regional groups-the Latin Amer-
 ican Foundation for Human Rights and Social Development and the Federation of
 Families of Disappeared Persons-have offices in Caracas and likewise operate free
 of government intervention.
 International human rights groups also act free of government restriction and
 have openly conducted investigations in Venezuela. Late in the year, both Amnesty
 International and Americas Watch released comprehensive reports on Venezuelas
 human rights problems. The reports received extensive coverage in the local press,
 although the Government appears to have largely ignored the findings.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender, and
 the Civil Code was reformed in the 1980's to make women and men legally equal
 in marriage. Women comprise roughly half the student body of most universities,
 have advanced in many professions, including medicine and law, and have gradually
 torn down many of the barriers that previously prevented them from fully partici-
 pating in political and economic life. Women's rights groups are active in Caracas
 and throughout the country. Women, nonetheless, are still underrepresented in po-
 litical positions and in the top ranks of the labor unions and private industry.
 
 
 573
 Many Venezuelan women also face socially ingrained discrimination that prevents
 them from receiving fair treatment in the workplace and under the law. The Labor
 Code specifies that women may not be discriminated against with regard to remu-
 neration or working conditions, may not be fired during pregnancy and for a year
 after giving birth, are entitled to unpaid leave (and compensation from the social
 security agency) for 6 weeks before the birth of a child and 12 weeks after, and are
 due 10 weeks of unpaid leave if they legally adopt children under 3 years of age.
 According to the Ministry of Labor and the major labor federation, these regulations
 are enforced in the formal sector, though social security payments are normally de-
 layed.
 There is a high level of violence directed against some Venezuelan women. Wom-
 en's groups point out the rape is extremely difficult to prove requiring at a mini-
 mum a medical examination within 48 hours of the violation. Few police officers are
 trained in how to deal responsibly with rape victims. Likewise, although there are
 laws that protect women against domestic violence, the police generally are unwill-
 ing to intervene to prevent abuse. The 40 percent of women who fall below the offi-
 cial poverty line often have no choice but to stay with abusive spouses for economic
 reasons. Although Venezuela theoretically has an elaborate web of social programs,
 few poor women and families receive more than nominal assistance. In addition,
 poor women are generally unaware of and have little access to legal protections
 available to them.
 Children.-Many Venezuelan children face extreme hardship. The Government
 scaled back its expenditure on education, health, and social services, leaving many
 impoverished children with no government assistance. The Central Office of Statis-
 tics and Information (OCEI) reported that 72 percent of children remain in school
 past the sixth grade and 49 percent past the ninth grade. According to a 1993 study
 sponsored by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), about 206,000 children
 under the age of 18 loiter in the streets and another 176,000 beg for money.
 While Venezuelan law provides for universal free education, children's rights
 groups assert that the Government dedicates insufficient funding to primary and
 secondary education. About 50 percent of an already tight education budget report-
 edly goes to universities, 45 percent to pay the salaries of education staff and ad-
 ministrators, and only 5 percent to primary and secondary school students and the
 maintenance of their schools. Government agencies responsible for the welfare of
 children are understaffed, and many reform institutions for young delinquents are
 in deplorable condition.
 According to children's rights groups, the recent increase in poverty has increased
 stress on families and led to a rise in abuse against children by parents or others.
 Neighbors are often hesitant to report cases of child abuse however, due to a fear
 of becoming involved with authorities and ingrained attitudes regarding family pri-
 vacy. Special procedures in the judicial system generally assure that children are
 removed from abusive households once a case has been reported.
 Indigenous People.-The Constitution provides for special laws governing "the pro-
 tection of indigenous communities and their progressive incorporation into the life
 of the nation." Nonetheless, indigenous people are not able to protect their civil and
 political rights or to influence decisions afecting their lands, cultures, traditions,
 and the allocation of natural resources. While there are a few indigenous congress-
 men who are members of tho dominant political parties, indigenous people are
 underrepresented in Government. Indigenous groups were not successful in obtain-
 ing legislation they sought to preserve ancestral lands and cultures or to enact pro-
 portional representation to provide more ethnic minorities in the country's legisla-
 tive bodies.
 Although Venezuelan law prohibits discrimination based on ethnic origin, mem-
 bers of the country's indigenous population frequently suffer from inattention to and
 violation of their human rights. Venezuela is home to about 315,000 indigenous peo-
 ple in 25 ethnic groups, according a special census conducted in 1992. The Wayuu
 ethnic group, which makes up well over half of the indigenous population, resides
 in the western part of the country on the banks of Lake Maracaibo and the Gulf
 of Venezuela. Other groups populate the dense jungle of the Orinoco and Amazon
 river basins and the mars a ong the Caribbean coast.
 In August at least 16 Yanomami Indians were killed by illegal Brazilian gold min-
 ers who crossed the border into southern Venezuela. The massacre resulted from a
 feud related to the miners' persistent incursions into Yanomami-protected territory.
 The press and human rights groups strongly criticized the Government for its ne-
 glect to protect the Yanomamis, as authorities had been repeatedly informed of the
 miners' incursions and the potential for conflict.
 Many of the country's indigenous people live isolated from modern civilization and
 lack access to basic health and educational facilities theoretically available to all
 
 
 Venezuelans. Their communities are plagued by high rates of cholera, hepatitis-B,
 malaria, and other diseases. Tourists and other outsiders inadvertently introduce
 new viruses to Indian populations with unprepared immune systems: The common
 cold often becomes bronchitis, and chicken pox can be fatal. In addition, few indige-
 nous communities hold titles to their lands, and many have been displaced in recent
 years by government-sponsored projects. Rivers have been polluted by fertilizer and
 machinery, and habitats plowed down for strip-mining and large-scale farming.
 The Yabarana tribe, one of the smallest indigenous groups with only 237 mem-
 bers, is in danger of extinction. Government- condoned ranching in Yabarana terri-
 tory turned many of the fields of corn and yucca that members use for subsistence
 into grazing ground for cattle. The Yabarana petitioned the courts and government
 aencies but were not successful in having the cattle removed. The plight of the
 abarana is paralleled by numerous ethnic communities throughout the country
 who face hardship and even extinction due to encroaching development.
 People with Disabilities.-Rights for the disabled are very limited. According to
 local advocates, the disabled are discriminated against in many sectors, including
 education, health care, and employment. Disabled people report having been ex-
 pelled from public university programs and turned away at hospitals, even for the
 treatment of afflictions unrelated to their disability. The physically impaired have
 minimal access to public transportation, and ramps are practically nonexistent even
 in   vernment buildings.
 In 1993 the Government passed the first comprehensive law to protect the rights
 of the disabled. The new law requires that all newly constructed or renovated public
 parks and buildings provide access for the disabled. Among other important provi-
 sions, the law forbids discrimination in employment practices and in the provision
 of public services. The Government did not make a significant effort to inform the
 public of the new law or to try to change the societal prejudice against the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Both the Constitution and labor law recognize and
 encourage the right of unions to exist. The comprehensive 1990 Labor Code extends
 to all public sector and private sector employees (except members of the armed
 forces) the right to form and join unions of their choosing. The Code mandates reg-
 istration  of unions   with  the   Ministry  of  Labor, but    it  reduces  the
 Ministry'sdiscretion by specifying that registration may not be denied if the proper
 documents (a record of the founding meeting, the statutes, and the membership list)
 are submitted. Only a judge may dissolve a union, and then only for reasons listed
 in the law, such as the dissolution of a firm or by agreement of two-thirds of the
 membership.
 One major union confederation, the Venezuelan Confederation of Workers (CTV),
 and three small ones, as well as a number of independent unions, operate freely.
 About 25 percent of the national labor force is unionized. There are no restrictions
 on affiliation with international labor organizations, and many union organizations
 play active international roles. The CTVs top leadership includes members of sev-
 eral political arties. The majority are affiliated with the counts larget arty, the
 AD. The CTV and the AD party reciprocally influence each other. The CTV, how-
 ever, repeatedly demonstrated its independence from the Government (in which the
 AD held the presidency and a plurality of the seats in the Congress) and from the
 AD party (as evidenced by its frequent criticism of the Government's economic poli-
 cies).
 The right of public and private sector employees to strike is recognized legally but
 may only be exercised by public servants if it does not cause "irremediable damage
 to the population or to institutions." The Labor Code allows the President to order
 public or private sector strikers back to work and to submit their dispute to arbitra-
 tion if the strike "puts in immediate danger the lives or security of all or part of
 the population."ln recent years workers seldom resorted to strikes, but a perceived
 decline in living standards increased the willingness of workers to consider them se-
 riously. During 1993 most strikes occurred among government employees. With the
 exception of a prolonged strike by public schoolteachers, which was settled through
 Labor Ministry mediation, the threat to strike was sufficient in most cases to
 achieve a resolution satisfactory to the workers.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is pro-
 tected and encouraged by the Labor Code and is freely practiced. According to the
 Code, employers "must negotiate" a collective contract with the union that rep-
 resents the majority of their workers. The Code also contains a provision stating
 that wages may be raised by administrative decree, provided that the Congress ap-
 proves the decree.
 
 
 575
 The law prohibits employers from interfering with the formation of unions or with
 their activities and from stipulating as a condition of employment that new workers
 must abstain from union activity or must join a specified union. Complaints regard-
 ing violations of these articles of the law are heard by Ministry of Labor inspectors,
 who can impose a maximum fine of twice the minimum monthly wage for a first
 infraction. Under the Code, union officials have special protection from firing. If a
 judge determines that any worker was fired for union activity, the worker is entitled
 to back pay plus either reinstatement or payment of a substantial sum of money,
 which varies according to his years of seniority.
 Labor law and practice is the same in the sole export processing zone as in the
 rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-There is no forced or compulsory
 labor. The Labor Code states that no one may "obligate others to work against their
 will."
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code allows children
 between the ages of 12 and 14 to work if given special permission by the National
 Institute for Minors or the Labor Ministry. Children between the ages of 14 and 16
 may work if given permission by their legal guardians. Minors may not work in
 mines, smelters, or in occupations "that risk life or health," in occupations that
 could damage intellectual or moral development, or in "public spectacles."
 Those under 16 years of age must by law work no more than 6 hours a day or
 30 hours a week. Minors under age 18 may work only during the hours between
 6 a.m. and 7 p.m. The law is enforced effectively by the Ministry of Labor and the
 National Institute for Minors in the formal sector of the economy, but much less
 so in the informal sector which by the end of 1990 (latest available figures) ac-
 counted for 41 percent of total employment. According to a UNICEF study, some
 1 million children work in the informal sector, mostly as street vendors; there is no
 other occupation in which employment of children is believed to be substantial.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Venezuela has a national urban minimum
 wage rate and a national rural minimum wage rate. The monthly minimum wage,
 effective February 1992, was $95 (9,000 bolivars) for urban workers and $63 (6,000
 bolivars) for rural workers. Mandatory fringe benefits are added to these minimum
 figures; they vary with the workers' individual circumstances, but in general in-
 crease wages by about one-third. In the past, this combined income provided a living
 wage. However, in 1993 unions, arguing that purchasing power declined signifi-
 cantly over the last several years, ca led for an increase of up to 50 percent in the
 minimum wage. Only domestic workers and concierges are legally excluded from
 coverage under the minimum wage decrees. Under the Labor Code, the rates are
 set by administrative decree, which Congress may either suspend or ratify but may
 not change. Minimum wages are enforced effectively in the formal sector of the
 economy by the Ministry of Labor, but compliance is generally not enforced in the
 informal sector.
 The 1990 Labor Code reduced the standard workweek to a maximum of 44 hours,
 and requires "two complete days of rest each week." Some unions, such as the petro-
 leum workers, have negotiated a 40-hour week. Overtime may not exceed 2 hours
 daily, 10 hours weekly, or 100 hours annually, and may not be paid at a rate less
 than time and a half. These standards are effectively enforced by the Ministry of
 Labor in the formal sector.
 The 1986 health and safety law still awaits implementing regulations and is not
 enforced. The delays are due largely to concern that the law provides penal sanc-
 tions against management when violations of health and safety occur and ambiguity
 in the law over what constitutes a violation. The Labor Code states that employers
 are obligated to pay specified amounts (up to a maximum of 25 times the minimum
 monthly salary) to workers for accidents or occupational illnesses, regardless of who
 is responsible for the injury. It also requires that workplaces must maintain "suffi-
 cient protection for health and life against sicknesses and accidents," and it imposes
 fines of from one-quarter to twice the minimum monthly salary for first infractions.
 Enforcement of the law by inspectors from the Ministry of Labor appears to be effec-
 tive. Workers can remove themselves from dangerous workplace situations without
 jeopardy to continued employment.
