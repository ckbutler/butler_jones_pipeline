 MADAGASCAR
 Madagascar is governed by a President and National Popular
 Assembly, both elected by direct universal suffrage, and a
 Supreme Revolutionary Council chosen by both the President and
 the National Assembly. President Didier Ratsiraka has broad
 constitutional powers, and his position is further
 strengthened by the influential role played by his political
 party, AREMA, which holds an overwhelming majority in the
 National Popular Assembly. The President's role has evolved
 in recent years into that of a power broker among various
 competing interests. Elections are actively contested within
 the controlled political framework sanctioned by the
 Government. This framework permits political activity by only
 the seven parties making up the National Front for the Defense
 of the Revolution, but whose political orientation ranges from
 moderate and pro-Western to pro-Soviet. Vigorous debate in
 1984-85 National Popular Assembly sessions and negative votes
 by opposition parties indicate that the Assembly is becoming
 less of a "rubber stamp" organization. The President chairs
 the Supreme Revolutionary Council which is composed of
 political and regional leaders and representatives of the
 military forces. The Council approves basic policy
 guidelines, convenes and adjourns the National Assembly, and
 passes laws when the Assembly is not sitting.
 The Malagasy internal security system is composed of the urban
 police force and the National Gendarmerie, which has
 jurisdiction in the provinces. On occasion, the National
 Peoples' Army has also been used for internal security
 purposes.
 The Malagasy Constitution adopted in 1975 made "Socialism" the
 State's political philosophy. This led to the nationalization
 of a major portion of the economy. The private sector was
 reduced to a secondary, albeit still important, role. The
 economy subsequently deteriorated as production declined,
 foreign debt rose, and unemployment grew. However, in the
 past few years the Government has adopted economic reform
 measures, and agricultural production has stopped declining.
 Nevertheless, there is still widespread unemployment, and
 markets for export commodities are weak.
 Fundamental liberties and individual rights are guaranteed by
 the Malagasy Constitution. However, several of these rights,
 such as freedom of the press and freedom of assembly, are
 restricted in practice. Rights normally considered
 inalienable, such as the inviolability of the home and the
 right to due process, may also be disregarded in cases
 involving state security.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From:
 a. Political Killing
 There has been one political assassination in Madagascar's
 25-year history. There have been, however, periodic outbreaks
 of political disturbances resulting in loss of life. In
 December 1984, street fights between "Kung Fu" martial arts
 enthusiasts and government-sponsored youth groups escalated
 into a downtown riot that left some 50 dead. When the
 
 
 189
 MADAGASCAR
 victorious Kung Fu groups then began to play a vigilante role
 in Antananarivo's poorer districts and began to represent a
 threat to the State, the Government responded in August by
 attacking Kung Fu headquarters. Some Kung Fu were shot on
 sight. The official casualty count was 20 dead, 31 wounded,
 and 208 arrested, but there were credible reports that
 approximately 50 people were killed and 300 arrested.
 Casualties were reportedly buried in mass graves without being
 returned to families for traditional funeral ceremonies.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance in Madagascar in 1985.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There were credible reports that the armed forces used torture
 in their campaign against outlaw bandits in Madagascar's
 southwest. There were also allegations that the security
 forces engaged in acts of brutality and torture. Prison
 conditions are reportedly poor; inadequate sanitation, poor
 health care, and unbalanced diet continue to be problems.
 However, there is no evidence of systematic or widespread
 mistreatment of prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There is no concept of habeas corpus in theMalagasy legal
 system. In criminal cases, the accused must be charged within
 three days or be released. However, persons suspected of
 activity against the State may be legally detained
 incommunicado for 15 days, subject to indefinite extension if
 considered necessary by the Government.
 Defendants are generally formally charged within the specified
 time frame and, upon being charged, are entitled to the
 assistance of counsel. Counsel is readily available, and in
 cases of indigence, court-appointed counsel is provided.
 Arbitrary arrest or detention generally occurs, however, in
 cases which involve an alleged threat to the State, such as
 during the August attack against the Kung Fu. Minors who were
 arrested at that time have been released, but 34 adults who
 were arrested are still being detained incommunicado without
 formal charges having been filed or a trial date set. Such
 extended periods of pretrial detention are the exception, not
 the rule, and are usually limited to cases involving state
 security.
 Forced labor is not practiced in Madagascar.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Under the Malagasy Constitution and in practice, the judiciary
 operates independently of the executive and legislative
 branches of government. Defendants are normally afforded due
 process. Trials, including those for individuals charged with
 crimes against the State, have been open, and decisions judged
 to be impartial.
 
 
 190
 MADAGASCAR
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The State does not intervene in the nonpolitical aspects of
 the lives of the people. The home is inviolable under
 Malagasy law. Intrusions into an individual's residence are
 permissible only under the authority of a warrant. However,
 at the time of the attack on the Kung Fu in August the
 military entered and ransacked homes without court orders.
 Although government economic policies limit the choices open
 to an individual, the Malagasy may make their own decisions,
 without government coercion or interference, in such matters
 as changing jobs or residence, marriage, having children, or
 joining political parties or social organizations.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 All publications are subject to censorship administered by the
 Ministry of Interior. The Government provides guidelines on
 prohibited topics, but the guidelines are not always explicit
 nor are they rigorously enforced. When censorship is
 enforced, the newspapers leave blank those columns where the
 offending materials would have appeared. One example of
 government censorship was the severely restricted press
 coverage of its August attack on the Kung Fu. In general,
 private citizens are free to criticize government officials
 and policies without fear of arrest by the local authorities,
 but direct criticism of the President or the "Socialist
 revolution" is not tolerated. Government control of the media
 is further strengthened by state ownership of the radio,
 television stations, and a news bulletin. There are also,
 however, two independently owned French-language papers.
 Several dailies and weeklies are also put out by party groups,
 and independent publications are available in Malagasy.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right of assembly and association is restricted in
 Madagascar. Permits are required to hold public meetings and
 can be denied by the Government if officials believe that the
 meeting poses a threat to the State or endangers national
 unity. Persons and groups belonging to the parties in the
 National Front are permitted to organize and assemble. Two of
 these parties held national conventions in the capital city in
 1984 and in speeches and resolutions roundly criticized the
 Government. There were no major political meetings in 1985.
 Since political activity by groups outside the National Front
 is prohibited, dissenting political opinion is limited.
 Malagasy are free to establish nonpolitical private
 associations.
 Although the right to organize labor unions is recognized,
 unions do not play a major role either politically or
 economically. The labor force of 4.5 million is mostly
 agrarian, and union labor accounts for less than 5 percent of
 the total. Unions are permitted to strike and conduct
 substantive wage negotiations, but because of the depressed
 economy, strikes have been few and trade unions relatively
 quiescent. Most unions are affiliated with the National Front
 parties.

 MADAGASCAR
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Government of Madagascar is secular, and there is no
 official religion. There is no discrimination on the basis of
 religious affiliation, and individuals are free to follow the
 faith of their choice. Missionaries and clergy are generally
 permitted to operate freely, and the Government has so far
 made no effort to restrain Christian churches which have
 become more active in criticizing government policies.
 However, churches not already established in Madagascar must
 obtain legal recognition from the Government, a process which
 can be difficult. Over half of the population is either
 Catholic or Protestant, with the remainder following
 traditional Malagasy religious beliefs or other faiths.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government has imposed no restrictions upon travel within
 the country. Official approval must be obtained for trips
 outside the country, but exit visas are obtained without
 difficulty. Travel abroad is impeded by the difficulty in
 obtaining foreign currency since the Malagasy franc is not
 convertible abroad, and the Government limits the amount of
 hard currency that can be obtained for foreign travel. There
 is no refugee population in Madagascar.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The electorate's choice is constrained by the nature of the
 political system, since the only political parties allowed to
 operate in Madagascar are those which are members of the
 National Front. However, there exists a range of ideological
 and policy views among the Front parties, and within this
 spectrum there are viewpoints represented that are at odds
 with the policies of the Government. Thus, the electoral
 process does give the voters a chance to choose among
 candidates expressing differing views in local and regional
 elections and in the National Assembly and presidential
 campaigns. The electoral process, although not completely
 free from irregularities, has been essentially straightforward
 in recent elections, and elections are actively contested.
 The political system in Madagascar also reflects a
 considerable degree of regional balance. There are no special
 conditions of nationality or citizenship which exclude any
 elements in society from participating in the existing
 political process.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has not cooperated with groups wishing to
 investigate alleged human rights violations and, in fact,
 denied visas-to such groups as Amnesty International. There
 are no official representatives of human rights organizations
 in Madagascar. In the absence of private human rights groups,
 the Christian churches in the country have taken the lead in
 advocating respect for human rights. Although the Government
 is sensitive to criticism emanating from this quarter, it has
 not officially responded to questions or criticisms from the
 churches or any other groups. When the President's opponent
 in the 1982 election campaign called for supervision of the
 
 
 192
 MADAGASCAR
 elections by Amnesty International, the President rejected
 this proposal as a derogation of national sovereignty.
 Amnesty International did not include a section on Madagascar
 in its 1985 Report due to insufficient information.  Freedom
 House rated Madagascar "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Madagascar is an island country more than twice the size of
 Great Britain. Some 9.5 million people inhabit its 592,000
 square kilometers of territory, approximately 16 persons per
 square kilometer. The annual population growth rate is 2.8
 percent. Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the
 world with a per capita gross domestic product of $310 (1983
 figure).
 Agriculture is the most important sector in the economy,
 accounting for almost 90 percent of employment and
 approximately 85 percent of export earnings. Under government
 controls, agricultural production declined in the late 1970's,
 and the Government had to import large quantities of rice, the
 staple of the Malagasy diet. Much of the agricultural problem
 is attributable to government marketing policies which
 subsidize consumer costs and control producer prices.
 Madagascar's external public debt reached over $1.6 billion in
 1984. Recent liberalizations in the marketing system,
 however, are beginning to show results: agricultural
 production increased slightly in 1984 and the long decline in
 economic activity has stopped. Inflation has been kept below
 15 percent. To attract foreign investment, the Government
 recently adopted a new investment code.
 Life expectancy at birth is 50 years and infant mortality is
 101 per 1,000 live births. Health care delivery systems are
 plagued by shortages of medical personnel, inadequate
 facilities, and limited supplies of antibiotics and other
 medicines. Malaria remains a continuing problem, especially
 in coastal areas, and the population is quite vulnerable to
 outbreaks of disease following natural disasters such as
 flooding. Although 1977 statistics show that individual
 levels of caloric intake were at 110 percent of requirements,
 recent U.N. surveys indicate significant malnutrition in
 highly populated areas of the plateau and coast. This is the
 result of poor dietary habits and erratic distribution of
 foodstuffs. Further, only one-fifth of the population had
 access to safe drinking water (1980 statistic).
 The official literacy rate in Antananarivo is 70 percent.
 However, overall literacy is somewhere around 55 percent.
 Primary school enrollment ratio was 90 percent for females and
 98 percent for males (1980 figures). Recent dramatic
 increases in enrollment have resulted in overburdened school
 facilities, shortages of qualified teachers, and extremely
 high student-teacher ratios in the public school system and
 at the secondary and university levels.
 Under the Malagasy work code the minimum age for employment is
 14, but the employment of anyone under the age of 18 is
 prohibited in those areas where there is apparent and imminent
 danger. There is a 40-hour work week in nonagricultural and
 service industries. There are also provisions for holiday
 pay, sick and maternity leave, and insurance. By government
 decree monthly minimum wages have been established for
 unskilled workers in both the agricultural and nonagricultural
 
 
 193
 MADAGASCAR
 sectors. The work code has rules concerning occupational
 safety and health as well as sanitation standards. In
 practice, the rules and regulations of the code are apparently
 adhered to by employers and are enforced by the authorities.
 Madagascar has what is essentially a matriarchal society, and
 a highly visible role for women has been a long recognized and
 integral part of the country's sociological framework. There
 are no restrictions concerning activities in which women may
 engage. Women have a lengthy tradition of involvement in high
 level political activity, and currently there are women
 members of the Cabinet, Supreme Revolutionary Council, and the
 National Assembly. Women are also active and play major roles
 in the various political parties. Women have prominent
 positions in the business and economic life of the country,
 with many of them managing or owning business concerns or
 filling management positions in state industries. Education
 at all levels is open to women. However, women in rural areas
 and among the poor face a greater degree of hardship. In
 .addition to the responsibilities associated with child rearing
 and household-management, economic necessity forces these
 women to engage in long hours of farm labor or other similar
 activities. These conditions stem more from socioeconomic
 factors than from any discrimination against women in Malagasy
 society.
 Although there are numerous indigenous ethnic groups in
 Madagascar, the society is relatively homogenous due to a
 common language and a tendency for what were perhaps once
 disparate cultures to draw together in an island environment.
 Nonetheless, prejudicial attitudes and rivalry among
 Madagascar's various ethnic groups still exist on a community
 level.. Ethnic Indian, Chinese, and French communities have
 experienced some resentment from the Malagasy mainly because
 of their success in commerce. Ethnic Comorans have also in
 past years been the object of discrimination and physical
 attack. These groups have occasionally been the target of
 local government policies favoring Malagasy nationals.
