 CAMEROON
 Cameroon has an authoritarian, one-party government, headed
 by a president who is elected after being chosen by top party
 officials. The former Federation of East and West Cameroon
 was made a United Republic under the 1972 Constitution.
 President Ahmadou Ahidjo, who had led the nation since
 independence, resigned November 6, 1982, and Prime Minister
 Paul Biya succeeded him in accordance with the Constitution.
 All candidates for president, the national assembly, and
 municipal offices are selected from within the single party
 by party officials. (Former President Ahidjo retained his
 position as head of the party after resigning the presidency).
 The names, one for each available post, are then submitted
 to the general population for approval or rejection.
 Presidential and municipal elections are held every five
 years. Regional governors, prefects, and subprefects are
 named by the president. The expanding economy, based on
 agriculture and boosted by significant petroleum revenues,
 has been well-managed and has attracted growing foreign
 investment. Cameroon is thus one of the few countries in
 Africa during the current recession that has not had to cut
 back on ,programs for development and improvement of the
 economic and social condition of the people.
 During the 1960's the Government suppressed an ethnically
 based, Marxist guerilla challenge. In recent years, as the
 threat of internal subversion has receded, political detai-
 nees have been released, including eight Jehovah's Witnesses
 in 1982. Nevertheless, decision-making in Cameroon remains
 highly centralized, and civil and political liberties are
 circumscribed. In mid-1982, during preparations for the
 tenth anniversary celebrations of the formation of the
 United Republic, additional restrictions were initiated
 temporarily as a result of stepped-up security operations.
 It is still early to predict human rights trends under the
 new Government, but all indications are that President Biya
 intends to follow closely the policies of his predecessor.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There are no reports of political killings either by the
 Government or terrorist groups during 1982.
 b. Disappearance
 Persons arrested for reasons of national security, as
 described below in subsection e, are not processed accord-
 ing to normal civil procedures. Amnesty International
 claims that at least four such prisoners have been held
 for many years. No such detention is known to have resulted
 in "permanent disappearance" or death. Several foreign
 governments and international human rights agencies have
 made inquiries to the Government about the welfare and
 whereabouts of alleged political prisoners, with mixed
 results.
 c. Torture
 Torture is proscribed implicitly in the Constitution and
 specifically in criminal procedures, which makes evidence
 obtained by torture inadmissible. Nevertheless, there
 
 
 46
 are credible reports of harsh treatment, including beatings,
 during police interrogation and imprisonment. In previous
 years, some police officers have been charged and found
 guilty of practicing torture.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Cameroon penal code prohibits public servants from using
 force against any person except under extraordinary circum-
 stances, e.g., resisting arrest. Government officials claim
 this prohibition is strictly enforced and cite several
 examples of prison sentences given policemen who physically
 abused others. Immediately prior to the tenth anniversary
 celebrations, in May 1982 police were granted extra power to
 ensure security. Police commissioners were given wide
 authority to decide upon and mete out physical punishment.
 Amnesty International has reported allegations of harsh
 prison conditions and ill treatment of detainees, and
 there are reports of unnecessary use of force by the po-
 lice, ranging in severity from bullying to brutality.
 Several such incidents were witnessed by credible sources
 during the past year. The Cameroonian Government acknow-
 ledges that prison conditions are crowded and inadequate; it
 attributes this to a lack of resources, rather than deli-
 berate neglect. The diet and health care offered at the
 prisons is inadequate. Since the daily food budget for
 each prisoner is less than 20 cents, most prisoners supple-
 ment their diet with food brought by family or friends
 during visiting hours. Prisoners are treated equally
 regardless of class, race, religion, or sex. There are
 no summary executions in Cameroon.
 Persons under "administrative detention" (i.e., political
 prisoners) are kept in special camps or prisons.   Access
 to the "administrative detention" centers by families and
 friends is reported to be severely restricted.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Under Cameroonian law a person arrested on suspicion of
 committing an offense may not be held for more than 48 hours
 without a court order. However, after an investigating
 magistrate has determined that the case should be brought to
 trial and has issued a warrant to this effect, there is no
 limitation on how long the person charged may be held in
 "preventive detention" pending trial. Accused persons
 awaiting trial constitute the great majority of persons in
 the prisons at Yaounde and Douala. Release on bail is
 infrequent. However, certain legal provisions exist which
 have proven effective in seeking legal remedy for persons
 detained illegally.
 During the months leading to the tenth anniversary in May
 1982, there were numerous reports of arrests and abuse as
 security officials were granted additional authority in
 conjunction with their security functions. There is evidence
 that citizens are increasingly being stopped by local police
 who harass or threaten to detain them unless a bribe is
 
 
 47
 paid. These actions do not appear to be initiated or con-
 doned by high government officials, but rather to be at
 the initiative of, individual rank and file officers. For
 the most part those detained are reportedly released within
 24 hours. There is no evidence available of Government
 actions to curb this practice.
 Persons maybe held in "administrative detention" under
 legislation pertaining to subversion. This legislation is
 interpreted with restraint. Such detention by regional
 authorities is initially for one month, renewable twice,
 and may be extended up to an additional six months by the
 Minister of Territorial Administration. During the tenth
 anniversary celebrations, eight Jehovah's Witnesses previously
 held as political prisoners were released; we estimate there
 are less than 15 prisoners in "administrative detention."
 Under a state of emergency, regional authorities also may
 order detention for up to one week of persons judged "dange-
 rous to public security", and the Minister of Territorial
 Administration may order detention of such persons for up to
 two months, the order renewable without limitation. A state
 of emergency is in effect in a limited area of West-Central
 Cameroon where the insurgency in the 1960's took place,
 apparently as a precautionary measure which would permit the
 Government to act swiftly in case of perceived threats to
 public security there.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Cameroon law guarantees criminal defendants a fair public
 trial, including legal representation at state expense if
 necessary. Lawyers have unrestricted private access to
 defendants, and both lawyers and defendants are made fully
 aware of the charges and evidence. Legal representation is
 automatic in cases for which the death penalty or imprison-
 ment for ten years or more may be imposed. In some cases
 involving lesser sentences, legal representation may not be
 available because defendants are not aware oftheir rights
 or because they are unable to afford counsel.
 Courts are independent of executive and military control,
 although civilians may be tried in military courts if they
 are charged with committing a crime jointly with a soldier.
 Due process for military courts is the same as for civilian
 courts. Verdicts of both civil and military courts may be
 appealed to the Appeals Courts at the provincial level and
 to the Supreme Court at the national level. In judicial
 proceedings, the court does not distinguish between those
 accused of ordinary crimes and those accused of political
 offenses.
 A revision of Cameroon's criminal procedure and evidence
 codes is under way with the goal of formulating a unified
 judicial code, thereby ending differences which occur in
 the administration of justice in anglophone and francophone
 parts of the country. This legislation is intended to
 strengthen protection for the accused -- including improve-
 ments in pre-trial, post-trial, and bail procedures.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The Cameroonian penal code prohibits the entry into
 another's residence without permission, unless such entry is
 made pursuant to a court order or under a state of emergency.
 
 
 In practice, indiscriminate and unauthorized entry into
 homes occurs during occasional police sweeps of the poorer
 residential districts in search of criminals. In the two
 months prior to the tenth anniversary, actions of working
 level security officials included the kicking in of doors
 and the seizure of personal property when citizens were
 unable to provide evidence of purchase of items of value.
 There is no credible evidence of violation of privacy of
 telephonic or mailed communication by the Government.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Cameroonian Constitution guarantees freedom of speech
 and press "under conditions fixed by the law." In practice
 there are restrictions on these freedoms. Except for indepen-
 dent weeklies in Douala, Limbe and Bamenda, the Cameroonian
 press and radio are government-owned and controlled. Criti-
 cism of the Government is discouraged, and the media are
 used to support government programs and institutions. All
 media elements are inhibited by occasional intimidation of
 journalists and the possibility of censorship. As a result,
 self-censorship is the rule, particularly with regard to
 political criticism. Opposition viewpoints are seldom ex-
 pressed in the media.
 A June 1981 presidential decree stipulated that all newspapers
 and periodicals must request authorization to publish from the
 Ministry of Territorial Administration. This law gives
 the Government increased discretionary power over the print
 media, and some editions of non-government newspapers have
 been seized for failure to obtain prepublication clearance.
 One newspaper ceased publication after only one issue when
 its editor, who had not obtained prepublication clearance,
 was arrested. Other journalists who have not exercised
 restraint have been banished to provincial assignments or
 lower level government jobs. Foreign magazines have occasion-
 ally been seized by the Government when articles have
 touched on areas considered to be sensitive. The media have,
 however, criticized inefficiency, unresponsiveness and
 corruption by the party, the university and other public and
 private institutions. Media criticism is directed exclusively
 at policy implementation; basic policy or actions of the
 Government are not criticized.
 Professors and students at the university are strongly
 discouraged from writing or publishing works critical of
 the Cameroonian Government and its policies, and professors
 must submit the text of their lectures prior to delivery.
 However, a wide range of research which is not blatantly
 oppositionist is encouraged. The work of certain authors
 critical of the Government may not be imported or read in
 Cameroon.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly and association is guaranteed in the
 Constitution but in practice is restricted. The Cameroon-
 ian penal code prohibits public meetings, demonstrations
 or processions without prior government approval.
 The national labor union operates within the framework of
 the government-controlled single national party and its top
 leadership is chosen by the Government. The decisions of
 the congress of the national labor union must be approved by
 the national political party, and the union cannot have
 
 
 49
 contact with foreign trade union organizations without
 government authorization. Cameroon is a member of the
 International Labor Organization (ILO). The union parti-
 cipates in a government regulated negotiation process, but
 strikes are illegal. Business groups are organized under
 the government-sponsored Chamber of Commerce. There is
 a National Bar Association. Other interest groups include
 professional organizations and informal associations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Cameroon is a nation of Muslims, Christians, and Animists.
 Followers of these religious beliefs do not appear to enjoy.
 any particular advantage or suffer disadvantage. Freedom of
 religion is protected by law and generally respected in
 practice. Religious groups are required to register with
 administrative authorities. Sects not accepting temporal
 authority, such as the Jehovah's Witnesses, are proscribed.
 The practice of witchcraft and sorcery is considered a crime
 under Cameroonian law, and persons have been convicted and
 jailed under this statute.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within the country is not restricted
 by law. In practice, however, the police frequently stop
 travelers for checks of identity, tax receipts, and the
 like. These checks sometimes develop into incidents of
 petty harassment. Exit visas are required to leave the
 country and often are available only after long bureau-
 cratic delays. In some cases, these delays may represent
 attempts by the Government to discourage or even prevent
 departure. Women must have the permission of their husbands
 to leave the country. Cameroonians leaving the country must
 deposit sums sufficient to buy a one-way return air ticket
 for repatriation should they become stranded abroad. There
 are no restrictions on the right of voluntary. repatriation.
 Over the yeas, Cameroon has offered safe-haven to large
 numbers of refugees from Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea, and
 Chad, as well as smaller numbers from other African regions,
 including Namibia and the Central African Republic. Most of
 the 30,000 refugees from Equatorial Guinea returned to that
 country by late 1979 following the declaration of general
 amnesty for all exiles. After the outbreak of civil war in
 Chad. in mid-1979, about 100,000 Chadian refugees fled
 to northern Cameroon where the Government took an active
 role in providing food and shelter with the help of foreign
 donors. Those refugees who subsequently returned to Chad
 and the estimated 200 still remaining in the Poli Camp have
 been well treated in what many observers have described as
 an exemplary program of international refugee assistance.
 Cameroon has cooperated with the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees in a program of voluntary repatriation.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Despite im'licit constitutional authorization of more than
 one party, Cameroon is a one-party state. Opposition
 parties are not tolerated and all political activities must
 take place under the umbrella of the Cameroon National Union.
 Citizens who accept these constraints can involve themselves
 in competition at the local level among factions representing
 different political points of view. For the majority of the
 Cameroonians who are not party activists, however, the
 
 
 50
 political process involves little element of choice. A
 single candidate for each position is chosen by the party
 and subjected to a vote of approval or disapproval by the
 public. Party-chosen candidates are occasionally rejected
 by the electorate. Voters need not be members of the party.
 Write-in candidates are proscribed by the Constitution.
 Anglophones and other minorities are represented in the
 Government and the National Assembly in numbers roughly
 proportional to their populations.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 Amnesty International regularly requests information from
 the Cameroonian Government on the status of persons allegedly
 detained without formal charges and without public trial.
 At first, the Government recognized no obligation to respond
 to queries about specific individuals. It has recently
 stated that each such case is thoroughly investigated.
 Amnesty International states that the only responses received
 from the Cameroon Government have been denials that the
 individuals in question are detained in Cameroon. In 1980,
 Amnesty International requested the Government to permit the
 inspection of prisons by an independent humanitarian organi-
 zation. The request was not acknowledged, and no action is
 believed to have been taken by the Government. In February
 1980 President Ahidjo responded indirectly to Amnesty
 International's criticism by rejecting the charge that human
 rights are not respected in Cameroon. There are no organi-
 zations within Cameroon which observe, report, or contest
 human rights violations. The preamble to the Cameroonian
 Constitution affirms support for the freedoms guaranteed in
 the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United
 Nations Charter. Cameroon is not a signatory to the African
 Human Rights Charter. In its 1982 report Amnesty International
 listed its concerns as long-term detention without trial
 of suspected political opponents and poor prison conditions.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Cameroon's population is estimated at 8.6 million, with a
 growth rate of 2.5 percent. Life expectancy is presently
 about 47 years, and the national infant mortality rate is 157
 per 1,000 live births.
 The national active labor force participation rate is 48
 percent. Seventy-five percent of this labor force (3.4
 million) is in the rural areas engaged in farming or small
 business such as tailoring, banking, and minor crafts. Two
 hundred thousand persons are 6ngaged in the industrial
 sector and the remaining 600,000 in the tertiary sector
 (transportation, communication, and service). The labor
 force in the public sector reached 100,000 by 1981, increas-
 ing at an annual rate of 6.9 percent. In 1980, the Government
 reported a national unemployment rate of six percent-- 12.2
 percent in the urban areas and about 4.3 percent in rural
 areas, although labor ministry officials estimate that
 the figures are not complete. Considering the annual
 economic growth of over six percent during the past three
 years, the expansion of employment opportunities has not
 kept pace with either the growth in the work force or the
 intensified national investment of over 24 percent of the
 gross domestic product. The rate of inflation, as recorded
 
 
 monthly by the IMF, is currently estimated at about 12
 percent.
 Fifteen percent of the urban population and 40 percent of
 the rural population of Cameroon are estimated to live below
 the absolute poverty level. Scanty national income data
 indicates that 10 percent of the population receives about
 60 percent of the income. This implies that 90 percent of
 Cameroon's population receives an income of less than one
 half of the national per capita average of $669. These
 differences in part stem from the diversities in geographical
 areas and limited access to ideas, markets, and services.
 A National Nutritional Survey (1978) reported that about 21
 percent of the children under five years of aqe suffer
 from chronic undernutrition. Moderate to mild malnutrition
 is suffered by 4.8 percent of the children under five
 years of age. The ratio of calorie supply available for
 consumption relative to nutritional requirements is 89
 percent (1977). Access to safe drinking water is estimated
 at 26 percent (1975).
 The school enrollment rate for children between the ages of
 6-14 averages 88 percent in urban areas and 46 percent in
 rural areas, with female students underrepresented noticeably
 in the rural secondary schools. There is a primary school
 enrollment ratio of 103 percent. Although the percentage
 is high, there are marked regional differences in access to
 primary education. School attendance rates are one-third
 the national average in the Muslim North, where only 22
 percent of the children attend school. The adult literacy
 rate is 12 percent (1970).
 Women, by law, enjoy equal rights with men under the Came-
 roonian Constitution and are politically active in the
 nation's sole political party and labor union. The women's
 wing of the party has created social and education programs
 aimed at encouraging the economic and social productivity of
 Cameroonian women. Cameroonian women are represented in the
 modern sector, although not proportionately in the upper
 levels of administration and in the professions. Women hold
 government positions such as Minister of Social Affairs,
 Vice-Minister of Education, Ambassador to the United Nations,
 party central committee member, and deputy in the National
 Assembly.
