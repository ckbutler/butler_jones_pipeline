 ARGENTINA
 The Argentine armed forces have held power since 1976. The
 military government instituted major changes, however, in 1982,
 easing restraints on political and civil liberties and
 committing itself to elections by not later than November 1983,
 with the restoration of a constitutional Government set for not
 later than March 1984. These changes occurred in the wake of
 severe and growing economic problems and Argentina's defeat in
 the Falklands/Malvinas conflict. They followed six years of
 military rule, characterized by the use of harsh measures to
 end terrorism and curb political dissent, severe limitations on
 political activity, and the frequent lack of protection of
 individual rights. During that time, the Government was unable
 to establish a solid basis for economic growth or a basic
 political restructuring.
 In June 1982, President Galtieri was replaced by General (Ret.)
 Reynaldo Bignone. The new administration lifted the formal ban
 on political activity on July 1 and in August promulgated a
 political parties law which required new registration of party
 members to be followed by internal party elections in
 preparation for the national elections. Trade unions, while
 circumscribed by government intervention dating from 1976, have
 been free to function in many cases as though there were no
 controls. Late 1982 witnessed an upsurge in political and
 labor activity. Political parties (including the communists)
 staged large rallies, human rights groups held demonstrations,
 and labor organized a successful national strike. At least
 100,000 people, organized by political, union, and human rights
 groups, took part in a 'March for Democracy" in downtown Buenos
 Aires in mid-December. The overall result has been a major
 change in the exercise of political rights during the second
 half of 1982.
 The press also has been less inhibited in 1982 than at any time
 since the early 1970s. Criticism of government policies and
 programs became a matter of course. Four small publications
 were closed briefly late in the year, but overall freedom to
 discuss sensitive political and social questions expanded
 markedly. In the electronic media, sensitive subjects have
 been openly treated on radio, but less so on state-owned
 television.
 The judicial system displayed greater independence in 1982.
 The Supreme Court overturned a military court ruling for the
 first time. Lower courts have been increasingly receptive to
 habeas corpus petitions filed on behalf of prisoners held under
 state of siege powers. The courts ruled in favor of three of
 the periodicals closed by the authorities. Prison conditions
 continued to draw criticism from inmates and their families.
 However, earlier reforms were reinforced; courts have heard
 prisoner-abuse cases and punished guards found quilty.
 Despite the significant expansion of civil and political
 liberties, incidents of violence occurred in 1982 which many
 believed to have been provoked by elements linked to the state
 security organizations but operating without the sanction of
 the Government. These uncontrolled elements were widely held
 responsible for harassment and threats against human rights
 
 
 385
 activists and foreign and Argentine journalists, for the
 abduction of several people who later reappeared, and for two
 murders. Some observers interpreted these efforts as attempts
 by dissidents within, or associated with, the security forces
 to undermine the Government's movement toward constitutional
 and civilian rule.
 There were no reported disappearances in 1982. Human rights
 groups and some political parties have concentrated on efforts
 to force an accounting for past disappearances which numbered
 in the thousands, including appropriatepunishment of those
 responsible. These efforts gained impetus when the press
 reported that unmarked gravesites contained the bodies of
 persons who disappeared during the mid-to-late 1970s. Given
 the widespread belief that many of the disappeared were-killed
 with the complicity of official security personnel, this issue
 is a highly sensitive and important one for the return to
 democratic government. The Government initiated efforts to try
 to reach an understanding with future civilian leaders on this
 issue prior to the departure of the military Government. By
 late 1982, the Government is believed privately to have
 provided information to family members regarding deaths and
 burial sites in approximately one fifth of the cases of persons
 whose disappearance was reported to the Government between 1974
 and 1982.
 The Government accelerated releases of state of siege political
 prisoners, held under special state of siege powers, freeing
 approximately 425 in 1982. The number of such prisoners was
 reduced to 243 at the end of the year.
 Argentine human rights organizations have experienced greater
 freedom of action, particularly since the inauguration of the
 Bignone administration. In an impressive showing, about 10,000
 people marched in downtown Buenos Aires in October 1982 and
 then a much larger march took place in December. The
 relaxation of restrictions on civil and political liberties has
 permitted greater press attention to the activities of human
 rights groups and encouraged prominent Argentine figures to
 lend their support. Urged on by humanitarian groups, many
 political leaders have endorsed objectives of the human rights
 movement.
 The Argentine Government has adopted varying economic policies
 since 1976 but the major thrust has been toward greater
 reliance on the free market, albeit within a context of
 extensive existing state controls. Argentina was beset by a
 number of severe economic problems in 1982 including high
 levels- of inflation, a deepening recession, which reduced real
 wages, and increased unemployment.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 The two reported killings for apparent political motives were
 those of Ana Maria Martinez, said to be active in the
 Trotskyite Socialist Workers Party, and Marcelo Dupont, whose
 brother claims he has evidence in a case of murder that
 occurred in 1978. Neither case has been resolved. Many
 observers believe that these two murders may have been
 perpetrated by individuals with links to to the police or
 military operating outside the control of the Government. The
 Government has promised thorough investigations.
 b. Disappearance
 There was no evidence of disappearances in 1982. Various human
 rights organizations have reported some persons as
 
 
 386
 disappeared. In all twelve instances cited, persons abducted,
 detained, or temporarily missing returned home or were released
 within several days of their initial absence, with the
 exception of one individual who remains in acknowledged
 detention on criminal charges. According to human rights
 organizations, some abductors reportedly told their victims
 that they represented a state authority, from which the
 humanrights organizations inferred official complicity. The
 Government disclaimed responsibility for the abductions.
 Demands that the authorities account for the large number of
 people who disappeared in the past became a major national
 issue in 1982. Considerable disagreement remains as to how
 many persons disappeared. The most carefully documented list,
 compiled by the Argentine Permanent Assembly for Human Rights,
 contains approximately 6,000 names. Other estimates are much
 higher. It is generally believed that most of those who
 disappeared over the years are dead, many as a result of
 actions by security forces but also some at the hands of
 terrorist groups.
 In late 1982, the press, political parties, and human rights
 organizations joined in demanding investigations of unmarked
 graves recently identified and thought to contain the bodies of
 some of the disappeared and calling for legal action against
 those responsible. Several foreign governments also renewed
 active efforts in late 1982 to seek an accounting of their
 nationals or descendants reported as disappeared. The
 Argentine Government has received approximately 6,600 requests
 for information on the whereabouts of disappeared persons and
 is believed to have provided information to family members on
 the deaths and in some instances the location of the remains of
 the disappeared in about 1,450 cases. On September 29 the
 Minister of Interior publicly said the Government will continue
 to collect information about disappearance cases and provide it
 to relatives.
 c Torture
 The Argentine Constitution prohibits the use of torture, but
 its use has been noted in both human rights and common criminal
 cases. The courts have sought to curb its use. Most of the
 persons reported as temporarily missing in 1982 claimed to have
 been subjected to torture by electric shock or the placement of
 plastic bags over their heads causing suffocation. In March,
 the Buenos Aires Lawyers' Association denounced what it
 referred to as the continuing, systematic use of torture by
 security officials. The Lawyers' Association of Salta Province
 at mid-year charged that inmates at the local penitentiary were
 tortured and brutalized regularly by guards. In October, four
 policemen were arrested by judicial order on charges of
 torturing criminal suspects. The Supreme Court in November
 ordered an investigation into a judge's conduct in connection
 with allegations that she and other judges had witnessed
 prisoners being tortured by security forces, as reported by a
 journalist in an article published in a daily newspaper in
 October.
 Allegations of police brutality continue to appear. Both the
 press and the Government have denounced cases of prisoner abuse
 and encouraged judicial investigations. In February, as a
 result of a court investigation, 12 police officers were tried
 for beating a detainee who subsequently died of his injuries.
 In July, a federal judge sentenced a prison guard to three
 years imprisonment for beating several immates at Caseros
 penitentiary. Court action was initiated against seven police
 officers in Cordoba province and six in Mendoza, all charged
 with abuse of prisoners, but no verdicts have been rendered yet.
 
 
 387
 Following strong editorial criticism of torture and police
 brutality, Minister of Interior Reston on September 10, 1982
 ordered provincial governors to take steps to eliminate the use
 of torture or brutality by provincial and municipal police and
 to prevent general mistreatment of prisoners. The Minister
 ordered severe measures taken against officers guilty
 ofexcesses. The Supreme Court overturned a lower court's
 conviction of an individual on the grounds that his confession
 was obtained through torture.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The Government continued in 1982 implementing reforms initiated
 in 1980 to improve prison conditions for those detained on
 security grounds. There was general agreement that treatment
 of persons detained for other than common crimes improved
 markedly, including acceleration of state of siege prisoner
 releases in 1981 and 1982. Some of those recently released say
 the greatest improvement in conditions began following the
 Falklands/Malvinas War. The International Committee of the Red
 Cross has free access to prisoners to conduct inspections.
 Application of the test of reasonableness to the severity of
 sentences continued to be a factor in the greater role played
 by the courts in granting habeas corpus rulings in the case of
 prisoners held for security reasons.
 Human rights organizations continue to maintain, however, that
 political prisoners are consistently treated more harshly than
 other inmates. Allegedly, stricter vigilance, limited
 facilities for exercise and rest, and inadequate medical care
 lead to greater psychological and physical strains than is the
 case for common prisoners. One suicide of a prisoner held for
 security reasons (Jorge Toledo in Caseros prison) was reported
 in June 1982.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The Argentine penal code, promulgated in 1924, gives the police
 and courts broad authority to detain persons and hold them
 incommunicado for up to eight days. Even in the case of minor
 offenses, the holding of suspects incommunicado for a few days
 is common. Apart from this authority, the Constitution confers
 power on the executive branch to detain and hold prisoners
 under a state of siege; one has been in effect in Argentina
 since November 1974. (Both the state of siege powers and the
 prisoners detained under them are characterized with the widely
 known acronym PEN, "Poder Ejecutivo Nacional"). There is no
 time limit for holding PEN prisoners, but they have the nominal
 constitutional right to choose foreign exile in lieu of
 continued imprisonment. Since 1978 nearly 1,000 PEN prisoners
 have been allowed to exercise this option. Over 50 former PEN
 prisoners, plus more than 40 family members, have obtained
 refugee status in the United States; the last PEN prisoner to
 receive permission to travel to the United States arrived in
 November 1981.
 From 1974 to 1981, over 8,700 persons suspected of terrorism or
 subversion were detained under PEN powers, according to the
 Ministry of Interior. Two persons who were fugitives since the
 military coup and emerged in late 1982 were detained under PEN
 powers but were later released. During 1982, approximately 425
 PEN prisoners were released, mostly on parole. According to
 the Ministry of Interior, as of the end of 1982 there were 101
 PEN prisoners held without trial or after being acquitted or
 having completed their sentences. Another 59 individuals were
 in trial status, and 83 were serving sentences imposed by the
 civilian courts. Another 345 individuals, described by the
 Ministry of Interior as subversives, were detained under
 ordinary civilian or military penal codes (i,e., not PEN
 powers), were convicted and were serving their sentences. In
 late December 1982, Interior Minister Reston said that no PEN
 prisoners would be held in PEN status by the end of 1983.
 
 
 388
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Persons accused of subversion or terrorism may be tried in
 either civilian or military courts. The Argentine
 civilianpenal code provides for open trials and rights to
 defense. Despite such guarantees, defendants can be denied
 access to evidence against them, and most of the process may be
 conducted in written rather than oral form, a practice common
 in many Latin American legal systems. Military tribunals
 trying civilians accused of internal security violations
 conduct their proceedings in secret. Defendants have a
 military defense counsel, usually not a lawyer, and are
 normally denied access to evidence against them. There do not
 appear to have been any military trials of civilians in 1982.
 The civilian judiciary displayed increasing independence in
 1982. In February, the Supreme Court, in an unprecedented
 ruling, overturned a military court's conviction of a man
 charged with belonging to an illegal organization and ordered a
 retrial by a lower civil court. All rulings by lower courts,
 civilian and military, may be appealed to the Supreme Court,
 which in 1982 showed itself increasingly disposed to accept
 such appeals. In August, the Supreme Court took issue with a
 ruling of the armed forces' highest tribunal, the Council of
 War, claiming the military court was 'not competent* to try and
 sentence an individual for subversive association. The person
 concerned was released, as ordered by the court.
 The high court also became more active in responding to
 requests for writs of habeas corpus filed on behalf of
 individuals held on security grounds. Lower civilian courts
 likewise have stepped up their consideration of PEN-related
 habeas corpus petitions. A doctrine advanced in an August
 federal court decision -- that 'citizens can no longer be
 deprived of their freedom for secret reasons' -- appeared
 increasingly to influence lower court rulings. In November
 1982 the Supreme Court decided to investigate allegations that
 the court morgue illegally carried out autopsies and issued
 improper death certificates for prisoners reportedly killed in
 the late 1970s by security forces.
 g. Invasion of the Home.
 Warrants are required before police may enter private premises
 without the owner's permission. These are issued by a judge on
 the showing by police of probable cause. Like other rights,
 protection of the home has been suspended by the state of
 siege. However, there were no reports in 1982 of security
 forces invading homes.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Constitutional guarantees of these freedoms have been
 circumscribed since the imposition of a state of siege in
 1974. The most recent trend, with some exceptions, has been
 toward liberalization, and it is expected to expand further as
 the process of civilian restoration unfolds. As domestic
 political competition has intensified and focused on elections,
 restraints on media and fuller expression of dissent have
 loosened. Published criticism of the military was a regular
 media staple before the July lifting of the ban on political
 activity, and it subsequently grew more pointed, with human
 rights developments and particularly the disappeared issue
 receiving prominent treatment. Political figures highly
 critical of the Government appear daily on the electronic
 media. Extensive television coverage of anti-government labor
 rallies in December illustrate the new liberalized atmosphere.
 
 
 389
 Reminders to the government-owned radio and television stations
 concerning subjects considered sensitive by the Government are
 issued periodically. In November the press leaked an
 apparently genuine government memorandum containing a list of
 issues that television stations and most radio stations werenot
 to mention. The issues included human rights groups,
 journalistic commentary on human rights, and related issues.
 Print and news media do not appear to have received direct
 warnings in 1982 and provide extensive coverage of these
 issues. From October to December, however, following several
 indirect unheeded warnings, the military junta closed four
 periodicals (the fourth was a successor to one of the first
 three) for "bringing disrepute upon the essential institution
 of the Republic." Three appealed the closures and won in
 court. The largest magazine was republishing by mid-December.
 Some journalists reported anonymous threats, harassment, and
 surveillance because of their writings. During the December
 16, 1982 anti-government demonstration, some journalists and
 photographers were beaten by police. Several foreign
 journalists covering the Falklands/Malvinas War were kidnapped
 in two separate incidents. They were robbed, held several
 hours, and stripped before being released. Many observers
 believe that this was the work of extremists associated with
 the state security organizations. Then-President Galtieri met
 with the journalists to offer personal apologies and assurances
 of protection. Journalists requesting them were provided
 police bodyguards.
 Censorship of Argentine and foreign literary and other artistic
 works declined significantly in 1982. Foreign books and
 magazines in their original language are practically free of
 censorship, but Spanish translations are subjected to the same
 scrutiny as works by Argentines. However, Jacobo Timerman's
 highly-critical and controversial book about his detention and
 torture in Argentina, *Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a
 Number', was published in Argentina (under a different title)
 and is available in Spanish. Censorship of foreign films for
 political and moral content is routine, but censors showed
 increasing leniency in 1982. Films authorized for showing
 included 'The House on Garibaldi Street', about the kidnapping
 of Adolph Eichmann from Buenos Aires, and *Norma Rae*, which
 presented labor union activism attractively. Similarly, drama
 productions are again dealing with sensitive political issues.
 The *Open Theater' staged a series in Buenos Aires that
 included several highly political plays. A celebrated
 Argentine folk singer, formerly proscribed for Communist
 sympathies, was allowed to return from exile to pursue her
 career.
 There are still restrictions on academic freedom in Argentina.
 At the university level, there is an officially promulgated
 list of activities, topics, and texts which are banned from
 classrooms. Controversy has also been sparked by the selection
 criteria imposed by the Government for the appointment of
 university professors. At the elementary and secondary levels,
 subjects and texts are rigorously prescribed by the authorities.
 There are reports that both wiretapping and letter opening by
 the authorities have taken place in Argentina during 1982.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Until the lifting of the ban on political activity and
 promulgation of the political parties law in August, public
 meetings were restricted to enclosed, roofed premises, and then
 only with prior permission of the authorities. Since then, all
 groups and parties, except radical organizations outlawed for
 
 
 390
 espousing violence, have been free to organize and assemble.
 Major rallies have been held by various political parties,
 including the Communist Party.
 Despite military intervention in 1976, labor unions remain a
 powerful economic and political force. Approximately
 one-thirdof the work force is unionized, mostly urban,
 industrial laborers. The unions generally oppose the military
 Government, especially its economic and social policies. Since
 mid-year, the Government has responded to union demands and
 demonstrations with tolerance and sometimes with wage increases
 and other concessions. This contrasts with a March 30, 1982
 crackdown on demonstrating labor groups that resulted in the
 brief arrest of hundreds and the fatal shooting of one
 demonstrator.
 Most major trade unions remain subject to intervention ard,
 therefore, ultimate control by appointed government
 representatives. However, in late 1982 the Government removed
 military overseers from a half dozen large unions and named
 trade union leaders to assume their control until union
 elections are held. Under the terms of the 1979 labor law, the
 Government has officially recognized approximately one-quarter
 of the nation's more than one thousand unions. They have
 proceeded to elect new leadership and to operate without direct
 interference.
 Collective bargaining is officially suspended. Nevertheless,
 some firms choose to consult with labor leaders on pay,
 benefits, and other issues. The ban on strikes is not now
 effectively enforced, and they occurred with increasing
 frequency after mid-year. While the administration of General
 Galtieri challenged labor demonstrations, the Bignone
 Government has tolerated them, including mass, anti-government
 rallies in downtown Buenos Aires in October and December, and a
 highly effective, non-violent general strike on December 6,
 1982. Violence did break out at the end of the December 16,
 1982 demonstration, however, and one demonstrator was killed.
 Many unions maintain close ties to international labor bodies
 and participate in international conferences, including the
 International Labor Organization (ILO). The ILO considers
 Argentina to be in violation of ILO Convention No. 87 (freedom
 of association) because of limitations on association contained
 in the 1979 law and legal restrictions on strikes, collective
 bargaining, and other trade union rights.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 By constitutional requirement, the President of Argentina must
 be a member of the Catholic Church, to which an estimated 95
 percent of Argentines belong. Recent Governments have publicly
 and vigorously condemned religious prejudice and all other
 forms of discrimination.
 Other religions must register with the Government to obtain the
 legal recognition required for their churches to operate freely
 in Argentina. Jehovah's Witnesses are the only religious group
 whose petition for recognition, filed in 1981, has not been
 granted. Even so, since late 1981, Argentina's approximately
 42,000 Witnesses have been permitted to assemble without
 permits or police interference. Problems previously
 experienced with the authorities and in the public school have
 eased somewhat. At present about 300 Witnesses, all Argentine
 nationals, are under arrest for refusal to acdept compulsory
 military service. The usual penalty is three to four years of
 service at various military installations around the country.
 Conditions are not onerous and furloughs are given for as much
 as a month at a time. A Supreme Court ruling in 1981 held that
 Witness children could not be held responsible for the training
 
 
 391
 and beliefs received from their parents. Problems remain for
 older students, but are reported to be subsiding. A Jehovah's
 Witness Church in Comodoro Rivadavia (a coastal town about
 1,000 miles southwest of Buenos Aires) was bombed in November
 1982. There were no casualties.
 Argentina's Jewish community of 300,000-450,000 practices its
 religion without official restraint. It represents an
 important part of the country's economic and cultural life, and
 the Government maintains good relations with the community.
 There is no evidence of an official policy of anti-Semitism.
 Occasional incidents of anti-Semitism, however, continue to
 occur. In late February 1982 a Jewish cemetery was desecrated
 with swastikas. The Government strongly condemned the
 vandalism, with President Galtieri's personal denunciation
 given wide distribution by all the news media. Jewish
 community leaders called the Government's repudiation of anti-
 Semitism "unprecedented" in its forcefulness.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Internal and foreign travel and emigration are basically
 unencumbered. Paroled PEN prisoners are usually restricted by
 judges to their municipality of usual residence for six to nine
 months; permission to travel must be received from the police
 to whom the parolees must report periodically. There are no
 other significant restrictions on parolees and there are few,
 if any, instances when parole is revoked and the person sent
 back to prison.
 A small number of officials of the civilian regime ousted in
 1976 are not permitted to leave the country. In May, 1982 the
 Government ended the problem of asylees in local embassies by
 granting "safe conduct' for passage to Mexico to the last
 asylee, resident in the Mexican Embassy since 1976.
 Former PEN prisoners who were granted the option to leave the
 country generally are barred from returning. In a rare
 exception in February, a former PEN prisoner and expellee was
 permitted to return. Other PEN applicants for self-exile under
 the right of option are carefully screened, and most requests
 to emigrate have been denied. Only one PEN prisoner was
 allowed the option to go to the United States in 1982.
 Argentina has a considerable refugee population, dating from as
 far back as the post-World War II period. It includes European
 refugees and thousands of Latin Americans who fled to Argentina
 over the years. Most of them enjoy legal status. The refugee
 population was slightly augmented in the late 1970's by the
 admission of several hundred families of Southeast Asia
 refugees. Three hundred foreigners were nationalized as
 Argentine citizens in 1982.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Argentina has been ruled since 1976 by a junta made up of the
 commanders-in-chief of the army, navy, and air force who select
 a military officer (usually retired) to serve as president of
 the nation. The junta was disbanded for a period after the
 Falklands/Malvinas War but has been reconstituted.
 The Bignone Government is publicly committed to holding
 elections in late 1983 and restoring constitutional civilian
 government by March 1984. A president, deputies and senators
 in the bicameral legislatures are to be elected, as well as
 provincial governors, mayors, legislators, and municipal
 councils. Specific dates have not yet been established for the
 1983 elections but President Bignone has stated that the
 elections will be held not later than the first Sunday in
 
 15-480 0 - 83 - 26
 
 
 392
 November. The political parties law issued in August 1982 is
 intended to facilitate democratic intra-party election and
 procedures. Some parties have criticized the role of court
 appointed temporary overseers in internal party affairs.
 National, provincial and municipal administration has been
 largely made civilian, with the appointment of politicians and
 technicians to many posts assumed by military officers after
 the 1976 coup. In 1982, national cabinet posts were in the
 hands of civilians, with the exception of the interior
 portfolio.
 Women participate freely in politics in Argentina, one of only
 three Western Hemisphere nations to have had a female head of
 government, Maria Estella Martinez de Peron, 1974-1976.
 Outside of Buenos Aires and other major urban centers, women
 are confined to a role defined by Argentine tradition. In
 urban areas where educational and economic opportunities are
 superior and society more open to modern trends, women commonly
 participate in most professions. Married women living in
 Argentina must have the permission of their husbands to travel
 abroad with their minor children, if the husband is not
 accompanying them.
 3. Government Attitudes Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 Argentina cooperates with both the United Nations on Human
 Rights Commission and the Organization of American States'
 Inter-American Human Rights Commission (IAHRC). Although the
 latter did not formally address Argentina's situation in 1982,
 the UN Human Rights Commission considered Argentine cases under
 the confidential 1503 procedure. In addition, an IAHRC report
 issued in September reviewed Argentine developments since
 publication of the report covering its 1979 on-site inspection.
 The report highlighted Argentina's renewed cooperation with the
 IAHRC since June 1982 and emphasized the lifting of restraints
 on civilian political activity. While it criticized
 continuation of the state of siege, the commission noted the
 Government's infrequent resort to state of siege powers and
 stated that the IAHRC had received no reports of disappearances
 or PEN detentions in 1982. Equally positive, according to the
 report, was the judicial system's more assertive effort to
 safeguard individual rights. The commission was critical of
 the Government's failure to provide information on past
 disappearances.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) maintained
 its presence in Argentina, visiting political prisoners. Like
 most other institutions in Argentina, however, ICRC's
 priorities were temporarily shifted by the war. The protection
 of the civilian population on the islands and, after
 Argentina's defeat, overseeing the transfer of Argentine
 prisoners back to the mainland, were primarily ICRC programs.
 Private human rights organizations number eight (their Spanish
 names or acronyms are cited parenthetically): the Grandmothers
 of Plaza de Mayo (Abuelas); the Permanent Assembly of Human
 Rights (APDH); the Center for Legal and Social Studies (CELS);
 Families of the Disappeared/Detained for Political Reasons
 (Familiares); The Argentine League for the Rights of Man
 (LIGA); The Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo (Madres); the
 Ecumenical Movement for Human Rights (Movimiento Ecumenico);
 and the Peace and Justice Service for Latin America (Paz y
 Justicia).
 The Permanent Assembly for Human Rigths was created before the
 1976 military coup in response to the abuses that flowed from
 the climate of violence then prevailing. With a membership
 
 
 398
 drawn from all sectors of Argentine society, it collects and
 disseminates information to sensitize public opinion to the
 human rights question. The Assembly compiled in 1979 the
 best-documented list of alleged disappearances, providing
 dataon about 6,000 cases. It also advises and assists families
 of victims of repression.
 The group most widely known nationally and internationally is
 the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo. The Mothers developed
 loosely at first as a group of people who in 1976 began
 gathering at Government House in the Plaza de Mayo to inquire
 into the fate of their family members who were detained and/or
 had disappeared. Their meetings have since been formalized in
 silent vigils every Thursday in the Plaza.
 The Center for Legal and Social Studies, founded in 1978, is
 the newest of Argentina's human rights organizations. As both
 a data-collecting and legal assistance agency, it prepares
 court actions in cases of detentions and disappearances,
 promotes improvement in conditions for political prisoners, and
 maintains active contact with foreign human rights
 organizations. The Center, together with the Mothers,
 isbelieved to have the widest connection with foreign human
 rights institutions, such as the UN and OAS Human Rights
 Commissions.
 Human rights organizations operated with increased
 effectiveness in 1982 despite minor incidents of harassment and
 surveillance. With the general trend toward political
 liberalization, a number of prominent organizations and
 individuals began to pursue themes formerly espoused almost
 exclusively by human rights groups. Political parties, labor
 unions, professional organizations, and the hierarchy of the
 Catholic church have adopted some of the objectives pioneered
 since the mid-1970's by the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, the
 Permanent Assembly for Human Rights, and similar
 organizations. In the meantime, human rights groups have
 stepped up their activities and expanded the scope of their
 efforts. The Mothers' weekly vigils in the Plaza de Mayo are
 being broadened into marches to other centers of Buenos Aires,
 giving them an expanded public profile. Human rights groups
 have also taken an increasingly active role at political
 conventions and meetings. Associated organizations are
 increasing their activities in the capital and the provinces,
 providing legal and social assistance services without official
 hindrance.
 Some officers and members of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo
 had denigrating posters hung on their homes while the Permanent
 Assembly for Human Rights discovered hidden listening devices
 in its headquarters. Other human rights activists reported
 receiving anonymous threatening telephone calls.
 Amnesty International's 1982 report, covering 1981, stated that
 that organization's main concerns in Argentina "continued to be
 the unresolved question of the 'disappeared' prisoners, and
 arbitrary detention without trial.' The Freedom House report
 for 1982 classified Argentina as "not free," The Washington
 Office on Latin America's 1982 report also cited continuing
 human rights problems.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Nothwithstanding a current high rate of inflation, a
 year-and-a-half recession, and high rates of unemployment and
 under-employment combined (15 percent of a labor force of 11
 million), Argentina's population of 27.7 million enjoys a high
 standard of living for a developing country. Per capita income
 is $2,395 (1980); the infant mortality rate, 40.8 per 1,000
 live births, (1981); and population access to safe water, 66
 
 
 394
 percent (1975). There is no discrimination in the availability
 of food, shelter, health, or education on the basis of sex,
 religion, race, or ethnic background.
 Although there was no unemployment insurance at the end of
 1982, the subject was being discussed by the Government. Laws
 govern how employees may be dismissed. Severance pay is high
 and employers tend to retain workers using temporary layoffs
 where possible to avoid dismissals. Real wages dropped
 substantially during the first half of 1982 due partly to a
 freeze in public sector wages and to the lengthy recession. In
 August-September 1982, across-the-board wage increases tended
 to raise real wages. There are provisions for a minimum wage,
 family allowances, and other fringe benefits; these have also
 recently been increased.
 In this largely middle class society, 80 percent of the
 population lives in urban areas. More than 65 percent of the
 population own their homes. There is ample protection for
 private property ownership. Although there may be some
 malnutrition due to the prolonged recession and unemployment,
 the average Argentine enjoys a healthy, high protein diet (126
 percent of daily caloric requirements). The adult literacy
 rate is 94 percent, and primary and secondary schooling is free
 and widely available. In the province of Buenos Aires where
 approximately one-third of the nation's population resides,
 93.6 percent of the 12-year old population was attending school
 at the time of the 1980 census, 1.7 percent had already
 graduated, only 4.2 percent had dropped out, and less than 1
 percent had never attended. Nationwide, 92 percent of the
 children in the appropriate age group are enrolled in the first
 two grades, 85 percent in the third grade, 70 percent in the
 fourth and fifth grades, and 60 percent in the sixth and
 seventh grades.
 The federal Government, the provinces, and the municipality of
 Buenos Aires combined allocate 15.3 percent of their budgets to
 education, 7 percent to public health, and 14.4 percent to
 social welfare, of which public housing is a large component.
 These figures as a percentage of GDP are 3.4 percent for
 education, 1.58 percent for public health, and 3.27 percent for
 social welfare.
 Affordable private health care is widely available, in addition
 to trade union health care programs, managed at this time by
 the Government, which reach at least 20 percent of the
 population. Housing is still inadequate, but new public
 housing programs have been announced.
