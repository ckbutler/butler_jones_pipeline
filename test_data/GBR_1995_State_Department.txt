 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN
 IRELAND*
 The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK) is a longstand-
 ing, constitutional monarchy with a democratic, parliamentary government elected
 in periodic, multiparty elections and an independent judiciary. Human and civil
 rights are recognized by statute and by strongly held traditions, but there is no
 written constitution. The legal system treats human rights as assumed unless lim-
 ited by statute.
 Throughout the United Kingdom, police forces are responsive to, and under the
 effective control of, civilian officials. In Northern Ireland, because of terrorist vio-
 lence in the recent past, army units in some areas reinforce the Royal Ulster Con-
 stabulary (RUC).
 The United Kingdom has a highly developed industrial economy. The Government
 provides comprehensive social welfare services. The Northern Ireland economy has
 improved since the 1994 cease-fires, but pockets of high unemployment remain.
 The United Nations Human Rights Committee (UNHRC), as part of a report is-
 sued in July, called on the Government to withdraw emergency legislation in North-
 ern Ireland. In response to the decrease in violence, the Government pledged in Au-
 gust to establish an independent panel to review the relevant acts. By year's end,
 *A separate report on Hong Kong, a dependent territory of the United Kingdom, follows this
 report.
 
 
 1094
 the panel had not been created, and the Government proposed to Parliament that
 the Emergency Powers Act be extended for 2 years. The Government has already
 taken several measures in Northern Ireland, including withdrawing some troops, re-
 ducing army patrols by 75 percent and ending them entirely in some areas, and
 opening some border roads with Ireland that had been closed for security reasons.
 In December the Defense Secretary stated that no further troop withdrawals were
 planned in the short term
 There continued to be allegations that security forces in Northern Ireland phys-
 ically and psychologically abused detainees in holding centers, although these de-
 creased as the let-up in terrorist violence eased tensions. Allegations of past use of
 excessive force by the security forces continued to be a matter of contention. Emer-
 gency antiterrorist measures enacted during the past 20 years restrict freedom of
 movement for 36 suspected terrorists and supporters (down from 69 in 1994). Also,
 primarily due to fear of terrorist violence, many Protestant and Catholic commu-
 nities in Northern Ireland are self-segregated.
 Laws and procedures governing detention that deny the right to immediate coun-
 sel and encroach on the right to silence have been widely criticized. Provisions of
 the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act of 1994 that allowed inferences to be
 drawn from the silence of persons accused of crimes drew censure from the UNHRC.
 The cease-fires called by Republican and Loyalist terrorist organizations (whose
 members are Catholic and Protestant, respectively) resulted in a greatly diminished
 threat to public order in Great Britain as well as in Northern Ireland.
 Paramilitaries in Northern Ireland are believed to be responsible for seven killings
 in 1995-four in December alone-in what both authorities and knowledgeable ob-
 servers believe are Provisional IRA (PIRA) murders of alleged and known drug deal-
 ers. Bomb explosions and defusions associated with paramilitary groups totaled 7,
 down from 22 in 1994. Nonetheless, both Republican and Loyalist paramilitaries
 continued to engage in vigilante "punishment" attacks on alleged "antisocial ele-
 ments" and to exile "informers" by force. There have also been instances of arson
 against (Protestant) Orange halls and Catholic churches.
 The Government is taking steps to combat violence against women and societal
 discrimination against nonwhite minorities.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings by the Government, but several deaths during apprehension or in custody
 raised questions about whether police and prison officers had used improper re-
 straining techniques or excessive force against minority group members and crimi-
 nal suspects.
 In May a black man, Brian Douglas, died from hemorrhages and a fractured skull
 5 days after an arrest during which a witness alleged that the police had struck
 him on the head; police said he was intoxicated. By year's end, the authorities had
 not decided whether to press charges.
 In December a black burglary suspect, Wayne Douglas, died in a police holding
 cell after resisting arrest. Two postmortems revealed a heart attack, but Douglas
 family asserted police brutality. An investigation was under way at year's end.
 Three other deaths of black men in detention remained under investigation at
 year's end. All died in prison after struggles that involved guards using extraor-
 dinary controls and restraints.
 In June a court acquitted three London metropolitan police officers of the 1993
 manslaughter of Joy Gardner. The officers had gone to Gardner's home to carry out
 an order to deport her to Jamaica. When she resisted arrest, they gagged her with
 13 feet of adhesive tape wound at least seven times around her head, causing her
 to asphyxiate and subsequently die of brain damage. A police department investiga-
 tion of the officers' supervisor, for neglect of duty in permitting the use of an unau-
 thorized restraint, continued at year's end. In July the UNHRC, alluding to the
 Gardner case, expressed its "grave" concern at the use of excessive force in the exe-
 cution of deportation orders.
 In November the Southwark Coroners Court returned a verdict of unlawful killing
 in the April 1994 death of 37-year-old Irishman Richard O'Brien, who suffocated
 after being handcuffed face down. Police shouting anti-Irish epithets assaulted
 O'Brien outside a social club where they had been called to investigate a disturb-
 ance. The coroner identified 31 separate injuries to O'Brien's body. Following the
 verdict, the family's attorney petitioned the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which
 had earlier decided there was insufficient evidence, to institute criminal proceedings
 
 
 1095
 against the officers involved. At year's end, the CPS had not taken a new decision,
 and police declined to suspend the officers involved in the interim.
 The European convention on human rights stipulates that lethal force should be
 used only when "absolutely necessary," while British law calls for it to be "reason-
 able under the circumstances." Human rights groups have criticized the British
 standard as deficient, but British courts have ruled that lethal force may be applied
 only if there is imminent and unavoidable danger to life. Courts generally assume
 that a police officer who aims and fires a weapon intended to cause serious bodily
 harm; the issue then is whether there was justification for such intent. If not the
 only applicable charge is murder, requiring a life sentence, and the courts have been
 unwilling to impose such a heavy penalty in borderline cases. The alternative
 charge oT manslaughter is applicable in death cases only if there is no intent to
 cause bodily harm; there have been few convictions on this basis.
 In February the trial of two British soldiers for killing 18-yearold Peter McBride
 in Northern Ireland in 1992 concluded. The court concluded that the victim had
 been shot as he ran away after being stopped and searched, and it sentenced the
 defendants who had denied murder, to life in prison.
 Private Lee Clegg, who had been sentenced to life imprisonment in an unlawful
 death case, was released in July. Clegg had been convicted for the 1990 shooting
 of an 18-year-old passenger in a stolen vehicle that had accelerated through an
 army checkpoint in Northern Ireland. In making his decision to parole Clegg after
 only 4 years of incarceration, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland cited an
 appellate decision that found the killing unlawful but regretted mandatory imposi-
 tion of the life sentence given the circumstances of the case. The decision also took
 into account the recommendation of the Northern Ireland Life Sentence Review
 Board. Although Review Board guidelines generally require a prisoner to serve 10
 years in confinement before cases are considered exceptions are permitted and have
 i    mae in other instances. The decision resuted in serious rioting in some parts
 of Northern Ireland and drew criticism from many within the Nationalist Commu-
 According to areport by a quasi-official advisory group, security forces in North-
 er Ireland have killed over 350 people, many in disputed circumstances, since the
 troubles began in 1968. While there have been criminal prosecutions in 32 cases in-
 volving the security forces, Clegg was only the fourth soldier to be convicted for an
 offense while on duty. The only other soldier sentenced to life imprisonment prior
 to the Mcbride case was released after 26 months in prison.
 During 1995 authorities and other knowledgeable observers attributed six killings
 of alleged and known drug dealers to the P, presumably acting in a vigilante
 capacity. A  oup calling itself "Direct Action ag nst Drugs (DAAD) took respon-
 siblity for four of the murders. While the Pin denied a connection with DAAD,
 its refusal to condemn the killings contributed to public suspicion that it was in-
 volved. There were no arrests in the cases by year's end.
 William Elliot, a known Protestant paramilitary, was killed in September in what
 appeared to be a Leyalst-ordered execution. Elliot was implicated in the April 1994
 murder of Margaret Wright, a Prc-testant woman brutay attacked after being mis-
 taken for a Catoic woman outside a dsnce hall frequented by Loyalists.
 The 1989 killing of Patrick Finucane, counsel to many RA suspects, remains an
 open case. Although it was widely alleged that Brian Nelson, a former Loyalist
 paramilitary and agent for British mitary intelligence, assisted in targeting
 Finucane, the Northern Ireland Director of Public Prosecutions determined that the
 available evidence was insufficient and decided not to bring charges against Nelson.
 Human rights organizations have called for the establishment of an independent
 public inquiry to investigate allegations of police threats to defense lawyers in
 Northern Ireland and of alleged collusion between the security forces and Loyalist
 paramilitaries. Amnesty International in August concluded that the Government
 had censistently refused to carr out a thorough, imrtial and wide-ranging in-
 quiry into the extent of collusion." Authorities pled security considerations in declin-
 ing to publish a report by senior police officer John Stevens on the subject. Although
 newspapers reported that Stevens' 6-year inquiry had uncovered proof of the in-
 volvement of four members of the security forces in killings, the Northern Ireland
 Director of Public Prosecutions declined to press charges, citing a lack of evidence
 sufficient to gain convictions. In September the European Court of Human Rights
 ruled in a 10 to 9 decision that the killing of three PIRA terrorists by British oin-
 mlndos in Gibraltar in 1988 was a breach of the European human rights conven-
 tion.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances attributed to the
 Government. At least 14 terrorist-prpetrated disappearances, going back to 1972,
 remain outstanding, without any significant investigative progress by the authori-
 
 
 1096
 ties. A seven-person RUC team works full-time to solve the cases, but the victims,
 typically members of the security forces, suspected informers, or petty criminals,
 have not been found. In spite of the cease-fire, the paramilitaries have not cooper-
 ated in locating any bodies.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law forbids torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. Confes-
 sions thus obtained are not admissible in court and judges can exclude even vol-
 untary confessions. Detainees who claim physical mistreatment have the right to an
 immediate medical examination. Such a claim must be examined by a trial judge.
 The Independent Commission for Police Complaints (ICPC), established by the
 Government, supervises police investigations in Northern Ireland. Authorized to re-
 view all complaints, it automatically superviss cases involving death or serious in-
 juny. It accepts information provided by a complainant and by any other sources,
 as well as that discovered by the police. The ICPC can advise (but cannot require)
 the chief constable to take dircipiinary action against police officers. The ICPC re-
 ported that in 1994 it had received 2,810 complaints of official abuse, that its inves-
 tigations had led to the substantiation of 30, the disciplining of 107 police officers,
 and the lodging of criminal charges against 6 more. Local human rights groups com-
 plain that the ICPC's pe.rs are inadequate because it cannot act autonomously;
 it can only review cases in which a state actor or citizen has filed a complaint.
 In 1993 the Northern Ireland Secretary named an independent assessor of mili-
 tary complaints to deal with procedures regarding complaints of abuses by the
 army; he, too, has no independent investigative powers. is second report, released
 in June, noted that, of 217 formal complaints in 1994, only 15 were substantiated.
 No disciplinary action was taken in five of these cases. In six cases, the soldiers in
 question were chastised; in two, they were severely reprimanded (in one case for
 pointing a rifle at a civilian and in another for incivility); in one, the soldier was
 removed from the area (for harassing a local resident); and in the remaining case,
 the soldier was fined (for makinga rude gesture at civilians).
 The U.N. Committee Against Torture and many human rights groups have raised
 concerns about ill-treatment of detainees in Northern Ireland, where suspects ar-
 rested under emergency legislation are interrogated in special holding centers. It
 recommended that interrogations in police custody be videotaped. The Government
 resisted doing so, on the grounds that videotaping could compromise operations and
 jeopardize informants.
 In December 1992, the Government appointed a senior barrister as Independent
 Commissioner for Holding Centers in Northern Ireland, with authority to make ir-
 regular, unannounced visits to any holding center, observe interrogations on tele-
 vision monitors, and interview detainees. His second report in March found some
 substandard conditions but nothing that would constitute torture. The Commis-
 sioner recommended the closure of the holding center at Castlereagh, where there
 is no exercise facility and no natural light in the cells and interview rooms. The
 UNHRC also urged that Castlereagh be closed "as a matter of urgency," but the
 Government has not announced any plans to do so.
 Following some widely publicized prison escapes in Great Britain, the Home Of-
 fice in January drafted a plan that stressed prison "security as the overriding prior-
 ity." Prison facilities and regimes vary depending on location, with the best condi-
 tions found in prisons in northern Ireland. Remand facilities in Britain, like holding
 centers in Northern Ireland, tend to be antiquated, overcrowded, unsanitary, or defi-
 cient in exercise areas. Most .permanent facilities are good, but human rights groups
 complained that overcrowding, caused by a 28 percent rise in the prison population
 between December 1992 and August 1995, led to inmate violence and alienation by
 reducing work and educational opportunities and limiting time prisoners could
 spend out of their cells.
 Women's prisons appeared to suffer the most. In December the new Chief Inspec-
 tor of Prisons halted his inspection of Holloway prison in London in protest at condi-
 tions there. He was reported to have been shocked at the squalor and vermin infes-
 tation and particularly concerned at the treatment of prison inmates who were for-
 eign nationals or ill. He called for "immediate improvements" after finding an "over-
 zealous and heavy-handed" security regime that included the use of shackles on
 pregnant women having antenatal examinations in nonsecure areas. The Govern-
 ment responded by assigning 16 additional staff members to the facility and issuing
 new guidelines to eliminate routine use of chains.
 There have long been accusations that security forces in Northern Ireland harass
 citizens, particularly young people, in areas where support for terrorists is consid-
 ered strong. The Government strongly denies that such behavior is widespread or
 officially tolerated. Police continue to use plastic bullets in crowd control situations
 a use which is restricted to Northern Ireland and which has been widely criticized
 
 
 1097
 by human rights monitors and by the U.N. Committee Against Torture. In July a
 demonstrator in Belfast was reportedly seriously injured when a plastic bullet
 struck him in the face.
 Both Loyalist and Republican terrorists in Northern Ireland have continued to
 carry out frequent "punishment" attacks, typically involving beatings with iron
 pipes and improvised clubs. The RUC recorded 76 Loyalist and 141 Republican as-
 saults of this nature; young men ages 14 years and over were the most frequent
 victims. While the Loyalists a ppear to target members of their terrorist cells who
 have broken ranks, the Republicans extend their vigilante activities to the broader
 Catholic community, punishing "antisocial" activities (drug-taking, car theft) or
 sometimes even such acts as dating an IRA prisoner's girlfriend.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-British authorities can and often do
 make arrests or detain suspects without judicial warrants--especially in Northern
 Ireland, under laws applicable only there-when they believe they have reasonable
 cause to suspect wrong oing.
 The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act of 1994 gives a police officer of the
 rank of superintendent or above the power to authorize uniformed officers in a spec-
 ified area to stop and search pedestrians and anything they are carrying for offen-
 sive weapons or dangerous articles if the officer reasonably believes there is a pros-
 pect of serious violence or terrorism. No reasonable suspicion is required that the
 person being stopped and searched has committed a crime.
 Outside Northern Ireland, suspects arrested without warrants must be released
 within 36 hours unless brought before a magistrate's court. The magistrate may au-
 thorize extension of detention by an additional 60 hours, or, in cases of crimes of
 violence, for periods of up to 3 years pending trial. Persons charged with
 "nonserious" offenses can request release on bail; to be granted bail they must either
 have a local address or be firmly established in the community.
 Under the latest Northern Iieland (Emergency Provisions) Act (EPA), passed in
 1991, members of the armed forces on duty there can arrest without a warrant any
 person they have reason to suspect of any offense--or intent to commit any of-
 fense-linked to terrorism. Such suspects may be held for up to 4 hours and then
 must be transferred to police custody or released. (From April on, routine military
 patrolling in support of the RUC throughout Northern Ireland dropped by 75 per-
 cent compared with levels before the cease-fire.)
 The most recent Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act (PTA)
 passed in 1989, allows the police to arrest without a warrant anywhere in the UK
 persons they have reason to suspect of being involved in terrorism. The authorities
 may detain such persons (even those under age 18) for up to 48 hours without legal
 representation or judicial review. Suspects may be interrogated during this time,
 and confessions obtained may be used in subsequent court proceedings. Under the
 1989 PTA in England or Wales, detainees are granted the right to have lawyers
 present during interrogation, but this is not the case in Northern Ireland. Judicial
 review may be delayed up to a further 5 days on the authority of the Home Sec-
 retary or, in Northern Ireland, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.
 In September a British High Court ruled that the Home Secretary's 6-month
 delay of parole hearings in the case of five PIRA prisoners serving longer minimum
 terms than they had been sentenced to was "manifestly unjust and flouted the
 principles of the common law and the European human rights convention.
 Immigration legislation ives the power of administrative detention to immigra-
 tion officers. There is no time limit for such detention and no right to have it re-
 viewed by a court. In March police detained a Punjab native withpermanent resi-
 dency in the UK, citing national security after the murder in London of a Punjabi
 newspaper editor. Although the detained Punjabi was not charged, at year's end he
 continued to be held in custody pending deportation.
 The Government does not practice exile (see Section 2.d. regarding exclusion or-
 ders), but the terrorist organizations do. A human rights group, Families Against
 Intimidation and Terror (FAIT), said it knew of 287 persons currently in PIRA or
 Loyalist paramilitary-enforced exile and suspected the true number was signifi-
 cantly higher.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is independent.
 The UK has several levels of courts. The vast majority of criminal cases are heard
 by magistrates' courts, which are managed by locally based committees. Their deci-
 sions may be a pealed to the Crown Court, which also hears criminal cases requir-
 ing a jury trial, or to the High Court. From the Crown Court, convictions may be
 appealed to the Court of Appeal, which in turn may refer cases involving points of
 law to the House of Lords. The Appellate Committee of the House of Lords (which
 consists of senior judges and is functionally distinct from the legislative arm of the
 House) is the final court of appeal. Once all of these appeals have been exhausted,
 
 
 1098
 defendants in England and Wales may appeal to the Home Secretary to refer a case
 back to the courts if fresh evidence has emerged that casts doubt on the conviction.
 (Appeals may be made to the Northern Ireland Office and the Scottish Office in
 those jurisdictions.) The law provides for fair trial, and the authorities respect this.
 However, serious exceptions led the Government in 1991 to establish a Royal Com-
 mission to review all aspects of the criminal justice system in England and Wales.
 The Commission's report, issued in 1993, included 352 recommendations. The Gov-
 ernment in July passed the Criminal Appeal Act to establish a Criminal Case Re-
 view Commission. The Commission, due to start work in 1996, will direct and super-
 vise investigations into possible miscarriages of justice and refer cases for further
 appeal on factual, legal, and sentencing grounds.
 The Belfast Crown Court acquitted the remaining three of the "Ballymurphy
 Seven," a group of teen-agers arrested in 1991 in connection with an attack on the
 RUC, on proce ural grounds. The 3 had been out on bail since October 1994, when
 10 boxes of documents pertinent to their trial, the existence of which had been pre-
 viously denied, were produced by the prosecution. The Court ruled that the failure
 to disclose the evidence was central to the men's release, but it described the pros-
 ecution's actions as an "inadvertent lapse" and strongly implied that the accused
 were in fact guilty as charged. It called "implausible the defendants' allegations
 that police used physical and mental coercion to elicit their confessions.
 With the entry into effect of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act of 1994,
 judges obtained the power to instruct juries that they may draw an inference of
 guilt from a defendant's refusal to answer questions during interrogation or trial,
 although no conviction can be based solely on such an inference. Human rights
 groups and the UNHRC have sharply criticized this change in the law. A similar
 provision is in effect in Northern Ireland (see below).
 Indigent defendants have the right to free counsel of their choice. All criminal pro-
 ceedings must be held in public except those in juvenile court and those involving
 public decency or security. In a trial under the Official Secrets Act, the judge may
 order the court closed, but the sentencing must be public. Convictions can be ap-
 pealed to successively higher courts.
 In Northern Ireland, special "emergency" restrictions affect due process. Under
 the 1973 EPA, the Government suspended the right to trial by jury there for certain
 terrorist-related offenses because terrorists haT intimidated the judiciary, jurors,
 and lawyers. Such offenses are tried instead by a "Diplock Court," a judge presiding
 without a jury. If the decision is to convict, the judge must justify it in a document
 that becomes part of the court record, and an appellate court may overturn it on
 substantive as well as legal grounds. The Diplock Courts have been widely criti-
 cized. The EPA also permits the use of uncorroborated confessions, but they cannot
 be the sole basis for conviction anywhere in the UK. The 1988 Criminal Evidence
 Order allows judges to draw an adverse inference when a suspect refuses to answer
 questions.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, home, or Correspondence.-War-
 rants are normally required for a police search of private premises. However, under
 the EPA, on-duty members of the armed forces or policemen in Northern Ireland
 may enter any premises if they believe they have "reasonable grounds of suspicion"
 that the entry is necessary to preserve peace and order.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Strongly held common-law tradition, an inde-
 pendent press, and a democratic political system combine to secure freedom of
 speech and the press, including academic freedom. Viewpoints critical of the Govern-
 ment are well represented. The print media are dominated by a handful of national
 daily newspapers, all privately owned and independent (although often generally
 aligned with a political party). About half the electronic media are run by the Brit-
 ish Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), which is funded by the Government but enjoys
 complete editorial independence. The remainder are run by corporations under re-
 newable government license.
 Human rights organizations continued to criticize the Official Secrets Act of 1990,
 which prohibits disclosure of a broad range of foreign policy and national security
 information. They assert that, in the absence of freedom of information legislation
 or a public interest defense for disclosing sensitive information, the act shields gov-
 ernment activities from public scrutiny, including possible improper or illegal activi-
 ties. Alleged offenses under the act may be tried in secret, and the Government need
 not disclose its justification for holding a secret trial. However, the act is seldom
 invoked and has not prevented the disclosure of numerous internal government doc-
 
 
 1099
 uments and alleged wrongdoings. Attempts by the Government in the 1980's to
 prosecute officials who leaked documents generally failed.
 The doctrine of Public Interest Immunity (P) allows government ministers to
 prevent certain information from being disclosed during litigation, on the grounds
 that its revelation would be contrary to the public interest. In May the Northern
 Ireland Secretary imposed a PH certificate on former Manchester Deputy Chief Con-
 stable John Staker to prevent him from giving evidence in court in a civil action
 against the greater Manchester police. The Government maintained that any discus-
 sion of the RUC's alleged "shoot-to-kill" policy, which Stalker had investigated in
 the mid-1980's, could jeopardize the current peace process. (Manchester's Chief Con-
 stable had taken Stalker off the investigation, and his findings, which he hinted
 might be damaging to the Government, were never published.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for the right
 of peaceful assembly, and the Government respects this right in practice.
 Under the PTA, the Secretary of State for Northern gland may proscribe any
 organization that "appears to him to be concerned in, or in promoting or encourag-
 ing terrorism. . . ." Membership in some 10 Loyalist and Republican paramilitary
 groups is thus punishable by up to 10 years' imprisonment, and supporting these
 entities is also illegal. Human rights activists have criticized this law because it
 criminalizes not only terrorist acts but also association with individuals who commit
 them.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Government policy and general practice ensure freedom
 of religion. There are two legally recognized official churches of the State: in Eng-
 land, the (Anglican) Church of England, and in Scotland, the (Presbyterian) Church
 of Scotland. Blasphemy of the Christian religion-and only of that religion-is out-
 lawed. The blasphemy law, however, is rarely enforced. In Northern -Ireland, the
 Constitution Act of 1973 prohibits public authorities from discriminating on the
 basis of religious or political belief.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens enjoy freedom of movement within the country and in foreign
 travel, emigration, and repatriation. However, the Home Secretary may exclude
 from Great Britain anyone believed linked with terrorism in Northern Ireland, ex-
 cept anyone born in Great Britain or resident there for 3 years; and the Secretary
 of State for Northern Ireland can likewise exclude persons not native to or resident
 in that province. Currently 36 persons (down from 69 in 1994) are subject to exclu-
 sion orders. Several Members of Parliament, human rights groups, and the media
 have objected to exclusion orders. The Secretary of State need not reveal the
 grounds for exclusion, and the evidence is not tested in any court. There is no right
 of appeal to the courts, but appeal may be made informally to an independent advi-
 sor.
 The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and
 other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The charge has been levied,
 however, that the Government regularly detains a small percentage of asylum seek-
 ers, on average for over 4 months, as a deterrent to others who might follow. The
 Government denies this, but figures show a higher percentage of detainees ulti-
 mately gain refugee status than do asylum seekers permitted to live in the commu-
 nity. Applications for political asylum dropped from a peak of 44,840 in 1991 to
 32,840 in 1994. Of those, 825 were granted-the lowest proportion ever.
 Because asylum procedures are cumbersome and cases are backlogged, the law
 provides for granting of "exceptional leave to remain" (ELR) as a step short of full
 refugee status. Home Office statistics show that three to four times as many asylum
 seekers are granted ELR as are granted full refugee status. While in ELR status,
 however, individuals are denied the benefit of family reunion. Human rights groups
 maintain that the Government does not apply safeguards, such as assurance of ac-
 cess to a fair asylum-determination procedure, when removing asylum seekers to
 safe third countries and that these policies undermine Britain's commitment to pro-
 vide haven for legitimate refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government and freely exercise it. The
 Government is formed on the basis of a majority of seats in the House of Commons,
 which are contested in elections held at intervals not longer than 5 years. Participa-
 tion in the political process is open to all persons and parties. All citizens 18 years
 of age and older may vote. Northern Ireland has city and district councils, as in the
 rest of the UK, but with somewhat fewer powers. England and Wales also have
 county councils, while Northern Ireland does not. (Scotland's structure is different
 
 
 1100
 still.) Despite periodic attempts, there has been no devolved government in North-
 ern Ireland since 1972 because of the troubles.
 In 1979 a majority of Scottish people voting (but not the required majority of
 those on the Scottish electoral rolls) voted in favor of devolution for Scotland.Par-
 ties committed to the establishment of some form of Scottish parliament received
 some 75 percent of the vote during the last general election (in 1992). The Govern-
 ment has chosen not to call a further referendum on Scottish devolution.
 British dependent territories, other than Hong Kong, have small populations
 under 60,000, and all are ruled by appointed governors or administrators assisted
 by executive councils (usually appointed) and legislative assemblies or councils
 (partly elected). In August Bermudians voting in an independence referendum chose
 to maintain their island's status as a British dependency.
 Women and minorities face no legal constraints on voting or holding office. The
 Head of State is a woman. The Head of Government from 1979 to 1990 was a
 woman. Female members constitute about a 10th of the House of Commons (includ-
 ing the Speaker of the House) and a 20th of the House of Lords. Both major parties
 recognize the need to increase the number of women representatives. The Labour
 Party has sought to require local constituencies to nominate only women candidates
 for safe seats that fall vacant. About a fifth of Councillors on local authorities are
 women. Several members of minority ethnic groups serve in Parliament, and many
 work in local governments.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmertal In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The many nongovernmental human rights organizations operate with no govern-
 ment interference, and the UNHRC praised their submissions to it as "a tribute to
 the democratic nature of United Kingdom society." In 1973 the Government estab-
 lished a standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights to monitor human rights
 in Northern Ireland but has not adopted many of its recommendations.
 A number of international, nongovernmental human rights organizations, includ-
 ing Amnesty International and Article 19, are based in the United Kingdom. The
 Government cooperates fully with international inquiries into alleged violations of
 human rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, nationality, or na-
 tional or ethnic origin and outlaws incitement to racial hatred, except that racial
 discrimination is not specifically outlawed in Northern Ireland. Conversely, discrimi-
 nation on grounds of religious or political opinion is unlawful in Northern Ireland
 but not in Great Britain. Discrimination on the basis of religion is only illegal in
 Great Britain when its effect is to discriminate against a member of a minority eth-
 nic group. The Government respects all extant antidiscrimination laws.
 In 1991 the Prime Minister announced that sexual orientation would no longer
 be a bar to receiving a security clearance. Nevertheless, in November an Appeal
 Court ruling upheld t , Ministry of Defense's power to dismiss male and female ho-
 mosexual members of the armed services on grounds of "incompatibility." The Min-
 istry commenced a review of the policy in order to advise a House of Commons spe-
 cial select committee due to consider the quinquennial armed forces bill in early
 1996.
 Women.-Statistical and other evidence indicates that most victims of societal vio-
 lence are women. Domestic violence constitutes one-third of all reported crimes
 against women and accounts for almost 25 percent of all reported violent crimes.
 A coordinator of refuge prevision, the Women's Aid Federation in England, says that
 it receives approximately 130,000 calls about domestic violence each year. Almost
 50 percent of all homicides of women are committed by partners or ex-partners.
 The law provides for injunctive relief, personal protection orders, and exclusion or-
 ders for women who are victims of violence. The Government provides shelters,
 counseling, and other assistance for victims of battery or rape, and it offers free
 legal aid to battered women who are economically reliant upon their abusers. It ac-
 tively prosecutes perpetrators of domestic violence, and the law provides for their
 imprisonment. The courts have held that nonconsensual marital sex can constitute
 a criminal offense. A 1994 law abolished the warnin_ that judges had previously
 beea required to give juries to the effect that a victims testimony alone should not
 be adequate for a rape conviction. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act of
 1994 made sexual (as well as other intentional) harassment a criminal offense.
 The law provides for equal opportunity between the sexes. A qovernment minister
 cochairs the Women's National Commission, a forum for women s organizations that

 presents women's views to the Government. An Equal Opportunities Commission
 supports persons who bring discrimination cases before in*dustrial tribunals and
 courts, and it produces guidelines on good practice for employers. Women in Britain
 earned approximately 21 percent less than their male counterparts in comparable
 positions. fn Northern Ireland, the figure is 25.9 prcent less.
 The 1975 Sex Discrimination Act as amende     1986 prohibits indirect as well
 as direct discrimination in training, education, housing, and provision of goods and
 services, as well as in employment. In February the Government promulgated regu-
 lations to ensure that employees working part-time, almost 90 percent of whom are
 women, are entitled to qualify for employment protection rights on the same basis
 as full-time workers. Women have equal rights regarding property and divorce.
 Children.-The Government demonstrates its strong commitment to children's
 rights and welfare through its well-fiunded systems of public education and medical
 care. In 1993 the Government initiated a 3-year grant to create an extra 50,000 out-
 of-school childcare places. Nine out of 10 children ages 3 and 4 now attend some
 form of nursery school or play group. In July the Government announced that it
 would provide parents with vouchers for nursery education for 4-year-olds. However,
 publicly funded care is available for only 2 percent of children under age 3.
 While there is no pattern of societal abuse of children, indications are, despite the
 lack of reliable data, thet child abuse is nevertheless a problem. Various laws cover-
 ing England and Wales stipulate that children have the right to apply for court or-
 ders, to give or withhold consent for m-dical treatment (for those capable of making
 an informed decision), to make complaints to the relevant local authority, to have
 their ethnic, linguistic, and religious background considered in decisions affecting
 them, to have reasonable contact with their family (usually applied in a cir-
 cumstance where there has been abuse), and in general to be consulted regarding
 their desires.
 The U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child concluded in January that emer-
 gency legislation in Northern Ireland operated to the detriment of children there:
 for examnle, the police and army power to stop, question, and search people-on the
 street led to complaints of youths being mistreated. The UNHRC in July regretted
 that corporal punishment is lawful in certain circumstances in independent schools.
 People With Disabilities.-The Companies Act of 1985 requires firms employing
 more than 250 people to set out in their annual reports their policies on recruit-
 ment, training, and career development for disabled workers.
 A 1994 survey commissioned by SCOPE, a charity and lobbying group, of 1,568
 disabled people in England, Wales, and Scotland found that nearly a fifth had been
 refused service in a pub or restaurant because of their disability, 45 percent found
 it difficult to get information about available health and social services, and 51 per-
 cent believed that they had been refused a job interview or a job because of their
 disability.
 In November the Government passed the Disability Discrimination Act, outlawing
 discrimination against disabled people in provision of access to public facilities. The
 Act does not cover discrimination in education, and the Government declined to cre-
 ate an enforcement body, creating the National Disability Council instead as an ad-
 visory body to carry out research and report regularly to the Secretary of State for
 Sial Security.
 Access to buildings is improving but inadequate. Many buildings are so old that
 they do not have elevators. Since 1985 government regulations have required that
 all new buildings meet the access requirements of all persons with impaired mobil-
 ity. In June 1992 the Government put in place similar regulations for sensory-im-
 paired persons.
 Government regulations mandate that by the year 2000 all taxis be accessible to
 wheelchairs.
 Religious Minorities.-For a variety of historical and social reasons, the Protes-
 tant community controls much of the local economy in Northern Ireland, and anti-
 Catholic discrimination persists in the private sector there. Despite government ef-
 forts, the unemployment rate for Catholic men there remained twice that for Protes-
 tant men. Government efforts to increase recruitment of Catholics into the police
 force (currently 92 percent Protestant) and related security fields in the province
 have been hampered by PIRA assassinations and death threats, as well as wide-
 spread antipathy in the Catholic community to the security forces. Applications by
 Catholics to join the RUC have nonetheless risen since the cease-fires from 12 to
 22 percent o? the total, and the most recent class of inductees included about 20
 percent Catholics. With postcease-fire downsizing likely, however, the RUC acknowl-
 edged that raising its percentage of Catholics to approximate that of the general
 population would remain problematic.
 
 
 1102
 While active recruitment of Catholics by the Northern Ireland civil service has
 produced rough proportionality in overall numbers, the service has acknowledged
 that Catholics remained significantly underrepresented in its senior grades, and in
 November 1993 it declared its intention to overcome this imbalance. Service-wide
 employment cutbacks have thus far hampered its efforts.
 The Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act of 1989, as amended, aims to end
 even unintentional or indirect discrimination in the workplace. (There is no legisla-
 tion to prohibit religious discrimination in housing, education, or provision of goods
 and services.) A fair employment tribunal adjudicates complaints. All public-sector
 employers and all private firms with over 10 workers must report annually to the
 Fair Employment Commission on the religious composition of their work force and
 must review their employment practices at least once every 3 years. Noncompliance
 can bring criminal penalties and loss of government contracts. Victims of employ-
 ment discrimination may sue for damages. While critics of the act have asserted
 that its targets and timetables are too imprecise, most leaders of the Catholic com-
 munity have praised it as a positive step.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.--Although the law prohibits discrimination
 based on race (except in Northern Ireland), persons of African or South Asian origin
 face substantial unofficial discrimination. The Home Office has estimated that there
 are between 130,000 and 140,000 incidents of racial attack and harassment involv-
 ing all races every year. An April study by the Northern Ireland Anti-Poverty Net-
 work found that 90 percent of the approximately 7,000 ethnic Chinese living in the
 province had experienced some form of racial prejudice. Incitement to racialhatred
 is a criminal offense punishable by a maximum of 2 years' imprisonment. The Gov-
 ernment strictly enforces these laws and regulations.
 A government-appointed but independent Commission for Racial Equality (CRE)
 provides guidelines on good practice, supports persons taking court action under the
 Race Relations Act of 1976, and may initiate its own court action. After investigat-
 ing a complaint, the CRE may issue a notice requiring that the discrimination be
 stopped. The CRE monitors the response to such a notice for 5 years.
 Although ethnic minorities are only 5.5 percent of the population, they are a quar-
 ter of those stopped and searched by police. Various studies have shown that, on
 average, black men face more serious charges for the same substantive offenses
 than do white men, they are more likely to be cautioned, and they are more likely
 to receive custodial sentences. Statistically, blacks are 7.1 times as likely as whites
 to be inprison. Ethnic minorities are seriously underrepresented in the criminal jus-
 tice processions.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the right to form and join unions, and
 the Government fully respects this right in practice. Unions participate freely in
 international organizations. Unions are free of government control. Like employers'
 associations, they must have their accounts certified by the Government. Senior
 union officers must be elected by secret ballot. The law mandates secret ballots be-
 fore a strike call; prohibits unions from disciplining members who reject a legal
 strike call; and allows members to lodge complaints against their union with a gov-
 ernment-appointed commissioner.
 There is no specific statutory "right to strike." Voluntary cessation of work may
 be considered a breach of contract. A system of legal immunities from prosecution
 for unions engaged in lawful industrial action was narrowed by acts of Parliament
 in the 1980's. These acts exclude secondary strikes and actions judged to have politi-
 cal motives; unions encouraging such strikes are subject to fines and seizure of their
 assets. The le gslation also restricts the ability of unions to act against subsidiaries
 of prime employers with which they are in dispute when the subsidiaries are not
 party to the dispute and are the employers of record.
 In September 1993, the Council of Europe (COE) determined that British labor
 law violated the European Social Charter by permitting an employer to dismiss all
 employees who take part in a strike and then, after 3 months, to rehire them selec-
 tively. The COE requested the British Government to notify the COE of the meas-
 ures to be taken to remedy this defect, but the Government has not done so, because
 it is no longer a party to the Charter.
 Legislation in 1978 and 1990 made it illegal to deny employment on the grounds
 that the applicant is not a union member. The Trade Union Reform and Employ-
 ment Rights Act of 1993 set new procedural requirements for union strikes, dues
 collection, and membership rules. It also made it possible for private citizens, when
 deprived of goods or services due to strike action, to seek damages and to obtain
 assistance in this effort from the Government. The Trade Unions Congress (TUC)
 in 1993 lodged complaints with the International Labor Organization (ILO) on var-
 
 
 1103
 ious provisions of the 1993 Act (see Section 6.b.); the ILO has not completed consid-
 eration of these complaints. In March the House of Lords upheld a provision of the
 Employment Protection Act of 1978, as amended by the Employment Act of 1988,
 allowing employers to offer workers financial inducements to give up trade union
 representation.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Although there is no legal ob-
 ligation for employers to bargain with workers' representatives, and while labor-
 management contracts are not enforceable in the courts, collective bargaining is
 longstqnding and widespread, covering about 40 percent of the work force.
 Workers who believe themselves victims of antiunion discrimination may seek re-
 dress through industrial tribunals. Remedies available include payment of indem-
 nities and reinstatement.
 Contrary to ILO Convention 98 on the right to organize and bargain collectively,
 it is lawful for employers or others to circulate blacklists of union members seeking
 employment. In May 1993, the ILO concluded that the British Government is
 obliged to protect union members from such discrimination, but the Government has
 not responded to this.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-School attendance until age 16 is
 compulsory. Children under age 16 are not permitted to work in an industrial enter-
 prise except as part of an educational course.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Ther is no legislated minimum wage. The
 Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act of 1993 abolished the w age council
 system, which prior to September 1993 had established minimum hourly wages and
 overtime rates for adult workers in 26 low-wage industries. No legislation limits
 daily or weekly working hours.
 The Health and Safety at Work Act of 1974 requires that the health and safety
 of employees not be placed at risk. A Health and Safety Commission effectively en-
 fo s regulations on these matters and may initiate criminal proceedings. Workers'
 representatives actively monitor the enforcement. Workers can remove themselves
 from hazardous conditions without risking loss of employment as provided in the
 European Union Framework Directive on Safety and Health.
