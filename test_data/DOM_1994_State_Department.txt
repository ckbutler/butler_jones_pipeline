 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 The Constitution of the Dominican Republic provides for a popularly elected Presi-
 dent and a bicameral Congress. In practice, the system heavily favors the executive
 branch, headed by seven-term President Joaquin Balaguer. The President appoints
 justices to the Supreme Court, which heads an only nominally independent judici-
 ary. International observers found significant irregularities in the May elections, in-
 cluding the disfranchisement of tens of thousands of voters. Despite an inconclusive
 investigation of fraud charges, the Central Electoral Board declared incumbent
 President Balaguer the winner. After lengthy negotiations between the parties and
 the candidates, it was agreed that President Balaguer would serve a reduced term
 of 18 months. However, the Congress, controlled by Balaguer's party, set the next
 presidential elections for May 1996, providing him a 2-year term instead of the nor-
 mal 4 years.
 The National Police (PN), the National Department of Investigations (DNI), the
 National Drug Control Directorate (DNCD), and the military (army, air force, and
 navy) form the security services. The Government controls all the security services,
 which are generally responsive to civilian executive branch authority. However,
 some members of the security forces continued to commit human rights abuses, with
 the tacit acquiescence of the civil authorities.
 Once heavily dependent on sugar, the economy has grown more diverse; tourism
 and export processing zones are now major sources of income and employment.
 State-owned firms such as the State Sugar Council, the Consortium of State Enter-
 prises, and the Dominican Electricity Corporation continue to be heavily involved
 in the economy, and the financial and administrative difficulties of these firms still
 impede economic growth.
 Human rights problems included electoral disfranchisement, continuing instances
 of police killings of civilians, arbitrary detentions (particularly during the tense
 post-electoral period), beating of suspects, security services' refusal to obey judicial
 orders, judicial corruption, maladministration of the courts, and abuses against mi-
 grant workers. Workers in the state-owned sugar plantations and mills continued
 to labor under deplorable conditions. Workers in the country's export processing
 zones achieved some gains with the signing of collective contracts and other agree-
 ments. Prostitution and domestic violence are also serious problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kiling.-There were no reports of political
 killings.
 
 
 378
 Police and military personnel carried out extrajudicial killings which resulted in
 the death of at least half a dozen civilians. Some killings occurred as a result of
 prsonal disputes but others clearly were the result of excessive force while in cus-
 dy. In July the authorities charged a elice lieutenant colonel and three lieuten-
 ants with killing four persons arrested or robbery. In September the colonel alleg-
 edly bribed the civilian judge to gain his freedom and fled the country.
 Military courts try militar personnel charged with extrajudicial killings. Police
 personnel accused of such k       are subject to dismissal from the police force, and
 can be remanded to civilian courts for trial. Police tribunals have on occasion tried,
 convicted, and sentenced personnel charged with extrajudicial killings. In March a
 police tribunal sentenced a lieutenant to 2 years in prison for the 'voluntary homi-
 cide of an individual.' In July a tribunal sentenced a police corporal to 5 months'
 imprisonment for the "fatal wounding" of another person. Of the over 200 cases
 pendinf in the police tribunal at year's end, 39 percent involved "deliberate bullet
 wound , 15 percent involved death, and 13 percent were listed as "violence against
 persons."
 b. Disappearance.-In May a professor at the Autonomous University of Santo Do-
 mingo, Narciso Gonzalez, dis appeared. Police investigators verified the professor's
 last known whereabouts on May 26, and pursued numerous unfruitful leads but
 never determined what happened to him. Many Dominicans, including the profes-
 sor's close associates, believe that the Government ordered the professor's dis-
 appearance because of his accusations against members of the Government, includ-
 ing President Balaguer, in lectures and in a magazine article published near the
 time of his disappearance. The case remained unresolved at year's end.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although torture and other forms of physical abuse are illegal, security service per-
 sonnel continued to abuse detainees. The authorities usually order little or no pun-
 ishment for perpetrators of such abuse. Although punishment may range up to 5
 years' incarceration for serious cases of abuse, as a rule the courts have given con-
 victed officials sentences ranging from a 1-month suspension to 6 months in jail. In
 September a police appeals tribunal upheld the conviction of a lieutenant colonel
 found guilty of heading a torture ring m police headquarters. The court sentenced
 the officer to 2 years' imprisonment.
 Prisons are overcrowded, and health and sanitary conditions are substandard.
 Some prison personnel reportedly engage in extortion and other corrupt activities,
 and most prisoners find it necessary to rely on relatives or their own finances in
 order to obtain sufficient food. Medical care suffers from a lack of supplies. In some
 instances, minors have been incarcerated in adult prisons (see Section 5). The Com-
 mandant of La Victoria prison was dismissed in -November, following a riot over
 prison conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exil&-The Constitution stipulates that the au-
 thorities may detain suspects for a maximum of 48 hours for investigation before
 arraignment, after which they must charge or release them. However, in special cir-
 cumstances, the authorities may detain suspects for longer periods with the ap-
 proval of the prosecutor's office. Security services routinely violated constitutional
 prvisions by detaining witnesses as weU as sus cts for "investigation" or "interro-
 gation" beyond the prescribed 48-hour limit. Civil authorities' efforts to address
 these widespread abuses have not yet produced any results.
 Military officers occasionally violated legal provisions against military detention
 of civilians. The DNCD and National Police continued to engage in indiscriminate
 roundups of people in poorer neighborhoods. In September, or example, police de-
 tained more than 200 persons in one roundup in the country's capital They released
 mast detainees after several hours in custody. The security services also occasionally
 detain relatives of suspected criminals with the aim of coercing suspects to surren-
 der. Civil authorities have taken no action to curb these widespread abuses.
 The authorities detained hundreds of persons, among them supporters of the lead-
 ing opposition party, members of other antigovernment groups, and journalists, in
 the period following the May elections. In some cases, they carried out these deten-
 tions ostensibly to foil possible violent demonstrations. Various organizations had
 called for strikes and demonstrations to demand annulment of the May elections
 and to call for new elections. They also asked that the authorities produce missing
 university professor Gonzalez (see Section L.b.).
 While the law does not prohibit exile, there are no known current cases of Domin-
 ican citizens in forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Although the Constitution stipulates an independ-
 ent judiciary, in practice interference from public and private entities including the
 executive branch, substantially undermines judicial independence. The President
 appoints justices to the Supreme Court, and the Senate appoints justices to all other
 
 
 379
 courts with the exception of military and police tribunals. Their terms of office cor-
 respond roughly to those of the President and other elected officials. A newly elected
 Senate can either replace the judges or reconfirm them, and may remove or transfer
 them by a majority vote. Senators customarily nominate judges on political grounds
 rather than for their competence as ,jurists. A number of corrupt and incompetent
 proscutors and judges also undermine the system. Furthermore, the judicial au-
 thorities are ineffectual in the administrative supervision of judges and prosecutors.
 A 1994 constitutional reform gave the judiciary a fixed percents  of the national
 budget, thereby diminishing legislative ontrol, and created a National Judicial
 Council which is to begin naming judges after passage of the judicial career law.
 The Constitution provides for public trial. Statutes provide or public defenders
 in all criminal cases, but the number employed is insufficient. The courts normally
 appoint lawyers or law students at public expense to defend indigents in felony
 criminal cases, but only as available in misdemeanor cases. Chronic delays plagued
 the judicial process; of the penal sysem's approximately 11,000 detainees, the
 ourts have tried and convictel only about 10 percent. Although the right to judicial
 determination of the legality of detention exists, pretrial detention is legal and com-
 monly employed. This custom, coupled with a lack of administrative and financial
 support for the system, creates a major backlog of cases, which in turn causes sus-
 pects to suffer long periods of pretrial detention that sometimes exceed possible
 criminal penalties.
 More than 250 persons, among them      more than 50 persons without official
 charges against them, remained incarcerated in Santo Domingo's La Victoria prison
 despite having judicial orders for their release, according to a group of human rights
 monitors. These prisoners have been in custody for periods ranging from 1 month
 to more than 5 years. Minors constitute more than half the group. The Attorney
 General for Santo Domingo called for the release of these prisoners. However, the
 National Police and the DNCD persisted in their refusals to release some prisoners
 and detainees who had been grnted judicial release orders, alleging judicial corrup-
 tion and the seriousness of the alleged crimes as justification for this noncompli-
 ance. No higher authority has taken action to force the prison authorities to comply
 with the release orders.
 The judicial system provides for bail. However, cases in which bail is posted rarely
 come to trial, circumventing the intended purpose of bail.
 Military or police courts have jurisdiction over members of the armed forces and
 police, but a military or police board frequently remands cases to civilian courts
 after review.
 There is no evidence that the Government holds political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government does not arbitrarily interfere with the private lives of persons or fami-
 lies and generally observes constitutional provisions against invasion of the home.
 The authorities may not search a residence except in the presence of a prosecutor
 or an assistant prosecutor, in instances of "hot pursuit,* or when there is probable
 cause to believe that a crime is in progress. During the 1994 electoral campaign and
 the post-electoral crisis, there were numerous credible allegations of widescale inter-
 ception of telephone conversations and surveillance of individuals which may have
 involved the Government as well as political parties. In addition, opposition politi-
 cians charged that government raids on their homes, ostensibly to search for fire-
 arms, were politically motivated. They also charged that the security service officials
 who rounded up many of the detainees mentioned in Section 1.d. employed illegal
 raids on their homes to capture them.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom o Speech and Pess.-The law provides for these freedoms and the
 Government generally respected them in practice. However, there were instances in
 which the authorities abused these rights.
 Dominicans of most political persuasions exercise freedom of speech, but a 1971
 law prohibits foreign language broadcasts. The numerous privately owned radio and
 television stations broadcast all political points of view.
 The Government controls one television station but no major newspapers. News-
 papers freely reflect independent and opposition points of view. Although journalists
 operate in a relatively tolerant environment, they practice a certain amount of self-
 censorship for fear of retaliation ranging from loss of influence to loss of a job. Soon
 after the May elections, the Foreign Ministry issued a note warning the authorities
 would take action accordingly against journalists deemed to have violated national
 security. Economic considerations also inhibit free expression, as powerful economic
 consortiums or wealthy, influential families own all the principal media outlets.
 Some journalists solicit, or are responsive to, bribes in order to generate reports.
 
 
 380
 In July the executive committee of the College of Dominican Journalists de-
 nounced police infringement of activities by journalists during the postelectoral pe-
 riod. During the ensuing months, the authorities temporarily jailed a number of
 journalists, beat some, and damaged their equipment.
 Public and private universities enjoy broad academic freedom. The Government
 exerts no control over private universities except for the preservation of standards,
 and teachers appear to be free to voice their own theories without government over-
 s" it.
 Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these freedoms, which the Government generally respects in practice. The Govern-
 ment requires permits for outdoor public marches and meetings, and the authorities
 usually granted them. However, in the postelectoral period, the authorities pre-
 empted antigovernment demonstrations by illegally detaining organizers.
 Political parties freely affiliate with their foreign counterpart organizations. Pro-
 fessional organizations of lawyers, doctors, teachers, and others function freely and
 can maintain relations with counterpart international bodies of diverse political phi-
 losophies.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution prohibits discrimination on religious
 grounds, and the Government does not interfere with the free practice of religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens face no unusual legal restrictions on travel within or outside
 the country.
 In 1994 the authorities forcibly repatriated between several hundred to a few
 thousand Haitians believed to be in the country illegally, according to various
 scurces. Some of these were legal resident Haitians and persons of Haitian ancestry
 who may have claims to Dominican citizenship. The authorities did not allow the
 Haitians opportunity to establish their possible claims to legal residence. Although
 somewhat diminished in comparison with earlier years (see Section 6.c.), there was
 continued forced recruitment and detention of Haitians to work on sugar planta-
 tions.
 Since the 1991 coup in Haiti, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) accorded refugee status to 1,341 Haitians who fled to the Dominican Re-
 public. Although the Government began processing petitions for Dominican recogni-
 tion of the refugee status of the Haitian UNHCR wards in 1991, only 10 percent
 have been granted such status thus far.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the constitutional right to change their government in free and fair
 elections, but there were allegations of a level of fraua in the national elections
 which effectively infringed this right. Although people voted in record numbers in
 the May 16 elections, international observers identified significant irregularities, in-
 cluding the disfranchisement of tens of thousands of voters (primarily supporters of
 the leading opposition party), evidence of double voting, and voting by ineligible per-
 sons. An investigation commission appointed by the Central Electoral Board (an
 independent body appointed by the Senate with the approval of the major parties)
 largely confirmed the irregularities, noting that they placed in dispute a number of
 votes potentially larger than the margin of victory. Despite the irregularities, the
 Central Electoral Board declared incumbent President Joaquin Balaguer the winner
 by 22,000 votes.
 The Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD), led by presidential candidate Jose
 Francisco Pena Gomez, strongly resisted this decision, considering it an attempt to
 steal the election. Faced with an explosive political crisis, President Balaguer nego-
 tiated a political agreement with Pena Gomez, leaders of the next largest party, the
 Dominican Liberation Party (PLD), and other political and civil figures. The agree-
 ment included several constitutional reforms, most notably shortening Balaguer's
 new term to 18 months (meaning elections in November 1995) as well as prohibition
 of presidential reelection. In accordance with this pact, Congress ratified the Central
 Electoral Board's decision. However, the Congress, dominated by Balaguer's party,
 set the next presidential elections for May 1996, providing Balaguer a 2-year term.
 After boycotting the new Congress for a month in protest, the opposition legislators
 took their seats based on a promise of future political considerations.
 The Constitution calls for the President and all 150 members of the Senate and
 Chamber of Deputies to be elected every 4 years. Elections are by secret ballot with
 universal suffrage for citizens age 18 and above (except for active duty military and
 police, who may not vote). The President appoints the governors of the 29 provinces.
 Although the nation has a functioning multiparty system, in practice the Presi-
 dent dominates public policy formulation and implementation. He exercises his au-
 
 
 381
 thority through use of the veto, discretion to act by decree, and influence as the
 leader of his party. The Congress traditionally has had limited powers and seldom
 disapproves actions by the executive branch. The governing Reformed Christian So-
 cialist Party (PRSC) has a 2-vote working majority in the 30-seat Senate when it
 combines its 14 votes with 1 vote from the PLD and 1 vote from the Democratic
 Union. Similarly, in coalition with the PLD, it has a working plurality in the Cham-
 ber of Deputies. Four Senate races and eight deputy races were close enough that
 themay have been affected by the election irregularities in favor of the ruling
 Women and minorities confront no legal or practical impediments to political par-
 ticipation. Women hold 8 of the country's 29 appointed governorships, 5 cabinet-
 level executive branch positions, 14 seats in the 120-member House of Deputies, and
 1 seat in the Senate.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vesgation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Nongovernmental human rights organizations olrate freely without government
 interference. In addition to the Dominican Human Rights Committee (CDH, several
 other Haitian, church, and labor groups exist. The Government has been slow to ac-
 knowledge criticism and requests for information from some international human
 rights organizations. It has not responded to criticisms leveled by the U.N. Human
 Rights Commission in 1993 regarding treatment of Haitian refugees.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination based on race or sex. Such discrimination exists
 in society, but the Government has not acknowledged its existence or made efforts
 to combat it.
 Women.-Women traditionally have not shared equal social and economic status
 or opportunity with men, and men hold the overwhelming majority of leadership po-
 sitions in all sectors. In many instances, women are paid less than men in jobs of
 equal content and equal skill level. According to one study, women are the head of
 the household in 37 percent of the families in the capital. Either spouse can easily
 obtain a divorce, and women can hold property in their own names apart from their
 husbands. Congress did not act on legislative prposals introduced in 1993 to modify
 women's status under the Civil and Penal Code
 Domestic violence and sexual harassment are widespread. According to one re-
 port, approximately 7,000 rapes occur annually, but victims report only 1,500 to the
 police. Spousal abuse itself is not a crime, and is rarely reported.
 Dominican women are victims of rings which smuggle third world women to Eu-
 rope to work as prostitutes in conditions rife with exploitation and mistreatment.
 The Government does not vigorously enforce prostitution laws, but does periodically
 prosecute organized alien smuggling rings. Corruption and a reluctance to restrict
 emigration hinder enforcement of the law.
 Ciildren.-The Government has not supported its professed commitment to child
 welfare with financial or human resources. Despite the existence of government in-
 stitutions dedicated to child welfare, private social and religious organizations carry
 the principal burden. The most serious abuse involving children is the failure of the
 justice system to respect the status of minors in criminal cases; there are more than
 150 minors in the country's main prison. Especially in narcotics cases, the authori-
 ties sometimes treat minors as adults and incarcerate them in prisons rather than
 juvenile detention centers.
 According to local human rights monitors, the incidence of child abuse is
 underreported because of traditional beliefs that family problems should be handled
 within the family. Sporadic instances of Haitian child-labor on sugar plantations
 continued to occur (see Section 6.d.). A new Minor's Code went into effect on Janu-
 ary 1, 1995. The Code contains provisions against child abuse, including physical
 and emotional mistreatment, sexual exploitation, and child labor. It also provides
 for removal of a mistreated or delinquent child to a protective environment.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Dominicans are strongly prejudiced against
 Haitians, who constitute a significant percentage of the unskilled manual labor
 force. This often translates into discrimination against those with darker skin. In
 election campaigning, President Balaguers PRSC sought to undermine PRD can-
 didate Pena Gomez by characterizing the latter's dark skin as a Haitian attribute.
 The Government does not acknowledge the existence of this discrimination nor
 make any efforts to combat it. Dark-skinned Dominicans also face strong informal
 barriers to social and economic advancement.
 
 
 382
 
 Credible sources charge that the Government continues to refuse to recognize in-
 dividuals of Haitian ancestry born in the country as Dominican citizens, as it has
 for many years. Lack of documentation also sometimes hinders the ability of chil-
 dren of Haitian descent to attend school; some parents fail to seek documentation
 for fear of being deported.
 People With Disabilities.-Disabled persons encounter discrimination in employ-
 ment and the provision of other services. Although a September 1991 law mandates
 certain provisions for physical access for the disabled for all new public and private
 buildings, the authorities have not enforced it.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the freedom to orga-
 nize labor unions and also for the rights of workers to strike (and for private sector
 employers to lock out workers). All workers, except military and police, are free to
 organize and workers in all sectors exercise this right. Requirements for calling a
 strike include the support of an absolute majority of the workers of the company,
 a prior attempt to resolve the conflict through arbitration, written notification to the
 Labor Secretariat, and a 10-day waiting period following notification before proceed-
 ing with the strike. The 1992 Labor Code also eliminated previous prohibitions
 against political and sympathy strikes. The Government respects association rights
 and places no obstacles to union registration, affiliations, or the ability to engage
 in legal strikes. The Government has not established an adequate court system to
 enforce the Labor Code.
 A number of strikes occurred in 1994, principally in the public sector. The Labor
 Code specifies in detail the steps legally required to establish a union, federation,
 and confederation. The Code calls for automatic recognition of a union if the Govern-
 ment has not acted on its application within a specific time. In practice, the Govern-
 ment has readily facilitated recognition of labor organizations. Organized labor rep-
 resents between 10 and 15 percent of the work force and is divided among three
 large confederations, three minor confederations, and a number of independent
 unions. The International Labor Organization's Committee of Experts considers the
 two-thirds majority vote required to form confederations is too high.
 Unions are independent of the Government and political parties. Labor unions can
 and do freely affiliate regionally and internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Although collective bargain-
 ing is lawfu and may take place in firms in which a union has gained the support
 of an absolute majority of the workers, only a minority of companies have collective
 bargaining pacts. The Labor Code stipulates that workers cannot be dismissed be-
 cause of their trade union membership or activities. The previous Code allowed arbi-
 trary termination of a worker so long as severance pay was provided; the 1992 Code
 exempts from dismissal specific numbers of union organizers and officials. The num-
 ber of union organizers or officials given protection from layoffs can total up to 20
 members of a union in formation, between 5 and 10 members of a union executive
 council (depending on the size of the work force), and up to 3 members of a collective
 bargaining negotiating committee. The new Code established a new system of labor
 courts for dealing with labor disputes. The new courts are located in the two juris-
 dictions with the most labor activity, but the juridical problems which the courts
 were established to address still prevail in the rest of the country. Violations of free-
 dom of association, the minimum wage, and overtime pay continue.
 The State Sugar Council (CEA) employs workers from over 100 unions. Dominican
 workers predominate in the unions, although between two and five unions are Hai-
 tian-dominated. The CEA tolerates existing unions but has steadily resisted addi-
 tional union organizing activity.
 The Labor Code applies in the 26 established export processing zones (EPZ's) com-
 prised of over 400, mostly U.S.-owned or associate, companies employing more than
 170,000 workers, mostly women. In 1994 four EPZ companies concluded collective
 bargaining ag   ments with unions. Some EPZ corpanies have a history of dis-
 charging wor ers          mpt to organize unions,  though the Government reg-
 istered more than 50 unions in the EPZs since the new Labor Code went into effect
 in 1992, fewer than 10 of these unions still have their membership intact. Some
 unions apparently ceased to function due to firings of union members, while others
 may have dissolved because of voluntary resignations or company closure. The Sec-
 retariat of Labor has brought criminal charges against 55 EPZ firms for Labor Code
 violations involving worker rights. The courts found in favor of management in the
 majority of cases concluded. The unions won two cases. A number of cases were
 under appeal and others still pending at year's end.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor. During previous years, the Government and the CEA forcibly re-
 
 
 383
 cruited Haitian seasonal agcultural workers and then restricted them to specific
 sugar plantations. The CEA denied the use of paid recruiters inside Haiti to obtain
 workers, and there is no conclusive evidence that either practice occurred to any sig-
 nificant degree in 1994. There are no firm statistics on the number of cane cutters
 on CEA plantations; most estimates place the number at around 30 000. The CDHI
 reported an instance where recruiters contracted approximately 50O0 HIaitians under
 fals pretenses to work at the Rio Haina Sugar Mill As this year's harvest in the
 southern half of the country began, the Ministry of Labor estimated that the per-
 centage of migrant workers would drop to between 20 and 30 percent of the work-
 ers.
 Haitian sugar cane workers continued to encounter restrictions on their freedom
 of movement, but there were fewer reported instances than in the past. They in-
 cluded the presence of armed guards in and around various sugar plantations and
 the sequestering of workers' belongings in order to discourage their movement to
 other CEA plantations or other type of employment. The gvernment program to
 document temporary workers begun in 1992 has been extendto approxately 50
 percent of all itinerant Haitian workers. Haitians' "rht to work is thus documented,
 butaontractualobligationisalsoim       edforworkerstoremaiin a specific area
 for the duration of the work contract. Many Haitians d not understand the contrac-
 tual process, and work conditions tantamount to indentured servitude prevail. The
 CEA and the Dominican Office of Immigration initiated a program in late 1991 to
 issue 1-year temporary work permits to the workers. According to a 1993 survey by
 an independent polling firm, 50 percent of all itinerant Haitian workers possessed
 permits. There are no figures available on the number of forcibly repatriated Hai-
 tian cane and coffee workers, but the authorities continued to force repatriations at
 will, depending upon the demand for labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code prohibits employ-
 ment of youth under 14 years of age and places various restrictions on the employ-
 ment of youth under age 16. These restrictions include a limitation of no more than
 6 hours of daily work, no employment in dangerous occupations or jobs involving
 the provision of intoxicating beverages, and limitations on nighttime work.
 In practice, children remain at risk of exploitation since the Government does not
 enforce many of the child labor restrictions. During the past few years, the Labor
 Secretariat made some effort to enforce the law in cases where companies employed
 underage workers, but penalties were largely limited to small fines. Some young
 workers obtained work permits and continued their employment; employers dis-
 missed those unable to obtain permits. Numerous minors perform unregulated work
 as itinerant vendors shining shoes, selling newspapers, and cleaning cars.
 The CEA and the Labor Secretariat took steps to discourage child labor in CEA
 sugar plantations, and it occurred in only isolated instances, most involving children
 accompanying their fathers into the fields.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Constitution gives the Government legal
 authority to set minimum wage levels, and the Labor Code assigns this task to a
 national salary committee. Congress may also enact minimum wage legislation.
 Minimum wage raises have not compensated for the loss of purchasing power, and
 scheduled wage increases in 1994 only provided partial relief Most workers receive
 only the minimum wage, which averages around $90 per month (xxx pesos) depend-
 ing on the sector and employer size. The minimum wage represents only 20 percent
 of the estimated monthly cost of living for an average-size family in Santo Domingo.
 As a result, many people hold more than one job.
 The Labor Code establishes a standard work period of 8 hours per day and 44
 hours per week. The Code also stipulates that all workers are entitled to 36 hours
 of uninterrupted rest each week. The Code grants workers a 35 percent wage dif-
 ferential for work over 44 and up to 68 hours per week and a 100 percent differen-
 tial for any hours above 68 hours per week.
 Workplace safety and health conditions frequently do not meet legal standards,
 which the Dominican Social Security Institute (IDSS) and the Labor Code establish.
 Both the IDSS and the Labor Secretariat have small corps of inspectors charged
 with enforcing standards. However, these posts are customarily filled through politi-
 cal patronage, and some inspectors have earned a reputation for corruption. In prac-
 tice, workers cannot remove themselves from workplace situations without jeopardy
 to continued employment.
 Conditions for agricultural workers, particularly Haitians, are in general much
 worse, especially in the sugar industry. Although the CEA readily cooperates with
 nongovernmental organizations active in efforts to improve the conditions of sugar
 cane workers, in some cases the CEA and the Government have failed to take meas-
 ures to implement written agreements designed to overcome the problems facing
 sugar cane workers. Cane cutters on CEA plantations are paid by weight of cut cane
 
 
 384
 rather than hours worked and thus they must work significantly more hours than
 the standard workweek in order to earn a wage approaching that of workers in
 other industries. The CEA continued to violate the Labor Codes prohibition of pay-
 ment in noncash forms by paying field workers in vouchers. Cane cutters also faced
 widespread cheating during the weighing of their cut cane. Although the CEA and
 the Labor Secretariat signed an agreement with labor unions to allow union officials
 to assist the Labor Secretariat in the inspection and monitoring of CEA weigh sta-
 tions, they took no action to implement this agreement. Many worker villages which
 are predominantly inhabited by Haitians continue to suffer high rates of disease and
 a lack of education and medical facilities, running water, and sewage systems.
