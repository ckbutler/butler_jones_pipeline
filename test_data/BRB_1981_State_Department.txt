 BARBADOS
 
 Barbadians enjoy a free and democratic system. When
 Barbados' constitution was proclaimed on November 29,
 1966, its drafters noted the island's traditional
 attachment to free institutions and to independence.
 A parliament has sat in Barbados since 1639. A basic
 statement of the rights and privileges of Barbadians,
 known as the Charter of Barbados, was proclaimed in
 1652 and has been upheld by those governing the island.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is specifically prohibited by the constitution,
 and there have been no reports that it is practiced.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There have been no reports of any cruel, inhuman or
 degrading treatment or punishment. The constitution
 does not prohibit the death penalty, which can be
 levied for treason and murder. All three of those
 executed in the past five years had been convicted
 of murder. As of December 1981 there were six convicted
 murderers on death row. Prison conditions are humane.
 There have been no reports that prisoners are physically
 maltreated; food is adequate. Attorneys have ready
 access to their clients.
 c. Disappearances
 There have been no reports of disappearances.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprison-
 ment, and this prohibition is respected in practice.
 The right of habeas corpus is guaranteed and honored
 in practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The constitution provides that persons charged with
 a criminal offense be given a fair, public hearing
 within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial
 court. Defendants are presumed to be innocent until
 proven guilty. These guarantees are respected in
 practice.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The constitution prohibits arbitrary search or entry,
 and this is respected in practice.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 
 (42)
 
 
 343
 .The constitution guarantees freedom of speech, press,
 religion-and assembly, and they -are honored in practice.
 The two regular newspapers and one radio station function
 independently:of the government. Government ownership
 and operation of the Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation
 radio and television service, modeled after the British
 Broadcasting Corporation, leaves the government open
 to charges of interference in the media, but these
 charges are rare.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There areno impediments to free movement of citizens
 or legal residents within or without Barbados. The
 constitution guarantees the right to move freely through-
 out the country, to reside anywhere in Barbados, to
 enter and leave Barbados and to be exempt from expulsion.
 Barbados has had a limited number of refugees and
 requests for asylum, and these are handled on a case-
 by-case basis. Barbados has been generous in its
 treatment of those whose applications are denied.
 In at least one-known case it granted a refugee a
 one-year temporary visa after his application for
 asylum was denied, in order to allow him to make alternate
 arrangements. The government recently announced the
 establishment Of an immigration committee, indicating
 'that it may attempt to revise the way refugee cases
 are processed.
 C. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There are no impediments to participation in the political
 -process. There is no discrimination based on race
 or sex. Labor unions function freely and are active
 politically. They participate in the political process
 and constitute the power base of two major political
 parties. Barbados is a signatory to the Convention
 on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
 against Women adopted by the United Nations in December
 1979. There is no legislation that discriminates
 against women, who are active in all aspects of national
 life. One cabinet member is a woman, and women are
 well-represented at all levels in both the public
 and private sectors.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 There have been no reports of human rights violations
 in Barbados or requests by human rights groups either
 within or without the country to investigate allegations.
 Barbados favors strengthening the human rights machinery
 of the United Nations and the Organization of American
 States. The government favors more investigations
 of alleged violations of human rights in other countries
 and increased use of fact-finding or observer teams to
 monitor controversial political and electoral situations.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 A tradition of political stability and prudent economic
 management has helped to place Barbados fifth on the
 World Bank list of developing countries in terms of
 per capita income. Barbados had a 1980 gross national
 product per qapita of $3,040. However, after five
 
 89-510 0 - 82 - 23
 
 
 344
 years of solid economic growth, Barbados is now facing
 the prospect of an economic downturn caused by a combination
 of a 1981 sugar crop shortfall, continued increase
 in world petroleum prices and a simultaneous decrease
 in local petroleum production, which currently amounts
 to 25 percent of local consumption. To counter the
 anticipated decline in output and deterioration of
 the balance of payments situation, the government
 has announced a series of corrective measures to avert
 a potential economic crisis..
 The 1966 proclamation of the constitution called for
 the government to promote the general welfare of the
 citizens of Barbados through equitable distribution
 of wealth. Both past and present governments have
 pursued that goal as a means to wipe out pockets of
 poverty while respecting private property. The ruling
 Barbados Labour Party in June 1981 committed itself
 to several public welfare goals, including improvements
 in public housing and community centers and an overhaul
 of the somewhat regressive tax system.
 Citizens have long enjoyed access to public and private
 educational systems, and the adult literacy rate is
 estimated at 99 percent. The government has embarked
 on a program of expanding the secondary school system
 to ensure that sufficient facilities exist for pupils
 leaving the primary system.
 Adequate medical care is available to all residents
 through local clinics and hospitals under the government's
 health program. There is one doctor for every 1500
 people. Average life expectancy for the Barbadians
 is 70.8 years. Infant mortality is 28.3 per 1000
 births. Government health insurance programs cover
 all Barbadians. The government is attempting to meet
 shelter needs through its low-cost housing program.
 Overall, Barbadians are well housed. Land ownership,
 however, is highly concentrated, with ten percent
 of the population owning over 95 percent of the total.
 The government has devoted over 60 percent of its
 operating budget and almost 30 percent of its capital
 budget to the fulfillment of vital needs. It also
 contributes to the direct provision of essential goods
 and services through its involvement in statutory
 boards and corporations, such as the Barbados marketing
 corporation, intended to guarantee distribution of
 agricultural products at reasonable prices; the public
 assistance board, which provides for the indigent;
 and the child care boards.
