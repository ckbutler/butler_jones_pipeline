 IRAN*
 Iran is officially an Islamic Republic under the leadership of
 Ayatollah Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini. Its formal system, based
 on the Constitution approved in 1980 by popular referendum,
 follows a parliamentary pattern with a legislature, the
 Majles, and a president elected from among multiple candidates
 by universal suffrage. However, only candidates meeting
 highly restrictive religious and political criteria are
 permitted to contest elections, and the choice offered to
 voters is limited. The regime's hold on power is reinforced
 through arrests, executions, and other forms of intimidation.
 The regime is dominated by a political elite composed of a
 group of Shi'a Muslim clerics who support Khomeini and of
 laymen aligned with these clerics. The regime, however, is
 not monolithic, and there are major differences on theology
 and on economic issues such as private property ownership,
 government versus private control of foreign trade, industrial
 policy, and strategy for the war with Iraq.
 The war with Iraq, which began in September 1980, continues
 with little hope for an end in the near future, given the
 Iranian regimes lack of interest in negotiating a
 settlement. The war has been costly to both sides. Iran
 claims that over 100,000 of its soldiers have been killed and
 that the war has created about 1 million refugees. Missile
 and bombing attacks have caused considerable damage to
 civilian areas and loss of civilian life. An insurgency in
 Kurdish areas began about 6 years ago and continues. Urban
 terrorists cause civilian casualties and property damage in
 often random bomb attacks.
 Nearly 7 years after the 1979 ouster of the Shah and the
 advent of the Islamic Revolution, the Iranian regime still
 considers itself revolutionary but must grapple with the need
 to revive the economy and operate political and social
 institutions, both new and old, in a productive manner. Iran
 is an oil-rich developing country. The disruptions of the
 revolutionary period caused serious economic deterioration.
 After improving somewhat in the preceding 2 years, the economy
 again declined in 1985. Inflation and unemployment are high,
 and corruption and black market activities flourish.
 Although the trend is toward greater adherence to
 constitutional guarantees of human rights, particularly since
 December 1982, Iran's human rights record continues to show
 serious abuses.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Reliable statistics are not available on the number of people
 killed for political or religious reasons. Due to the lack of
 procedural safeguards for defendants tried in revolutionary
 courts, which handle virtually all political cases, most of
 the hundreds of executions ordered each year by such courts
 amount to summary executions. It is difficult to separate
 * Because of the absence of a United States Mission in Iran,
 this report draws heavily on unofficial sources.
 
 
 1235
 IRAN
 cases of executions for actual participation in violent
 activities or narcotics trafficking from cases of executions
 based purely on the defendants' beliefs, statements, or
 associations, given the regime's practice of cloaking the
 latter category with trumped-up charges from the former
 category, but the number of purely political executions in
 1985 reportedly includes dozens of persons arrested during
 demonstrations and summarily executed. At least 6 Baha'is
 were killed for religious reasons in 1985.
 Amnesty International's 1985 annual report recorded an
 estimated 6,108 executions for all causes in Iran between
 February 1979 and the end of 1984; the report noted, however,
 that "Amnesty International believed the true figures were
 much higher, as former prisoners and relatives of prisoners
 consistently testified that large numbers of political
 prisoners were executed in secret."
 Political killings were also perpetrated by opposition groups,
 including the Mojahedin-e-Khalq, a terrorist organization
 sometimes known as the People's Mojahedin Organization of
 Iran. The Mojahedin have claimed responsibility for
 assassinations with firearms, and dozens of innocent persons,
 including a 4-year-old girl, were killed in 1985 by bombs
 exploded in public places. The Mojahedin are also believed
 responsible for bombs delivered, and in some cases exploded,
 at Iranian diplomatic missions in other countries.
 Killings related to the insurrection in the Kurdish area also
 continue. Although there are no reliable statistics, many
 deaths have resulted not only from fighting between dissident
 Kurdish groups and the regime and from regime forces' summary
 executions of Kurds in captured territory, but also as a
 result of internecine fighting among Kurdish groups.
 b. Disappearance
 Disappearances are seldom permanent in Iran. People are
 arbitrarily arrested or carried off, they are held without
 charge, and some are summarily executed; the society, however,
 is not tightly controlled, so a persistent relative can
 usually determine who was responsible for the arrest and
 locate the detainee. Although many relatives are not
 officially informed of executions, they seem to find out and
 can often confirm rumor by checking burial records at Tehran's
 cemetery.
 There are, however, some cases of long-term disappearance.
 One report obtained by Amnesty International stated that
 sometimes opposition members are listed as "killed while
 resisting arrest" when in fact they are still alive and in
 jail. Most such arrests are believed to be the work of the
 Revolutionary Guard and to be sanctioned by the regime.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Stories of torture in Iran's prisons are rampant and cover a
 wide range of inhuman practices, particularly in Evin Prison
 in Tehran, Iran's largest and most notorious. Mock executions
 are a favorite method of torture there, along with
 blindfolding and solitary confinement. Beatings of all kinds
 appear to be common. Prisoners are beaten on the soles of
 
 
 1236
 IRAN
 their feet until they can no longer walk. Others have had
 damaged kidneys as a result of being kicked and beaten.
 This torture occurs in government prisons or in government
 houses in which prisoners of special interest are held for
 questioning. Presumably it takes place with the sanction of
 top officials. Many of these reports come from individuals
 who themselves were in the prisons and who, in some cases,
 experienced the torture.
 The regime continues to revise Iran's civil code to conform
 more closely with its interpretation of Islamic law. In
 January the Government announced the development and
 inauguration of a new machine for surgical amputation of the
 hands of convicted thieves. As interpreted in Iran, this
 punishment consists of amputation of the four fingers of the
 right hand. There were subsequent announcements of the
 occasional use of this device. Death by stoning reportedly
 has been reinstituted as a punishment for certain crimes
 against morality, at least in the city of Kerman. There are
 many reports of floggings, both as a means of torture and as a
 formal punishment for sexual offenses.
 The jails are grossly overcrowded. Toilet facilities are
 inadequate or totally lacking. Medical treatment is not
 available, unless the guards believe a prisoner will break and
 "confess" if enticed by treatment of his wounds. Food is
 inadequate and sometimes full of dirt and bugs.
 In its report, "Torture in the Eighties," Amnesty
 International expressed concern that torture has become a
 routine practice in at least some Iranian prisons and noted in
 particular two kinds of ill-treatment of prisoners: the
 officially sanctioned punishment of prisoners by whipping, and
 the torture of prisoners held in incommunicado detention
 during interrogation to extract confessions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arrests for expression of views critical of or different from
 those of the Government have decreased during the past 3
 years, in part because of the widespread fear of arrest. If
 there is a formal accusation, the charge is usually
 subversion, antiregime activities, or treason. There is also
 evidence that some persons are arrested on trumped-up criminal
 charges (for example, on drug charges) when their actual
 "offenses" are political; the lack of fair trials and other
 procedural safeguards encourages such a practice. Political
 arrests are made by members of the Revolutionary Guard or,
 less commonly, by Komiteh members. Regular police and
 gendarmes are normally not involved in arrests made on
 political or morals charges. In political cases, there
 normally are no warrants for arrest. There is no judicial
 determination of the legality of detention in Iranian law.
 Detainees are frequently held for long periods without charge
 and in some cases have been tortured, only to have the mullah
 (Muslim cleric) who supervises the prison apologize
 subsequently for the mistake. For political crimes, no access
 to a lawyer is permitted; such cases are heard, if at all, by
 the revolutionary judiciary. Bail is not permitted in
 political cases.
 Although the Constitution does guarantee many basic human
 rights, including rights related to due process (e.g., the
 
 
 1237
 IRAN
 right to be informed in writing of charges immediately after
 arrest, the right to legal counsel, the right to trial by jury
 in political cases), the revolutionary court system ignores
 these provisions in practice. There are no reliable estimates
 of the number of persons'arbitrarily arrested in 1985, but the
 number is probably in the thousands.
 Persons suspected of involvement in antiregime activities are
 all subject to the same procedures. They are arrested by
 Revolutionary Guard or Komiteh members. Those suspected of
 minor offenses are held for questioning at local Revolutionary
 Guard offices. Sometimes they are released after several
 hours or several days, a process that may be repeated two or
 three times before the authorities decide the detainee is
 innocent or that he is guilty and should be jailed. Other
 suspects are taken directly to one of the prisons where they
 may be held for weeks, months, or even years prior to being
 released or executed. Some who have been released report
 being called for questioning on several different occasions.
 In some cases a mullah is involved, in others unidentified
 questioners, sometimes including torturers. It is also
 unclear whether this questioning constitutes a trial by a
 revolutionary court or whether it is part of the investigative
 process.
 Information as to whether forced labor is used in Iran is
 unavailable.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Most of those arrested have a trial of some sort, but,
 although so-called trials of major opposition figures are
 sometimes telecast, no trial'by a revolutionary court can be
 called fair or public. If the trial is given publicity, it is
 generally because the prisoner has already been forced to
 confess to crimes. Restraints on arbitrary actions of the
 revolutionary courts were reportedly severely weakened in 1985
 by a decision to limit the review authority of the Supreme
 Court. Formerly, all cases decided by the revolutionary
 courts were subject to review by the Supreme Court, permitting
 improper decisions to be overturned, but under the new
 decision the Supreme Court can only examine those cases which
 are recommended for review by the Supreme Judicial Council,
 which consists of the Chief Justice, the Prosecutor General,
 and three mullahs.
 For common criminal offenses, many elements of the
 prerevolutionary judicial system survive, and the accused
 often have the right to a public trial with benefit of lawyers
 of their own choosing, assuming they can afford the fee. Even
 this judiciary is not fully independent. Many of the former
 judges were retired after the revolution, and new judges
 selected. One criterion for new judges is grounding in
 Islamic law, and political acceptability is an absolute
 requirement for any government position. Assignment of cases
 to regular rather than revolutionary courts is haphazard and
 apparently occurs mainly when arrests are made by regular
 police. Favorable verdicts reportedly can often be
 "purchased" from the judges serving on civil and criminal
 courts and to a lesser degree from judges of revolutionary
 courts.
 
 
 IRAN
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government is attempting to remake Iranian society
 according to Khomeini's interpretation of Shi'a Islam. It
 rejects the Western distinction between a public sphere which
 the Government may control and a sphere of private'life
 (religion, culture, thought, and private behavior) which the
 State may not properly control. The regime defines itself as
 Islamic and attempts to enforce a way of life asserted to be
 Islamic.
 Since Khomeini's eight-point decree of December 1982, Iranians
 have enjoyed greater freedom in their private life. One of
 the eight points was that no one had the right to enter
 private homes without a warrant. An exception was made for
 suspected hideouts of opposition groups. The decree did say
 that if Revolutionary Guards entered a home believing it to be
 an opposition hideout and found they had made a mistake, they
 were to depart, even if they had found evidence of un-Islamic
 activities such as the presence of alcoholic beverages. The
 decree also stated that mail should not be opened nor
 telephones tapped unless there was good reason to suspect
 antiregime activities. Homes are still entered, mail is still
 opened, and phones are still tapped, but much less so than
 previously. Moreover, Iranians now have a decree by Khomeini
 on which to base complaints. A Headquarters for the
 Enforcement of the Imam's Decree was set up, as were a number
 of provincial and local offices. These offices, which may
 still be in operation, received thousands of complaints about
 violations of rights of privacy.
 Special Revolutionary Guard units check on social activities.
 Women whose clothing does not completely cover the hair and
 all of the body except hands and face, or who wear make-up,
 are subject to arrest. If they are, in the words of the
 Prosecutor General, "reformable," they may be lectured and
 released. If considered defiant, they may go to jail.
 The schools are reportedly used by the regime to assure that
 students' families behave in an "acceptable, Islamic manner."
 Children are asked about the habits of their parents, and
 un-Islamic behavior is reported to Revolutionary Guard units.
 Neighborhood Komitehs, which originally acted as "block
 wardens," monitoring activities of residents, seem to be less
 active now. There have been efforts to disband them and many
 may have in fact disappeared.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution states that "publications and the press may
 express ideas freely, except when they are contrary to Islamic
 principles, or are detrimental to public rights." In
 practice, most publications are controlled by the Government
 or by the Islamic Republican Party, and the remaining
 independent publishers run the risk not only of press
 shutdowns and confiscation of publications and equipment but
 of arrest and summary punishment if they are overly critical
 of the regime. Examples of such punishments were sufficiently
 numerous in past years to retain a chilling effect. All books
 are required to be submitted to the Ministry of Islamic
 
 
 1239
 IRAN
 Guidance for censorship before they can be published.
 Publishers, authors, and printers also engage in substantial
 "self-censorship" before submitting books to the Ministry, due
 to the substantial penalties, including economic losses,
 incurred when books are rejected.
 Closure in June of the radical daily newspaper Azadegan was
 extensively criticized by the press, and the paper's
 publishers were later permitted to publish a new daily,
 Abrar. While there are competing newspapers in Iran, and
 officials and policies of the Government are often subjected
 to public criticism, newspapers must be supportive of
 Khomeini's concept of the Islamic Republic, and they do not
 criticize Khomeini or key policies. Nevertheless, some
 independent publishers out of favor with the regime continued
 to survive in 1985, and some books and pamphlets critical of
 the regime were published without reprisal. All broadcasting
 facilities are government-owned.
 Academic freedom has increased in the last 3 years.
 Universities have reopened and are under looser constraints.
 The regime remains committed, however, to the elimination of
 all un-Islamic influences, and textbooks are reviewed to
 determine their acceptability. Foreign books, newspapers, and
 magazines either are not permitted or may be imported only
 after review.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.
 Although the Constitution permits unarmed assemblies and
 marches "provided they do not violate the principles of
 Islam," the only ones permitted in practice are those
 sponsored by the Government, such as Friday prayers and
 sermons and parades on official occasions. As in the past,
 there were numerous cases during 1985 of outbursts of public
 protest, but these were forcibly dispersed, and hundreds were
 arrested and dozens reportedly executed during the year for
 taking part in such demonstrations. The Constitution permits
 parties, groups, professional associations, and both Islamic
 and minority religious associations, but most independent
 organizations have either been banned or are moribund.
 Restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly discouraged the
 participation in the 1984 parliamentary elections of any party
 other than the semiofficial Islamic Republican Party (IRP).
 Only IRP candidates were permitted to run in the 1985
 presidential election, although at least two other legal
 parties exist.
 There were until recently no legal labor unions, although some
 unauthorized unions had been organized and were active.
 However, a new national labor union, the "Islamic Union," was
 reportedly created in late 1985 under a law enacted by the
 Majles. All economic concerns with a minimum of 50 employees
 are permitted to have a branch of the new union, whose goal is
 said to be to protect workers' interests and further their
 professional development. Nominally independent, it
 reportedly will be controlled by the Labor Ministry.
 It is also believed that there are officially sanctioned
 "Islamic workers councils" in some factories. These, however,
 are more instruments of government control than bodies that
 represent workers' interests, although they have frequently
 been able to block layoffs or firings of workers. Several
 short-lived strikes in 1984 were dealt with severely. The
 
 
 1240
 IRAN
 leaders of a soft-drink plant workers' strike were reportedly
 arrested and executed. Other major strikes, involving steel
 workers in late 1984 and petroleum refinery workers in late
 1984 and early 1985, reportedly were settled peacefully.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Iran terms itelf an Islamic republic, and religion is closely
 intertwined with government. Grand Ayatollah Khomeini is
 recognized as the supreme leader, and this position is viewed
 as having something akin to divine sanction. The President
 and many other top officials are mullahs (religious leaders),
 as are the Speaker of the Majles and nearly half the Majles
 deputies.
 Approximately 90 percent of Iranians are Shi'a Muslims. Aside
 from slightly over 1 percent who are non-Muslims (Baha'is,
 Christians, Zoroastrians, and Jews), the rest are Sunni
 Muslims. The Sunnis, who are mostly non-Persians--Kurds,
 Arabs, Turkomans, Baluch, and other ethnic minorities--tend to
 be located in remote tribal areas. Their political influence
 is very limited. The Constitution declares that "the official
 religion of Iran is Islam and the sect followed is Ja'fari
 Shi'ism," but it also states that "other Islamic denominations
 shall enjoy complete respect." Although Sunnis have
 encountered religious discrimination on the local level and in
 many cases persecution based on ethnic origin, the regime has
 made efforts to reduce Shi'a-Sunni antagonism.
 Tests of Islamic knowledge and orthodoxy, required in the
 early postrevolutionary years for public or semipublic
 employment and enrollment in higher education, have been
 dropped in recent years on the grounds that they conflict with
 the constitutional provision that "the interrogation of people
 regarding their beliefs is forbidden." This provision is
 ignored, however, in the treatment of members of the Baha'i
 faith.
 The Baha'i religion is not recognized in Iran, and since the
 revolution the Baha'is, Iran's largest non-Muslim minority
 (300,000-350,000 members), have suffered severe persecution,
 mainly government-directed and aimed at the religious
 leadership. Baha'i property has been confiscated, shrines
 demolished, businesses disbanded or confiscated, and known
 Baha'is denied public-sector employment. These measures
 effectively deny employment to most urban Baha'is. Much of
 the Baha'i religious leadership has been arrested, as have
 many ordinary Baha'is. Charges are vague; "crimes against
 God," "corruption on earth," "warring against God," and
 "Zionism" are among the most frequent. The real reason for
 the arrests seems to be advocacy of Baha'ism. As of December,
 1985, 767 Baha'is were in jail. Approximately 200 Baha'is
 have been executed or have died following torture since the
 beginning of the revolutionary period, at least 6 during 1985.
 In August 1983, the Prosecutor General issued an order that
 effectively bans all Baha'i religious activity and provides
 the legal foundation on which virtually all members of the
 faith could be charged with crimes. Participation by Baha'is
 in social welfare organizations is forbidden, their businesses
 are outlawed, and teaching of the faith, even by parents to
 children in the home, is not permitted. Although the Baha'i
 national leaders dissolved the community's organizations in
 
 
 1241
 IRAN
 obedience to the Prosecutor General's edict, they were
 subsequently arrested, and at least some were executed.
 The small Christian, Jewish, and Zoroastrian (the pre-Islamic
 religion of Iran) populations are concentrated mainly in urban
 areas. Their religions are recognized by the Constitution,
 and they elect representatives to seats reserved for them in
 the Majles. They are permitted to practice their religions,
 to instruct their children, and, although with a great deal of
 disruptive interference, to maintain schools. There continue
 to be reports of officially sanctioned discrimination against
 these minorities, particularly in the areas of employment and
 public accommodations, and of severe discrimination by the
 Government against Muslims who have converted to Christianity.
 The Constitution states that recognized religious minorities
 shall be free in matters related to teaching and that the
 teaching of ethnic-language literature is permitted. Armenian
 schools, closed during much of 1984 due to the Government's
 insistence that they could not use the Armenian language for
 instruction, reopened in late 1984 after an informal
 compromise was reached, but their status remains precarious.
 Jewish groups report fewer such problems because the language
 spoken in Jewish homes and informally among Jews is Farsi.
 Jews, however, are subject to travel restrictions which are
 not applied to members of other recognized religious groups.
 In parts of Iran, Zoroastrians reportedly are considered
 "unclean" and are required to warn barbers, launderers, and
 restaurant owners that their service will be for "unclean"
 people, so that they can decide whether to serve such clients.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Iranians may travel to any part of Iran, except for the war
 zone on the border with Iraq and, in times of heavy fighting,
 some Kurdish areas. Such limitations as exist are for
 purposes of military security. Persons may also change their
 place of residence without obtaining permission.
 Travel outside Iran is considerably easier than before the
 spring of 1983. Khomeini's decree of December 1982 included
 the right to travel abroad. Prior to that time passports and
 exit visas had been difficult to obtain. Males of draft age
 are not issued exit visas except for approved courses of
 study, and Iranians who are politically suspect, such as some
 retired military officers and high level public officials
 under the former regime, may not be able to leave. Also
 denied exit visas are persons who have not repaid loans
 obtained from development banks under the old regime.
 Reportedly some Iranians, particularly those with skills in
 short supply and who were educated at government expense, are
 required to post bonds to obtain exit visas. Jewish Iranians
 are permitted to obtain passports and to travel, but they are
 normally denied the multiple-exit visas given to most Iranians
 and must make a fresh application (with a fresh fee) for each
 planned trip. Permission is not normally given for all
 members of a given Jewish family to travel outside Iran at the
 same time. Baha'is are not permitted to obtain passports or
 to leave the country.
 With the exception of some with close ties to the former
 regime, Iranians are generally able to return after long
 
 
 1242
 IRAN
 periods abroad without reprisal. Not all citizens who leave,
 however, are guaranteed the right to return. Iranians
 suspected of close association with the old regime have
 encountered problems obtaining new passports, and there are
 unconfirmed reports that a few were arrested in 1985 on their
 return. However, numerous other immediate relatives of
 persons wanted by the regime seem able to live in Iran, travel
 outside, and return without undue difficulty, and in recent
 years many who fled at the time of the revolution have
 returned and have sought, through the Iranian judicial system,
 the return of their properties.
 Iranian passports have always been stamped "not valid for
 emigration" but the Government does not make a clear
 distinction between legal residence in another country and
 emigration. According to the regulations, Iranians with a
 legal residence outside Iran may be issued passports and
 advance exit visas by the Iranian embassy, consulate, or
 interests section in their country of residence. Iranians who
 have acquired U.S. citizenship are considered Iranian (in
 effect dual nationals) unless they have formally renounced
 their Iranian citizenship in accordance with Iranian law.
 Dual nationals have complained that the Iranian Interests
 Section in Washington, D.C., will neither give them visas in
 their U.S. passports nor issue them Iranian passports and exit
 visas on the grounds that their residence in the U.S. is not
 legal because, according to Iranian law, they emigrated
 illegally. Although such services may be denied, there are no
 known instances of the denial of Iranian citizenship to
 Iranians who left Iran, or to those who have remained there.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Iran is ruled by a group of religious leaders and their lay
 associates who share belief in Ayatollah Khomeini as the
 supreme leader of the revolution and in the legitimacy and
 desirability of a theocratic state based on his interpretation
 of Shi'a Islam. Of Iran's political parties, only the Islamic
 Republican Party is represented in the Government, and most
 high-level government officials belong to it. Roughly half
 the winning candidates in the 1984 Majles elections were
 members; the remainder were elected as independents.
 Beginning a year after the Shah's departure, the revolutionary
 regime has held elections at fairly regular intervals for
 President, Majles deputies, members of the Council of Experts
 (responsible for choosing Khomeini's successor), and members
 of local government councils. All elections have been hard
 fought, generally with several candidates for every position.
 All candidates must be approved by the Council of Guardians,
 however, and only those meeting the Council's vaguely
 described political and religious criteria may run. In
 practice, only supporters of the theocratic state are
 accepted. There has, however, been considerable diversity of
 opinion among candidates on economic and social questions.
 A presidential election was held in 1985, but the Council of
 Guardians denied certification as candidates to 51 of 54
 applicants. Only the incumbent President, Hojjatollah Ali
 Khamenei (Secretary General of the IRP), and two fellow
 members of the IRP were permitted to run. The President was
 reelected with a reported 87 percent majority, with both his
 majority and the level of voter participation lower than in
 the 1981 election.
 
 
 1243
 IRAN
 The independence of the Majles is enshrined in the
 Constitution and exists to a large degree in practice. While
 Majles deputies are typically allied with various powerful
 poltical and religious officials, they may speak and vote
 independently and may shift from one faction to another. The
 Majles holds genuine debates, normally broadcast live on
 radio, on a wide variety of issues but not, however, including
 central issues such as the war or the fundamental character of
 the Islamic Republic. In some cases, laws proposed by the
 Government have been voted down. Prime Minister Musavi was
 heavily criticized before and after the presidential election,
 and there were public calls for his replacement. Following
 Khomeini's expression of support for Musavi's continuation in
 office, the Majles voted to reconfirm him, but 40 percent of
 the deputies voted against him or abstained. In October,
 after Khomeini convoked Majles deputies and informed them of
 his desire for the rapid approval of Musavi's new Cabinet, the
 deputies voted independently on the proposed ministers,
 approving 22 ministers by widely varying margins but rejecting
 2 incumbent ministers. On several previous occasions the
 Prime Minister's nominees to fill ministerial vacancies were
 rejected. Rejection of bills and officials by the Majles is
 accepted by the executive branch.
 The Constitution provides for a Council of Guardians composed
 of 12 members, 6 clerics unilaterally appointed by Khomeini,
 and 6 lay members well-grounded in Islamic law who are
 nominated by the head of the Judicial Council subject to the
 Majles' approval. The Council of Guardians must certify all
 bills passed by the Majles as being in accordance with Islamic
 law and the Constitution. If bills fail to be certified, they
 are sent back to the Majles for revision. They cannot become
 law until passed by the Majles and certified by the Council.
 The Council has rejected various important bills and portions
 of bills passed by the Majles, including legislation on land
 reform, foreign trade, private enterprise, the press code, and
 reform of the civil code.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The regime in Iran is disdainful of foreign human rights
 groups, government-sponsored or independent. A team of
 experts appointed by the U.N. Secretary General investigated
 conditions in prisoner-of-war (POW) camps in Iran and Iraq in
 January. There have been no other visits by any humanitarian
 group in recent years aside from the International Committee
 of the Red Cross (ICRC), which has also visited Iraqi POW's
 and has assisted in several small-scale POW exchanges between
 Iran and Iraq. There are no internal human rights groups. At
 its 1984 and 1985 sessions, the U.N. Human Rights Commission
 voted to appoint a special rapporteur on the human rights
 situation in Iran. The Government has refused to allow him
 entry to prepare his reports.
 The ICRC has had access to some POW's, but not to all of those
 believed held in Iran. In a special appeal to the Permanent
 Representatives to the United Nations in Geneva in November
 1984, President Hay of the ICRC stated that "... the repeated
 and systematic nature of the Iranian violations of the Third
 Geneva Convention is so serious that the ICRC feels that if it
 did not have recourse to this exceptional measure, it would
 jeopardize by its silence not only the lives of tens of
 
 
 1244
 IRAN
 thousands of men, but also the very future of humanitarian
 law." The U.N. Secretary General's report issued in February
 criticized conditions in prison camps in both Iran and Iraq.
 Iran was the subject of a critical paragraph in the 1985
 report of the International Labor Organization's Committee on
 the Application of Conventions and Recommendations. Focusing
 on the treatment of Baha'is and others, the committee
 expressed concern over Iran's continued failure to comply with
 the Convention on Discrimination in Occupation and called upon
 the Government to ensure a policy consistent with the
 convention.
 Amnesty International has written to Iranian officials,
 including Khomeini, protesting violations of human rights in
 Iran, but has received no reply. In its 1985 Report, Amnesty
 International expressed concern over the large number of
 executions, allegations of torture and other forms of
 ill-treatment of prisoners, the imprisonment of prisoners of
 conscience, denial of fair trial to political prisoners, and
 religious persecution, particularly of Baha'is. Freedom House
 rates Iran "partly free" and explains this upgrading of its
 rating previous to 1984 in terms of the improvement in the
 electoral and parliamentary processes and in the right to
 privacy.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 There are no reliable statistics for the postrevolutionary
 period. The following World Bank economic and social
 indicators should be taken as rough estimates based in large
 part on statistics from the mid-1970's. In 1985, the
 population was about 45.2 million with a population growth
 rate of 3.1 percent. The gross national product (GNP) in 1982
 was estimated at $66.5 billion, $1,620 per capita. This
 represents a sharp drop from the 1977 GNP of $77.8 billion and
 per capita GNP of $2,160, particularly when inflation is taken
 into account. The economy improved modestly in 1983 but
 stagnated in 1984 and declined in 1985.
 Nearly all export income comes from petroleum. Oil exports
 averaged about 1.6 million barrels per day for most of 1985,
 approximately the same as in 1984 but significantly below the
 average of 1.9 million barrels per day in 1983. This amount
 was sufficient, in combination with a major drawdown of
 foreign currency reserves, to permit the import of food and
 other essential civilian items and of enough war materiel to
 maintain the war against Iraq. Acute and worsening shortages
 of foreign exchange nevertheless prevented adequate imports of
 industrial raw materials, machinery, and spare parts and
 contributed to a decline in industrial production, already at
 less than half the prerevolutionary level. Luxury items are
 often difficult to find, and there are still shortages of
 essential items, but most items are available, at inflated
 prices, on the black market. Support for the regime comes
 mainly from the urban lower classes, and the Government has
 attempted to see that the basic needs of this group are met.
 While all classes have suffered from electricity and water
 shortages in the cities, economic problems have been more
 severe for the middle- and upper-income groups who formerly
 enjoyed lives of comparative luxury.
 The Iranian labor law, which exempts agriculture, domestic
 service, family businesses, and, to some extent, other small

 businesses, forbids employment of minors under 12 years and
 places special restrictions on the employment of minors under
 18 and of women. Under the law, women and minors may not be
 used for hard labor or, in general, for night work. The labor
 law also establishes a 6-day work week of 48 hours maximum
 (except for overtime at premium rates), with 1 day of rest
 (normally Friday) per week as well as at least 12 days per
 year of leave with pay and a number of paid public holidays.
 Legal provisions have also been made for minimum wages and
 regarding health and safety in workplaces. Given the large
 segments of the economy exempted from the labor law, the
 State's still unresolved administrative disorganization
 resulting from the revolution, the effects of the war with
 Iraq, and the general lack of labor unions which are both
 legal and effective, it is unclear to what extent the
 provisions of Iran's labor law actually affect most of the
 labor force. Despite the war, unemployment is high, probably
 in the 30 percent range.
 Life expectancy at birth is 61.1 years, and the infant death
 rate is 112 per 1,000 live births. The adult literacy rate
 was 36.2 percent in 1976. The primary school enrollment ratio
 in 1982 was 81.3 percent (93.7 per cent for boys but only 68.3
 percent for girls). Universities were closed in 1980-81 but
 have reopened, with attendance reportedly at record levels in
 1985.
 Ultraconservative dress, entirely hiding the hair and all of
 the body except the face and hands, is now an absolute
 requirement for all women, regardless of their religion,
 national origin, citizenship, or diplomatic status. Women are
 harassed, detained, or physically attacked if they appear in
 public in clothing which official or self-appointed guardians
 of public morality deem insufficiently modest. Harassment of
 women intensified in Tehran during two weeks of demonstrations
 in April by radical supporters of the regime demanding
 stricter enforcement of the Islamic dress requirements. The
 President, reacting to spreading violence, ordered the
 demonstrations to cease. Employment opportunities for women
 are more restricted than was the case under the Shah. Women
 are legally barred from being judges. Although there are
 cultural barriers making employment in professional level
 positions difficult to obtain, women do work as lawyers,
 physicians, and statisticians, and in other professions in
 both the public and private sectors. Four women serve as
 deputies in the Majles.
 The Family Protection Act, passed under the Shah, was revoked
 by the Islamic Government and replaced by a civil code
 reflecting Islamic law. A bill passed in mid-1983 did,
 however, give women the right to divorce their husbands, and
 regulations announced in 1984 substantially broadened, to 12,
 the number of grounds for which a woman may seek divorce. A
 husband may still obtain a divorce without having to state a
 reason or go to court. The new marriage regulations provide
 for improved financial settlements for wives whose husbands
 divorce them.
