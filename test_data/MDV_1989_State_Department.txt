 MALIV1ES
 The Republic of Maldives has a parliamentary form of government
 with a strong president. In practice, government control in
 this small, homogeneous society is exercised by an elite whose
 authority is based on long tradition. There are no political
 parties. Candidates for the unicameral legislature, the
 Majlis, run as individuals. The Majlis selects a single
 nominee for President who -is subsequently approved or rejected
 by the voters. In 1988 President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom was
 reelected to a third term. This followed his unanimous
 nomination by the Majlis and subsequent approval in a public
 referendum by more than 95 percent of those voting.
 Until recently, the Maldives had not been attacked or invaded
 for hundreds of years. It thus sees no need for a large
 defense and security establishment. In November 1988, however,
 a few Maldivians using foreign mercenaries attempted
 unsuccessfully to overthrow the Government. After the attempt,
 the Government moved to strengthen its security forces. The
 National Security Service (NSS), previously numbering fewer
 than 1,000, is now a force of about 1,500. The NSS is
 responsible for maintaining internal law and order and
 defending the country. The police division of the NSS
 investigates crimes, makes arrests, and enforces house arrest.
 The Maldives comprises 1,200 islands in 19 atolls scattered
 across an area 500 miles long by 75 miles wide in the Indian
 Ocean. The isolation of individual islands from each other,
 and of the Republic as a whole from the rest of the world, is a
 dominant feature of social and economic life. Nearly half the
 population engages in traditional activities such as fishing,
 harvesting coconuts, and small-scale farming. Industry
 accounts for only 5 percent of the gross national product.
 Human rights continue to be restricted in a number of areas,
 including speech and press, religion, the right of citizens to
 change their government, and women's and worker rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Maldivians follow Shari'a or Islamic law. Occasionally
 convicted eriminals are flogged. Usually, however, punishment
 is confined to fines, compensatory payment, house arrest,
 imprisonment, or banishment to a remote and sparsely populated
 island.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution states that "no person shall be apprehended or
 arrested, except on a verdict specified by Shari'a or (civil)
 law." There is no provision under Maldivian law for preventive
 detention. Incommunicado detention is rare.
 Acting on formal written complaints alleging commission of a
 crime, the Attorney-General's office refers a case to the
 appropriate court. The court then instructs the police to
 undertake an investigation. A suspect may, depending upon the
 charges, be detained or placed under house arrest for 15 days
 while the case is investigated. In cases not brought to trial
 within 15 days, the suspect is freed. Detention or house
 arrest may be extended after the first 15 days by authority of
 the President, though usually for less than a month. There is
 no legal provision for bail. However, a defendant in detention
 who has valid reasons to travel may receive permission to do so
 from the Prisbns Division.
 Actions which "arouse the people against the Government" are
 illegal, and persons may be arrested for violation of this law,
 though none were in 1989.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There is a High Court and eight lesser courts in Male, the
 capital. Each deals with specialized cases, such as debt,
 theft, or property claims. On other islands, there are
 all-purpose courts. There are no jury trials. Trials are
 conducted by judges trained in Islamic law. They are appointed
 by the President and serve at his pleasure. Thus they cannot
 be considered fully independent. Cases in island courts that
 present knotty legal questions are referred to the appropriate
 specialized court at Male. The Male court can in turn refer
 the legal issue to four judges attached to the Justice
 Ministry. The High Court acts as a court of appeal. It also
 handles politically sensitive cases.
 During trial, the accused may defend himself and call
 witnesses. He also may be assisted by a lawyer. However,
 there are few lawyers in the Maldives and courts do not provide
 them to defendants. The length and type of sentence are
 established by law and custom.
 In 1989 the Maldivian judicial system faced an unprecedented
 challenge when it tried 7 Maldivians and 68 Sri Lankans accused
 of the November 1988 coup attempt. Court facilities were
 expanded and foreign translators located for the accused
 Tamil-speaking Sri Lankan mercenaries. However, a Sri Lankan
 lawyer engaged to represent these defendants was unable to
 secure government permission to participate in the court
 proceedings. The accused were therefore without legal
 counsel. All those tried were found guilty. Sixteen were
 sentenced to death, but the sentences wete commuted to life in
 prison.
 In its 1989 Report, Amnesty International (AI) stated that it
 had written to the Government, urging that the prisoners be
 granted access to lawyers and be tried in accordance with
 international standards, and that the Government had replied
 that the suspects would be tried accDrding to Sharila law.

 MALDIVES
 Other than those found guilty for attempting to overthrow the
 Government in 1988, there are no Maldivians serving sentences
 for political crimes.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution prohibits opening, intercepting, reading, or
 making public letters, telephone conversations, telegrams, and
 wireless messages exchanged between persons "except in
 accordance with the specific provisions of the law." There is
 no evidence that the Government monitors correspondence or
 telephone conversations or uses a regular system of informers.
 The Constitution requires that private premises and dwellings
 be respected. There have been-no reports of practices to the
 contrary.
 There are no prohibitions on the import of foreign
 publications, except those containg pornographic material.
 Foreign broadcasts are not jammed.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and expression
 "so long as the specific provisions of Shari'a and the law are
 not contravened." In practice, freedom of speech and press are
 restricted. A citizen may criticize or complain to the
 Government without fear if he does so through recognized
 channels. These include letters or oral complaints to the
 President, a Majlis member, a civil servant, or other person in
 authority. Maldivians often discuss the Government, sometimes
 critically, in private. However, the law forbidding arousing
 opposition to the Government, together with a tradition of
 authoritarian rule, make Maldivians careful when expressing
 their opinions to foreigners or in the media.
 There are three privately owned newspapers. Each must register
 with the Government. The only government-owned publication is
 the News Bulletin. It is published by the Maldivian Department
 of Information and Broadcasting. There is no prior censorship
 of newspapers. However, because writers and editors are
 subject to prosecution if their articles contravene the law,
 self-censorship is well ingrained. No writers or editors were
 prosecuted in 1989 for writing articles alleged to have created
 antigovernment feelings.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution assures freedom of assembly and association.
 However, Maldivians make little use of these freedoms in a
 political sense. Most rallies and meetings are sponsored or
 approved by the Government and are usually addressed by
 government officials or religious leaders. Clubs'and other
 private associations are permitted if they do not contravene
 Shari'a and civil law. They must be registered with the
 Government.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.

 MALDIVES
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is significantly restricted. The
 Constitution affirms Islam as the official religion and defines
 all citizens as Muslims. There are no churches, shrines or
 synagogues for the practice of any other religion.
 Missionaries of non-Muslim faiths may enter the Maldives but
 are forbidden to proselytize. Conversion of a Muslim to
 another faith is a violation of Islamic (Shari'a) law and would
 result in the loss of citizenship for the Maldivian convert.
 Links with Muslims in other countries are strong. Each year a
 number of Maldivians perform the hajj.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government discourages Maldivians from changing islands of
 residence, primarily because most migrants move to Male, whidh
 is severely overcrowded. In 1982 the Government reimposed
 regulations that limit immigration to the capital island and
 its surrounding atoll, permitting migration to Male for short
 periods only for work, education, or medical treatment.
 There are no restrictions on foreign travel or emigration. The
 Government does not require exit visas. It requires a
 Maldivian who has acquired another nationality to maintain
 Maldivian nationality concurrently. Such a dual national must
 enter and leave the Maldives on a Maldivian passport. As far
 as is known, the Government has never revoked the citizenship
 of a Maldivian. There are no refugees or displaced persons in
 the Maldives. As far as is known, no Maldivians have been
 exiled abroad or are refugees or displaced persons elsewhere.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Maldivians have only limited and indirect influence on the
 selection and organization of their government. President
 Maumoon Abdul Gayoom rules the Maldives together with a
 well-educated elite loyal to him. A single nominee for
 President is chosen by secret ballot in the Majlis from as many
 candidates as are proposed by members. His nomination is
 confirmed or rejected in a nationwide referendum, also by
 secret ballot. President Gayoom was elected for a third 5-year
 term by this process in 1988.
 Members of the Majlis, a unicameral legislature, are chosen for
 5-year terms by secret ballot. All Maldivians over 21 years of
 age may vote. Of 48 members, 40 are elected--2 from each atoll
 and 2 from Male--and the President appoints 8. Individuals or
 groups may freely approach members of the Majlis with
 grievances or opinions on proposed legislation. The most
 recent Majlis election was held in November 1989.
 While they are not forbidden by law, there are no political
 parties. President Gayoom has publicly discouraged their
 formation, declaring political parties inappropriate to the
 homogeneous nature of Maldivian society. In place of political
 parties, factions in the Majlis tend to form around individuals
 or points of view. Any member may introduce legislation. If
 seconded, it must be considered by the Majlis. The Majlis may
 question ministers and call for their removal. In practice,
 however, the Majlis generally supports the Government in its
 positions after discussing and sonoetimes amending its proposals.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no local human rights organizations. There were no
 public requests for outside investigation of human rights
 violations in 1989. The Government did respond to an inquiry
 from AI concerning the trials of those involved in the November
 1988 coup attempt (see Section I.e.).
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 I       Language, or Social Status
 Women by tradition play a subordinate role in Maldivian
 society, although they now participate in public life in
 growing numbers. Islamic practice is the basis for Maldivian
 civil law. It is therefore easier for husbands to divorce
 wives than vice versa. Islamic law, or Shari'a, also governs
 inheritance. Most women, like most men, are not part of the
 cash economy. Women who do work for wages--for the Government,
 in businesses on Male, or in garment factories--generally
 receive wages similar to those of men.
 In late 1988 the Government opened the NSS to female
 applicants. There are now 'about 70 women in the NSS and more
 are being sought.
 Violence against women occurs in the Maldives, but little is
 known about its extent. Abuse within the family, such as wife
 beating, is seldom mentioned publicly owing to the value
 attached to personal privacy in this conservative society, and
 the Government does not acknowledge the existence of a
 problem. There are no official statistics on the subject.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 There are no trade unions in the Maldives. The Government
 recognizes neither the right to form them nor the right to
 strike, and strikes do not occur. The Maldives are not a
 member of the International Labor Organization.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively are
 neither recognized-nor protected by law. There are no export
 processing zones in the-Maldives, though the Government has
 granted certain tax concessions to investors who opened garment
 factories. As far as is known, the customary procedures
 governing conditions of labor are the same for garment
 factories and the economy as a whole.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Although'no information is available on Maldivian law on forced
 or compulsory labor, there have been no reported instances.
 d.. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 There is no compulsory education law or minimum age for the
 employment of young people. The Government has set no
 restrictions on conditions under which children or young people
 
 
 1491
 MALDIVES
 may be employed. However, most employers do not hire young
 people for work at night or in what are considered hazardous
 conditions.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Until the mid-1970's, most Maldivians were either self-employed
 or held government jobs. There was a relative lack of interest
 in workers' rights or organization. During the last 7 years,
 however, three garment factories have opened, employing large
 numbers of workers. Agreements between the Government and
 foreign investors setting up these factories included no
 provisions for workers' rights or treatment.
 In 1982 the Government established a Department of Labor, and
 an intergovernmental Labor Advisory Board met in 1987 to draft
 the country's first labor laws. The Board's work is not yet
 complete, and the country still has no statutory provisions for
 hours of work and length of annual leave. An 8-hour day, 6-day
 workweek is customary, though not enforced by law.
 There is no national minimum wage, although the Government has
 established wage floors for certain kinds of work. The wage
 floor for garment workers is $84 per month. Employees who work
 more than an 8-hour day are entitled to overtime pay.
 Government workers receive 3 weeks' leave per year under labor
 laws adopted in 1987.
