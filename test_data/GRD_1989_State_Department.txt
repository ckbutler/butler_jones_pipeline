 A member of the Commonwealth of Nations, Grenada.s
 parliamentary form of government, with a Governor General as
 titular Head of State, was suspended in 1979 by the Marxist
 People's Revolutionary Government (PRG) and then restored in
 October 1983. Free and fair elections in December 1984
 brought the New National Party (NNP) into power with 14 seats
 in the 15-member lower house of Parliament. Prime Minister
 Herbert Blaize later broke with the NNP and formed The
 National Party (TNP) with the support of six Members of
 Parliament. With a majority of elected Members of Parliament
 no longer supporting the Government, the Prime Minister
 prorogued Parliament on August 23, rather than face a
 potential vote of no confidence. Under the Constitution, the
 Prime Minister has until March 27, 1990, to hold new elections.
 Political and civil rights are provided for by the
 Constitution and respected in practice, although the Emergency
 Powers Act of 1987 gives the Government authority to suspend
 most civil rights should the Governor General declare a state
 of national emergency. Although provisions of the Act have
 never been applied, opposition politicians objected
 strenuously to it, citing existing government authority to
 deal with national emergencies.
 Security in Grenada is the responsibility of the 600-strong
 Royal Grenada Police Force (RGPF), which includes a 75-man
 paramilitary Special Services Unit (SSU) and a 30-man coast
 guard unit. It is controlled by and responsive to the
 civilian government.
 Grenadians enjoy substantial freedom to pursue economic goals
 in a free market environment. Major improvements in
 infrastructure have accompanied economic growth, which has
 averaged 5 percent annually in real terms over the past
 several years. Economic development in agriculture,
 construction, tourism, transportation, and communications has
 been aided by a return of Grenadian capital and substantial
 economic assistance following restoration of democratic
 government in 1983.
 Grenada's overall human rights record remained good during
 1989.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated or other
 extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances
 or abductions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution specifically prohibits torture, and there
 were no reported incidents of torture in Grenada in 1989.
 Some of the prisoners convicted of the 1983 murder of Prime
 
 
 591
 GENADA
 Minister Maurice Bishop, whose cases are still under appeal,
 made allegations of beatings by prison officials, but these
 have not been substantiated. The Government authorized the
 formation of a prison visitation committee in 1989 to visit
 the prison periodically, but the program had not been
 implemented by year's end.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 According to law, police have the right to detain persons on
 suspicion without a warrant, but formal charges must be
 brought within 48 hours. This time limit is adhered to in
 practice. If the detainee is not charged within this time, he
 must be released. In 1989 no one was detained for political
 reasons.
 The law provides for a judicial determination of the legality
 of detention within 15 days after arrest on a criminal charge.
 Formal arraignment or release of the arrestee must be
 determined within 60 days. These procedures were generally
 followed.
 There is a functioning system of bail, although those charged
 with capital offenses are not eligible. Persons charged with
 treason can only be accorded bail upon recommendation of the
 Governor General.
 No Grenadian citizen was exiled in 1989. With regard to
 forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to fair public trial is provided for by law and is
 observed in practice. Those arrested and charged are brought
 before an independent judiciary and are allowed access to a
 lawyer of their choice. For capital crimes, the courts
 appoint lawyers when the accused cannot pay for his defense.
 In other cases, the defendant is assigned counsel if the case
 reaches the appellate stage. Following a determination by a
 judicial hearing that there is sufficient evidence to
 substantiate a criminal charge, the defendant is remanded for
 trial. Due to the backlog of cases caused by a lack of judges
 and facilities, a significant amount of time can pass before
 those charged are brought to trial.
 The Government has taken particular care to afford a fair
 public trial, including an appeal process which has been under
 way for 2 years, in the cases of the 17 former PRG and army
 officials convicted of the murders of Maurice Bishop and 10
 others on October 19, 1983. Fourteen defendants have been
 sentenced to death and three to long prison terms. This
 appeals process continues before a panel of Caribbean jurists,
 although it was temporarily delayed by the death of the
 president of the court in December 1988. The Grenada
 Government continues to bear the cost of both the prosecution
 and the defense in the appeal.
 There are no persons imprisoned without due process. There
 are no political prisoners, the 17 PRG and revolutionary
 army officials having been convicted of capital crimes.

 GRENADA
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There is no arbitrary interference in private life. Warrants
 for searching homes are normally required by law except in
 cases of hot pursuit. In practice, warrants are obtained in
 the majority of cases before a search is conducted. There
 were no reports of arbitrary monitoring of telephones or
 correspondence.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech dnd press is provided for by the
 Constitution and fXeely exercised. There are five weekly
 newspapers and several papers which are published
 irregularly. Most are affiliated with political parties, but
 the two most widely circulated newspapers are independent.
 Flyers are occasionally distributed by remnants of the PRG's
 Revolutionary Military Council and the New Jewel Movement.
 Newspapers are frequently critical of the Government.
 Grenada has one government-operated radio station.- There are
 no regulations regarding equal access to radio broadcasts by
 opposition political parties. In practice, the official
 opposition party was given occasional air time, but made
 sporadic, informal complaints that the time given was
 inadequate. In 1988 a license granted to a private FM radio
 station by the Government a few months earlier was revoked and
 the station closed. After an inconclusive court case on
 charges of operating without a license, the owners resumed
 broadcasting, only to be closed down again. In October, the
 Government announced that it had issued a license for a new
 privately owned FM radio station, which was scheduled to begin
 broadcasting by year's end. Its programming was not expected
 to deal with political matters.
 Grenada currently has a fledgling television broadcasting
 system which was purchased from its American owners in
 September 1989 by a public corporation controlled by the
 Government. Under its previous owners, the programming
 featured regular political interview/talk shows which were
 open to all the political parties in Grenada, as well as to
 public commentary. It was unclear at year's end if the policy
 of free access by opposition political parties to television
 will continue under the government-controlled public
 corporation.
 In 1989 the Government, as it did in 1988, banned the
 importation of a number of Marxist-oriented publications
 destined for the Maurice Bishop Patriotic Movement (MBPM), in
 connection with the anniversary of the coup which overthrew
 the elected government of Sir Eric Gairy in 1974. The
 Government-noted that the Constitution allows limitations on
 freedom of speech and the press when deemed necessary to
 protect the public interest. On April 11, the Government
 issued a formal order prohibiting permanently the importation
 of 86 specific publications-into Grenada on the basis that
 they were contrary to the public interest.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Grenadians enjoy the right to assemble for any peaceful
 purpose, including the public protest of policies or actions
 
 
 593
 GEN1ADA
 of the Government. Supporters of political parties meet
 frequently and hold public rallies. There are no controls on
 private or public associations, and permits are not required
 for public meetings.
 Citing a refusal to endorse a celebration of the destruction
 of democracy, the Government refused to permit foreign
 visitors to remain in Grenada in March 1989 to attend events
 planned by the MBPM.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 All groups enjoy freedom of religion. The Roman Catholic and
 Anglican faiths predominate, but there are many Presbyterian
 and Methodist as well as evangelical church members. In
 addition, there is a small Bahali community and an Islamic
 center which serves the Muslim community. Complete religious
 freedom extends to the Rastafarians, who were harassed under
 the PRG regime. Clergy, including missionaries, travel and
 prosyletize freely. No apparent advantages or disadvantages
 are conferred by adherence to a particular faith, although
 Christian prayers and hymns form part of many governmental and
 political meetings. Representatives of the Church of Jesus
 Christ of Latter-Day Saints travel and proselytize in Grenada.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is freedom of movement within Grenada and, in principle,
 the right to enter and leave is guaranteed to all Grenadian
 citizens, except in special circumstances as outlined and
 limited by the Act to Restrict the Freedom of Movement of
 Certain Persons, passed in 1986. The law allows the minister
 responsible for national security to restrict travel out of
 Grenada of any person whose aims, tendencies, or objectives
 include the overthrow of the democratic and parliamentary
 system of government. Anyone so restricted may appeal after 3
 months to an independent and impartial tribunal, presided over
 by an accredited lawyer chosen by the Chief Justice. The law
 was enacted after the Grenadian Appeals Court upheld a
 government action withholding the passport of a former member
 of the PRG who sought to leave the country in 1985. The
 Government subsequently reversed its decision in this case
 late in 1988; the individual's passport was returned, and he
 has been permitted to travel abroad and return.
 No one was forcibly repatriated to Grenada in 1989. There
 were no official applications to Grenadian authorities for
 refugee status, although the Baha'i community includes
 Iranians who left their homeland to escape persecution. Work
 permits are granted to them, and they are allowed to practice
 their religion freely. The Government has allowed students
 and others to return to Grenada from Cuba and other Communist
 countries.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Constitution provides for this right through free and fair
 elections to be held at least every 5 years. Formed by the
 union of three parties to contest the December 1984 elections,
 the ruling NNP won 14 of the 15 parliamentary seats in an
 
 
 594
 election in which 85 percent of the voters participated. The
 NNP s majority was reduced after the resignation of two
 members in 1986, and further defections in 1987 left the NNP
 with only a 9 to 6 majority. After being ousted as party
 leader of the NNP in a January 1989 convention, Prime Minister
 Blaize broke with the NNP in August and established a new
 party, The National Party (TNP). The dismissal and/or
 resignations of remaining NNP members of the Cabinet then left
 the Prime Minister's TNP with a 6 to 9 minority in
 Parliament. Rather than face a potential vote of no
 confidence, the Prime Minister, in accordance with
 constitutional provisions, advised the acting Governor General
 to prorogue Parliament indefinitely on August 23.
 Constitutionally, the Parliament ended its maximum 5-year term
 on December 27, 1989, and elections must be held no later than
 March 27, 1990. It was not certain whether or not Parliament
 would be reconvened in the interim.
 Local government elections promised by the NNP in the 1984
 campaign remain a topic of public debate but have yet to be
 held. The political system is not dominated by any particular
 ethnic group, nor are there any restrictions which limit
 participation of any elements of the Grenadian population.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has welcomed visits of several human rights
 organizations in the past, including Amnesty International.
 In September the Government hosted and participated in a
 seminar on the Judiciary and Human Rights in the Commonwealth
 Caribbean sponsored by the International Commission of Jurists
 in association with the Caribbean Justice Improvement Project.
 The Caribbean Institute for the Promotion of Human Rights
 (CARICARE) is active in Grenada. It has called on the
 Government to recognize and accept the jurisdiction of.the
 Inter-American Court of Justice, but there was no action on
 this issue in 1989.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There is no evidence of official discrimination in health
 care, employment, or education. There have been some reported
 incidents of unofficial job discrimination against Guyanese
 and other foreign-born residents. Women frequently earn less
 than men performing the same work; wage differences are less
 marked for more highly paid jobs.
 Grenadian women's rights activists contend that violence
 against women in Grenada is common, and that most cases of
 spouse abuse go unreported to police authorities. To address
 this problem, one women's group instituted in December 1989 a
 telephone crisis hot-line so that victims of rape or spouse
 abuse have a mechanism for requesting support and assistance.
 The Grenadian police confirm that most cases of alleged abuse
 are not reported and those that are are settled out of court.
 Grenadian law stipulates a sentence of 15 years' imprisonment
 for a conviction of rape. Sentences for assault against a
 spouse vary according to the severity of the incident.

 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers are free to organize independent labor unions. Local
 Labor Ministry officials estimate that approximately 25
 percent of the total work force is unionized, although this
 figure may be low. Workers in the public and private sectors
 can and do strike legally if they give advance notification.
 The threat of strike action by three public sector unions in
 September 1989 contributed to a wage settlement highly
 favorable to the workers. Union leaders play a significant
 role in the political process, and one labor leader serves in
 the Grenada Senate at the nomination of the governing party.
 In 1989 all unions were free of government control, and none
 was given government support. Grenadian unions are affiliated
 with the Caribbean Congress of Labor. The Grenada Trade Union
 Council still maintains contacts with the Communist-controlled
 World Federation of Trade Unions, although at a very low level
 of activity.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers are free to participate in collective bargaining.
 Legislation compels employers to recognize a union which
 represents the majority of workers in a particular business.
 Grenadian law prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers
 against union members and organizers. If a complaint of
 discrimination arises, mechanisms exist for trying to resolve
 it. After all avenues for resolving a complaint have been
 exhausted between union representatives and employers, both
 sides may agree to ask for the assistance of the Labor
 Commissioner. If the Labor Commissioner is unable to find a
 resolution to the impasse, the Minister of Labor can appoint
 an arbitration tribunal if both parties agree to abide by its
 ruling.
 There are no areas in which union organization and collective
 bargaining are discouraged or impeded by the Government,
 including the export processing zone. In August workers at
 Abbott Labs Grenada, located in the export processing zone,
 voted not to form a union by a three to one margin in an
 election considered to have been free and fair.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution specifically prohibits forced labor, and no
 such incidents were reported in 1989.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The statutory minimum age for employment of children (16
 years) is enforced in the formal sector by periodic checks
 made by inspectors from the Ministry of Labor. Enforcement in
 the informal sector (i.e., family farms and small family
 businesses) is less effective.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no effective regulation of work hours or occupational
 safety standards, although the normal workweek rarely exceeds
 40 hours. A legal minimum wage has been fixed for the
 agricultural sector only. However, it is very limited in its
 scope, and for the majority of agricultural workers, as in
 other sectors, the minimum wage is determined by union/employer
 
 
 596
 negotiations. The Government's own wage rate and vacation
 allowances are comparable to those in the rest of the Eastern
 Caribbean. Wages from full-time jobs normally provide the
 basis for at least a minimally decent living standard.
