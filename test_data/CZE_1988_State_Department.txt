 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic is ruled by the Communist
 Party of Czechoslovakia whose leadership decides all important
 political, economic, and social questions and sharply limits
 the scope of individual human rights. In December 1987, Milos
 Jakes replaced Gustav Husak as General Secretary of the
 party. At a Central Committee meeting in October 1988, five
 new members joined the ruling Communist Party Presidium and
 two resigned. The party nominated Ladislav Adamec to replace
 Lubomir Strougal as Prime Minister.
 Czechoslovakia has a large, well-funded internal security
 establishment, directed by the Ministry of the Interior and
 the party hierarchy. It includes uniformed police (public
 security) who are similar to Western police forces, and the
 secret police (state security), who deal with those they judge
 to be past, present, or future opponents of the- regime. This
 powerful internal security force--backed by the Czechoslovak
 Army and the 80,000 Soviet troops stationed in the country
 since 1968--is the main pillar of the party's control.
 Czechoslovakia's centrally planned economy allows virtually no
 private enterprise or ownership in manufacturing, retail
 operations, agriculture, or services. In recent years, the
 economy, characterized by excessive central planning, obsolete
 equipment and infrastructure, and an almost complete lack of
 incentives for innovation and initiative, has become less
 competitive on world markets. Party leaders hav6 admitted to
 problems with the economy and have proclaimed a policy of
 "restructuring the economic mechanism" with the intention of
 improving efficiency and reducing central control, while
 maintaining the leading role of the party in all sectors of
 society.
 Although the Constitution provides for freedoms of speech,
 press, assembly, and religion, these provisions are rarely
 implemented. Independent associations are not legally
 permitted in Czechoslovakia; all labor unions, professional
 associations, and even amateur groups are controlled by the
 Communist Party and subordinated to it.
 The human rights situation in Czechoslovakia in 1988 evinced
 some slight improvement in the first part of the year, but
 events in the latter half of 1988 demonstrated increasing
 repression and a possible return to previous practices.
 Although there were fewer trials resulting in prison
 sentences, officials nevertheless demonstrated little
 tolerance for independently organized activities. Harsh
 repression, especially outside the capital, continued to be
 directed at religious activists and at those persons and
 groups, such as signatories of Charter 77 and members of the
 Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Perdecuted (VONS),
 who monitor human rights abuses in Czechoslovakia.
 On the other hand, positive developments included the
 Government's unprecedented decision to permit doctors from the
 U.S. organization Physicians for Human Rights to investigate
 the circumstances surrounding the death in prison in April of
 Pavel Wonka. The Government also permitted an unofficial
 demonstration on December 10 in Prague in honor of the
 anniversary of the proclamation of the Universal Declaration
 of Human Rights. Finally, the Government in December ceased
 jamming Radio Free Europe broadcasts.

 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Pavel Wonka, imprisoned in 1986 and subsequently convicted in
 1987 of subversion for distributing an independent election
 ballot for the May 1986 election, was released from prison in
 very poor health in February 1988. Rearrested in April for
 failing to comply with the terms of his release, Wonka was
 sentenced to an additional 5 months of imprisonment. He died
 within a month of his reincarceration. At the request of
 Wonka's mother and the independent human rights initiative
 Charter 77, the U.S. nongovernmental organization Physicians
 for Human Rights requested permission to investigate the
 circumstances surrounding Wonka's death. According to an
 interim report, the doctors' findings were consistent with
 official Czechoslovak reports regarding the cause of Wonka's
 death. They concluded that there was no physical evidence of
 beatings or torture. Nevertheless, it is clear that Wonka's
 health was seriously undermined by the severe conditions of
 his imprisonment.
 No other reports of incidents suggesting political killings by
 the police came to public attention in 1988. In the course of
 trying to prevent Czechoslovak citizens from fleeing to the
 West, border guards in past years have caused a number of
 casualties, including f~talities. There were no reports of
 such incidents in 1988.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Government does not appear to practice a systematic
 program of torture. In a collection of articles published in
 1987 by Charter 77, however, current and former prisoners in
 Czechoslovak jails reported instances of cruel and degrading
 treatment during the past 10 years. In addition, Pavel and
 Jiri Wonka reported that they were severely beaten during
 their extended detention in 1986-87, and Pavel Wonka was in
 very poor health when he was released from prison in February,
 2 months before his death. Jiri Wolf, a political prisoner
 whose health has caused concern in the past, was visited by
 the doctors who investigated the circumstances surrounding
 Pavel Wonka's death. Their interim report criticized the
 conditions of Mr. Wolf's incarceration.
 Generally, prison conditions are poor and sometimes approach
 the level of cruel and inhuman treatment. This is especially
 true under the "third category" of imprisonment (the harshest
 regime). Cells are usually small and unheated, family visits
 are strictly limited, and prisoners report such punishments as
 reduction in pay and limitations on free time, bathing, and
 exercise periods if the' fail to meet unrealistically high
 work standards. Informed sources report that prisoners are
 assigned unpleasant and hazardous work which normal workers
 refuse to perform. Inmates are occasionally given such
 health-threatening assignments as polishing crystal and
 costume jewelry in environments lacking sufficent ventilation
 
 
 1019
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 to prevent glass fragments and chemicals from being inhaled.
 Sanitary facilities, diet, and medical facilities are reported
 to be inadequate. Former prisoners have reported that prison
 guards sometimes encourage hardened criminals to prey on
 persons serving sentences for political offenses. Prisoners
 or former prisoners who complain publicly of mistreatment have
 been severely punished and sometimes sentenced again for
 having complained.
 In its July 1983 meeting, the World Psychiatric Association
 accused Czechoslovakia of misusing psychiatry for political
 purposes. Czechoslovakia thereupon resigned its membership in
 the organization. No consensus exists among independent
 observers regarding whether or not there is widespread abuse
 of psychiatry in Czechoslovakia. However, one case of
 possible psychiatric abuse involved Augustin Navratil, the
 Catholic activist who drafted a 31-point petition for
 religious freedom. On October 28, Navratil was committed
 involuntarily to in-patient psychiatric care for an indefinite
 period. This decision was made despite an examination in
 September by Western physicians who reportedly found
 Navratil's mental condition to be within "normal parameters."
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Czechoslovak citizens, especially human rights activists, are
 frequently arrested, detained, or subjected to searches--
 including of their homes--and interrogations for the
 expression of personal views contrary to those of the regime.
 Judicial and police authorities often explain such actions in
 legal terms and perform them with warrants. They have also
 arrested and detained citizens without warrants. Under the
 law, a person may be detained for up to 48 hours without being
 charged, although in practice this limit has not always been
 observed. Searches, detentions, and frequent interrogations
 are among the tactics used by the regime when it has decided
 to harass rather than to prosecute.
 Human rights activists from Charter 77, the Independent Peace
 Initiative, the Democratic Initiative, and other unauthorized
 groups were detained on October 27 on the eve of the 70th
 anniversary of the founding of the Czechoslovak Republic,
 presumably to prevent the independent demonstration scheduled
 the next day. At least 65 persons were taken into custody,
 and 13 were subsequently charged with criminal offenses
 stemming from the unofficial celebration of the anniversary.
 The authorities also prevented the independently organized
 seminar "Czechoslovakia 1988" from being held November 11-13
 by detaining about 20 activists for several days.
 According to law, a detainee may be held in investigative
 detention for 60 days if the authorities decide to press
 charges. A detainee may receive visits by family members only
 after a trial. Investigative detention may be, and has been,
 extended beyond 60 days at the request of the prosecution, and
 detainees are occasionally held for long periods without being
 brought to trial. For example, Ivan Polansky was held in
 detention for over 6 months before his trial (see Section
 2.a.).
 Persons arrested for expressing personal views that take issue
 with the regime's official position generally are charged with
 "subversion," "incitement," "defamation of the Republic," or
 "damaging the interests of the Republic abroad." In the past,
 citizens who had unauthorized contacts with foreign diplomats
 
 
 1020
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 or who frequented foreign embassies and their libraries were
 sometimes charged with "espionage." Those arrested for
 religious activities usually are charged with "obstructing
 state supervision over churches and religious societies."
 Many articles of the criminal code are sufficiently elastic to
 encompass almost any activity. In certain instances, the
 authorities have also resorted to arbitrary or trumped-up
 criminal charges (e.g., "hooliganism" or "stealing Socialist
 property") to punish those whose real offense was to engage in
 unauthorized political or cultural activity.
 The authorities do not formally impose internal exile or house
 arrest. In 1984, for the first time, the Government introduced
 a regime of "protective supervision," which combines features
 of both. Pavel Wonka's rearrest in April stemmed from his
 refusal to abide by the terms of his "protective supervision."
 Protective supervision includes travel restrictions, curfews,
 frequent searches of persons, homes, and guests, and the
 obligation to report regularly--often twice a day--to the
 police. The imposition of such a regime, intended for
 habitually violent offenders, against persons who have never
 committed or advocated an act of violence is a form of
 harassment that sharply curtails their freedom of movement and
 isolates them from normal contact with those outside their
 home.
 Since 1986 there have been no reports that the Government has
 employed forced exile to rid itself of critics. Prior to that
 time, people working or visiting abroad with official
 permission were at times stripped of their citizenship and
 refused the right to return. The authorities have on occasion
 exerted heavy pressure, to emigrate on those who have already
 served a jail sentence. If they refuse, they and their
 families may suffer harassment, denial of jobs and schooling,
 and the threat of rearrest. After a year or more of this
 treatment, some ex-prisoners have applied for emigration
 passports.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 According to Czechoslovak law, people charged with criminal
 offenses are entitled to fair and open public trials. The law
 provides that accused persons have a right to be informed
 concerning the charges against them, to retain counsel, and to
 present a defense. In practice, however, the exercise of
 these rights may be reduced to a mere formality, especially
 where political offenses are concerned.
 Defendants may either choose their own lawyers or request
 court-appointed lawyers. However, lawyers, like judges, are
 subject to direct and indirect pressures from political
 authorities, and they do not always vigorously represent their
 clients. Defendants may exercise their right to defend
 themselves in court and occasionally succeed in having charges
 dismissed or reduced at the original trial. Thereafter, the
 prosecution may file an appeal which may result in an increase
 in the sentence or in additional charges.
 In 1988 it was easier for friends of defendants, press
 representatives, and diplomats to attend trials with political
 content than some years ago. Ivan Polansky's appeal of his
 conviction for subversion was not, however, open to the
 general public (see Section 2.a.). Attendance was restricted
 
 
 1021
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 to "interested members of the public," as selected by court
 officials who refused access to the representative of a human
 rights group and to a U.S. Embassy officer.
 The judiciary is not independent of the regime and the
 Communist Party. In theory, judges can be removed only by the
 Federal Assembly (national parliament) or by the Czech or
 Slovak National Councils (regional parliaments). In practice,
 they are subject to direct control and supervision by the
 party, to which most judges and lawyers belong.
 The number of political prisoners in Czechoslovakia is
 difficult to estimate. The Government does not release
 figures on its prison population and does not recognize
 political prisoners as a separate category. The only figures
 available are those from the VONS, which to the best of its
 ability documents individual cases. By VONS' account, there
 are at least 15 political prisoners at this time. However,
 due to the limitations on securing such information, VONS'
 list is almost certainly illustrative, not exhaustive, and
 therefore represents a minimum figure. Additionally, VONS
 does not monitor certain categories of political prisoners,
 such as those sentenced for attempts to leave Czechoslovakia
 without official permission. The number of such prisoners--
 most of whom serve terms of 1 to 2 years--has been estimated
 at 1,000. The amnesty declared on October 27 could affect up
 to 160,000 persons who left or tried to leave Czechoslovakia
 illegally.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government monitors and controls the activities of citizens
 whom it suspects of engaging in antiregime or independent
 activity. Consequently, it also interferes with privacy of
 communications.
 Those who are considered opponents of the regime bear the brunt
 of heavily intrusive surveillance. They, their families, and
 their friends are subjected routinely to such measures as
 electronic surveillance, tapping of telephones, and
 interception and destruction of mail. Discrimination in
 employment is a regular aspect of the harassment and
 persecution of families of dissidents and religious activists.
 Fear that their children may be denied higher education is a
 major factor in preventing open dissent among intellectuals
 and white-collar workers.
 A special problem exists for religious believers who wish to
 raise their children in their faith. The organization of
 religious instruction or of ceremonies in private homes is
 forbidden (see Section 2.c.).
 The Government discourages contacts with persons and
 organizations in the West and receipt of information from the
 West. It also requires persons in a variety of professions to
 file a report each time they have a conversation with a
 Westerner. In December, however, the Government ceased
 jamming broadcasts of Radio Free Europe for the first time in
 two decades. Other Western radio broadcasts are also not
 jammed. Many people who live near the country's western or
 southern borders can receive West German or Austrian
 television broadcasts.

 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Constitution provides for freedom of speech and
 freedom of the press, it states that these freedoms must be
 exercised "in accordance with the interests of the working
 class." In effect, persons may not voice opinions publicly
 that differ from party policy or that question the legitimacy
 of party rule, the fundamental principles of the "Socialist"
 state, or the regime's relationship with the Soviet Union.
 Likewise, political directives severely limit academic
 freedom. While there is limnited evidence that, in the light
 of recent Soviet examples, the Czechoslovak authorities have
 allowed marginally more freedom of expression, no clear
 pattern has yet emerged.
 All officially recognized newspapers and magazines are
 published and controlled by political parties or mass
 organizations of the National Front (e.g., the Youth League,
 Revolutionary Trade Union Movement, or Sports Federation).
 These in turn are controlled by the Communist Party. Legally
 published religious literature and periodicals are subject to
 strict censorship and are available only in limited editions.
 Publishing houses and the news media, all state-owned, employ
 self-censorship under Communist Party guidelines. Editors who
 are insufficiently vigilant suffer fines or dismissal. Writers
 who wish to publish must belong to the state-controlled Union
 of Writers.
 Only a limited n'imber of Western non-Communist periodicals are-
 imported, and these are usually not available to ordinary
 citizens. Since the early 1970's, libraries have restricted
 access to Western publications of a political character to
 those persons who have obtained special permission from their
 employers or their universities documenting their need for the
 material for official purposes. Periodicals such as Time and
 Newsweek are locked in cabinets controlled by special
 personnel. Books and periodicals published during the 1968-69
 period and other publications considered ideologically
 "harmful" are subject to similar controls.
 The Interior Ministry controls printing and photocopying
 equipment, except typewriters, which cannot be obtained
 legally by private citizens. Despite these restrictions, a
 lively underground samizdat (self-published) press publishes a
 variety of fiction and nonfiction, usually in very small
 editions. In 1988 an independent newspaper, Lidove Noviny,
 began publication in Czechoslovakia. Although authorities
 refused to register the publication officially and fined the
 periodical's editor-in-chief for his unauthorized publication,
 the monthly continued to appear. Also, a group of Charter 77
 signatories regularly publishes a newsletter entitled
 Informace o Charte 77 (Information about Charter 77), which
 carries Charter documents and VONS communiques reporting human
 rights violations. Some samizdat literature is sent abroad,
 where it is reprinted in emigre publishing houses and then
 brought back to Czechoslovakia in large editions. Persons
 prosecuted for exercising their right to free speech or for
 engaging in independent publishing activities in 1988 included
 Ivan Polansky, who on August 30 received a 4-year sentence for
 subversion in connection with historical and religious samizdat
 materials that he allegedly compiled and distributed. Polansky
 was released from prison on December 16 following the reduction
 in his sentence as part of the October amnesty.
 
 
 1023
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although the Constitution provides for freedom of assembly,
 that freedom is severely limited in practice. Public meetings
 may be held only with the permission of the police, and this
 permission depends upon whether or not the proposed meeting
 supports state objectives. When the authorities wish to have
 a large rally, such as May Day or "peace" demonstrations, they
 exert pressure on people to attend.
 On August 21, the 20th anniversary of the 1968 Soviet-led
 invasion that put an end to the "Prague Spring," the
 authorities suppressed a spontaneous, peaceful demonstration
 in Prague. Up to 10,000 persons marched through Prague for
 more than 2 hours before police forces dispersed a remaining
 group of several thousand demonstrators, detaining a number of
 persons and charging 13 with criminal offenses.
 In another example of repression, the authorities broke up an
 independent peace seminar convened in Prague in mid-June.
 They briefly detained local activists attempting to participate
 in the seminar and expelled a number of foreigners from the
 country. An independent seminar on modern Czechoslovak history
 was also disrupted on November 11. On the 70th anniversary of
 the founding of the Czechoslovak Republic on October 28, up to
 8,000 persons staged a demonstration in Prague despite a series
 of preventive detentions aimed at discouraging the
 commemoration. Police used truncheons, dogs, water cannon,
 and tear gas to disperse demonstrators- and spectators.
 Thirteen persons were charged with criminal offenses.
 On December 10, Czechoslovak authorities permitted an
 unofficial human rights demonstration in Prague. This was the
 first independent demonstration to receive official sanction
 in nearly 20 years. Subsequently, however, there were reports
 that authorities were banning such activities, at least on a
 local basis.
 The Government does not permit the establishment of
 independent associations as demonstrated by its continuing
 unwillingness since 1985 to tolerate the Jazz Section of the
 Musicians' Union. Unijazz, a successor organization, was
 formed in 1988. Unijazz was refused authorization to form a
 legally recognized association. Jazz Section Chairman Karel
 Srp, the last of the five members of the Jazz Section's
 leadership tried, convicted, and sentenced to up to 16 months'
 imprisonment in March 1987, was released on January 1, 1988.
 In May 1987, the founding committee of a proposed organization
 to be named the Society of Friends with the United States
 (SPUSA) submitted a request for approval of its bylaws to the
 Ministry of Interior. The organization was to be a voluntary,
 social association within the framework of the National Front,
 and dedicated to developing friendship, trust, and
 understanding between Czechoslovakia and the United States.
 Following final rejection of the organizers' application for
 registration with the National Front, SPUSA reorganized itself
 as an informal "association." Activists have been subjected
 to repeated interrogations, and SPUSA has been characterized
 by Czechoslovak authorities as an antistate organization.
 Meanwhile, the authorities set up their own "North American
 Committee" of the Society for International Relations as a
 state alternative to SPUSA.
 
 
 1024
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 Other citizens' groups subjected to official harassment or
 unable to secure official recognition include the "Independent
 Peace Initiative" and "Democratic Initiative." Citizens
 interested in the environment and in the visual and performing
 arts (including rock and punk groups), although also harassed,
 have some success in organizing independent activities.
 Meetings between independent citizens and visiting foreign
 officials have generally passed without incident. However,
 police did prevent a March 4 meeting between a visiting
 British official and representatives of Charter 77 and the.
 Jazz Section.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 "Scientific atheism" is part of the official ideology, and
 freedom of religion, provided for in the Constitution, is
 strictly limited in practice. The regime actively discourages
 all religious activity, especially among the young. Teachers,
 policemen, Communist Party officials, and members of certain
 other professions encounter problems in their careers if they
 are seen in church.
 Early in the year, some 600,000 persons signed a 31-point
 petition demanding increased religious freedom. Conditions
 did not improve as a result of the petition, and the
 Government declined to address the points raised in the
 petition. The petition's drafter, Augustin Navratil, was
 committed to a mental hospital on October 28. Earlier, on
 March 25, police brutally dispersed a group of several
 thousand people who were demonstrating for religious freedom
 in Bratislava.
 The Government exercises strict control over all religious
 affairs. A church must be registered officially in order to
 function legally in Czechoslovakia. Groups which proselytize,
 such as Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons, are banned outright,
 and their members suffer frequent harassment and arrest.
 Jehovah's Witnesses have been reported in several prisons, but
 there is no reliable estimate of their number.
 Organized religious practice is hampered by both written and
 unwritten restrictions. Clergymen are paid by the State and
 must'receive a state license in order to practice. Such
 licenses can be--and are--withdrawn without explanation.
 Estimates of the number of clergymen who have lost their
 licenses vary, but they are known to include several bishops.
 Those who continue to practice despite revocation of their
 licenses are liable to criminal prosecution. On the positive
 side, the Government reached agreement with the Vatican on the
 appointment of three new bishops. However, with the death in
 November of Bishop Jan Pasztor, Bishop of Nitra, 11 of
 Czechoslovakia's 13 dioceses were unfilled.
 Religious instruction in the home is forbidden, and parents
 must obtain the permission of local authorities if their
 children are to receive religious education at school.
 Instruction for Catholic children is provided at school, and
 instruction for Protestant children takes place at church, as
 arranged between the leaders of each religious denomination
 and the Government. School authorities warn parents that
 participation in religious classes could be damaging to a
 child's education and career prospects.
 Although the Government has stated its intention to increase
 the supply of religious literature, printing is severely
 
 
 1025
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 restricted, and Bibles are in short supply. The demand for
 religious literature exceeds supply, and Bibles and other
 pieces of religious literature are smuggled in from abroad and
 produced by underground samizdat methods. Samizdat and other
 unofficial efforts to increase the supply of religious
 materials are illegal.
 The authorities do not facilitate travel by religious
 officials to and from Czechoslovakia unless the proposed visit
 serves the purpose of the State. In the case of the Catholic
 Church, the Government has followed an extremely restrictive
 policy. Pope John Paul II has not been permitted to visit
 Czechoslovakia, despite an invitation from Cardinal Tomasek
 and petitions signed by thousands of Czech and Slovak
 Catholics. Priests and other religious leaders are frequently
 denied permission to travel outside the country. Unofficial
 or unsanctioned travel by religious groups for purposes the
 Government considers illegal--e.g., importing religious
 literature or objects, conducting religious training, and
 similar activities--is severely punished.
 For many years, no proposed construction of new Catholic
 churches has been approved. However, some Protestant
 congregations--including Baptists--have been allowd- to build
 new churches. The Roman Catholic Church is the largest of
 Czechoslovakia's 18 officially registered religious bodies.
 There axe an estimated 8 to 11 million Roman Catholics in the
 country, and up to 450,000 members of the affiliated Greek
 Catholic (Uniate) Church. The Greek Catholic Church was
 reestablished in 1968 after having been forcibly united with
 the much smaller Orthodox Church in 1950. However, the Greek
 Catholics have been unable to reclaim their property, which
 remains in the possession of the Orthodox Church.
 Students in Czechoslovakia's two remaining Catholic seminaries
 (out of a prewar total of 13) need state approval to be
 admitted and ordained. In addition, the State must approve
 each priest's assignment to a parish or higher office.
 Consequently, many priests have to cover more than one parish.
 In 1950 all male religious orders were dissolved. A few
 female religious orders are allowed to continue functioning
 and for the first time since a brief period in 1968 have been
 allowed to admit a limited number of new members. Despite
 these limitations, some Catholic monastic orders have
 continued to operate clandestinely, with members making
 occasional public appearances.
 In Slovakia there were several Catholic pilgrimages in 1988 in
 which several hundred thousand people took part with no
 substantial police interference. Authorities did, however,
 prevent participation by known religious activists in the
 September 17-18 pilgrimage to the Slovak shrine at Sastin as
 well as the March 25 religious demonstration in Bratislava.
 "Pacem in Terris," the state-sponsored -peace association" of
 Catholic clergy, founded by the State in 1970, has been a
 major instrument of state control over the Catholic Church.
 The- association has been losing ground since 1982 when the
 Vatican banned clerical participation in political
 organizations- worldwide. Although Cardinal Tomasek and the
 overwhelming majority of Catholic clergy in Czechoslovakia
 have disassociated themselves from "Pacem in Terris," priests
 associated with the organization have retained control of
 
 
 1026
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 Katolicke Noviny (Catholic News), the only legally published
 Catholic newspaper.
 Protestant denominations registered by the Government operate
 under constraints similar to those for the Catholic Church.
 Proselytizing is forbidden; religious education is strictly
 regulated; religious ceremonies are restricted for the most
 part to church premises; and education of clergymen is closely
 controlled. Clergymen who become popular with young people or
 associated with Charter 77 soon find themselves barred from
 preaching.
 Two Jewish community councils, one in the Czech lands and the
 other in Slovakia, serve the Jewish community of several
 thousand. These councils are central religious organizations
 financially supported and controlled by the Government. The
 Government permitted publication of a pamphlet with prayers in
 Hebrew and Czech in 1988. There are synagogues and prayer
 houses open for worship and two rabbis, one in Prague and one
 in Kosice. Religious ritual articles and kosher meat are
 available in limited supply. In Prague there is a Jewish
 Museum operated by the State. The Prague rabbi initiated a
 small Jewish religion class in 1988 for young children. There
 is no rabbinical seminary.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 For all Czechoslovaks, freedom of movement is restricted near
 military installations and along the borders with Austria and
 the Federal Republic of Germany. Movement within the rest of
 the country is not restricted for most citizens. However, the
 Government has restricted the movements of Charter 77
 activists and other "suspect" persons, especially to prevent
 their participation in independently organized activities.
 In theory, Czechoslovak citizens may buy hard currency from
 the state bank to finance travel to the West once every 3
 years. In practice, while some Czechoslovaks are able to
 travel to the West every year, others are granted exit
 documentation only once in a lifetime or never. In addition
 to applying for passports and exit permission, which are
 required for all foreign travel, persons desiring to visit
 "non-Socialist" countries must submit an application for a
 hard currency allocation in January of the year in which they
 wish to travel. Regulations promulgated in January enable
 Czechoslovaks to receive hard currency from friends or
 relatives abroad for foreign travel or to use their own hard
 currency funds if they can demonstrate that they legally
 obtained such funds. In such cases, the traveler need not
 apply for the hard currency allocation from the Government.
 These new regulations have enabled many more Czechoslovaks to
 travel to the West than had previously been the case.
 Travel by citizens of Czechoslovakia to East European
 countries also is regulated. A special passport is required
 for trips to Yugoslavia, and travel to Poland has been
 strictly controlled since 1981. Travel to Hungary has been
 made more difficult by limiting the amount of currency which
 may be exchanged and the number of trips which may be made per
 year. Citizens deemed politically unreliable may be denied
 permission to travel outside of Czechoslovakia, including to
 other countries in Eastern Europe.
 
 
 1027
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 The right to emigrate is extremely limited. In general, only
 those wishing to join a foreign citizen spouse, or, in the
 case of retired persons, foreign citizen children abroad, have
 this right. Those caught while seeking to leave Czechoslovakia
 without official permission may be sentenced to between
 6 months and 5 years in prison. A general amnesty announced
 on October 27 will affect those persons convicted on the charge
 of seeking to leave or leaving the country illegally as well
 as on other charges incurring sentences of less than 2 years.
 The amnesty for those who left the country "illegally" could
 affect thousands who departed Czechoslovakia following the 1968
 Warsaw Pact invasion. Those who have taken a "hostile
 attitude toward the Socialist social and state system,"
 however, were specifically excluded from this part of the
 amnesty.
 Czechoslovakia in the past has denied the right of repatriation
 by stripping the citizenship from those citizens it wished' to
 keep out. Emigration passports are not valid for return
 without special endorsement, and in some cases permanent exile
 has been a condition for emigration or study abroad. There is
 a moderate outflow of persons from Czechoslovakia, primarily
 persons who leave the country legally. on vacation to
 non-Warsaw Pact countries and do not return, but precise
 statistics are unavailable.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the right to change the political
 leadership or the system of government. The Communist Party
 leadership makes all significant decisions regarding
 government, economic, and social affairs. Real power is
 exercised by only a few top-level officials in the party
 Presidium and Secretariat. They determine who will be placed
 in decisionmaking positionis not only within their own ranks
 but also throughout the Government, the economy, the media,
 and mass organizations. There are few women in high-level
 party and government positions. There is one woman in the
 party Secretariat, and she holds her position by virtue of
 being Chairman of the Women's Union. There are no female
 ministers at the national level or ambassadors abroad.
 Ordinary citizens, especially those who are not party members,
 have no role in selecting their leaders or in participating in
 political or economic decisions. Four minor political parties
 are permitted to exist and publish their own newspapers, but
 they must conform strictly to Communist Party directives. All
 parties and mass organizations are incorporated in the
 National Front, which is completely controlled by the
 Communist Party. Among its tasks is the nomination of a
 single slate of candidates to stand unopposed at all elections.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 As noted above, the Government permitted representatives of
 the U.S. nongovernmental organization Physicians for Human
 Rights to travel to Czechoslovakia in 1988 to investigate the
 circumstances surrounding the death in prison of Pavel Wonka
 and to meet with political prisoner Jiri Wolf. Nevertheless,
 Czechoslovakia generally reacts negatively to expressions of
 concern about human rights violations either by other
 governments or by nongovernmental institutions. Officials
 
 
 1028
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 have spoken with U.S. officials about the Czechoslovak
 Government's interpretation of human rights and of the limits
 which it contends must exist to provide adequate protection
 for society. During 1988 representatives of the Helsinki
 Watch Committee and Amnesty International were permitted to
 travel to Czechoslovakia.
 Two groups within Czechoslovakia concern themselves primarily
 with human rights issues. One is Charter 77, composed of
 persons who signed a document, first made public in January
 1977, calling on the Government to honor its commitments under
 international agreements on human rights, including the Final
 Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe,
 as well as human rights provisions in the Czechoslovak
 Constitution. The second group, VONS, uses public records and
 reports from friends and relatives of the accused to issue
 communiques in cases where it believes the police, the courts,
 or the prisons have abused citizens' rights. These
 communiques are distributed to Czechoslovak authorities.
 Members of both these groups are targets for harassment by the
 regime.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language or Social Status
 Health care, educational, retirement, and other services are
 provided without regard to race or sex. Membership in the
 Communist Party confers special access to goods and services
 (including education, medical services, and consumer items),
 and party officials receive particularly favorable treatment.
 Women are equal under the law, and there are small numbers of
 women in the.professions. However, female representation is
 very low in higher ranking political and managerial positions.
 Women comprise 46.5 percent of the work force, but they tend
 to be concentrated in lower paying, less skilled jobs. In
 nonagricultural activities, women's average wages amounted in
 1985 to 68.4 percent of those of men. Women do, however,
 receive pay equal to that of their male colleagues if they
 hold the same job.
 Czechoslovakia has two major nationalities--Czechs and
 Slovaks--and two substantial minorities--Hungarians and
 Gypsies. Czechoslovakia provides certain guarantees for
 minorities, but interethnic relations are still colored by
 historic animosities. Hungarians, who are concentrated in
 southern Slovakia, form the country's largest minority
 (555,000, according to official statistics). They are
 represented proportionately in federal and local legislative
 bodies but are underrepresented in high-level jobs in
 industry, government, and the party apparatus. The State
 provides some primary and secondary education in Hungarian and
 permits a limited number of ethnic Hungarians to pursue higher
 education in Hungary. Ethnic Hungarians complain, however,
 that Hungajian-language instruction at the elementary and
 secondary levels is being reduced, and that the lack of
 opportunities for higher education in Hungarian is creating a
 growing shortage of qualified Hungarian-language teachers.
 Gypsies, who number about 250,000, are the only other sizable
 minority. They tend to suffer from disproportionately high
 rates of poverty, crime, and disease. Their problems appear
 to result more from traditional and popular prejudice than
 from government policies.

 Approximately 30,000 Vietnamese laborers are temporarily
 working and residing in Czechoslovakia. Reportedly, they are
 allowed to retain two-thirds of their salary. The remainder
 is shared by the Czechoslovak and Vietnamese governments.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a- The Right of Association
 Workers do not have the right to associate freely or to
 strike. They may not establish and join organizations of
 their own choosing without previous authorization. An attempt
 to establish an independent trade union in the early 1980's
 was suppressed. The Czechoslovak labor union umbrella
 organization, the Revolutionary Trade Union Movement (ROH), is
 a mass organization strictly controlled by the Communist
 Party. Membership in official trade unions is virtually
 obligatory for workers. The RuH is affiliated with the World
 Federation of Trade Unions, whose headquarters are in Prague.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers do not have the right to organize or engage in
 collective bargaining. Special economic incentive zones do
 not exist in Czechoslovakia.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor does not exist in Czechoslovakia, bdt "work
 education" is required of prisoners. Former prisoners report
 that convicts face highe norms (quotas), lower pay, and
 poorer working conditions than do ordinary workers.
 The Constitution affirms the right and duty to work. In
 practice, persons considered politically unreliable are barred
 from professional positions and forced into menial, low-paid
 jobs such as coal stokers and nightwatchmen. The International
 Labor Organization has condemned this practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for full-time employment is 16, although
 younger persons may accept part-time employment. The law is
 effectively enforced.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The average workweek is 42.5 hours. Beyond 45 hours, workers
 are paid overtime, and there are additional bonuses for some
 shift and weekend work. The retirement age is 57 years for
 women and 60 years for men. The average pension is 55 percent
 of the average wage, an amount which can be insufficient to
 meet a citizen's needs if not supplemented from other
 sources. A welfare system does exist to supplement these
 resources if need can be demonstrated.
 There is a nominal labor shortage induced by low productivity
 and the underutilization of the labor force. The need for
 unskilled and semiskilled labor is filled in part by workers
 from other Communist countries.
 Working conditions appear generally acceptable, although far
 less attention is paid to occupational safety and health than
 in most advanced industrial economies. The problem of
 environmental pollution, especially in heavily industrialized
 
 
 1030
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 areas and in industries in which environmental safeguards have
 been neglected, has become acute for the working population.
 Czechoslovakia does not have a state-wide, legally mandated
 minimum wage. However, individual ministries establish wage
 scales of economic enterprises. Workers appear to be able to
 secure minimally acceptable standards of living for themselves
 and their families based on these wage scales.
 Amendments enacted on December 14 to the labor code generally
 strengthened the powers of management, which now may:
 terminate a worker's employment with 2 months' (instead of 6
 months') notice, giving no reason; terminate a worker's
 employment for any serious infringement of work discipline
 (instead of for major or repeated infringements); search the
 work force coming to and leaving work; check for alcohol
 intoxication and drug use; reduce workers' wages for producing
 substandard products; extend a worker's probationary period
 from 1 to 3 months; and determine independently timework,
 piecework, and other wages, bonuses, and rewards. The Labor
 Ministry is to fix stricter criteria for time off from work.
 Under the amendments, workers are eligible for leave after 60
 days on the job instead of 5 months, and maternity leave
 without pay is lengthened to 3 years.
