 AFGHANISTAN*
 The political situation in Afghanistan in 1993 was characterized by the absence
 of effective central authority and an ongoing civil war among contending political
 factions. Governmental functions, where they were performed at all, were split be-
 tween a fragmented central Government and several warring factions and regional
 councils which attempted-with mixed success-to establish some local civil admin-
 istration. In March leaders of nine major political groups met in Islamabad, Paki-
 stan and agreed, under the terms of the Islamabad Accords, to participate in a tran-
 sitional grand coalition until elections could be held. Fighting among various groups
 continued, however, and in May the factional leaders reconvened in Jalalabad and
 agreed on how the transition was to be implemented. The terms of these Accords
 have not been fully met and, despite the drafting of an interim set of constitutional
 principles and inconclusive discussions about elections, intermittent fighting and a
 general political stalemate continued in Kabul.
 No formal internal security apparatus has been established by the coalition Gov-
 ernment. The unstable political situation, exacerbated by the presence of well-armed
 party militias in the capital, has produced an array of regional security bodies,
 many of which frequently operate independently of both party authorities and the
 fractious central Government.
 The Afghan economy is based on agriculture, with land tenure in the hands of
 individuals or family/tribal groups and with some land remaining under feudal con-
 trol of the traditional Khans. The collapse of irrigation systems, deterioration of
 market roads, and the danger of millions of unmarked land mines have seriously
 impeded agricultural production. Small-scale commerce, manufacturing, and mining
 activities also exist.
 In the volatile and tense political environment of 1993, human rights were rou-
 tinely violated on a large scale. The country had no constitution national judicial
 system, or effective central government. Observance of human rights varied greatly
 from place to place, depending on the character of the local commander and his rela-
 tionship with the local populace.
 Throughout much of the country, there was a continued absence of the rule of law.
 While conditions approaching near normalcy returned to parts of the north, central,
 and western regions, Kabul was wracked by intermittently heavy fighting and wide-
 spread human rights abuses. Forces loyal to various factions re presented in the coa-
 lition Government rocketed and shelled the capital in battles that left an estimated
 18,000 people, mostly civilians, dead or wounded. Gunmen are said to have engaged
 in looting, rape, andmurder of civilians in the ongoing struggle to control the cap-
 ital.
 RESPFCT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Thousands of Afghans, including
 specific individuals targeted for assassination, died in 1993 during the course of the
 civil conflict. Perpetrators and motives were difficult to identify in most cases, as
 political motives were often entwined with family and tribal feuds, battles over drug
 turf, religious zealotry and personal vendettas.
 Intense factional fighting in Kabul in February was marked by reported excesses,
 even atrocities, attributed to both Hezb-i-Wahdat fighters and the Ittehad-i-Islami/
 Shura-i-Nazar alliance. These reports included incidents of mass rape, abduction,
 *Since the staff of the American Embassy in Kabul was withdrawn for security reasons in
 1989, the United States has no official presence in Afghanistan. This report therefore draws to
 a large extent on non-U.S. government sources.

 and the torture and murder of both combatant prisoners and civilians. In February,
 according to press reports, approximately 60 women were seized by armed men,
 held in the Institute of Social Sciences in Kabul, raped and killed. Also in February,
 four U.N. employees were murdered near the city of Jalalabad. Neither the motive
 nor identity of the killers was discovered. In July in Nangarhar province, a local
 group, calling itself 'he Oppressed" and supported by members of the former Com-
 munist regime, was attacked by other factions, including men loyal to Shomali
 Khan, a member of the Nangarhar Provincial Council. At least a dozen members
 of The Oppressed were captured and summarily executed. In September Shomali
 Khan was himself killed, along with four bodyguards and some 20 bystanders, in
 a hail of bullets and rockets in Jalalabad. Shortly afterward, Nasir Khan, Shomali
 Khan's brother, was detained by a rival faction commander, allegedly tortured, and
 killed while in custody. Also in September, Mansur Nadiri, a leader of the minority
 Ismaili sect, reportedly escaped an assassination attempt in Kabul that killed a
 number of his bodygards, and Yunis Qanuni, political director in the Ministry of
 Defense, was seriously wounded when a bomb concealed in a vendor's cart exploded
 as his car passed nearby. None of the perpetrators was apprehended.
 Convicted murderers were summarily shot after Shari'a court trials in Kunar,
 Kabul, and Nangarhar provinces. There were also reports of instances in which rel-
 atives of a murder victim were allowed by local commanders to "slaughter" the con-
 victed murderer, using a knife in a so-called "qisas" (revenge) ritual. In one well-
 publicized case in northern Helmand province, the wife of a murder victim carried
 out the sentence; this was believed to be the first case of a "qisas" killing by a
 woman.
 b. Disappearance.-Hostage taking was again common in 1993, particularly dur-
 ing the outbursts of heavy fighting in Kabul in January, February, and May. The
 Government was unable or unwilling to bring an end to this practice. An American
 citizen of Afghan origin and several dozen Soviet prisoners of'war who disappeared
 during the Soviet-Afghan conflict remained unaccounted for.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were numerous unconfirmed reports that ill-treatment and torture were used
 to extract information from prisoners being held by feuding political factions.
 Traditional laws and punishments were often invoked in the absence of a func-
 tioning judicial system. These punishments traditionally include the amputation of
 hands and feet for those convicted of theft. International press reports suggest that
 women were frequently abused and often raped by fighters from the various warring
 factions especially in Kabul.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Informed observers agree that the rule
 of law has broken down in most of Afghanistan. Justice is administered locally with-
 out reference to any clear central legal system. Little is known about legal protec-
 tion under current conditions, and it is doubtful that any uniform procedures exist
 for taking persons into custody and bringing them to trial.
 The factions that form the coalition Government and independent local command-
 ers are believed to hold up to 1,300 opponents or hostages in private prisons.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-With the widespread breakdown of the judicial
 system, little was known about the administration of justice in 1993, although some
 municipalities and provincial authorities were known to have held public trials. Var-
 ious leaders of the national political parties strongly back the imposition of Shari'a,
 or Islamic law, and it appeared that many local and provincial legal procedures
 were based on Islamic juridical precepts. Traditional tribal procedures also play a
 prominent role in the judicial process in some parts of Afghanistan; in many in-
 stances it is likely that these procedures do not accord with the protection of a fair
 public trial envisioned by international human rights standards.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-During
 periods of intense fighting in Kabul, there were many instances of looting, forced
 entry of homes, and other forms of arbitrary interference by members of factions
 contending for control of the capital.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Five major factions, aligned in two loose coalitions, fought over Kabul,
 wreaking widespread destruction and causing many deaths.
 Despite Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's denials, credible reports indicate
 his Hezb-i-Islami faction fired numerous rockets at the capital, frequently demolish-
 ing residential or commercial districts of no discernible military value. Artillery,
 tank cannon fire, m.)rtars, rocket-propelled grenades, and automatic weapons were
 employed regularly and indiscriminately in Kabul in the low-intensity fighting.
 In February gunmen affiliated with Abdul Rasul Sayyaf's Ittehad-i Islami group
 and those of former Defense Minister Ahmad Shah Masood's Shura-i-Nazar seized
 the largely Shi'a neighborhood of Afshar from the rival Shi'a Wahdat militia. On
 
 
 1317
 Febru ar7 11th and 12th, armed men rampaged thrugh th~e quarter, raping, looting,
 andkillmg cilians. One eyewitness reprted to an Aghan media source that he
 had seen an elderly Shi'a man nailed to a tree and then shot in the head. An Afghan
 human rights organization reported that marauding militiamen chopped off limbs
 and slit the throats of civilians with bayonets. Estimates of civilians mutilated,
 killed, or raped in Afshar ranged from several dzen to over a thousand.
 There were indications that armed factions were dragooning civilians to serve as
 porters or trench-diggers. In Baglan Province, one organization allegedly forcibly
 conscripted a member from each amily in the area to serve in its militia.
 Millions of land mines sown by Soviet regime, or resistance forces remain scat-
 tered around fortifications and roads and in the countryside. There is a U.N.-spon-
 sored program to detect and remove mines, but the devices will pose a significant
 hazard to civilians for years to come.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedoms of speech and press are not guaran-
 teed, and in practice th Government lacks the authority to protect them.
 A number of daily and weekly newspapers are published in Afghanistan; they are
 generally under the control of the central or regional government or are organs of
 one of the political parties. The government-owned radio and television services
 were under the control of President Burhanuddin Rabbani's Jamiat-i-Islami party,
 but air time was occasionally granted to other groups. Prime Minister Gulbuddin
 Hekmatyar and National Islamic Movement leader General Abdul Rashid Dostam
 periodically broadcast radio and television programs from their own facilities.
 In August AfghaNews reported that Prime Minister Hekmatyar sought to dis-
 suade Kabul Radio from reporting rocket attacks on the city and sought reprisals
 against local journalists who wrote unflattering articles about him.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-In the current unsettled condi-
 tions, Afghans have a bewildering array of political groups with which they are free
 to associate. However, the prohibition against non-Islamic political parties remains
 in effect. Peaceful assembly was limited in practical terms by the dangerous security
 conditions in Kabul but was practiced elsewhere. Public mass demonstrations were
 occasionally held; in August several thousand people affiliated with a number of Af-
 han parties reportedly demonstrated without interference in the northern city of
 aloqan against alleged Russian and Tjikistani bombardment of Afghan villages in
 reprisal for ross-border raids by insurgents opposed to the Government of
 Tajikistan.
 c. Freedom of Re/igion.-Approximately 85 percent of Afghanistan's population is
 Sunni Muslim. Islam is the state religion, as enshrined in the official name of the
 country, the Islamic State of Afghanistan. In September the draft constitutional
 principles prepared under the auspices of President Rabbani declared the Hanafi
 Sunni) rite as the basis of the State's Islamic foundation. The minority Shi'a com-
 munity strongly objected, and the Shi'a Wahdat militia reportedy responded by at-
 tacking Abdul Rasul Sayyafs religiously conservative Sunm forces.
 Non-Muslims resident in Afghanistan may practice their faith, but may not pros-
 elytize, according to an official Afghan source. The country's small Sikh and Hindu
 communities, once totaling some 50,000, continued to dwindle as their members
 emigrated or became refigees in the wake of the intense religious violence to which
 they were subjected in some urban areas following the destruction of the Ayodya
 mosque in India in December 1992. There were scattered reports that zairats,
 shrines of Sufi Muslim orders, and some pre-Islamic funereal totems in Nuristan
 were also being vandalized.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Afghans were able to travel with relative freedom  both within and
 across the country's borders. However, travel was restricted by the deterioration of
 the national road network, the millions of undetected land mines, brigandage, and
 the unsettled political situation. Quasi-authorized checkpoints extracted tolls in
 cash or kind from travelers. Ethnic tensions limited the ability of some g-oups to
 travel safely through areas controlled by other groups. This made repatriation of Af-
 ghans who had fled to Pakistan and Iran difficult or, for some, impossible.
 As a result of 15 years of fighting, Afghans form the world's largest refugee popu-
 lation, comprised predominantly of women and children. The high rates of return
 in 1992, when 1.4 million Afghans repatriated from Pakistan and Iran, fell sharply
 in 1993. Approximately 600,000 refugees returned to Afghanistan in 1993, two-
 thirds of them from Iran. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR) and the Government of Pakistan, in late 1993 there were 1.46
 million Afghan refugees in Pakistan. In addition, roughly 2 million Afghan refugees
 remained in Iran.
 
 
 1318
 During 1993 approximately 60,000 Tajiks, fleeing civil conflict in Tajikistan,
 sought refuge in Afghanistan. In December some 40,000 Tajik refugees remained en-
 camped in northern Afghanistan. Threats from    militant extremist groups, who
 wished to manipulate both the refugees and international organizations for their
 own ends, kept the UNHCR and other international organizations from working
 with about half of this large refugee population.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 In the absence of a functioning central authority, citizens did not, in 1993, have
 the ability to change their government through peaceful, democratic means. The
 Grand Council convoked by President Rabbani in late 1992, which unilaterally ex-
 tended his tenure for 2 years, was not regarded as legitimate by other political fac-
 tions. After severe fighting broke out in January and February, the leaders of nine
 rival factions met in Islamabad, Pakistan, in March and agreed to form a transi-
 tional grand coalition until elections could be held. The Islamabad Accords were de-
 railed in May by another outburst of fighting among the signatory groups over de-
 tails of their implementation. The faction leaders reconvened in Jalabad, where
 in late May they signed the Jalalabad Accords, agreeing to a mechanism for forming
 a transitional government. The two key elements of the Jalalabad Accords were an
 agreement to hold a council of commanders to choose Ministers of Defense and Inte-
 nor, and the collection of heavy weapons by these authorities prior to national elec-
 tions. However, these key stipulations had not been implemented by the end of the
 year.
 In September President Rabbani appointed a 44-member commission to draft an
 interim set of constitutional principles. This document was rejected by two Shi'a
 parties and other leaders who objected to its contents on religious grounds or viewed
 the process itself as illegitimate. Prime Minister Hekmatyar and others pressed for
 early national elections to overcome the political stalemate, but political infighting
 prevented progress on this issue as well.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no known local human rights groups in Afghanistan, and the unsettled
 conditions in Kabul made it difficult for any hiuman rights organizations to effec-
 tively monitor human rights issues.
 The U.N.'s Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in Afghanistan visited Kabul in
 September. He met with senior Afghan officials and others and issued a report of
 his findings in November. The International Committee of the Red Cross was al-
 lowed to begin prison visits late in the year, in addition to continuing to provide
 medical services in Kabul and several provincial capitals. The Afghan League of
 Human Rights, based in Peshawar, Pakistan, issued a report in July condemning
 human rights abuses in Afghanistan. The organizer of the League reported that he
 subsequently became the target of threats from parties criticized in the report.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-The participation of women in activities beyond the home and fields is
 limited by longstanding customs and reli.ious beliefs. The Communist regime in the
 1980's official[y sanctioned a wider public role for women, whose status improved,
 particularly in urban areas, as they ean tmove,particularly in urban areas, into
 nontraditional occupations. However, the Mujaheddin victory over the Communist
 regime prom pted a return to more traditional roles for women, largely restricted to
 the home or t all-female environments such as teaching in girls schools or working
 in female health clinics. Reports by travelers to Kabul in late 1993 indicated that
 some female newscasters had returned to Afghan television, although they were ap-
 parently subject to a strict, conservative Islamic dress code.
 Children.-In the absence of an effective central authority in Kabul, it is not pos-
 sible to assess the Government's commitment to the human rights and welfare of
 children. Various provincial and national governmental agencies, frequently in con-
 junction with international voluntary organizations, the United Nations, and bilat.
 eral donors made some efforts to address the most pressing social welfare needs of
 children, particularly in education and health care.
 People with Disabilities.-The mentally and physically disabled suffe 'ed as a re-
 sult of the anarchic situation existing in much of the country. The international
 media reported that residents of Kabul's 600-bed Marastun home for the blind, des-
 titute, and mentally ill were abandoned by the staff in January as the security situ-
 ation deteriorated. Many of the patients wandered away amid the fighting, other
 stayed and lived unattended and largely unfed, more than a dozen were killed in
 
 
 1319
 crossfire or rocket attacks, and a number of mentally ill women were reportedly
 raped by gunmen who repeatedly broke into the home.
 There is no information indicating whether the Government has enacted legisla-
 tion mandating provision of accessibility for the disabled. Available evidence indi-
 cates a large portion of health care activity of international humanitarian relief or-
 ganizations focused on providing prostheses and therapy to victims of land mines.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-There was little reliable reporting on labor laws and
 practices. No labor rallies or strikes were reported. The Government does not have
 the means to enforce worker rights at present, nor is there a functional constitu-
 tional or legal framework that defines and protects them.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There is no tradition of genu-
 ine labor-management bargaining in Afghanistan. There is no information on any
 progress in establishing labor courts and other mechanisms for the resolution of dis-
 putes.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-No information is available on
 government edicts regarding forced or compulsory labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-There is no evidence that the Gov-
 ernment enforces a labor law relating to the employment of children.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-No information on any statutory minimum
 wage is available. Provision appears to be made for time off for prayers and observ-
 ance of religious holidays. There appear to be no effective enforcement mechanisms
 to ensure fair and safe labor practices.
