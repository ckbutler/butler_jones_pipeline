 MALI
 In 1991 the 23-year-old, single-party military dictatorship of
 President Moussa Traore was overthrown, leading to the
 establishment of a transitional government which pledged to
 establish a multiparty democracy with free elections by January
 1992. The transition period was later extended to March 26,
 1992. On March 26, 1991, after 4 days'of intense
 antigovernment rioting, a group of 17 military officers
 arrested President Traore and suspended the constitution.
 Within days, these officers joined with the Coordinating
 Committee of Democratic Associations to form a predominantly
 civilian 25-member ruling body, the Transitional Committee for
 the Salvation of the People (CTSP). The CTSP issued a
 fundamental code, the basic governing document for the
 transitional period, and appointed a civilian prime minister
 and transitional government. A National Conference held in
 August produced a proposed new constitution, political parties
 charter, and electoral code. In a referendum on January 12,
 1992, the new Constitution was approved. Lt. Colonel Amadou
 Toumani Toure became Head of State during the transition period.
 The country was affected by rebellious activity in the north,
 which varied from politically motivated rebels seeking an
 autonomous Tuareg state to simple banditry. Rebel activity,
 which started in mid-1990, had subsided by the time the
 previous government signed accords with two rebel groups in
 January 1991. Dissident rebel elements continued sporadic
 attacks in the early part of the year, which escalated after
 the change of government. There were credible reports of
 civilians killed and abducted by rebels, of extrajudicial
 killing committed by the military, and of the theft by rebels
 of vehicles belonging to private voluntary organizations
 involved in food distribution. The transition Government made
 strenuous efforts to find a political solution to the problem
 and held a series of conferences of all parties in late 1991,
 with more scheduled for early 1992.
 Mali's armed forces number some 7,000 and are under the control
 of the Minister of Defense. The gendarmerie (paramilitary
 police) and local police forces have primary responsibility for
 maintaining internal security. Military forces were deployed
 throughout the northern regions of the country to deal with
 insurgency and banditry. The military's credibility was
 profoundly shaken when it used lethal force to put down the
 antiregime demonstrations that led to the arrest of then
 president Traore on March 26. Subsequently, the CTSP made
 strenuous efforts to reestablish discipline among the troops
 and to prepare officers for a changed role for the military
 under civilian democracy, but problems remained, especially in
 the north.
 With an annual per capita gross national product of
 approximately $290, Mali is one of the world's poorest
 countries. Mali's economy rests primarily on subsistence
 farming and animal husbandry, making it highly dependent on
 good rainfalls for its economic well-being. The transitional
 Government continued efforts to modernize the economy through
 fiscal reform and made determined efforts to end government
 corruption. Nonetheless, Mali remained heavily dependent on
 external aid. Private enterprise was encouraged as part of
 economic.reform and liberalization programs.
 Although therelwere significant violations of human rights in
 1991, especially those associated-with the conflict in the
 north and the end of the Traore regime, the change in
 
 
 231
 MALI
 government in most respects improved the human rights
 situation. Political rights were greatly expanded, and freedom
 of speech, press, assembly, and association increased
 significantly. The new Constitution provides broad protection
 of human rights and civil liberties. Because of good media
 coverage of the events, more Malians became aware of their
 rights and were less afraid to file complaints when these
 rights were violated. At the end of the year, the transition
 Government had taken many steps toward the establishment of a
 multiparty democracy based on the rule of law, including
 scheduling municipal, legislative, and presidential elections
 for early 1992.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of targeted political killings.. There
 were, however, numerous instances of extrajudicial killing by
 security forces using excessive force in putting down
 antiregime demonstrations in Bamako and in dealing with the
 rebellion in the north (see Section l.g.)..
 b. Disappearance
 Rebels frequently abducted civilians during raids on villages.
 Some of them were released, others are known to be held by
 rebels, but the whereabouts of still others are unknown.
 Although there were no reported incidents of abduction or
 hostage-taking attributable to the Government, there reportedly
 have been incidents in which persons detained by security
 forces in the north have been.killed (see Section l.g.).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The new Constitution prohibits torture and inhuman, cruel,
 degrading, or humiliating treatment, and the transitional
 Government made strides toward ending the physical abuse of
 suspected persons which sometimes occurred during police
 interrogation. Widespread publicity given to issues of human
 rights made citizens more willing to complain-, which
 constrained individual police officers in their treatment of
 arrestees. The transitional Government also improved
 conditions in prisons, rebuilding the Bamako central jail,
 improving food and medical services, and separating hardened
 criminals from lesser offenders. In addition, it authorized
 the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to conduct
 a seminar for prison officials on the treatment of prisoners.
 Many prisons outside the capital, however, are still harsh and
 are characterized by inadequate medical facilities and food
 supplies:
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Malian judicial system is based on the French model, and
 the fundamental code and the new Constitution expanded the
 rights of arrested individuals. Persons arrested must be
 charged or released ithin 48 hours. Malian law does not
 provide for release on bail, but detainees are sometimes
 released on their own recognizance. Administrative backlogs
 often cause delays in bringing people to trial. The new
 
 
 MALI
 Constitution gives arrested persons the right to have a lawyer
 of their choice present at all questioning; even before the
 constitution was promulgated, persons began to demand that this
 right be accorded them. Lawyers are quite active in making
 sure detainees have representation; many provide pro bono
 service.
 A number of Tuaregs were detained by military authorities in
 the wake of rebel and bandit attacks in the northern regions.
 By November all those detained had been released, except for 22
 persons who were transferred to Bamako and charged with
 specific crimes. Those Tuaregs arrested during 1990 were
 released after the signing of the Tamanrasset Accords in
 January 1991.
 At the time of the overthrow of the previous regime, the former
 president, his family, all government ministers and members of
 the party executive committee, and many others were detained.
 Following investigations by a special commission of the
 judicial police, the investigating judge formally charged all
 former officials with specific violations of the law and
 initiated detailed investigations of the cases, as required,
 prior to trial. Two of the "former" president's children
 continue to be detained without charge. Two other children and
 one grandchild are being held in protective custody.
 Detention of political demonstrators, which was sometimes
 practiced by the previous regime, was discontinued under the
 transitional Government. Many Malians who were in exile under
 the previous regime returned to live in their country in 1991.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The transitional Government basically retained the existing
 court structure, with two notable changes: it declared the
 judiciary independent of the legislative and executive power,
 and it abolished the special court of state security, which
 operated outside the regular judicial system.
 The Fundamental Code and the new Constitution provide for. the
 independence of the judiciary.  However, the Ministry of
 Justice appoints judges and supervises both law enforcement and
 judicial functions. The Superior Judicial Council, which
 supervises judicial activity, is headed by the President of the
 Republic. The Supreme Court has both judicial and
 administrative powers. Under the Constitution, there will be a
 separate constitutional court and a high court of justice, with
 the power to try senior government officials in cases of
 treason.
 Except in the case of minors, trials are public and defendants
 have the right to be present and to have an attorney of their
 choice. Defendants are presumed innocent and have the right to
 appeal decisions to the Supreme Court. Many members of the
 former government, including the former president and his wife,
 were charged by the regular criminal court with corruption and
 embezzlement; others have been formally charged with violations
 of law in connection with the-shooting of demonstrators during
 the riots in January and March. The Government pledged to try
 these persons in accordance with the law and prevented efforts
 by some groups to use the National Conference as a popular
 tribunal. No trials had begun by the end of the year. All
 members of the former government reportedly had access to
 lawyers.
 
 
 233
 MALI
 Another concern was a wave of vigilante justice which erupted
 after the overthrow of the previous regime, but it declined by
 the end of 1991. In the wake of massive jailbreaks and overall
 lack of confidence in the security system, mobs in Bamako and
 other towns on more than 15 occasions captured and killed
 suspected thieves. However, special police units in several
 cases rescued threatened individuals and treated them in
 accordance with the law.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 Inviolability of the home is provided for in both the old and
 new Constitutions and generally is respected in practice.
 Police searches-are infrequent, and warrants are issued by a
 judge and recorded, though sometimes after the fact. Local
 authorities sometimes seize and open mail extralegally.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 In March, during 4 days of rioting and demonstrations which
 preceded the overthrow of the previous regime, security forces
 in Bamako and several other cities opened fire on
 demonstrators, killing 216 and wounding 717. Some of the
 killings occurred while demonstrators were looting and burning
 government buildings; many others occurred as security forces
 attempted to stop peaceful demonstrations. In addition, there
 are credible reports that 65 persons died when security forces
 set fire to a building into which demonstrators had fled. The
 transitional Government arrested and charged a number of senior
 military officials who were believed responsible for issuing
 live ammunition to the troops.
 The Tuareg rebellion in the north resulted in the deaths of
 many civilians, rebels, and Malian military and government
 officials. The number of dead in the conflict is uncertain,
 but at least 39 civilians were killed by Tuaregs in at least 29
 attacks. In one case, the Government reports a woman was
 killed by rebels after she refused to accompany them back to
 their camp.
 The military's response to these attacks included reprisals
 against unarmed Tuaregs and Maurs. On November 14, soldiers
 summarily executed 10 Tuareg civilians near Menaka in reprisal
 for the killing of military dependents earlier that day,
 according to credible reports. In Timbuktu on December 12,
 soldiers murdered leading Tuareg notable and government
 supporter Mohamadoum Ag Hamani and eight members of his
 household following an attack, possibly by a Tuareg faction, on
 the Governor's residence. There were confirmed reports that,
 on May 21, a group of soldiers summarily executed 34 nomads in
 Lere, and credible reports that in July they executed 15 more
 near Tonka. The President repudiated such behavior, and the
 Government reportedly transferred and disciplined the soldiers
 involved,'but no one was arrested or tried, largely out of'
 concern over possible military discontent should the officers
 be publicly humiliated. -
 Aside from those who died or were wounded in rebel attacks and
 army reprisals, many nomads lost cattle herds, and commercial
 enterprises were destroyed. Rebels stole vehicles from private
 voluntary organizations, making food distribution in the region
 extremely difficult. The number of deaths in the conflict is
 difficult to estimate. Credible reports put total civilian
 
 
 2M4
 MALI
 Tuareg deaths at the hands of the military at around 70. It is
 likely that the Malian military and the various rebel and
 bandit groups lost as many as 150 people each.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 With the installation of the transitional Government in March,
 Malians enjoy virtually complete freedom of speech and press.
 Both the Fundamental Code and the new Constitution contain
 strong affirmations of these freedoms. At the National
 Conference, citizens from all segments of society voiced
 opinions, including often strong complaints, about government
 policy and leaders and direct criticism of the President of the
 Transitional Council, which were broadcast live on the
 state-owned radio system.
 There are some 15 independent newspapers and journals. The
 government-owned newspaper and radio and television system are
 open and give space to a wide range of views. In September the
 transitional Government announced that it would allow the
 creation of private radio and television stations, and a
 subcommission was established under the Minister of
 Communications to prepare regulations for private
 broadcasting. By the end of the year, two private radio
 stations were operating in Bamako.
 Political meetings take place openly and without interference.
 The political pressures which previously inhibited academic
 freedom have all but disappeared.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 One of the first acts of the CTSP was to allow the free
 formation of political parties and other associations. The
 Constitution affirms this right. Some 46 political parties and
 at least as many professional and special interest associations
 were formed and operated freely. While no parties have
 established formal ties with those in other countries, there
 are no restrictions on their doing so. Permits must be
 obtained for mass demonstrations, but these are now routinely
 granted.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Mali's status as a secular state is reconfirmed in the new
 Constitution. The Government generally does not discriminate
 on religious grounds. Although 90 percent of Malians are
 Muslim, members of other religions practice their faiths freely
 and are permitted to establish houses of worship and schools.
 Christian missionaries of various faiths, including foreign
 missionaries, operate freely. Proselytizing and conversion are
 permitted, except in the case of the Baha'i. The Government
 prohibits publications in which one religious group defames
 another; the Minister of Territorial Administration determines
 whether such a publication is defamatory. This law is rarely
 applied, however.
 While administrative orders promulgated in 1977 prohibiting
 Baha'i from meeting in groups of more than three people remain
 in force, these orders are not enforced, and Baha'i practice
 their faith without interference.
 
 
 MALI
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement in Mali is generally unimpeded, although
 police checks occur in which Malians and foreigners alike are
 stopped, particularly at night. These checks are used
 ostensibly to restrict the movement of contraband goods and to
 check vehicle registrations. In practice, some police
 supplement their salaries by assessing ad hoc fines or
 confiscating goods. As part of its anticorruption campaign,
 the Government attempted to end these abuses. An exit visa is
 no longer required.
 In recent years, Mali has both accepted and generated
 refugbes. Some 13,000 Mauritanian Peuhl refugees who fled
 strife in their country in 1989'settled in Mali and were
 generally absorbed into the local economy. Some 140 Liberian
 refugees who fled to Mali in 1990 were relocated to Cote
 D'Ivoire in 1991 under a program of the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees. In 1991 the insecurity in Mali's
 northern regions led some 18,000 Malian Maurs and Tuaregs to
 flee to Mauritania and thousands to flee to Algeria, perhaps
 35,000, according to Malian government estimates. Several
 thousand Tuaregs who had fled drought conditions in 1984-85 and
 had begun to be repatriated to Mali in 1990 returned to Algeria
 as refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 DUring 23 years of single-party military rule, Malians were
 unable to change their government through peaceful means.
 However, the Transitional Committee for the People's Salvation
 (CTSP), which assumed power in March, laid the groundwork for
 multiparty democracy in which citizens will be able to elect
 their government and change it through peaceful means.
 The CTSP is made up of 15 civilians representing organizations
 which led the prodemocracy movement (including the national
 labor union) and 10 military officers, led by Lt. Colones
 Amadou Toumani Toure, who is Head of State for the transition
 period. Upon assuming power, the CTSP appointed a transition
 Government comprising mainly technocrats charged with
 day-to-day operations of the Government and with conducting
 elections planned for early 1992. The CTSP almost immediately
 allowed the formation of political parties, with the only
 restriction being a prohibition against parties based on
 religion, ethnic group, region, or gender. By September there
 weresome 46 registered political parties.
 In August a widely representative national conference adopted a
 proposed new constitution, a political parties charter, .and an
 electoral code, which will be the basic documents of the new
 political system. The new Constitution, which contains broad
 provisions on civil rights and liberties, was adopted in a
 referendum on January 12, 1992.  It provides for direct
 election of the President for a term of 5 years (with a limit
 of two terms), direct election at the district level of members
 of the National Assembly, a separation of executive,
 legislative, and judicial powers, and control of the military
 by the President.* Members of the CTSP and military officers
 who wished to stand for office were required to resign their
 posts by the end of August.- Members of-the transitional
 Government were excluded from running for office in these
 elections. The Government immediately began preparations for
 
 
 236
 MALI
 the elections, and political parties started operations
 throughout the country. The test of the system will come in
 the elections and completion of transfer of power from the CTSP
 to the newly elected president, including the return of the
 military to their barracks, now scheduled for March 26, 1992.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The independent Malian Association for Human Rights (AMDH),
 established in 1989, was prominent in the prodemocracy movement
 and active in the drawing up of the new Constitution. Two of
 its members sit on the CTSP. AMDH lawyers represent individual
 cases of human rights violations before courts and work to
 inform people of their rights. There was some concern that the
 AMDH's representation on the CTSP and the involvement of its
 president in a political party would jeopardize its
 independence. The Fundamental Code and the new Constitution
 make reference to the universal declaration of human rights.
 The transitional Government addressed some human rights
 questions much more forthrightly than did the previous
 government and has been much more open with international
 organizations concerned with human rights questions. It
 replied publicly to Amnesty International's letters regarding
 the military's killing of Tuaregs in Lere and Tonka in May and
 July. It has invited the ICRC to observe the situation in the
 north and published information about the ICRC's activities.
 ICRC representatives are stationed in two northern towns and
 are permitted to travel widely. They have visited persons
 abducted by rebels and toured all civilian and military
 detention facilities in the north. The Government also allowed
 the ICRC and the local human rights association access to
 members of the former government who were under arrest or being
 detained.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Virtually all of Mali's ethnic and language groups are
 represented at all levels of government and society, and suffer
 little discrimination. The nomad populations are not
 completely integrated into the economic and political
 mainstream, however, and they resent being politically
 dominated by other, more numerous ethnic groups. In April and
 May, Tuareg and Maur nomadic groups became the target of ethnic
 rioting in Gao and Timbuktu in reprisal for attacks by rebels
 on the local population. While there was evidence of
 complicity of some elements of thq security forces, there were
 also eyewitness accounts of police rescuing potential victims.
 The Government attempted thereafter to try to reduce
 interethnic strife as part of its overall efforts to restore
 security in the north. At the end of 1991, tension and racial
 polarization remained high throughout the north.
 Although the new Constitution reaffirms that there shall not be
 discrimination, social and cultural factors place men in the
 dominant position in Mali. There are a number of women in the
 professions and in important posts in government--three members
 of the transitional Government are women--but economic and
 educational opportunities for women are limited. Women live
 under harsh conditions, especially in the rural areas.
 According to a 1991 United Nations report, females in Mali
 receive only 29 percent of the schooling of males.
 
 
 237
 MALI
 Traditional practice and existing Malian laws place women at a
 disadvantage with regard to family and property rights.
 However, many newly formed women's organizations began actively
 seeking the improvement of women's rights, and many questions
 were addressed at the national conference, with the goal of
 improving the condition of women.
 Violence against women, including wife beating, is accepted in
 Malian society, though there are no statistics to indicate how
 widespread it may be. The society generally does not tolerate
 spousal abuse resulting in physical injury and deals with the
 problem informally at the village level; for example, a village
 chief may intervene to stop the abuse and punish the
 perpetrator. Legal action for redress of injury is not
 normally available, although severe physical injury is grounds
 for divorce. The issue of spousal abuse was not addressed by
 the transitional Government. Many of the new women's
 organizations and some independent journals campaign against
 female circumcision, which is still a widely accepted practice
 in Mali. The transition Government continued radio and
 television broadcasts intended to discourage female
 circumcision but did not pass legislation prohibiting the
 practice.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The new Constitution specifically provides for the freedom of
 workers to form or join unions and, unlike the old
 constitution, does not limit them to the National Union-of
 Malian Workers (UNTM). While most unions are still part of the
 UNTM, higher education teachers left the teachers' branch of
 the UNTM and created an independent union which has been"
 officially recognized by the Ministry of Education. The UNTM
 was a leading force in the movement that led to the overthrow
 of the previous regime. Three of its members, including'its
 President, now sit on the ruling Transitional Committee for the
 People's Salvation (CTSP), though the.UNTM has maintained its
 independence from the Government.
 The new Constitution provides for the right to strike. After
 the fall of the previous government, there were several
 strikes, some for higher wages, some for improved working
 conditions, and some to demand different managers in state
 enterprises. These strikes were generally resolved by
 negotiations between the labor unions, the new Government, and
 the economic entity involved. While strikes were rarely
 allowed under the previous regime, the UNTM held a 2-day
 general strike in January to demand higher wages and called a
 general strike in March to demand the resignation of former
 President Traore.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The change in government reduced some of the constraints on
 workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively, notably
 by ending the UNTM's legal status as the sole union. Wages and
 salaries for those workers belonging to UNTM unions are still
 set by tripartite negotiations between the Ministry of Labor,
 the labor unions, and representatives of the federation of
 employers of the sector for which the wages are being set.
 Workers in some industries also created associations which
 started to function like unions to make demands and operate
 outside of the tripartite system. The new Constitution does
 
 
 238
 MALI
 not address the question of antiunion discrimination. No
 export processing zones exist in Mali.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The new Constitution prohibits forced or compulsory labor.
 Although not sanctioned or upheld by law, debt slavery
 reportedly exists in the salt mining communities north of
 Timbuktu. Since the change of government in March, however,
 many of those treated as slaves have refused to continue
 working under those conditions.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment is 14, but with parents'
 permission children may be apprenticed at age 12. In practice,
 many employers ignore this regulation. In addition, children
 in rural areas and in the informal sector are not protected by
 laws against unjust compensation, excessive hours, and
 capricious discharge. The labor inspection service of the
 Ministry of Labor is responsible for enforcement of child labor
 laws. The law is reasonably effective in the modern sector but
 has no effect on the vast number of children who work in the
 informal sector.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Mali has a detailed Labor Code specifying conditions of
 employment, including hours, wages, and social security
 benefits. The legal workweek is 40 hours, with a requirement
 for at least one 24-hour rest period. Workers must be paid
 overtime for additional hours. There are legal minimum wage
 scales, most recently adjusted in 1991, which are supplemented
 by a required package of benefits, including social security
 and health care benefits. While this could provide a minimum
 standard of living if it went to support only one person, most
 wage earners support extended families. In addition, most
 people work in the informal sector, outside the realm of these
 rules and conventions. The Social Security Code provides a
 broad range of legal protection against hazards in the
 workplace, and workers' groups have put pressure on employers
 to respect parts of the regulations, particularly those
 affecting personal hygiene. With unemployment high, however,
 workers are sometimes reluctant to report violations of
 occupational safety. While in theory the labor inspection
 service of the Ministry of Labor oversees these standards,
 there is limited enforcement due to the lack of inspectors.
