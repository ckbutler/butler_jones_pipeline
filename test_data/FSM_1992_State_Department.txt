 FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA
 The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) is composed of 607 small islands, most-
 ly uninhabited, extending over 1 million square miles of the central Pacific. Four
 
 
 619
 states--Chuuk (formerly Truk), Kosree, Pohnpei, and Yap-cmprise the federation.
 The population is estimated to exceed 100,000, mostly of Micronesian origin. The
 four states were part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, administered by
 the United States from 1947 to 1986 pursuant to an agreement with the United Na-
 tions.
 Political legitimacy rests on the popular will expressed by a majority vote in ac-
 cordance wit the Contitution, which is based in large part on the U.S. model.
 There are three branches of government: a president as chief executive and head
 of state, a unicameral legislature elected from the four constituent states, and a ju-
 dicial orstem that applies criminal and civil laws and procedures closely paralleling
 those of the United States.
 Under the Compact of Free Association, the United States is responsible for de.
 fense and national security. The FSM has no security forces of its own, aside from
 local police and other law enforcement officers, all of whom are firmly under the
 control of the civil authorities..
 The economy depends heavily on transfer payments from the United States, fish-
 ing, tourism, and subsistence agriculture.
 Traditional customs sustain a value system which distinguishes between people
 on the basis of social status and sex; discrimination and violence against women are
 the principal human rights problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-No political killings occurred.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no disappearances or abductions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There was no incidence of torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment
 or punishment in 1992.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Legal procedures for the most part are
 patterned after US. law in its provisions for due process. These provisions are care-
 fully observed. There is no exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria.--Public trial is provided for in the Bill of Rights,
 and trials are conducted fairly. Juveniles may have closed hearings. The Chief Jus-
 tice of the Supreme Court is appointed by the President, with the advice and con-
 sent of the Congress.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 prohibits such arbitrary interference, and in practice there is none.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-These rights are constitutionally assured and
 faithfully observed. Each of the four state governments controls a radio station,
 broadcasting primarily in the local language. Yap also controls a small television
 station. The Federal Government and the Governors of Ksrae and Chuuk publish
 newsletters. Several private and municipal newsletters in Kosrae, Chuuk, and
 Pohnpei, however, do not hesitate to challenge governmental policies. Religious
 groups operate private radio stations in Pohnpei and Chuuk, and two commercial
 television stations broadcast on Pohnpei.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Bill of Rights guarantees
 freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and these rights are honored in prac-
 tice. During political campaigns, citizens often question candidates at public meet-
 in~s. Formal associations are uncommon in Micrnesia, but student organizations
 exist.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Federated States is extremely hospitable to diverse
 religions, and missionaries of many faiths work within the nation. The Bill of Rights
 forbids establishment of a state religion and governmental restrictions on freedom
 of religion. Most of the citizens are Christians.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions in any of these areas. The Compact of Free
 Association permits citizens to travel to, reside in, and work in the United States
 without having to obtain visas.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Congress is elected by popular vote from each state; the Congress then choos-
 es the President and Vice President from its ranks by majority vote. State gov-
 ernors, state legislators, and municipal governments are all elected by direct popu-
 lar vote. Elections are conducted honestly, and political campaigning is unrestricted.
 
 
 Although there are no restrictions on the formation of political groups, to date there
 have been no efforts to form political parties.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 No human rights violations were alleged, nor were there any known requests for
 investigations. While there are no official restrictions, no local groups concern them-
 selves with human rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides explicit protection against discrimination based on race,
 sex, language, or religion, but the various traditional cultures establish hierarchies
 of social status. These traditional rankings can influence aaess to political office
 and education, even though such access is in principle open to all. Traditional cul-
 ture is greatly respected by the peoples of the Federated States and protected by
 Article V of the Constitution. Although the traditional social orders are losing
 ground as Westernization and a monetized economy take a greater hold upon young
 people, male dominance remains a fact of life throughout Micronesia.
 Women are still at the early stages of finding jobs beyond the entry level in both
 the public and private sectors. Their roles within the family as wife, mother, home-
 maker, and child-rearer remain virtually unchanged from earlier times. Allegations
 of violence against women are almost exclusively concerned with domestic conflict
 between husband and wife, and wife beating under certain circumstances still is
 condoned among more traditional elements of the population. While assault by a
 husband or other male relative on women and children within the family is a crimi-
 nal offense under law, most women are reluctant to bring formal charges. The gen-
 eral attitude is that such issues are best left to the extended family unit to resolve.
 Local support groups are beginning to hold meetings in some of the state capitals
 to publicize issues of violence within the family and to highlight the effects of wide-
 spread alcohol and drug abuse. These meetings serve to create a greater awareness
 of social problems and help to publicize the rights of all citizens under the law.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Citizens have the right to form or join associations,
 and national government employees by law may form associations to "present their
 views" to the Government. However as yet, neither such associations nor trade
 unions have been formed in this largely nonindustrial society.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Coilectively.-There is no law dealing spe-
 cifically with trade unions or with the right to collective bargaining. Wages are set
 by individual employers. The Government is not a member of the International
 Labor Organization. Micronesia has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution specifically pro-
 hibits involuntary servitude, and there is no evidence of its practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-There is no law establishing a
 minimum age for employment of children. While in practice there is no employment
 of children for wages, they often assist their families in subsistence farming activi-
 ties.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-A federally established minimum wage exists
 for government workers, and one of the four state governments has established a
 minimum wage that applies to the private sector. These minimum wage structures
 and the wages customarily paid to unskilled workers are sufficient to provide an ac-
 ceptable standard of living under local conditions. There are no laws regulating
 hours of work or prescribing standards of occupational safety and health, but a fed-
 eral regulation requires that employers provide a safe place of employment.
