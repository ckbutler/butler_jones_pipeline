 Estonia, -an.independent state between the two World Wars, was
 annexed-by,the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.)
 in 1940 as a constituent republic. The United States does not
 recognize the forcible incorporation of Estonia into the
 U.S.S.R.
 Like,,the other-Baltic states, Estonia has generally been
 subjected to the same.centralized rule, the same Constitution
 and judicial system, and the same restrictions on civil and
 political liberties as the Soviet Union. Political power has
 been exercised by the leadership of the Communist Party of the
 Soviet Union, which tightly controlled the activities of local
 gQvernment-and Communist Party structures in Estonia.
 Estonians have taken advantage of liberalization in the Soviet
 Union since-1988 to exert greater control over their own
 affairs. Responding to mass public pressure demanding
 poli-tical democracy, and respect for human rights, the Estonian
 Supreme Soviet (parliament)-adopted a "Declaration of
 Sovereignty" and constitutional amendments in November 1988,
 declaring that its laws superseded those of the U.S.S.R.
 Supreme-Soviet. In response to both the Estonian declaration
 and related developments in other Republics, the Supreme
 Soviet Presidium voted on November 10, 1989, to instruct all
 15 Republic Supreme Soviets to bring their laws into
 conformity with all-Union law and the Soviet Constitution. By
 the end of 1989, however, no action had been taken to enforce
 this declaration. The Estonian Supreme Soviet declared in
 November 1989 that Estonia had been illegally incorporated
 into the Soviet Union in 1940.
 The primary law enforcement organization is the militia
 (police). The powerful Committee for State Security (K.G.B.),
 special troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (M.V.D.),
 and the regular Soviet armed forces, which maintain a
 signifipapt presence in Estonia, can be assumed to take orders
 from authorities in Moscow. Although K.G.B. surveillance is
 assumed to continue, there were few reports of human rights
 violations in 1989 by the security and military apparatus.
 The standard of living in Estonia is higher than the Soviet
 avezage, but the margin is shrinking. Estonians resent the
 fact that much of the national income they create is
 transferred to other Republics and that most major economic
 enterprises are controlled by central ministries in Moscow.
 They also complain about a continuing decline in the quality
 and quantity of food supplies and consumer goods. In May the
 Estonian Supreme Soviet adopted a plan for a transition to
 economic autonomy to begin on January 1, 1990, with future
 relations between the Estonian and Soviet economies to be
 based upon mutual agreements. The U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet in
 November voted to grant Estonia control over its land,
 resources, banks, and a portion of state-run industry.
 For the second year in a row, the human rights situation in
 Estonia improved markedly. As in the latter half of 1988, the
 authorities tolerated public expressions of Estonian national
 sentiment and independent political views which had previously
 been repressed. For the first time since annexation by the
 Soviet Union, relatively free multicandidate elections were
 held both to the U.S.S.R. Congress of People's Deputies and to
 local government councils. The independent prodemocratic mass
 organization, the Estonian -People's Front, was officially
 registered as a sociopolitical movement, and the right of
 
 
 1094
 ESTONIA
 other independent organizations to freedom of association was
 generally respected. Limited progress was made, both in
 Estonia and the Soviet Union, toward legislative reforms that
 would help to institutionalize human rights improvements.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no confirmed cases of such killing in 1989. The
 15-year-old daughter of former political prisoner Enn Tarto,
 an advocate of Estonian independence, was shot to death in
 1989 under mysterious circumstances.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known instances of permanent or prolonged
 disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 In Estonia, as in the Soviet Union, harsh treatment of
 prisoners occurs during both interrogation and confinement in
 labor camps, prisons, or psychiatric hospitals. Physical and
 psychological abuse of prisoners, as well as detention under
 extremely unhealthful conditions, are common. Estonians in
 1989 remained concerned about reports that Estonian youths are
 subjected to physical abuse, beatings, and degrading treatment
 in the Soviet armed forces.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Soviet laws are written and interpreted so broadly that
 persons may be arrested and convicted for trying to exercise
 their basic human rights. During 1989, however, the
 authorities in Estonia did not use these laws to arrest
 political activists.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Despite provisions for judicial objectivity in both the
 Estonian and Soviet Constitutions, the State retains the
 ability to control the judicial process and arbitrarily
 determine the outcome of trials. Procedural safeguards, such
 as the right to a public trial and to a defense attorney, are
 generally respected but are not sufficient to guarantee fair
 trials. Reforms to strengthen the rights of defendants have
 been proposed but were not implemented in 1989.
 There were no known trials on purely political charges in
 1989, and no Estonians were known to be imprisoned for purely
 political reasons at the end of 1989.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government continued to interfere in personal life through
 the use of informers, monitoring.of mail and telephones,
 surveillance, and other means. The security apparatus did
 
 
 1095
 little, however, to intimidate Estonians or to hinder the
 vi-rtual explosion.of social and political activism which began
 in'1988'and continued through 1989., Advocates of Estonian
 independencereported that obvious surveillance of their
 movements declined in 1989.
 Contacts between Estonians and visitors from foreign countries
 continued to be monitored, despite a considerable increase in
 such contacts during 1989. Although many -Estonians continued
 to assume that telephones and mail were monitored, they
 exhibited little fear of using these means of communications
 to -express-.theiz views .... ..
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 -  ar Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Soviet Constitution-provides for most internationally
 accepted political liberties on the condition that-exercise -of
 them does not threaten the security of the Socialist system.
 The Estonian-Constitution was amended in 1988 to include the
 provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and
 Political Rights, as well as other internationally recognized
 human xights. instruments, as "an inseparable part of the legal
 system.
 In previous years, the authorities had interpreted all such
 constitutional guarantees to fit the convenience of the
 State. -Vague Soviet laws prohibiting "anti-Soviet agitation
 and propa'gnda" and "Snti-Soviet slander", which had
 frequently been used in previous years to punish Estonian
 human rights and-political activists, were replaced in 1989 by
 a more.limited provision which specifically outlaws calls for
 the "violent overthrow" ofthe Soviet system.
 In 1989, freedom of speech'was widely-respected. The
 authorities t6lerated public-expression of virtually any -
 viewpoint, including criticism of- Soviet officials and calls
 for the immediate withdrawal of Soviet "occupation" troops
 from Estonia. Several hundred thousand Estonians signed a
 petition calling for annulment of Estonia's 1940 "request" to
 join the U.S.S.zR. Display of- Estonian national symbols, which
 had been repressed until mid-1988, was extremely widespread
 and officially-sanctioned in 1989
 The range of subjects cover~d by'official Estonian television,
 radio, and publications continued to expand in 1989. Print
 and electronic media devoted considerable attention to the
 50th anniversary of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Nonaggression Pact
 between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. The media also
 publicized the secret protocols that became the basis for the
 Soviet occupation and -annexation of the Baltic states. The
 Pact and the protocols were widely republished in 1989 by
 Estonian newspapers, which also pgovided extensive treatment
 of the Soviet Union's 1940 occupation. Reports in the '
 Estoniah media on events in other areas of the Soviet Union,
 including such incidents as the April 9 killings by Soviet
 military forces in Tbilisi, tended to be much more timely and-
 open than the reports provided by the central Soviet media.
 The Estonian media provided extensive information about the
 positions of candidates in the spring elections for the
 U.S.S.R. Congress of People's Deputies and in the December 10
 local elections, and they regularly reported on the views of
 Baltic deputies to the Soviet Parliament. These views .
 
 
 1096
 frequently differed from those of the political leadership in
 Moscow, particularly when the Central Committee of the Soviet
 Communist Party issued a harshly critical statement about the
 Baltic opposition movements on August 26. The Baltic
 responses included calls for the repeal of Article 6 of the
 Soviet Constitution, which provides for the "leading role" of
 the Communist Party.
 While self-censorship was exercised in varying degrees by
 individual editors and journalists, no political subject
 remained off-limits in 1989. Articles advocating the
 reestablishment of Estonian independence appeared in numerous
 publications, as did articles opposing the service of young
 Estonians in the Soviet armed forces.
 Among the issues on which Estonians expressed themselves most
 strongly in 1989 was the state of the environment. They were
 particularly concerned about the impact of oil shale mining in
 northwestern Estonia as well as-the harmful environmental
 effects of aircraft using a military airfield near the
 historic university town of Tartu. Official censorship was
 apparently used to prevent the publication of such "state
 secrets" as operational military information, but the military
 draft and the environmental consequences of military bases
 were subjects addressed by the media. There was one report
 that military authorities had threatened to draft journalists
 who had written critical articles about the military.
 Despite the extraordinarily open nature of the Estonian press,
 most publications remained under the formal control of the
 Communist Party or other official organizations. Independent
 publications were produced legally by the Estonian People's
 Front, the Estonian Heritage Society, a Jewish cultural
 society, and some other nonofficial organizations.
 Unauthorized (samizdat) publications were also produced and
 distributed by various groups without hindrance from the
 authorities, although the opinions in such publications were
 increasingly available in the official press.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The peaceful assembly of citizens is controlled by the
 authorities, who retain the power to prohibit public
 gatherings. Soviet guidelines on demonstrations and meetings
 are contained in a 1988 decree confirmed by the U.S.S.R.
 Supreme Soviet, but the Estonian Supreme Soviet declined to
 adopt relevant implementing legislation.
 In practice, the people of Estonia were allowed to hold mass
 meetings and demonstrations without hindrance from the
 authorities in 1989. Many of these meetings took place on
 anniversaries of historical events, commemoration of which had
 been repressed in previous years.
 The Presidium of the Estonian Supreme Soviet declared February
 24, the independence day of the interwar Estonian Republic, to
 be officially commemorated as the "Day of Restoration of
 Estonian Statehood." Leading Estonian Communist Party and
 government leaders participated along with People's Front
 leaders in public ceremonies attended by thousands of people
 as the blue, black, and white flag of the independent
 Republic, now recognized officially as Estonia's national
 flag, was raised over the symbolic Tall Hermann tower in
 central Tallinn. It replaced the red state flag of the
 Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic.
 
 
 1097
 Hundreds of thousands of Estonians joined hands August 23 in
 the first link of a 2-million-person human chain that extended
 through Latvia and Lithuania as a sign of protest marking the
 50th anniversary of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. Participants,
 -in-fhe demonstrations and related nfeetings ranged from members
 of the Estonian People's Front and many other nonofficial
 organizations, including the Estonian National Independence
 Party (ENIP),..tO the leaders of the Estonian Communist Party
 and Government. The Central Committee of the Soviet Communist
 Party criticized these events in an August 26 statement as
 "nationalist-hystefia."
 The Estonian Constitution provides for the right to assoriate
 in public organizations and movements (such as the People's
 Front),-but this right had been liriited in previous years by
 legislation and repressive practices. A new law concerning
 official'registration of public organizations was adopted in
 1989, rdquiring the Government to review applications promptly
 and explain the reasons.for any refusals. The People's Front
 was'officially registered, as were the ecological "Green"
 movement and many other groups, but ENIP and 6ther political
 partkes *ere ndt registered.
 While':conining to exercise a measure of control over mass'
 organizations associated with the Communist Party, the
 authorities have acquiesced in the rapid growth of both
 registered and unregistered clubs, professional associations,
 and other organizations. There were no reports of significant
 harassment of any of these groups.
 In 1989 a coalition of ENIP, the Estonian Heritage Society,
 .andlthe Christian Union begantan effort to form'Estonian
 Citizens'.'Committees and eventually to convene a Congress of
 Estdnib.' Estonian citizens were defined as persons who had
 b~enycitizens of the Estonian Republic in 1940 as well as
 their descbndants,'while other residents of Estonia were
 invited to submit applicbtions for Estonian citizenship.
 Despite riiticism ftom the authorities, who'feared that the
 Citizens' Committees would represent a form of parallel
 political power, over 500,000 persons had registered by year's
 ,end.
 For a discussion of freedom ofiassociation as it applies to
 labor-unions,-see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although-the Soviet Constitution provides for the right to
 profess, ot'not to. profess, any religion, both the party and
 Government promote atheism. The authoritigs continued to
 improve their relations with organized religion in 1989.  -
 Christmas was celebrated as an officially sanctioned holiday
 Eot*'the second consecutive year, and religious services were
 sometimes shown on television. Top Estonian political leaders
 held highly publicized meetings with leaders of the Republic's
 religious communities, and there were no reports of signifidant
 church-state conflicts. Nevertheless, state control of
 religion continued tO be formally golerned by repressive 1929
 Soviet legislation, as neither the U.S.S.R. nor Estonian
 Supreme Soviet adopted a new law to guarantee freedom of
 conscience.
 
 
 1098
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement is neither guaranteed by law nor fully
 permitted in practice, although Soviet officials have publicly
 pledged to bring their legislation into conformity with
 international standards. The right to emigrate by choice is
 not recognized by Soviet law, and persons wishing to leave
 temporarily are generally required to present an invitation
 from abroad. Many Soviet Jews in Estonia were denied
 permission to emigrate in previous years, but the upsurge in
 Soviet Jewish emigration has had a positive effect on Jewish
 emigration from Estonia as well.
 Although travel abroad is limited by restrictive legislation
 and arbitrary enforcement, bureaucratic procedures are
 considerably less cumbersome in Estonia than in the Soviet
 Union as a whole. For the second consecutive year, there was
 a dramatic upsurge in the number of Estonians visiting the
 United States and other Western countries in 1989. Leading
 figures in all of the Republic's main political movements,
 including the People's Front and groups favoring immediate
 Estonian independence, visited Western countries to present
 their views. An unprecedented number of Estonian-Americans,
 other emigres, and persons of Estonian descent were able to
 visit Estonia in 1989, with many visitors permitted to visit
 areas that are formally "closed" to foreigners.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Until 1989 the peoples of Estonia and the Soviet Union had not
 been free to change government leaders or the system of
 government. For the first time in postwar Estonian history,
 however, representatives to the U.S.S.R. Congress of People's
 Deputies (the federal legislature) and to Estonia's local
 soviets (government councils) were chosen in 1989 by secret
 ballot, on the basis of universal suffrage, in relatively free
 multicandidate elections.
 Although alternative parties could not formally participate in
 the Estonian elections, nominating procedures were
 sufficiently flexible to permit nomination of candidates with
 a very broad range of political views. Unlike many areas of
 the Soviet Union, there was no apparent manipulation of the
 candidate registration process to exclude "troublesome"
 candidates from the ballot in Estonia. While many Communist
 Party leaders were elected or reelected to their posts, others
 --including the chief of the K.G.B. for Estonia--were
 defeated. Most-of the successful candidates campaigned with
 the active support of the Estonian People's Front, which was
 able to nominate candidates on its own authority in the local
 elections. In heavily Russian districts, however, successful
 candidates included leaders of the predominantly Russian-
 speaking "Intermovement" and "United Councils of Work
 Collectives."
 The spring elections to the U.S.S.R. Congress were boycotted
 by the Estonian National Independence Party, which opposed
 participation in elections to the legislature of Estonia's
 "occupying power." Participation in these elections was
 nevertheless very high, over 80 percent. Several
 predominantly Russian organizations favored a boycott of the
 December 10 elections to local government councils as a
 protest against the residence requirement for candidates to
 
 
 1099
 ESTONIA
 local office as well as other legislation which allegedly
 discrimi-hates against non-Estonians.- While the boycott
 reduced the turnout somewhat,"a majority of voters took part
 in the local elections.
 Although the Est6nian-Parliament and Government were not
 democratically elected; in 1989 they were frequently
 responsive to the sdntimdnts of popular movements and the-
 generaI'public. Draft laws were circulated and amended on the
 basis of constituents' expressed interests, and the agenda for
 government action was heavily influenced by the People's
 Front, a leader of which--Edgar Savisaar--was appointed as a
 Deputy Prime Minister in 1989. The Estonian Supreme Soviet
 coedemned the 1-6blofov-Ribbentrop Pabt and endorsed reports
 which characterized the Republic's incorpotation into the
 Soviet Union in 1940 as illegal.
 Multidandidate elections to the Estonian Supreme Soviet were
 scheduled t'be held on March 18, 1990, potentially providing
 the peopli of Estbniawith their first opportunity in postwar
 history to determIne the'comosition of their own parliament
 and government.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 'Te Soviet Government has adopted a more forthcoming approach
 to-foreign driti7cism of its-human rights record in recent
 year s dcknowledding Ehat human rights are a legitimate
 subject of official"diplomatic-contacts. In the case of
 Estonia,-the-U.S.S.R.- Stpreme Soviet's'Presidium was'involved
 in a dispute with Estonian authorities over alleged human
 rights violations. The central Government accused the
 Estoniari Supreme'Soviet of violating the human rights of its
 non-native 'populafidn by adopting a 2-year residence
 requiremefit for voters in Estonian local elections.
 Although there were few'other allegations of human rights
 violations in Estonia in 1989, the Estonian Government
 generally welcoidd foreign and nongovernmental observers on
 any subject.
 Section 5 -Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination on the basis'of-race, sex, dr'other grounds is
 prohibited in the Constitution. Tensions between ethnic
 Estonians'-and Russians, however, are always near the surface
 in Estonia where a low Estonian birthrate and an official
 Soviet settlement policy have caused the ethnic Estonian
 proportion of the population to fall from 92 percent in 1939
 to approximately 60 percent in 1989. These tensiQns were
 dxpressed in heated debates over a number of issues. Ethnic
 Estonians continued to complain that they could not always
 conduct'business in their own language, that immigrants from
 the'Soviet Union receive favored'treatment in the provision of
 housing and othet 'social'setvices, and that nonresidents
 frequently visited Estonia in order to buy out the Republic's
 relatively well-stocked stores.
 The Estonian Supreme Soviet adopted a detailed language law to
 provide Estonian language training and to require that
 incumbents of certain management and service positions will
 eventually be bilingual. Regulations were issued to prevent
 
 
 1100
 ESTONIA
 nonresidents of Estonia from purchasing goods which are in
 short supply, and measures to control immigration were under
 consideration in 1989. Ethnic Russian and other Russian-
 speaking residents of Estonia were generally concerned by the
 Estonian language law, and many also objected to the Estonian
 economic autonomy plan, which asserted the "priority"
 interests of the native Estonian population and called for the
 the Republic to assume control over enterprises which are
 currently subordinate to Moscow-based ministries. Russian-
 speaking workers constitute a significant percentage of the
 work force at such enterprises.
 In the absence of a citizenship law, the Estonian Supreme
 Soviet adopted a requirement of 5 years' residence in a local
 district, or 10 years in Estonia, in order to stand as a
 candidate for local office.
 Although the number of persons negatively affected by the
 local elections law was relatively small, representatives of
 the Russian-speaking population complained that it would have
 the effect of retroactively disenfranchising voters who had
 recently moved to Estonia. They also noted that it would
 affect very few ethnic Estonians, most of whom could meet its
 requirements for a total of 5 or 10 years' residence in the
 Republic. In July and August, at least 40,000 predominantly
 Russian workers staged a political strike in the Estonian
 cities of Tallinn and Kohtla-Jarve to protest the residence
 requirements in the local election law. The strike was halted
 when the Estonian Supreme Soviet agreed to defer consideration
 of the residence requirements but was resumed after adoption
 of the election law. The Estonian Government responded by
 issuing a decree to ban the strike, but the decree was not
 enforced.
 Meanwhile, the Presidium of the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet ruled
 that the residence requirements were discriminatory and that
 they violated the Soviet Constitution as well as the
 U.S.S.R.'s international human rights commitments. The strike
 was ended when the Republic's leadership agreed to enter into
 negotiations with strike leaders, eventually proposing a
 one-time suspension of the residence requirement for voters.
 This proposal was accepted by the Estonian Supreme Soviet in
 October, with the proviso that the election law will
 subsequently be brought into line with a new citizenship law.
 The compromise did not satisfy the Russian strike leaders, who
 continued to complain about the residence requirements for
 candidates in local elections as well as about other
 provisions of the election law.
 While major ethnic tensions in Estonia divide the Estonian and
 Russian populations, most ethnic groups have formed officially
 recognized cultural societies which work closely with the
 Estonian People's Front on proposals to enhance their cultural
 autonomy. A law to protect the rights of national minorities
 was adopted by the Estonian Supreme Soviet in December.
 Over the past 10 years, discrimination and persecution has
 been directed against Estonians who sought to express their
 national and cultural identity, against independent political
 and religious activists, and against Jews and Pentecostals
 wishing to leave the country.
 Women nominally enjoy the same legal rights as men, and an
 extensive system of day-care service and maternity benefits
 assists women in obtaining and retaining jobs.
 
 
 1101
 Estonian statistics on the problem of violence against women,
 incluing. wifebeating, are unavailable. The official Soviet
 prosx in 19&9 'discussed the issue, and the Soviet Council "of
 dinisteors estlablished '-special branch (headed by a woman) to
 study tho:.problems of womth. Human rights and'women's rights
 groups in Estonia are aware of the issue but hav focused
 their efforts thus far on the broader questions of
 .independence and freedom.
 Section 6 , .orker.- Rights
 A. The Right of Association
 Soviet lobor Ia  and practice has generally been enforced in
 Estohia. There has been no right of association as defined by
 the International Labor Organization (ILO). Although the
 Constitution grants Soviet citizens the right to form trade
 unions, attempts to exercise this right independently of the
 state-controlled union had always tmen repressed. new
 professional associations with no ties to lMscew were created
 in 1989, but it is not yet clear whether they will effectively
 exercise trade union functions.
 A dual effort to reform Estonian labor legislation and
 practice began to take shape in late 1989, with adoption of a
 new law on trade unions and moves toward comprehensive
 overhaul of the official trade union organization. The law
 cites ILO standards and provides for trade unions to exist as
 independent organizations with the right to strike to defend
 workers' interests. It is too soon to judge the practical
 effects of these proposed changes, which are consistent with
 the stated goals of the Estonian economic autonomy plan.
 In addition to the politically motivated strikes by at least
 40,000 predominantly Russian workers protesting against the
 new Estonian election law, a few other brief strikes were
 reported in the Estonian press. There were no reports of
 repression against strikers in 1989.
 b. The Right to Organize and Dargain Collectively
 Workers in Estonia generally have not been able to organize or -
 engage in collective bargaining. Virtually all workers in the
 Soviet Union automatically become members of an affiliate of
 the official Soviet trade union organization, the All-Union
 Central Council of Trade Unions, in order to be entitled to
 government social welfare benefits. There are no economic
 incentive zones in Estonia.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Soviet law contains no prohibition on forced or compulsory
 labor. Host prisoners are confined to camps where they are
 forced to labor, often under harsh and degrading conditions.
 d." Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The statutory minimum age for employment of children is 16.
 There is no indication of widespread violations of these norms.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Labor conditions in Estonia are similar to those in the Soviet
 Union. According to the Soviet State Statistical Committee,
 the average monthly wage in Estonia for blue- and white-collar
 
 
 1102
 workers in September 1989 was $430 and for collective farm
 workers.$488 at the official exchange rate. The minimum
 monthly wage in the U.S.S.R. was $140. (The ruble is not a
 convertible currency, and its value here in terms of the U.S.
 dollar does not represent actual purchasing power for
 international purposes.)
 The standard workweek is 40 hours. The average workweek is 40
 ,hours for most white-collar workers and 41 hours for most
 blue-collar workers. Soviet law establishes minimum
 conditions of health and safety. Press reports suggest,
 however, that legislation on maximum hours of work and health
 and safety standards are widely ignored.
