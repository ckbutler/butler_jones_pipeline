 CHIlA
 China is an authoritarian one-party state in a stage of
 historic transition and experimentation. It has repudiated
 many aspects of the Soviet model that had previously guided
 its political, economic, social and cultural life, as well
 as its approach to human rights. Though overt and covert
 opposition to the Communist Party and the socialist system
 are not tolerated, discussion of the meaning and content of
 socialism is encouraged.
 During the Cultural Revolution, 1966-1976, the structure of
 government, the economy, education and family life were
 uprooted. Authority was arbitrary and there was little
 pretense of a legal system. Since 1976 the Chinese lead-
 ership has been attempting to correct past abuses of
 authority. Hundreds of thousands of persons persecuted
 during the period have been publicly rehabilitated. The
 involuntary rustication of millions of urban young people
 has been curtailed, and a number of forced labor camps have
 been closed. Labor camps reportedly continue to incarcerate
 many thousands, however.
 New policies, institutions and economic strategies that are
 currently emerging may have a major, long-term impact on
 human rights in the People's Republic of China (PRC). China
 is seeking to develop political, economic and legal insti-
 tutions that will help insure against a repetition of past
 human rights violations. These are designed to discourage
 the abuse of power, allow greater individual freedom and yet
 assure the primacy of the Communist Party. The contra-
 dictions inherent in these objectives are often irrecon-
 cilable. When faced with a choice, the regime has usually
 given priority to control and stability.
 During 1980, China made some progress toward a relatively
 more open society although the 1979 crackdown against radi-
 cal opponents of the party and government was reconfirmed.
 Political dissent is permitted only within a narrow frame-
 work, but the September session of the National People's
 Congress was the most lively since the founding of the PRC
 in 1949. Although the NPC meets only for two weeks and is
 not a vigorous deliberative body, criticism of government
 policies expressed during the most recent session reflects
 the leadership's stated desire to institute, in a controlled
 way, the concepts of separation of power and checks and
 balances. This approach has also been reflected in the new
 phenomenon of expose reporting by the press, which has re-
 sulted in considerable criticism of specific government
 policies and leaders, so long as such criticism does not
 extend to the basic socialist economic structure, the
 leadership role of the Communist Party or disruption of the
 social order.

 Nationwide implementation of the new election law began in
 the latter half of 1980. The law provides for direct elec-
 tion of local officials by secret ballot, and requires that
 there be more candidates than positions. This new procedure
 raises the possibility that the Party's monopoly of power at
 the local levels could be loosened somewhat. It remains to
 be seen, however, how fairly these elections will be con-
 ducted and what range of candidates will be permitted.
 Under the rubric of "socialist democracy" the government is
 turrently studying various methods for encouraging greater
 public participation in the political process. A committee
 of the National People's Congress is drafting a new state
 constitution, looking at Western democratic as well as
 socialist models.
 The revitalized legal system, which went into effect January
 1, 1980, has developed unevenly in its first year. Chinese
 authorities have reportedly brought charges against thou-
 sands of government functionaries and others accused of
 abusing citizens' rights. Legal advisers' offices were
 opened in many cities to assist citizens. Defendants'
 rights, however, have apparently received little attention
 thus far. Public trials called for by the criminal pro-
 cedure code appear to be essentially sentencing hearings,
 attended by selected spectators. Party interference in the
 legal process has been decried by the president of China's
 Supreme Court. The trial of Jiang Qing, Mao's widow and
 other Cultural Revolution radicals (the so-called "Gang of
 Four" and 6 others) which began in November 1980, after the
 accused had-been held without trial for four years, seemed
 designed to achieve political as well as judicial aims. The
 controversial trial saw the defendants charged with numerous
 criminal acts during their tenure as high officials.
 China's renewed commitment to the rule of law has also not
 affected the government's continued suppression of those
 engaged in basic political dissent. The fate of dissidents
 arrested at "Democracy Wall" and other places in 1979 re-
 mains unknown. In Guangzhou, in August 1980, the authori-
 ties closed down an unauthorized magazine and arrested four
 editors. In September, 1980, the NPC deleted passages in
 China's current constitution granting the right to put up
 wall posters. The virtual abolition of wall posters and
 underground journals in 1979 and 1980 throughout China has
 dried up important sources of information about human rights
 conditions and eliminated an outlet for political expres-
 sion. Meanwhile, an extensive police system still monitors
 the political activities of China's citizens.
 The gvernment's primary goal is economic development with
 emphasis on agricultural production and raising levels of
 consumption. In terms of providing the basic rights of
 food, shelter, and clothing, as well as education and
 health, China performs well given the limitations in the
 availability of material goods. Consumer goods have become
 available to the Chinese people in greater quantity and
 variety than in the past.
 In economic life, greater scope is being given for indi-
 vidual and group action. Industrial and agricultural units
 are beginning to enjoy more autonomy. China is experi-
 menting with a degree of worker supervision of industrial
 
 
 575
 enterprises through elected "workers councils." On rural
 communes private plots have been expanded, and farmers are
 permitted to sell their own products in many free markets.
 Licensed individual craftsmen ply their wares in city
 streets, and an increasing number of individual enterprises
 such as restaurants and retail shops have been approved.
 Loosening of political and social controls has resulted in a
 more colorful and varied life for many Chinese, especially
 in urban areas. Theaters offer fare ranging from tradi-
 tional Beijing opera to Shakespeare to old American movies.
 Chinese television regularly provides glimpses of life
 abroad and news coverage based on Western satellite film
 clips; foreign radio broadcasts, including the Voice of
 America, are not jammed and enjoy a large audience. Though
 foreign religious connections remain a matter of great
 sensitivity, constraints on religious practice have been
 eased significantly, and some Chinese Christians say there
 are more Christians in China today than before 1949. The
 government has also admitted past abuse of minorities and
 promised major reform, including more autonomy and special
 economic development programs for minority areas. Relaxed
 travel controls have permitted thousands of Chinese, both
 officially and privately sponsored, to journey abroad. A
 US-China Consular Treaty signed in 1980 reaffirmed China's
 commitment to facilitating the reunification of family
 members.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Article 32 of the Criminal Procedure Code and Article 136 of
 the Criminal Code now clearly prohibit the use of torture or
 duress in acquiring evidence. Wall posters and other
 unofficial sources have alleged that beatings and torture by
 electrical means continue to be practiced in some prisons
 and labor camps. A report of the Supreme People's Procura-
 torate acknowledged, in October 1980, that cases of
 torture and illegal detention continue to occur, and pledged
 to combat such abuses. The report said that the government
 has prosecuted over 10,000 cases of violations of citizens'
 rights, some including torture, between January 1979 and
 June 1980.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrdding Treatment or Punishment
 Wall posters, court notices, and other reports indicate that
 lengthy or open-ended prison sentences for political of-
 fenses may involve years of confinement with little or no
 communication with family allowed.
 Although there have been no recent reports of summary
 executions for political offenses, Chinese media reports a
 number of executions in criminal cases. This past year,
 in a well-publicized case of a gold thief, the execution
 was carried out immediately after the trial, with no evi-
 dent review by the Supreme People's Court as required by
 
 
 576
 law. However, in an earlier 1979 case of two brothers
 convicted of gang rape and blackmail, the two convicted
 criminals were able to appeal their death sentences. They
 lo, and the execution of one of them was televised.
 Treatment in the penal labor camps varies greatly. Beat-
 ings .reportedly occur in some camps but not in others;
 letters and family visits are sometimes permitted and
 sometimes not. Many inmates never leave the camps after
 their sentences are completed but instead remain in the
 labor camp as contract workers under the widely-held view
 that it would be difficult for them to acquire employment
 if theyleave.
 c. Disappearancea
 Scores of dissidents and other demonstrators were arrested
 in Beijing in 1979, some of them in connection with their
 activities at Democracy Wall. China conducted well-
 publicized trials of two dissidents, Wel Jingsheng and Pu
 Yuehua in 1979. The disposition of the other detainees
 arrested with Wei and Fu is unknown, although there have
 been reports that some were secretly tried and sentenced
 to long prison terms.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Chinese law allows a detained person or his family to
 obtain his release if public security officials have not
 acted in accordance with regulations regarding arrest.
 Presumably the defendant or his family can remonstrate
 with the procurate or appropriate local authorities but
 the government has not yet published any elaboration of
 the procedure. A prisoner can be detained up to two
 months before the prosecutor makes a public charge against
 him, although this period can be extended with the ap-
 proval of a higher prosecuting unit or the NPC Standing
 Committee.
 There are still reports of political prisoners being sent
 to penal labor camps, but it appears that the number of
 total political prisoners at these camps has diminished in
 recent years as Kuomingtang (KMT) elements imprisoned in
 the 1950s have died and as Cultural Revolution detainees
 have been released. Of the many thousands of prisoners
 estimated to be held in the network of labor camps (some
 estimates range upwards of 100,000), the number of polit-
 ical prisoners cannot be gauged.
 The Chinese authorities have stated that courts have
 reviewed 1.13 million convictions obtained during the
 Cultural Revolution, and reversed the verdicts on 267,000
 persons, of which 184,000 were reportedly wrongly con-
 victed on political grounds. China has also taken
 steps to prosecute local officials who have abused their
 authority. According to official statistics, 10,000 such
 cases were investigated in the period from January 1979
 through June 1980, resulting in criminal convictions
 against 1,800 officials on such charges as illegal deten-
 tion and torture. Host of the other cases investigated
 were found to have been in violation of administrative
 regulations and the officials involved received non-
 criminal sanctions.
 
 
 577
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Both the constitution and the criminal procedure code
 stipulate that an accused person has the right to defend
 himself at trial, or to appoint an attorney or other
 representative. Although a defendant's attorney can meet
 with him in custody, the defendant is not permitted to
 have the attorney present during pre-trial interrogations
 by the prosecutors, police, or the court.
 Decisions on guilt or innocence appear to be made during
 the pre-trial investigation, and trials become the equiv-
 alent of sentencing hearings, with the role of the defense
 attorney limited to pleading for mercy or offering extenu-
 ating circumstances. No defendant has been found innocent
 in any trial of which the details have been made public.
 In fact, the Chinese have publicly reported that over 97
 percent of the defendants brought to trial have been
 convicted.
 The criminal procedure code stipulates that all trials
 should be held in public, except those involving state
 secrets, personal secrets, and juveniles. In practice,
 attendance at public trials has required an admission
 ticket, obtained from organizations selected by the
 authorities. Foreign observers are rarely admitted to
 criminal trials.
 Communist Party and government officials with no judicial
 responsibilities sometimes intervene in legal cases and
 apparently instruct judicial bodies on how to handle
 procedures and sentences. In recent months, high PRC
 officials outside the judicial system have commented
 publicly on the nature of the trial of the "Gang of Four,"
 suggesting they were closely involved in trial prepara-
 tions and perhaps in deciding the sentences before the
 fact.
 There have been reports of special courts and hearings for
 political offenders, particularly Communist Party mem-
 bers. Party members apparently can be subjected to obser-
 vation, detention and reform through labor under the
 rubric of Party discipline, thereby circumventing entirely
 the judicial system.
 Under labor reform regulations reaffirmed in February
 1980, those who commit "minor theft or fraud," or who have
 been expelled from their work units for anti-social and in
 some cases "counterrevolutionary" behavior may be sent by
 administrative (quasi-judicial) action to labor reform
 camps for periods of up to four years. Reportedly each
 city and province maintains its own camp or set of camps.
 f.   Invasion of the Home
 Article 47 of the constitution states "the citizens'
 freedom of person and their homes are inviolable." The
 criminal procedure code generally requires the use of
 search and arrest warrants issued by the procurator or by
 a People's Court. There were a few unofficial allegations
 of warrantless arrests in 1980 but no repetition of the
 well-publicized roundups of dissidents in the spring of
 1979.
 
 
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 China has a population of almost one billion people, and
 faces massive problems in feeding, housing, educating and
 employing its people. The Chinese government has suc-
 ceeded in meeting basic requirements in these areas.
 Per capita income is estimated to be around    $225. A
 typical urban dweller spends about 12 percent of his
 income on housing, 54 percent on food, and 23 percent for
 clothing, according to government estimates. For 1980,
 industrial growth is expected to be about six percent.
 Due to unfavorable weather conditions, agricultural
 production will probably show little or no increase in
 1980 compared to last year's record levels. Most people
 have a simple but adequate diet, although there are
 occasional reports of food shortages in rural areas.
 While there is a disparity between urban and rural living
 standards, the government is making efforts to boost rural
 income, most recently by raising prices on agricultural
 products and removing price controls on private produc-
 tion, which amounts to about one-fifth of total agricul-
 tural products.
 There are differences in income and access to material
 goods, particularly between urban and rural residents. A
 government official, senior university professor or
 skilled engineer may earn four or five times the monthly
 salary of a young factory worker. Top government and
 party officials enjoy a relatively high standard of
 living, with perquisites not available to others.
 Government officials acknowledge that a significant
 unemployment problem exists, and is particularly serious
 among urban youth.
 Chinese citizens may own houses, and recent financial
 regulations have been modified to make this easier.
 Construction of private dwellings seems to be on the
 increase. Chinese have the right of inheritance.
 Recently, the government has encouraged Chinese citizens
 to start their own businesses, primarily in services such
 as restaurants, tailoring or individual production of
 handicrafts.
 Inflation has not been a major problem for most of the
 PRC's history. A 5.9 percent increase in the cost of
 living during 1979 was unusually high, but was partially
 offset by wage increases granted to 40 percent of urban
 workers.
 Living guarters are cramped and inadequate, a problem the
 government is attempting to solve by embarking on large
 housing construction projects. Basic health care is
 available to all, either gratis or at low cost.
 The Chinese educational system now aims for universal
 education through the high school level. In practice, even
 education through the eighth grade has not been achieved in
 some areas. An estimated 75 percent of those completing
 the eighth grade continue through high school, and about
 five percent of high school graduates attend college.

 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The constitution guarantees freedom of speech and the
 press, but in practice criticism of the socialist system,
 the leadership of the Communist Party, and the ideology of
 Marx, Lenin and Mao is not permitted. At the NPC session
 in September 1980, large character wall posters used in
 1979 for some political debates were banned and virtually
 all of the underground journals had already been forced to
 cease publication. No more dissidents were tried in 1980,
 but last year's 15 year sentence for dissident Wei
 Jingsheng cast a heavy pall over public expression of
 political and philosophical dissent.
 Tolerance of criticism not involving key political
 questions increased in 1980. Some newspapers have engaged
 in "expose journalism" following up reader's complaints and
 aiming their criticism at bureaucratic bungling and
 corruption, sometimes at high levels. Delegates to the
 National People's Congress in September engaged in free-
 wheeling debates about government policies, and these were
 given considerable publicity in the official media.
 Foreign books and magazines are available in libraries, but
 access is apparently restricted to Party or government
 officials and to certain scholars.
 The Communist Party exercises control over the arts. In
 late 1980 several prominent writers were allowed to voice
 criticism of the party's involvement in the arts and some
 suggested that the Party should not interfere with artistic
 expression. These criticisms were published in the
 official Chinese media.
 Public practice of religion has increased markedly in the
 past two years, with many youthful worshippers now visible
 in Christian and Muslim congregations, as well as at
 traditional Buddhist or Daoist rites. National religious
 organizations have resumed activities. Interest in
 religion as a social phenomenon has grown concurrently and
 China now has several government-sponsored research
 institutes studying the subject. Government attitudes
 toward religious practice vary from wary tolerance of
 Christianity to limited encouragement of traditional
 Muslim, Buddhist, and Daoist activities. Although many
 religious followers have been released from years in
 detention, including the Roman Catholic Bishop of Canton,
 there are reports that some religious figures still remain
 in prison.
 The constitution guarantees the rights of assembly and
 association but these rights are often abridged in
 practice. In 1979, thousands of demonstrators marched
 peacefully in the streets of Beijing and assembled in front
 of government offices demanding the right to return to
 their former homes and jobs in the capital. Some of these
 demonstrators were arrested and, according to unconfirmed
 reports, have been sent to labor camps without trial.
 Restrictions on Chinese contacts with foreigners have
 lessened in the past four years. Nevertheless, such
 
 
 580
 contacts are subject to monitoring by an extensive network
 of security personnel. Chinese whose work does not require
 or permit contacts with foreigners may be warned, or in
 extreme cases arrested, if they persist in meeting foreign
 acquaintances.
 Minority religious groups in border areas such as Xizang
 (Tibet), Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang (Sinkiang) are per-
 mitted a degree of local autonomy, official recognition of
 their languages, and favorable treatment in some areas,
 such as university admissions. China has announced plans
 to repatriate 85 percent of the Han Chinese officials in
 Xizang over the next three years, turning their admini-
 strative duties over to Tibetans. Laws protecting minority
 rights are currently being drafted for Inner Mongolia as
 well as other autonomous regions. In Xizang, a legal group
 was established in June under the People's Congress. It is
 reportedly reviewing all local laws, decrees and regula-
 tions promulgated since 1949, and will make suggestions for
 their abolition or revision. Despite these efforts at
 reform, reports of Tibetan discontent with Chinese rule
 continue to surface. The Chinese government has attempted,
 thus far unsuccessfully, to woo the Dalai Lama back from
 exile in India, in an attempt to placate Tibetan national-
 ist sentiment.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel     Emigration and Repatriation
 China continues the policies of liberalizing control over
 foreign travel and emigration which have been instituted
 over the past three years. Thousands of Chinese citizens
 have traveled abroad this year to study, conduct business,
 and visit relatives. By late 1980, the number of official
 delegations from China visiting the United States exceeded
 130 per month. Legal emigration has also increased, with
 about 75,000 per year now going to Hong Kong, and hundreds
 of others to the US and other countries. Under pressures
 from the Hong Kong government, China has attempted to stem
 the flow of illegal emigrants to the Colony, but reportedly
 those who are arrested trying to exit China illegally are
 only mildly censured by the Chinese authorities.
 China has received about 250,000 refugees from Southeast
 Asia in the past few years, and spent about $450 million on
 their care and settlement. About 225,000 of these refugees
 were Vietnamese citizens of Chinese descent, and nearly all
 the rest were ethnic Vietnamese. Conditions in refugee
 areas vary, but in general are on a par with those of local
 Chinese residents. The few who have been able to secure
 refuge in other countries have departed without hindrance
 by the Chinese authorities.
 Travel within China is subject to government restrictions,
 but citizens travel constantly and are limited only by the
 capacity of the planes, trains and buses available to move
 them. Chinese citizens who wish to visit another locale
 must obtain letters of introduction from their work units
 in order to secure accommodations. They also need ration
 coupons, usually valid only within one province. To obtain
 certain foods, these coupons may be obtained only if the
 
 
 581
 traveler registers with the local Public Security Office.
 In practice, some Chinese travel without the appropriate
 documents.
 Chinese are normally assigned work by the local authori-
 ties, and cannot freely move to other areas to seek employ-
 ment. There are still many examples of families (mostly of
 professionals) obliged to live separately, sometimes for
 years, due to work assignments.
 A program to send large numbers of urban middle school
 graduates to rural communes or state farms that has been in
 effect since the early sixties, is being phased down. The
 stated purpose of the rustification program was to provide
 employment for youths who would encounter difficulties in
 finding urban jobs. Although the official policy stipu-
 lates that only volunteers will be sent, in practice this
 has often not been the case. At its peak in the early
 1970's an estimated 18 million young people had left cities
 for life in the countryside, most of them involuntarily.
 The number of school-leavers sent to the countryside has
 diminished considerably in recent years. Many rusticated
 youths have returned to cities without permission, and have
 contributed to urban crime and unemployment problems.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Although other political parties in theory may exist in
 China, in practice the Chinese Communist Party dominates
 all aspects of political, economic, and social life.
 Over the past year, however, the government has taken some
 steps toward broadening participation in the political
 process. China's new election law calls for election by
 the people of local assemblies, which in turn elect local
 government officials and provincial assembly representa-
 tives. The Chinese authorities have indicated that these
 local elections will be carried out nationwide by early
 1981. According to the law all parties and "mass
 organizations" may nominate candidates, as may any voter
 with three or more people supporting his proposal. Candi-
 dates are selected from nomination lists by local election
 committees consisting of Party and non-party persons repre-
 senting various local organizations. The number of candi-
 dates is required to exceed the number of deputies to be
 elected. It remains to be seen how these elections will
 work out in practice.
 The Chinese elite -- the more than 38 million Chinese
 Communist Party members -- participate in the selection of
 representatives to higher party organs. There is no direct
 election of senior Party or government officials.
 China has traditionally been a male-dominated society, and
 men predominate in senior leadership positions. Women
 delegates to the September 1980 NPC complained that the
 number of women in leadership roles in China has not only
 failed to increase, but is actually declining. A China
 press report in December stated that the percentage of
 women admitted to the Party and participating in government
 
 
 582
 and political affairs is very low. The Constitution pro-
 vides that "women enjoy equal rights with men in all
 spheres of political, economic, cultural, social and family
 life. Men and women enjoy equal pay for equal work."  The
 new Marriage Law promulgated at the third session of the
 Fifth National People's Congress in September 1980 further
 protects the rights of women. Nevertheless, there are
 widespread reports that women do not enjoy equality with
 men in the economic or political sphere. Few women occupy
 top leadership positions in industry and other economic
 activity and even fewer play any significant role in the
 political structure.
 The trade union structure is controlled by the Chinese
 Communist Party and is used primarily to channel Party
 policy downward. Along with many of the Chinese Communist
 Party's other mass organizations, the All-China Federated
 Trade Union (ACPTU) was reconstituted at both the local and
 national level by late 1978. The ACFTU has about 50 mil-
 lion members of the 100 million in the industrial labor
 force. This figure does not include agricultural workers,
 civil servants or the growing numbers in the "private" and
 "collective" sectors. Trade union leaders have stressed
 that their organization follows the leadership of the party
 and is the means through which the Party "maintains ties"
 with the workers.
 The Constitution guarantees the right to strike but there
 was no report of any strike during 1980. The primary
 function of-the trade union organization in the work-place
 is to foster labor discipline and greater productivity.
 The trade union organization does not act on behalf of the
 economic interest of the workers by negotiating wages or
 other benefits at the plant level with plant management.
 At the local level, the union performs a variety of welfare
 and social functions such as making small loans to workers
 in need, management of the health and insurance systems and
 intervention in work site health and environmental issues.
 Periodically, the government has encouraged the union's
 active participation in the protection of the welfare of
 the workers. In 1980 the Tianjin branch of the union took
 an active role in the investigation of the Bohai Gulf dis-
 aster in which 72 workers died when an oil rig collapsed.
 The union successfuliy advocated the dismissal of the
 project manager and the Minister of Petroleum.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Chinese Government officials did not respond to repeated
 requests by Amnesty International and other non-govern-
 mental organizations for meetings and explanations regard-
 ing alleged human rights violations in 1979. During 1980
 Amnesty International made no approaches to the Chinese
 government for human rights information. Chinese officials
 regard such requests as interference in China's internal
 afffairs. There are no known organizations based in China
 observing or reporting on human rights violations. As of
 August 1, 1980, China had not acceded to the International
 Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
