 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 The year 1987 saw dramatic political change in the Republic of
 Korea (ROK), resulting in significant developments in the
 human rights situation there. Large street demonstrations
 broke out in June, partly the result of widespread
 disenchantment with the Government over the death of a student
 by torture at police hands in January and the highly unpopular
 decision by President Chun Doo Hwan on April 13 to end debate
 over conStitutional revision.
 Faced with continuing protests, on June 29 ruling Democratic
 Justice Party [DJP] Chairman Roh Tae Woo, President Chun's
 choice as his successor, announced far-reaching democratic
 reforms. In addition to acceptance of the opposition's
 demands for direct presidential elections, these proposals
 included the release of'political prisoners, a sweeping
 amnesty, and restoration of civil rights, including those of
 opposition leader Kim Dae Jung. On July 1 President Chun
 accepted Roh's proposal.
 In October ruling ahd'opposition parties in the National
 Assembly passed a bipartisan constitutional revision bill,
 thus paving the way for Korea's'first direct presidential
 election since 1971. The-election took place on December 16.
 Four major ctndidates cbndh6ed a fiercely contested campaign,
 occasiohally marred by Violence. Nearly 90-percent of the
 electorate partlcipated in the election,'in which Roh Tae Woo
 emerged as the4fictor'with a plurality-of arbund 36 percent.,
 These developments basically changed the political environment
 in Korea and ptb@idethe pbssibility fbr further improvement
 in the human rights environment-.'      -
 The Korean;Government dedcribes itself as a liberal democracy,
 but power under'the-Constitution of the Fifth Republic was'
 indisputably centered around President Chun: The Constitution
 creating the Fifth Republic in[October 1980 was written under
 strict martial law conditions. The 1987 bipartisan-revision
 --to take full effect on the inauguration of the new President
 February 25, 1988 -is widely regarded ds a'key Etep in, Korea's
 democratization'.                                 '         -
 The elected legisl ture currehtly has-fubstantially less power-
 than the Lxedutive-brench, bilt it is' &major forum for public
 debate. The National Assembly's proceedings are reported - "
 extensively by the media, and its influence on public opinion
 is conslAderabl. *The new"Constitution' sign-IfIcantly increases
 the legislature's authority and constrains the President's
 exercise of emergency powers. Changes in the structure of the
 legislature and National Assembly elections were pending at
 year's end. The judiciary is generally independent and free
 of government interfetbncdCin'rdinary biiminal'and ciVil
 matters, but much lest so in politically sensitive cabes.
 Korea is one of the world's most homogeneous sodieties. Dts
 sociopolitical traditi6n emphasizes order, conformity, and a
 subordinate role for women. These attitudes,'while cha'nging
 somewhat, nevertheless retain great strength, coexisting
 uneasily a tim~s rith"Western deiocratic ideals.This
 tradition and a heavily armed and unpredictable Communist
 North Korea', which invaded the South in 1950 and remains
 committed to reunifying the entire peninsula under its
 control, have caused successive South Korean governments to
 give top priority to maintaining external and internal
 security.

 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 Koreans do have considerable personal freedom, including
 economic and religious freedom, and broad rights to pursue
 private interests. Since the mid-1960's, Korea's export-
 oriented economy has achieved one of the world's highest
 average growth rates. The population has a large and
 well-educated urban component. Abject poverty has been
 eliminated to a great extent, although there are shortfalls in
 urban housing. The rapid growth of the economy has created
 many of the social dislocations associated with rapid economic
 growth in developing nations, but the already sizable middle
 class is growing. Overall access to education, health care,
 and wealth is increasing respect for human rights in Korean
 society.
 Many Koreans have complained that the security threat from the
 North, which is genuine, has been used as a pretext by the
 Government to suppress legitimate internal dissent. Although
 the law enforcement agencies are well trained and generally
 well disciplined, excessive use of force has been a continuing
 problem, especially prior to June 29. Torture has also
 occurred. Although the Constitution provides for freedom of
 speech and press, in practice both have been abridged. The
 new Constitution promises to make these freedoms a reality.
 'RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing:
 In January university student Park Chong-Chol died in police
 custody after being tortured during questioning about alleged
 antigovernment activities. The Park Chong-Chol torture
 incident, together with later revelations of an official
 attempt to cover up the number of officers involved in the
 case, drew widespread public condemnation and contributed
 greatly to the outpouring of public sentiment against the
 Government in June. Five police officers from the Anti-
 Communist Division of the National Police Headquarters (NPH)
 were arrested for direct involvement in the torture killing.
 They were convicted and sentenced to prison terms ranging from
 5 to 15 years. In September 1987, an appellate court reduced
 the sentences of these five to from 3 to 10 years. Three
 senior police officers were convicted of orchestrating a
 coverup of the incident. They were eventually released with
 suspended sentences. In mid-January 1988, newspaper stories
 on the anniversary of Park's death led to a reopening of the
 investigation, leading to the arrest of the head of the Korean
 National Police on charges of ordering the coverup.
 There were unconfirmed reports that Kim Sang-Won, a day
 laborer, died in May as a result of injuries sustained while
 in police custody in March. But it was unclear whether the
 death was politically motivated or the result of physical
 abuse during a criminal investigation.
 In the summer, two protesters, one a university student and
 the other a shipyard worker, died from injuries sustained
 after being struck in the head by tear gas cannisters fired by
 police during demonstrations. There was no evidence that the
 deaths were premeditated in either case. One riot policeman
 was killed during the wave of antigovernment demonstrations in
 June after being hit by a bus commandeered by a demonstrator.
 
 
 730
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 b. Disappearance
 In January and February, human rights and opposition groups
 charged that several students and'others accused of
 antigovernment activities had "disappeared" after being
 apprehended by police and other government security officers.
 All were eventually accounted for, but it was subsequently
 learned that several had been held incommunicado for extensive
 periods in violation of the law, prompting plausible
 allegations that they were mistreated while in custody.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Despite Government insistence that it strictly enforces the
 constitutiqnal prohibition of torture, incidents of torture
 occurred during 1987. In the Park Chong-Chol torture death
 case described above, eight police officers were convicted,
 five of-them receiving prison terms. The Government admitted
 official culpability in the Park Chong-Chol case but denied
 that other instances of torture had occurred. Nonetheless,
 there continued to be plausible reports of other cases of
 torture and cruel treatment by government authorities, some as
 late as October 1987. There were credible charges that labor
 activists
 in what was known as the "Namnoryon" (South Seoul Labor
 Federation) case were mistreated while being questioned by a
 government security agency and that even security agency
 officials thought to be disloyal to the regime were tortured.
 Korea's large police force is well trained and generally well
 disciplined, but at times uses excessive force against
 detainees, especially in political cases. Such abuses by the
 police are a pervasive and ingrained problem. In 1987 there
 were also instances when peaceful demonstrators, including
 Protestant clergyman and lay believers, were beaten by
 plainclothes police officers. On the other hand, despite
 universal proclamations by organizers that demonstrations
 against the Government would be peaceful, students and other
 protesters frequently engaged in violence, throwing rocks and
 homemade Molotov cocktails at police; Riot police have never
 fired weapons nor do they employ baton charges in street
 confrontations. The authorities claim that the preemptive use
 of tear gas prevpnts injury or loss of life.
 Conditions in Korean correctional institutions are austere,
 especially in winter. Cells are unheated. Discipline is
 strict. Prisoners who break rules or protest conditions are
 sometimes beaten. Generally, prisoners are permitted visits
 only by lawyers and members of their immediate family. There
 does not appear to be a major discrepancy in the overall
 treatment between political and regular prisoners in this
 respect, but there continued to be periodic reports in 1987 of
 confrontations between political prisoners, mainly ex-students,
 and prison authorities. Opposition and human rights groups
 have contended that political prisoners are beaten and
 subjected to mistreatment by their jailors because of their
 political views. The Government insists that prison
 authorities exercise only the minimal force necessary to deal
 with prisoners' defiance of authority.
 Charges of police beatings occasionally occur in nonpolitical
 cases and are sometimes reported in the press. In late
 December 1986, the Supreme Court acquitted four people on
 separate murder and robbery charges because the confessions
 
 
 731
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 used against the defendants during their trials had been
 obtained under duress. Similarly, the Supreme Court in
 September 1987 overturned a lower court conviction because the
 defendant was held in seclusion for 35 days and beaten
 repeatedly to coerce him into making a false confession.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Arrest warrants are required by law but sometimes are not
 presented at the time of arrest in politically related cases.
 The Supreme Court ruled in 1985 that police may not detain a
 suspect for more than 48 hours without issuing a formal arrest
 warrant. Furthermore, authorities are required to notify the
 family or lawyer of a suspect's detention and whereabouts
 within 3 days of making a formal arrest. An indictment must.
 be handed down within 30 days of the arrest. The Constitution
 also assures the right to prompt legal assistance and to review
 of an arrest by a court. These requirements are not always
 observed, however, particularly in cases involving suspected
 violators of security-related laws.
 Beginning in October 1986 and continuing through the early
 part of 1987, the authorities conducted sweeping roundups of
 suspected antigovernment "leftists." During this campaign,
 there were numerous violations of legal protections governing
 arrest warrants and timely notification to family members and
 lawyers. Relatives of some suspects apprehended by authorities
 were unable to ascertain the whereabouts of those detained for
 several days and even weeks, prompting charges that some of
 them had "disappeared," even though all were eventually
 accounted for. Another politically motivated roundup of
 "leftists" occurred late in the year without widespread
 violation of legal protections.
 Habeas corpus, not traditional in Korean law, was introduced
 after World War II, abolished in the 1970's, and reintroduced
 in 1980. Although arguably inconsistent with the old and new
 Constitutions, which state that all persons arrested or
 detained shall have the right of review of the legality of the
 arrest or detention, under the Code of Criminal Procedure
 habeas corpus does not apply to those charged with violations
 of the National Security Law or laws governing crimes
 punishable by at least 5 years' imprisonment. Many political
 offenses are therefore excluded. There is a system of bail,
 but it does not apply to offenses punishable by 10 or more
 years' imprisonment. In 1985 the Government adopted a new
 policy to compensate persons held for questioning who are
 subsequently found innocent by prosecutors. The courts
 started to apply this provision in 1987.
 Dissidents who openly criticize the Government are sometimes
 charged with "spreading groundless rumors," detained for short
 periods of usually less than 10 but sometimes up to 30 days,
 and then released. Police and the security agencies
 periodically increase surveillance of, or put under various
 forms of house arrest, those they believe "intend to violate
 the law." Such surveillance is allowed under the Social
 Safety Act, which the Korean Federal Bar Association contends
 is in part unconstitutional under both the new and old
 Constitutions. This law permits measures including "protective
 surveillance," "residential restriction," and "protective
 custody" of certain persons considered likely to break the
 law. These restrictions were used against opposition
 politicians and religious and other. dissidents, particularly
 on days when antigovernment rallies and demonstrations were
 planned.
 
 
 732
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 Opposition politician Kim Dae Jung, for example, was placed
 under house arrest several times in 1987, including for more
 than 2 months on one occasion. Since July 1987, his movements
 have not been restricted. He ran a vigorous campaign for
 president in the fall.
 In 1987 the Government investigated dissident and student
 organizations and made many arrests on national security
 grounds for alleged pro-Communist, pro-North Korean, or
 antistate activities. Government critics claimed that in many
 of the cases the charges were trumped up by the Government to
 suppress dissenting views. There were occasional charges that
 the Government identified suspected student activists for
 immediate conscription into the armed forces. (Military
 service is required of all Korean males, but students are
 normally given deferments in order to complete their
 education). Students convicted of antigovernment activities
 were sometimes required to sign statements of repentance and
 undergo "reorientation programs" (usually consisting of
 lectures, slide shows, etc., on the dangers of communism)
 before being eligible for release.
 Preventive detention of persons deemed "socially dangerous" is
 allowed under prgvisions of the Social Safety Act (referred to
 as the Social Stability Law in previous reports) and the Act
 for the Protedtion of Society (previously called the Social
 Protection Law). The Social Safety Act provides that certain
 security offenders, including suspected North Korean agents,
 can be kept under varying degrees of restriction and
 surveillance as long as they are believed to constitute a
 security threat. A judicial panel can order preventive
 detention for a fixed term of 2 years after the completion of
 the original prison sentence. This incarceration can be
 extended by the panel for additional 2-year periods
 indefinitely, The Government declines for national security
 reasons to reveal the number of'prisoners being detained under
 the Act and -maintains that it is applied mainly to security-
 related offenders, such as North Korean spies. The Protection
 Act also provides for preventive detention--"protective
 custody"--for 7 to 10 years. The law appears designed for
 habitual criminals, the mentally ill, and drug addicts rather
 than security offenders.
 Prisoners judged to be insufficiently repentant are sometimes
 held following the completion of their original prison
 sentences. Two such inmates held under the Social Safety Act
 are Soh Jong-Shik and Kang Jong-Kon. Soh is a Korean resident
 of Japan who finished his original 7-year sentence for
 violating the national security law in 1978. Kang Jong-Kon,
 also a Korean resident of Japan, completed his 5-year sentence
 in 1981. Their continued internment has been criticized by
 international and domestic human rights groups, including the
 Korean Federal Bar Association. In October 1987, the Supreme
 Court ruled that the Social Safety Act was constitptional,
 dismissing a lawsuit filed by Soh challenging the legality of
 his detention.
 In early 1987, the death of an inmate at a government-
 subsidized welfare center'for the destitute in Pusan led to an
 official investigation which revealed that large numbers of
 inmates were being held against their will at the center and
 forced to work for the private gain of the director. The
 director was convicted and sentenced to a 4-year prison term.
 Charges of gross negligence by local officials responsible for
 social welfare implicated the Government indirectly in the
 
 
 733
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 forced labor practices at the center. Further accusations
 were made that authorities accepted such facilities as useful
 places to dump "troublemakers" and made little effort to
 oversee them. The incident prompted calls for a review and
 reform of the country's network of welfare centers. There,
 have been no reports of forced labor in prisons.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution enumerates many rights of defendants,
 including a presumption of innocence, protection against
 self-incrimination, freedom from ex post facto laws and double
 jeopardy, the right to a speedy trial, and the right to legal
 counsel. These rights are generally observed. Trials, with
 some exceptions, must be held within 6 months of arrest.
 The President appoints members of the Supreme Court, whose
 Chief Justice in turn appoints lower court judges. There is a
 three-tier system for criminal cases: district court, appellate
 (high) court, and the Supreme Court. The judiciary is
 generally considered independent in ordinary criminal and
 civil litigation but much less so in politically sensitive
 cases.
 Most trials are open to the public, but attendance was
 occasionally restricted at politically sensitive trials in
 1987. In such instances, the court permitted only a few close
 relatives of the defendants to observe proceedings from the
 gallery. The Government has maintained that these measures
 are necessary to maintain order in the courtroom because of
 occasional attempts by unruly defendants and onlookers to
 disrupt proceedings. Judges generally allow considerable
 scope for examination of witnesses by both prosecution and
 defense. The courts have, however, sometimes denied defense
 requests to call "expert" witnesses to discuss the political
 or ideological leanings of the defendants, even when the
 prosecution has introduced evidence on such topics. The right
 of defendants to be represented by an attorney is respected,
 but attorneys are sometimes denied permission to meet with
 defendants until after they are referred to prosecutors by the
 police or other security/investigative agencies.
 Although trials are usually open to the public, trial
 documents are not part of the public record. Charges against
 defendants are clearly stated. In lengthy and complex
 indictments, however, the relationship between specific acts
 alleged and violations of particular sections of the penal code
 is not always clearly drawn. In cases involving a mixture of
 political and criminal charges, this lack of clarity can bring
 into question the fairness of the proceedings. Political and
 ordinary criminal cases are both tried by the court system
 described above. Military courts do not try civilians.
 Defendants have the right of appeal in felony (including
 politically related) cases, a right often exercised and
 frequently resulting in reduced sentences. Death sentences
 are automatically appealed.
 The number of political prisoners fluctuated considerably
 during 1987. In national security cases, neither the
 Government nor Korean law distinguishes between-criminal acts
 of violence and actions such as disseminating "subversive"
 literature (including North Korean propaganda). The Government
 has in the past been reluctant to acknowledge that any
 prisoners were "political prisoners" per se. At the beginning
 of 1987, when the Government was conducting a large-scale
 
 
 734
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 roundup of suspected "leftist" activists, human rights and
 opposition groups claimed that as many as 2,000 political
 prisoners were being held.
 A major component of the democratization reforms announced
 June 29 by the ruling Democratic Justice Party Chairman Roh
 Tae Woo was the release of political prisoners. Consequently,
 in July and August, the Government released a large number of
 political prisoners in a series of special clemencies. During
 this time, the Government also granted amnesty and restored
 civil rights to more thana 2,300 individuals, including
 prominent opposition politician Kim Dae Jung. In August the,
 Government claimed that it was holding no more than about 100
 political prisoners, all of whom it contended had been
 convicted by the courts of being ideological 'leftists" and
 revolutionaries who sought to subvert society through viclence
 and other means. Human rights groups acknowledged that large
 numbers of prisoners, mainly students, had been released, but
 claimed that the number of real political prisoners still
 being held was closer to 400.
 During the summer numbers of people were arrested in connection
 with growing labor strife. Beginning in September, authorities
 began to apprehend significant numbers of suspected student
 activists, including key leaders of the National University
 Student Council Alliance ("Chondaehyop"). 'Many of these
 students were accused of violating the National Security Law
 by allegedly forming subversive organizations, plotting to
 undermine the presidential.electiorr, and fomenting social
 unrest. Other arrests were made during and after the
 presidential election campaign. By the end of 1987, human
 rights groups estimated that there were around 1,200 political
 prisoners, a figure given credence by the Government's
 announcement in early January 1988 that about 1,200 prisoners,
 including Kim Keun Tae, recipient of the 1987 Robert Kennedy
 Human Rights Award, might be released in a special amnesty in
 honor of the presidential inauguration on February 25.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 -   Correspondence
 Many political, religious, and other dissidents are subjected
 to varying methods and degrees of surveillance by government
 security-'agents. During politically sensitive periods, this
 surveillance by one or more security agencies may increase, or
 a form of house arrest may be imposed or both. The tapping of
 telephones and the opening or interception of correspondence
 is believed to be prevalent. Koreans who meet with foreigners,
 particularly with journalists, diplomats, and human rights
 representatives;-are often questioned afterward.
 Listening to North Korean radio broadcasts is strictly
 prohibited by-law, and is punishable by a prison sentence.
 Reading or purveying books or other literature considered
 subversive, pro-Communist, or pro-North Korea is also illegal
 and a punishable offense. In 1987, as in previous years,
 several people, mostly students, were arrested and charged
 with violating the National Security Law for both types of
 offenses.
 The Constitution requires a warrant issued by a judge upon
 request of a prosecutor for search and seizure in a residence.
 The police, however, at times force their way into private
 homes~vr offices without warrants. There are frequently large
 numbers of uniformed and plainclothes police in city centers,
 
 
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 near university campuses, government and ruling party offices,
 and media outlets because of fear of antigovernment
 demonstrations. Citizens, particularly students and young
 people, are sometimes stopped, questioned, and searched.
 Government informants are known to be posted on and around
 university campuses. Traditional Korean police practice
 requires poli-ce commanders to be familiar with the personal
 and business affairs of residents in their jurisdictions.
 This system has generally proved effective in combating
 ordinary crime, and urban residents generally credit it with
 keeping streets safe. But the large police presence near
 campuses has the primary purpose of keeping track of and
 discouraging students from engaging in political activities,
 and it has been a key complaint of students, faculty members,
 and administrators.
 In most other respects, the Government honors the right of
 personal privacy and the integrity of the home and family.
 Persons thought to have politically suspect backgrounds,
 however, are denied some forms of employment and advancement,
 particularly in government, the media, and education.
 Although corroborating evidence is sketchy, it is widely
 believed that the Government maintains a blacklist of labor
 and student activists. According to reliable reports, the
 Government periodically pressures large business corporations
 and other enterprises into making "voluntary contributions,"
 and threatens tax audits or the elimination of favorable loan
 conditions for those who fail to comply.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 During the latter half of 1987, the media was more open in its
 coverage of events. Although freedom of speech and press is
 provided for in the Constitution, in practice the expression
 of opposition viewpoints has often been restricted, sometimes
 severely.
 Although National Assemblymen enjoy immunity from prosecution
 for remarks made within the Assembly, they are not immune from
 prosecution for what they write or say outside the chamber.
 Opposition parliamentarian Yoo Sung-Hwan was arrested in
 October 1986 for prior dissemination of an Assembly speech in
 which he suggested that the first priority of the Government's
 "national ideology" should be unification of the peninsula and
 not anticommunism. He was convicted in April 1987 of violating
 the national security law and sentenced to 1 year in prison.
 Yoo was released from custody in July 1987, however, and
 returned to active politics.
 In 1980 the Chun government enacted a Basic Press Law, merged
 broadcasting networks and newspapers, established a government-
 owned public television corporation, and prohibited national
 newspapers from stationing reporters in provincial cities.
 Media organizations were required to have a license to
 operate. There are also criminal code provisions against
 spreading "rumors which eventually disturb peace and order" or
 "defiling the state." Government critics say that such
 statutes were used to muzzle and punish dissident views. In
 response to continuing public criticism over its restrictive
 provisions, the Basic Press Law was abrogated by the National
 Assembly in October. Ruling and opposition parties were
 unable to agree, however, on a replacement law to govern the
 publication of newspapers and periodicals and the broadcast
 media.
 
 
 736
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 Under the old Basic Press Law the domestic media engaged in
 "self-censorship" according to "guidelines" issued regularly
 by the Government orally or in writing to editors. Journalists
 who objected to or ignored these guidelines, or who printed
 critical stories on politically sensitive topics were
 occasionally picked up for questioning and intimidated by
 security officers. After abrogation of the Basic Press Law in
 late 1987, reports persisted that the Government tried to give
 "guidelines," but the press felt less constrained to follow
 them.
 Four major national daily newspapers frequently carry articles
 critical of th3 Government. Two other national dailies are
 much less independent. A leading dissident group led by a
 former'journalist dismissed in the 1970's announced plans to
 start an independent newspaper in 1988. Certain news items
 are taboo, including any direct criticism of the President or
 members of his immediate family. Praise of or support for
 communism or North Korea is also strictly prohibited.
 The two major television networks are controlled by the
 Government. Althoug' opposition viewpoints are usually aired,
 coverage is biased. Opposition positions -are often downplayed
 and distorted. In 1987 opposition and dissident groups
 continued to urge a public boycott of the television viewers'
 fee collected by the Government. In October the Government
 granted permission for the Christian Broadcasting System
 (CBS), which is affiliated with a leading dissident Christian
 organization, to resume limited newscasts banned since the
 early 1980's.
 In late 1986, three journalists were arrested and charged with
 violating the National Security Law for publishing a series of
 "press guidelines" issued by the Government to a leading
 national daily newspaper. The "Mal" ["words"] case, as it
 came to be kqown, was. reported extensively by the press and
 stirred considerable public debate. The three. journalists
 were alI convicted in 1987, but the court released them by
 suspending execution of their prison terms.
 The Goyernmeht announced in October that it was lifting the
 ban on the sale of 419.books previously deemed "illegal," and
 that only 2]9 book s would remain on the banned list. Less
 than 2 Xeeks after the announcement, however, government
 authorities searched bookstbres in Seoul, confiscating
 hundreds of nlacklisted" books and detaining some bookstore.
 owners and publishers for questioning. In 1987 the Government
 invokedithe National Security Law at least a dozen times _
 against publishers, printers, and distributors for producing
 or selling 'subversive, ideological" literature.
 Professors are expected to play an aptive role in preventing
 campus demonstrations,_ a task many find objectionable. In
 1987 some 1,400 professors and faculty members signed
 petitions and other statements critical of President Chun's
 April 13 decision to halt public debate over constitutional
 revision. There is no evidence of retribution. In the past,
 however, some professors who signed politically critical
 statements were later subjected to various pressures and
 punishments. In some instances, universities withheld
 promotions and salary increases, yielded to government
 pressure and demanded apologies, denied funds or grants to
 pursue research abroad, or pressured professors to resign from
 administrative positions.
 
 
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 A number of specified categories of assembly, including those
 considered likely to "undermine public order or cause social
 unrest," are prohibited by the Law on Assemblies and
 Demonstrations. The law also requires that demonstrations of
 all types, including political assemblies, be reported in
 advance to the police, who may declare an assembly "unlawful."
 Violation of the law carries a maximum sentence of 7 years'
 imprisonment or a substantial fine. Most peaceful nonpolitical
 assemblies take place without official supervision or
 restriction.
 Meetings of opposition and dissident groups are closely
 monitored and sometimes blocked, often by placing the featured
 speaker under some form of house arrest. In 1987 the
 Government prevented several opposition-sponsored gatherings
 on grounds they might incite "social unrest" and were
 therefore illegal. During the fall presidential campaign,
 however, the opposition and government parties held a number
 of large rallies, including some attended by over a million
 people. Students are generally permitted to hold
 demonstrations and rallies on campus, but police almost always
 block attempts to march into the streets. Confrontations
 ensue, often leading to violence. Radical students sometimes
 attempt to create such encounters with the police.
 Under the Constitution, workers are assured the rights of
 independent association, collective bargaining, and collective
 action. In the past these rights have been seriously
 circumscribed in practice and law. Under present legislation,
 the rights do not apply to certain categories of workers,
 primarily government employees, the armed forces, policemen,
 and firefighters.
 The single national labor center, the Federation of Korean
 Trade Unions (FKTU), and its 16 national affiliate federations
 and unions are not directly controlled by the Government. An
 amendment to the Labor Union Law in October 1987 now permits
 workers to organize industrial or vocational trade unions
 nationally. The old law limited unions to individual
 enterprises, with some minor exceptions such as some taxi and
 bus drivers.
 The political activities of federations and unions are,
 however, limited by law. The Government has also interfered
 with their other activities. For example, in 1987 the FKTU
 leadership was pressured by the Government and ruling party to
 issue a statement supporting President Chun's controversial
 April 13 decision to end constitutional revision negotiations
 between the ruling and opposition parties. Labor organizations
 are prohibited by law from endorsing a particular political
 party or politician, although the FKTU frequently lobbies the
 government and National Assembly in connection with labor and
 welfare-related issues.
 The FKTU is affiliated with the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). The FKTU's constituent federations
 and unions are affiliated with recognized international trade
 secretariats. The Government has observer status at the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) and aspires to become a
 full-fledged member. A tripartite delegation regularly
 represents Korea at major ILO conferences and functions.

 Widespread labor unrest broke out across the country for about
 3 months beginning in July, shortly after DJP Chairman Roh's
 June 29 announcement of reforms. Through the first 10 months
 of 1987, more than 3,000 labor disputes were recorded by the
 Ministry of Labor, compared to 276 in all of 1986. During the
 strikes, there were work stoppages and other collective
 actions, most of them technically illegal. Workers demanded
 trade union autonomy, higher wages and compensation, and
 improved working conditions. Although most strikes and other
 collective actions by workers were relatively peaceful, some
 labor-related protests were violent. The Government generally
 displayed restraint during labor unrest. Later the police
 began arresting workers and student activists accused by the
 Government of either engaging in violence or clandestinely
 inciting laborers and attempting to imbue them with "leftist"
 ideology. Although the Government subsequently freed many
 detained workers, an estimated 250-300 were believed
 to be still in custody in mid-November.
 Largely in response to the labor upheavals, the National
 Assembly in October revised some provisions of the trade union
 and related laws to liberalize requirements and other
 administrative procedures for organizing workers. The
 changes, if observed in practice, should strengthen the
 relative bargaining power of unions, which previously tended
 to be weak vis-a-vis employers and the Government in wage and
 other labor issues. The National Assembly failed, however, to
 repeal the ban on political activities by organized labor.
 Amendments to the labor laws in 1986 removed the FKTU and its
 affiliates from the category of "third parties" barred from
 lending assistance to local unions or intervening in labor
 disputes. Other religious, dissident, and "nonofficial" labor
 groups, such as the Catholic Young Christian Workers (JOC) and
 Protestant Urban Industrial Mission (UIM), continued to be
 prohibited by law from assisting legally established unions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state-favored religion in Korea. There is
 generally complete freedom for proselytizing, doctrinal
 teaching, and conversion. The faith of political figures,
 such as those contending for the Presidency, is not a
 political issue. Korea both sends and receives missionaries
 of various faiths. Many religious groups in Korea maintain
 active links with members of similar faith in other countries.
 Foreign missionaries, although generally welcome, are sometimes
 subjected to various forms of harassment by immigration and
 other government authorities if they have extensive dealings
 with Korean political activists or directly criticize the
 Government.
 The Government and Koreans in general do not discriminate
 against minority sects. Adherence to a particular faith
 confers neither advantages nor disadvantages in civil,
 military, or official life. Churches and religious groups,
 however, are subject to most of the restrictions dn political
 activities and criticism of the Government that apply to other
 institutions. Many of the most vocal and well-organized
 critics of the Government are religious in nature; these
 include Catholic, Protestant, and Buddhist groups. Police in
 1987 occasionally hindered religious services when they were
 scheduled to coincide with a political or human rights related
 rallies. Clergy and lay believers were sometimes harassed by
 authorities for their political or social activism or for both.

 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Except for criminals and some figures considered politically
 suspect, most Koreans can obtain passports for overseas travel
 in officially approved categories like business. Christian
 activists, opposition politicians, and other dissidents whom
 the Government believes may "defame the State" while abroad
 are sometimes prevented from leaving the country. Religious
 dissidents are sometimes prevented from attending church
 conferences abroad at which "sensitive" political topics like
 human rights or national reunification are to be discussed.
 In November the Government refused to issue a passport to Ms.
 In Chae Keun until it was too late for her to come to the
 United States for the 1987 Robert Kennedy Memorial Human
 Rights Award ceremony at which she was to receive the award on
 behalf of herself and her husband, Kim Keun Tae, who has been
 in jail since 1985.
 Citing foreign exchange considerations and the problem of
 unqualified students going abroad, the Government limits the
 number of passports issued to tourists and prospective
 students. Limitations on tourist travel were, however,
 somewhat liberalized in 1987. Because Korea is one of the
 most densely populated countries in the world, the Government
 encourages emigration and does not discriminate against
 prospective emigrants.
 A small but continuing influx of Indochinese refugees
 continues to be admitted to temporary first asylum in Korea.
 They are cared for at a camp in Pusan by the Korean Red Cross
 until they can be resettled abroad. Few have been permitted
 to resettle permanently in Korea.
 There is universal freedom of movement and freedom to change
 employment within Korea, with the exception of the temporary
 house arrest previously described.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The President has been the center of power in modern Korea.
 This concentration has been reinforced by traditional political
 attitudes, law, and practice, and intensified by the support
 the President enjoys from the military and security agencies,
 and by the Government's active role in economic development.
 No local autonomy currently exists in Korea; the President and
 members of the National Assembly are the only elected
 officials.
 In August 1980, under strict martial law conditions, President
 Chun Doo Hwan promulgated the new Constitution establishing
 the Fifth Republic. Claiming that this Constitution was
 democratic and fair, President Chun expressed his preference
 for selecting his successor through an indirect election
 system. The opposition claimed that would be tantamount to
 permitting Chun to name the next president and demanded direct
 presidential elections.
 In 1986 Chun responded to increasing pressure from the
 opposition and said he would "not object" to revising the
 Constitution provided it was the product of bipartisan
 agreement. The ruling party proposed a parliamentary cabinet
 system with a strong prime minister.elected by the National
 Assembly, arguing that such a system would help redress the
 
 
 740
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 overconcentration of power in the presidency. The opposition
 refused to budge from its demand for direct presidential
 elections, which, it contended, reflected the will of the
 majority of the people.
 With talks between the ruling party and the opposition
 stalemated, on April 13, 1987 President Chun unilaterally
 ended public and National Assembly debate over constitutional
 revision. He argued that there was a "pressing need" not to
 waste "national energy" on constitutional revision with
 important "national tasks," like the 1988 transfer of power
 and hosting of the Olympic Games in Seoul little more than
 1 year away. Chun's decision led to widespread civil
 disturbances that rocked the country in June. DJP Chairman
 Roh's dramatic June 29 announcement promising democratic
 reforms and direct presidential elections ended the protests.
 In October, after intense negotiations, the ruling and
 opposition parties produced a bipartisan consensus on a
 constitutional revision. The agreement called for a directly
 elected president to serve one 5-year term beginning February
 1988. In late October, Koreans overwhelming approved the
 constitutional revision package in a free and fair national
 referendum. On December 16, a national election for the
 presidency took place. There were four major candidates for
 President: Roh Tae Woo, opposition leaders Kim Dae Jung and
 Kim Young Sam, and Kim Jong Pil, a former prime minister and
 close confidante of the late President Park Chung Hee. The
 election campaign was hard fought and sometimes marred by
 violence. Nearly 90 percent of the electorate voted. Roh Tae
 Woo emerged the victor with a plurality of around 36 percent,
 winning approximately 2 million more votes than his closest
 competitor. While Kim Jong-Pil, the head of the most
 conservative opposition party, conceded victory to Roh
 immediately, the opposition parties led by Kim Young Sam and
 Kim Dae Jung challenged the outcome, alleging fraud.
 The opposition parties had observers in both voting places and
 ballot counting posts. While there appear to have been
 numerous instances of irregularities and abuses of Korean
 election laws, the available evidence does not suggest
 systematic fraud of a kind which would call into question the
 overall election resultS. Although they protested election
 irregularities, the two Kims immediately began work on
 participation in the National Assembly elections scheduled for
 early spring 1988. President-elect Roh pledged to continue
 efforts to realize greater democratization. Some student and
 opposition groups staged protests against the "rigged
 elections." Nevertheless, the public as a whole appeared
 willing to accept the election results as an important first
 step in the process of political development.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 .of Human Rights
 The Republic of Korea does not welcome outside involvement in
 the human rights area, but government and ruling party
 officials have generally been willing to meet with
 international-human rights interest groups, such as Amnesty
 International, the International Human Rights Law Group, and
 Asia Watch. Representatives-of these groups are, however,
 closely watched during the time they are in Korea. Some have
 had documents and other materials confiscated at the time of
 their departure from Korea, and occasionally visas have been
 
 
 741
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 denied such persons when they have subsequently applied for a
 return visa.
 According to the Government, public prosecutors and the human
 rights division of the Ministry of Justice are responsible for
 protecting human rights and investigating violations. The
 Government has admitted some human rights problems, but claims
 it is taking steps to address them. For example, in the wake
 of the Park Chong-Chol torture killing in January, the
 Government promised to take all necessary measures to prevent
 a recurrence and set up a Human Rights.Protection Committee
 under the Office of the Prime Minister. The Committee met a
 few times but was inactive for much of the -rest of the year.
 The National Assembly and political parties also have
 committees which are concerned with various aspects of human
 rights. Human rights issues, like the release of political
 prisoners and allegations of prisoner mistreatment, continued
 to be important issues in political debate. The human rights
 committees of the major opposition parties were active in
 investigating allegations of abuses, visiting prisons, meeting
 with prisoners-and their families, and .providing legal defense
 for court cases.
 Several politically nonaffiliated private organizations are
 active in promoting human rights, chiefly the Human Rights
 Committee (HRC) of the Korean National Council of Churches
 (KNCC), the Catholic Justice and Peace Committee, the Family
 Members Movement for the Realization of Democracy
 ("mingahyop"), the Korean Federal Bar Association, and the
 Korea Legal Aid Center in Seoul. These groups publish reports
 on the human rights situation in Korea, submit petitions to
 the Government, and make their views known both inside and
 outside Korea. People working with these groups are sometimes
 questioned and detained. Their offices are searched and
 materials periodically confiscated by the security services.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Republic of Xorea with more than 41 million inhabitants is
 densely populated and racially and culturally homogeneous.
 There are no ethnic minorities of significant size. Despite
 the cultural homogeneity of its people, regional rivalries
 exist in Korea. Many Koreans believe that persons from the
 southwestern region (North and South Cholla provinces) face
 some discrimination, and that successive governments led
 predominantly by figures from southeast Korea (North and South
 Kyongsang provinces) and other areas have neglected the
 economic development of the Cholla region. The present
 Government claims that it is making particular efforts to
 encourage the development of the Cholla region.
 In Korea, with its conservative Confucian tradition, women are
 subordinate to men socially, economically, and legally.
 Nonetheless, women are free to vote, become government
 officials, and hold elected office. In 1987 Hong Sook-Ja, a
 former career diplomat representing the Social Democratic
 Party, became the first woman in Korea's history to run for
 president, although she subsequently dropped out and joined
 the campaign of Kim Young Sam. Women enjoy full access to
 educational opportunities. They are increasingly represented,
 though still largely at the entry level, in government and the
 private sector.
 
 
 742
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 In general, however, women are not protected against
 discrimination in hiring, pay, or advancement. They are
 commonly expected to resign from jobs upon marriage or
 pregnancy. Women's organizations'and members of the National
 Assembly are trying to focus more attention on women's rights.
 The Family Law was revised in 1960 and 1979, but critics
 contend that the law is still inconsistent with Korean
 constitutional provisions of sexual equality. For example,
 women do not have equal rights with men in passing on
 citizenship to their children, nor do they have equal rights
 with regard to child custody in divorce cases. Women's rights
 groups have continually campaigned for changes in these and
 other points of the family law.
 CONDITIONS OF-LABOR
 The Labor Standards Law governs the employment of-minors and
 female workers. Minors under age 13 must have a special
 permit issued by the Ministry of Labor to be employed. Minors
 under age 18 must have a parent or guardian�ls written approval
 in order to work. They are prohibited from working at night
 without special permission from the Ministry of Labor.
 Certain labor-intensive industries, such as wearing apparel,
 textiles, footwear, and small electronics assembly,
 traditionally employ large-numbers of recent junior high
 school graduates, generally aged 15-17, for full-time
 production line work. These young workers are generally
 treated like other regular full-time employees and therefore
 are not always accorded the full protections to which they are
 entitled by law.,    --
 The Labor Standards Law provides for a maximum workweek of 60
 hours,-1 paid dayooff a week, compensation for overtime and
 holiday work, paid holidays, and annual leave. Recent
 government. statistics indicate that the average full-time
 industrial worker spends more than 55 hours per week on the
 job--one of the highest rates in the world. Workers are
 usually compensated for overtime work, but unions often
 complain that extensive overtime, often in excess of legal
 limits, is. mandatory. On January~l, 1988, the Government
 implemented a two-tier minimum wage system and an ambitious
 national pension system for industrial workers. It also plans
 to expand eligibility for medical insurance benefits.
 Although the Ministry of Labor has not yet released the
 year-end figures, there were estimated to be more than 1,500
 work-related fatalities in Korea in 1987. The Government has
 pledged to take stronger measures, including fines and
 imprisonment, to curb employer abuses. Government critics
 cite the continued high incidence of such accidents as
 evidence of lax enforcement procedures on the part of
 government investigators.
