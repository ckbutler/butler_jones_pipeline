 ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES*
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy with a multiparty system and free elections.
 There is no constitution; a series of "basic laws" provide for fundamental rights. The
 legislature, or Knesset, has the power to dissolve the Government and limit the au-
 thority of the executive branch. On May 29, Likud Party leader Benyamin
 Netanyahu was elected Prime Minister, he heads a center-right coalition govern-
 ment. The judiciary is independent.
 Since its founding in 1948, Israel has been in a state of war with most of its Arab
 neighbors. It concluded a peace treaty with Egypt in 1979 and with Jordan in 1994.
 As a result of the 1967 War, Israel occupied the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, East
 Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights. The international community does not recognize
 Israel's sovereignty over any part of the occupied territories. Throughout its exist-
 ence, Israel has experienced numerous terrorist attacks. It relies heavily on its mili-
 tary and security services and retains many security-related regulations from the
 period of the British Mandate.
 An historic process of reconciliation between Israel and its neighbors began with
 the Madrid Conference in 1991 and continued with the September 1993 signing of
 the Israeli-Palestinian Declaration of Principles (DOP.) In September 1995, Prime
 Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Chairman Yasir Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Or-
 ganization (PLO) signed the Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza
 trip, which provided for the election and establishment of a Palestinian self-gov-
 erning authority, transfer of civil authority, Israeli redeployment from major Pal-
 estinian population centers in the West Bank, security arrangements, and coopera-
 tion in a variety of areas. Palestinian elections were held in January. Negotiations
 on permanent status--which are to address the status of Jerusalem, Palestinian ref-
 ugees, Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, final security arrangements,
 borders, and other issues of common interest-began on May 5 and were imme-
 diately adjourned.
 Internal security is the responsibility of the General Security Service (GSS)-
 (Shin Bet, or Shabak), which is under the authority of the Prime Ministers office.
 The police are under the authority of the Minister of Interior Security. The Israel
 Defense Forces (IDF) are under the authority of a civilian Minister of Defense. The
 IDF includes a significant portion of the adult population on active duty or reserve
 status and plays a role in maintaining internal security. The Foreign Affairs and
 Defense Committee in the Knesset reviews the activities of the IDF and Shin Bet.
 Some members of the security forces committed human rights abuses.
 Israel has an advanced industrial economy, and citizens enjoy a high standard of
 living, with a per capita income of almost $17,000. Unemployment among citizens
 was approximately 6.5 percent with nearly full employment in some areas. Along
 with rapid economic growth in recent years there has been a tendency toward in-
 creasing income inequality. The long-standing gap in levels of income between Jew-
 ish and non-Jewish citizens continues. Israel s growing reliance on foreign workers,
 principally from Asia and Eastern Europe who are generally employed in agri-
 culture and the construction industry, and comprise about 10 percent of the labor
 force. Since the implementation of an economic stabilization plan in 1985, Israel has
 moved gradually to reduce state intervention in the economy. The new Netanyahu
 Government promised a renewed emphasis on market-oriented structural reforms,
 especially deregulation and rapid privatization of the economy, but had achieved lit-
 tle progress by year's end. Despite the continued dominant role of the Government
 in the economy, individuals generally are free to invest in private interests and own
 property.
 *The human rights situation in the occupied territories is discussed in the annex appended
 to this report.
 
 
 1279
 The Government generally respects human rights, and citizens enjoy a wide range
 of civil and other rights. Israel's main human rights problems have arisen from its
 policies and practices in the occupied territories. However, the redeployment of the
 IDF from most major Palestinian population areas in the West Bank in December
 1995, and its previous withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, have significantly re-
 duced these problems. In September, however, Israel's opening of an archeological
 tunnel near the Temple Mount in Jerusalem and the subsequent calls by Palestin-
 ian leaders to protest this decision sparked confrontations between Israeli security
 forces and Palestinians expressing their frustrations over the slow pace of the peace
 process. These demonstrations escalated into several days of fighting between lsrae-
 lis and Palestinians and left 16 Israelis and 58 Palestinians dead and many hun-
 dreds injured.
 The authorities continue to hold and mistreat Palestinian security detainees, and
 detention and prison conditions, particularly for Palestinians, are poor. However,
 new legislation during the year set tighter limits on the length and grounds for pre-
 trial detention. New legislation also broadened children's rights and made the basis
 for comparing men's and women's compensation more equitable. Proposed legisla-
 tion defining the basis for and limits of GSS activities, circulated to interested
 groups in 1995 for their comment, was widely criticized for because it authorized
 the Government to use force during interrogation and to issue secret guidelines de-
 fining the methods of interrogation. The legislation has not been formally submitted
 to the Knesset.
 The Government responded to terrorist and security incidents by tightening exist-
 ing restrictions on movement across borders with the West Bank and Gaza, and de-
 molishing the homes of some suspected terrorists and their families in the occupied
 territories.
 The Government took steps to address discrimination and violence against
 women. It pledged to eliminate the social and economic gap between Israel's Arab
 and Jewish citizens; however, the Arab minority still does not share fully in the
 rights granted to, and the obligations imposed on, Jewish citizens.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-There are no reports of political
 killings by government forces. During the year, however, at least two Palestinians
 died while in Israeli custody, two after apparently being tortured by other Palestin-
 ians (see Section L.a. and Section 1.c. of the annex.)
 Two extremist Islamic groups, the Islamic Resistance (Hamas) and the Palestine
 Islamic Jihad (PIJ), made a concerted effort during the year to undermine the au-
 thority of the Palestinian Authority and derail the Israeli-Palestinian peace xrocess
 by killing Israeli civilians in a series of deadly suicide bombing attacks in erusa-
 lem, Tel Aviv, and Ashkelon (see Section 1.g.). On June 9, terrorists shot and killed
 an Israeli couple in a car 12 miles southwest of Jerusalem.
 On October 3, a Tel Aviv court sentenced Yigal Amir, the killer of former Prime
 Minister Yitzhak Rabin, to an additional 5 years in prison. Amir is already serving
 a life term. The court also sentenced the killer's brother, Hagai Amir, to 12 years,
 and a third man, Dror Adani, to 7 years, for plotting Rabin's murder. The three men
 were also found guilty of planning attacks against Palestinians, and Hagai Amir
 was convicted of various weapons carges.
 In September Israel's opening of a controversial tunnel near Muslim and Jewish
 holy sites in Jerusalem and calls by the Palestinian Authority (PA) for Palestinians
 to protest the move sparked several days of violent clashes between Israeli security
 forces and Palestinian security officers and civilians. Fifty-eight Palestinians (in-
 cluding 11 Palestinian security officers) and 16 IDF soldiers and border police offi-
 cers died in the fighting, and some 1,500 persons were injured (see Section 1.g. of
 the annex).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although laws and administrative regulations prohibit the physical abuse of detain-
 ees, the head of Shin Bet is empowered to authorize security officers to use use
 "moderate physical and psychological pressure" in interrogating Palestinian detain-
 ees. In certain "ticking bomb" cases the GSS has "greater flexibility" to employ "spe-
 cial measures" when deemed necessary to obtain information to save lives. These
 measures have been applied against Palestinians suspected of involvement in plan-
 ning terrorist acts, and include the practice of violent shaking (see Section l.c. of
 the annex).
 
 
 1280
 The practice of shaking was challenged repeatedly before the Israeli Supreme
 Court during the year by human rights groups and attorneys for individual detain-
 ees. In two cases in November, the Court upheld the right of the GSS to use "special
 measures" and "force" against Palestinian prisoners. However, in a number of cases,
 the Court ordered the GSS to show cause that this method of interrogation was nec-
 essary in order to obtain information directly related to citizens' safety. While in a
 number of cases the GSS succeeded in meeting the Court's standard, and shaking
 was authorized, the show-cause orders constitute some restriction on the use of the
 method.
 In August the authorities detained Bashar Tarabieh, a part-time employee of the
 nongovernmental organization (NGO) Human Rights Watch, who had been visiting
 his family in the Golan Heights. For 8 days he was held without charge in a jail
 near Hailfa, in a separate section for the detention and interrogation of security pris-
 oners. Between repeated interrogation sessions he was frequently hooded and tied
 to a chair in a contorted position. He was held in a cell with poor sanitary condi-
 tions, and for much of his detention given food that was inedible. After international
 attention brought his case to light, he was released without charge.
 Conditions vary in incarceration facilities in Israel and the occupied territories,
 which are administered by the Israeli Prison Service (IPS), the national police, or
 the Israel Defense Forces. IPS prisons usually meet minimum international stand-
 ards. Generally, IPS inmates are not subject to physical abuse by guards, food is
 adequate, and prisoners receive basic necessities. Inmates receive mail, have tele-
 vision sets in their cells, and receive regular visits. Prisoners receive wages for pris-
 on work and benefits for good behavior. Many IPS prisons have drug treatment,
 educational, and recreational programs. The IPS has established an investigatory
 committee to look into charges of violence byguards against inmates.
 Since the closure in 1995 of the main ID& detention camps in the occupied terri-
 tories, all security detainees from the occupied territories who are held for more
 than a few days are transferred to facilities within Israel. Security detainees in 1996
 were held in IDF camps in Israel, but also in IPS facilities and in special sections
 of police detention facilities. Prisoners incarcerated for security reasons are subject
 to a different regimen, even in IPS facilities. They are often denied certain privi-
 leges given t prisoners convicted on criminal charges. Security prisoners include
 some minors. Detention camps administered by the IDF are limited to male Pal-
 estinian security prisoners and are guarded by armed soldiers. The number of secu-
 rity prisoners, 4,900 at the beginning of 1996, varied between 3,800 and 4,200 dur-
 ing the year, and was approximately 3,800 at year's end.
 Conditions at some national police detention facilities can fall below minimum
 international standards. Such facilities are intended to hold criminal detainees prior
 to trial, but often become de facto prisons. Those held include some security detain-
 ees and some persons who have been convicted and sentenced. Inmates in the na-
 tional police detention facilities are often not accorded the same rights as prisoners
 in the IPS. Moreover, conditions are worse in the separate facilities for security de-
 tainees maintained both in police facilities and in IPS prisons.
 In response to a series of reports by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel
 (ACRI) that were critical of the country's detention facilities, the Government in
 April presented a plan for widespread reform, including renovation of existing police
 and IPS facilities and construction of new ones. By year's end some improvements
 had been made in the country's major detention facilities. A new prison, built to
 modern standards for incarceration, was opened at Tsalmon. A detention facility in
 Beersheva that had been criticized for its very poor conditions was shut down. Some
 detainees from police facilities were moved to the IPS to relieve overcrowding.
 Funds were allocated to rebuild the Abu Kabir facility in the Tel Aviv area, and
 some minor renovations were made in Jerusalem's Russian Compound detention
 center, in which up to 50 Palestinian detainees had been crowded into 4-bed cells.
 Thus far improvements have been limited in scope, and dilapidation and over-
 crowding (the latter aggravated by the closure of IDF detention facilities in the occu-
 pied territories) are sti problems. New legislation enacted in May and scheduled
 to take effect in 1997 defines the minimum conditions for detainees. The minimum
 conditions for detainees include: The right to live in conditions that would not harm
 the health or dignity of the detainee; access to adequate health care; the right to
 a bed for each detainee; and access to exercise and fresh air on a daily basis.
 Children's rights gups have expressed particular concern over the separate sec-
 tions of holding facilities set aside for the detention of children. Overcrowding, poor
 physical conditions, lack of social workers, and denial of visits by parents are among
 the key problems. In addition to some Israeli minors held in criminal cases, there
 are juveniles among Palestinian detainees. Children's rights activists have rec-
 ommended the construction of a separate detention facility for children.
 
 
 1281
 Conditions in IDF detention camps have been criticized repeatedly over the years.
 In May the Ketziot Detention Camp in the Negev, regarded as having had the
 harshest conditions, was closed. Conditions at Meggido detention facility near Afula
 remain difficult, where 90 percent of detainees are housed in tents. Conditions in
 remaining facilities improved in some respects, with inmates given more time for
 exercise outside their cells. Nevertheless, recreational facilities remain minimal, and
 severe limitations remain on family visits to detainees. Visits were prevented for
 long periods during closures of the borders with Gaza and the West Bank, including
 a 4-month closure after the February-March bombings.
 All incarceration facilities are monitored by various branches of the Government,
 by members of the Knesset, and by the International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICRC) and other human rights groups. In somes instances, human rights groups
 and diplomatic officials encountered difficulties gaining access to specific detainees,
 usually Palestinians held for security offenses (see Section 1.d. of the annex).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest of citi-
 zens, and the Government observes this prohibition. Defendants are considered in-
 nocent until proven guilty, and have the right to writs of habeas corpus and other
 procedural safeguard. However, a 1979 law permits administrative detention with-
 out charge or trial. The Minister of Defense may issue a detention order for a maxi-
 mum of a year. Within 48 hours of issuance, detainees must appear before a district
 judge who may confirm, shorten, or overturn the order. If the order is confirmed,
 an automatic review takes place after 3 months. Detainees have the right to be rep-
 resented by counsel and appeal detention orders to the Supreme Court. At detention
 hearings, the Government may withhold evidence from defense lawyers on security
 grounds. It may also seek to renew administrative detention orders.
 In felony cases, a district court judge may postpone for 48 hours the notification
 of arrest to the detainee's attorney. The postponement may be extended to 7 days
 by the Minister of Defense on national security grounds or by the Police Inspector
 General to conduct an investigation. Moreover, a judge may postpone notification for
 up to 15 days in national security cases.
 New legislation enacted in May, which takes effect in 1997, defines more narrowly
 the grounds for pretrial detention, and reduces to 24 hours the length of time a per-
 sn may be held without charge. Children's rights activists have recommended sepa-
 rate legislation to define when and how a child may be arrested and how long chil-
 dren may be detained.
 Administrative orders issued by the IDF central command continued to restrict
 the movements of some members of the Jewish ultranationalist Kach and Kahane
 Chai organizations who live in the occupied territories. In October two Israeli set-
 tlers in-Hebron were detained due to indications that they might incite violence as
 the Hebron negotiations were beginning.
 Most of the protections afforded by law are not extended to Palestinian detainees,
 who fall under the jurisdiction of military law even if they are detained in Israel.
 With IDF redeployment on the West Bank, detention centers there were closed, and
 all Palestinian detainees held for longer than 1 or 2 days are incarcerated in Israel.
 The Government does, however, observe some humanitarian prvisions of the
 Fourth Geneva Convention with regard to these detainees (see Section 1.d. of the
 annex).
 The Government detains 140 non-Palestinian Arabs, who comprise a mixture of
 common prisoners, administrative detainees, and security detainees. It continues to
 deny the ICRC access to two Lebanese citizens, Sheikh Mustafa Dirani and Sheikh
 Obeid. The disposition of these two cases appears linked to government efforts to
 obtain information on Israe   litary personnel believed to be prisoners of war or
 missing in Lebanon.
 In 1995 the Government expelled a Jordanian citizen and a West Bank Palestin-
 ian into the security zone in southern Lebanon. While the Jordanian has since re-
 turned to Jordan, de Palestinian still is being given shelter by the United Nations
 Interim Force In Lebanon (UNIFIL). The ICRC  as t  en up his ease with the oev-
 ernent.
 The law prohibits forced exile of citizens, and it is not used.
 e. DenialTof Fair Public TriaL.-The law provides for an independent judiciary,
 and the Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary provides citi-
 zens with a fair and efficient judicial process.
 The judicial system is composed of civil, military, religious, labor relations, and
 administrative courts, with the Supreme Court at the apex. The Supreme Court is
 an appellate court. Each of the cited courts, including the Supreme Court, have ap-
 pellate courts or jurisdictions.
 The law provides for the right to a hearing with representation by counsel, and
 authorities observe this right in practice. A planned regional and national system
 
 
 1282
 of public defenders operated by the Ministry of Justice was inaugurated in 1996
 with the opening of a Tel Aviv office, although that office has suffered serious budg-
 et shortages and faces further cutbacks in 1997.
 Al nonsecurity trials are public except those in which the interests of the parties
 are deemed best served by privacy. Cases involving national security may be tried
 in either military or civil courts and may be partly or wholly closed to the public.
 The Attorney General determines the venue in such cases. The prosecution must
 justify closing the proceedings to the public. Adult defendants have the right to be
 represented by counsel even in closed proceedings but may be denied access to same
 evidence on security grounds. Convictions may not be based on any evidence denied
 to the defense. Nevertheless, in the 1995 case of Mohammed Salah, he was denied
 access to some evidence, but it is not clear that he was convicted on the basis of
 that evidence.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.--1
 though privacy of the individual and the home are generally protected by law, au-
 thorities sometimes interfere with mail and monitor telephone conversations. In
 criminal cases, the law permits wiretapping under court order; in security cases, the
 order must be issued by the Ministry of Defense. Under emergency reglations, au-
 thorities may open and destroy mail on security grounds (see Section 1.f. of the
 Annex).
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-In April in response to Katyusha rocket salvos launched by the terrorist or-
 ganization Hizballah from southern Lebanon against towns and civilian areas in
 northern Israel, the Government responded with an aerial and artillery counter-
 attack. The IDF attempted to confine its initial attacks to the Hizballah-contrlled
 areas from which the rockets had come; however, many Hizballah launching sites
 were intermingled with, or located close to, Lebanese civilian areas. The fighting
 subsequently intensified to include attacks on Beirut and blockades of Lebanese
 ports. The conflict resulted in more than 150 civilian deaths and hundreds of
 wounded civilians on the Lebanese side, and dozens of wounded civilians in Israel.
 The Israeli military operation-known as Grapes of Wrath-included a public call
 on Lebanese civilians in the south to move away from areas that Israel intended
 to attack. As a result, the operation created 200,000 to 300,000 or more temporary
 refugees. In northern Israel, Hizbalah salvos caused 20,000 to 30,000 civilians to
 abandon their homes. Lebanese obserirers and some Israeli media commentators al-
 leged that a central tactic of Grapes of Wrath was to put pressure on the Lebanese
 Government to restrain Hizballah by generating a large northward flow of Lebanese
 refugees toward Beirut. Israel clearly stated that it did not intend to injure civil-
 ians, but would not allow Hizballah to fire from within villages and conceal itself
 among the civilian population. Hizballah declared that its aim was to create a flow
 of Israeli refugees in retaliation.
 On April 18, Hizballah fired mortar rounds at an Israeli military unit from a psi-
 tion very near the UmN. compound at Qana, and the IDF responded with artillery
 fire. A number of Israeli shells struck the compound, killing 102 civilians who had
 sought shelter there and wounding others. The Government expressed re et for
 these casualties, but insisted that the U.N. compound had not been shelled inten-
 tionally. A U.N. report concluded, however, that it was unlikely that the shelling
 was due to technica or proceural error.
 Negotiations to end the fighting resulted in an April 26 understanding under
 which the two parties committed not to target civilians or to use civilian-populated
 areas or noiitary public installations as launching grounds for attacks. An inter-
 national monitoring goup was established to investigate complaints of violations of
 the understanding. This group, the Israel-Lebanon Monitoring Group (ILMG), con-
 tinued to function thugout the remainder of the year, with the participation of
 the United States, France, Syria, Israel, and Lebanon.
 Politically motivated intercommunal killings continued as extremists sought to
 disrupt the Israel-Palestinian peace process. On February 25, two Palestinian sui-
 cide bombers struck in Jerusalem and at a road junction near the southern coastal
 city of Ashkelon. The Jerusalem explosion killed25 persons, including three U.S.
 citizens. In Ashkelon one person was killed and 36 injured. On March 3, another
 suicide bomber killed 19 persons, including Palestinian and Romanian workers, and
 wounded 7 in Jerusalem. The following day a fourth bomber killed 14 persons-in-
 cluding 6 children-and injured more than 100 others at an intersection in central
 Tel Aviv. On December 22, a court in Lod sentenced two Palestinians to consecutive
 life terms for driving suicide bombers to the scenes of the bombing attacks in Jeru-
 salem and Ashkelon.
 See also Section 1.g. of the annex.
 
 
 1283
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for freedom of the press, and
 the Government generally respects this right in practice. The law authorizes the
 Government to censor any material reported from Israel or the occupied territories
 regarded as sensitive on national security grounds. A new censorship agreement
 signed on May 22 between the Government and media representatives continues the
 trend to broaden liberalization of Israel's censorship regime. The agreement pro-
 vides that military censorship is to be applied only in cases involving national secu-
 rity issues that have a near certainty of harming Israel's defense interests, and now
 applies to aU media organizations in Israel, including local and Arabic-language
 newspapers. All media organizations can appeal the censor's decision to the Su-
 preme Court. Moreover, a new clause abolishes the right of the censor to shut down
 a newspaper for a censorship violation and eliminates the ability of the office of the
 censor to appeal a decision against it. News printed or broadcast abroad may be re-
 ported without censorship.
 Emergency regulations prohibit anyone from expressing support for illegal organi-
 zations. The Government occasionally prosecutes persons for speaking or writing on
 behalf of terrorist groups. No such cases were filed in 1996.
 Individuals, organizations, the press, and the electronic media freely debate public
 issues and criticize government officials and policies. A public debate on the legiti-
 mate exercise of the freedom of speech, sharpened by the November 1995 killing of
 Prime Minister Rabin, continued during the year. New concerns were raised by the
 actions of angry right-wing extremists who criticized the Supreme Court and issued
 threats against the life of Chief Justice Aharon Barak. There was also scattered
 praise from extremists for Rabin's killer. The head of the Zo Artsenu movement was
 tried for sedition and the case is still pending. For the most part, however, the At-
 torney General, while condemning hate speech, concluded that such speech could
 not be prosecuted.
 All newspapers are privately owned and managed. Newspaper licenses are valid
 only for Israel; separate licenses are required to distribute publications in the occu-
 pied territories.
 Directed by a government appointee, the quasi-independent Israel Broadcast Au-
 thority (IBA) controls television channel 1 and Kol Israel radio, both major sources
 of news and information. Six cable companies operate under franchises granted by
 government-councils. Privately owned channel2 television, the first commercial tele-
 vision channel, is operated by three franchise companies. Seven regional radio fran-
 chises were joined by another 6, bringing to 13 the number of private radio outlets.
 The Second Television and Radio Authority, a public body, supervises both channel
 2 and the regional radio stations.
 The May elections focused public attention on a provision of the communications
 law that prohibits the visual image of candidates to be screened during the last 30
 days of a campaign. A bill to change this law was debated in the Knesset, but de-
 ferred, even though cable news channels like Cable News Network (CNN) and the
 British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) were not prohibited from broadcasting im-
 ages of the candidates. Another part of the law that prohibits paid political advertis-
 ing on television was also debated but was not changed.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for these
 rights, and the Government generally respects them in practice. After the Hebron
 massacre in 1994, the Cabinet invoked the 1948 Ordinance for the Prevention of
 Terror to ban the ultranationalist Kach and Kahane Chai organizations, a ban that
 remains in effect. The decision stipulates imprisonment for anyone belonging to, or
 exressing support for, either organization.
 Demonstrations by ultra-Orthodox Jews in July and August were organized to
 force the municipality of Jerusalem to close the city's Bar-Ilan Street, a main
 throughfare, to traffic on the Sabbath. The demonstrators committed acts of civil
 disobedience and violence. The police used excessive force in countering the dem-
 onstrators.
 c. Freedom of Rel ion.-The law provides for freedom of religion, and the Govern-
 ment respects this right. Approximately 81 percent of citizens are Jewish. Muslims,
 Christians, Druze, and menbers of other religions make up the remaining 19 per-
 cent. Each recognized religious community has legal authority over its members in
 matters of marriage and divorce. Secular courts have primacy over questions of in-
 heritance, but parties, by mutual agreement, may bring cases to religious courts.
 Jewish and Christian families may ask for some family status matters, such as ali-
 mony and child custody in divorces, to be adjudicated in civil courts as an alter-
 native to religious courts. New legislation passed during the year allows the rabbini-
 cal courts to sanction either party who is not willing to grant a divorce.
 
 
 1284
 Many citizens object to the Orthodox Jewish religious authorities' exclusive con-
 trol over marriage, divorce, and burial, whether persons are Jewish or not. These
 authorities do not recognize marriages or conversions to Judaism performed in Is-
 rael by Conservative or Reform rabbis. These issues have been a source of sharp
 division within society, particularly in recent years, as thousands of Jewish immi-
 grants from the former Soviet Union have brought with them family members not
 recognized as Jewish by these Orthodox authorities. The divisions grew sharper dur-
 ing the year, as Jewish religious extremists, asserting the supremacy of religious
 law over democracy, threatened the life of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court,
 and of local Reform rabbis.
 A large number of Jews who wish to be married in secular or non-Orthodox reli-
 gious ceremonies do so abroad. The Ministry of Interior recognizes such marriages.
 New Knesset legislation provided for the right to civil burials, and land for the first
 secular cemeteries was recently designated.
 Missionaries are allowed to proselytize in Israel, although Mormons are specifi-
 cally prohibited from doing so by mutual agreement between the Church of Jesus
 Christ of the Latter-Day Saints and the Government. A 1977 antiproselytizing law
 prohibits anyone from offering or receiving material benefits as an inducement to
 conversion, but the law has not been applied for several years.
 A 1995 Supreme Court ruling allows small numbers of Jews under police escort
 to pray on the Temple Mount, which is the site of two Muslim holy places and also
 the location of the First and Second Jewish Temples.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 in practice for citizens, except with regard to military or security zones or in in-
 stances where citizens may be confined by administrative order to their neighbor-
 hoods or villages. During the year, rabbinical courts asserting jurisdiction over di-
 vorce cases refused at least two visiting U.S. citizens permission to depart the coun-
 try until their cases were tried (see Section 5). The Government continued to limit
 the movements of some Jewish settlers living in the occupied territories who be-
 longed to extremist Kach or Kahane Chai groups (see Section 2.d. of the Annex).
 Citizens are free to travel abroad and to emigrate, provided they have no out-
 standing military obligations and are not restricted by administrative order. In 1996
 the Government again permitted Muslim citizens over 30 years of age to perform
 the religious pilgrimage to Mecca, but it denied permission to Muslim citizens under
 30 ears of years of age on security grounds. The Government asserts that travel
 to Saudi Arabia, which is still in a state of war with Israel, is a privilege and not
 a right.
 The Government welcomes Jewish immigrants, their families, and Jewish refu-
 gees, on whom it confers automatic citizens ip and residence rights under the Law
 of Return. This law does not apply to non-Jews or to persons of Jewish descent who
 have converted to another faith. Other than the Law of Return, which applies only
 to Jews, and the family reunification statutes, which mainly apply to Arabs who fled
 Israel in 1948-49, Israel has no immigration law that provides for immigration to
 Israel, or for political asylum. The law does allow qualified individuals to live in Is-
 rael as permanent residents.
 The issue of first asylum did not arise in 1996. The Government cooperates with
 the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other humani-
 tarian organizations in assisting refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The law provides citizens with the right to change peacefully their government,
 and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair elections
 held on the basis of universal suffrage for adult citizens. In May general elections
 were held for the 14th Knesset and, for the first time, the voters elected the Prime
 Minister by direct ballot.
 Israel is a parliamentary democracy, with an active multiparty %stem represent-
 ing a wide range of political views. Relatively small parties, including those whose
 primary support is among Israeli Arabs, regularly win seats in the Knesset. Elec-
 tions are by secret ballot.  -
 While there are no legal impediments to the participation of women and minori-
 ties in government, they are underrepresented. Women hold 9 of 120 Knesset seats
 compared with 11 female members in the previous Knesset. There are 11 Arab and
 1 Druze in the new Knesset, compared with 7 and 2 prior to the May election; most
 represent parties deriving their support largely or entirely from the Arab commu-
 nity. Of the Knesset's12 committees, 2 (including the Committee on the Status of
 Women) are chaired by a woman and another is chaired by the Druze member of
 
 
 1285
 the legislature. There is one woman in the Cabinet, as compared with 2 in the pre-
 vious government. There are no Arab or Druze ministers or deputy ministers in the
 new government. Three women, but no Arab or Druze citizens, serve on the 14-
 member Supreme Court.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide variety of human rights groups operate without government restriction,
 investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government offi-
 cials are generally cooperative and responsive to their views.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, marital status, or sexual ori-
 entation. The law also prohibits discrimination by both government and nongovern-
 ment entities on the basis of race, religion, political beliefs, and age. Local human
 rights gups are concerned that resources for implementing those laws, or mecha-
 nisms or their enforcement, are sometimes lacking.
 Women.-There continued to be action, both in and out of government, to deal
 with the issue of violence against women in Jewish and Arab communities. The
 Government has allocated funds for a special campaign to combat such violence, and
 in June a parliamentary committee of inquiry issued a report recommending a num-
 ber of measures to combat the problem at its source. Groups that focus on domestic
 violence include a committee established by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs
 that includes Jewish and Arab nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) as -well as
 government representatives, and a coalition of human rights organizations. Approxi-
 mately 16 women were killed by husbands or other male relatives during the year.
 According to the most recent estimates, some 200,000 women suffer from domestic
 violence each year, and some 7 percent of these are abused on a regular basis.
 Arab human rights advocates also have formed a coalition to raise public aware-
 ness of so-called family honor killings, a term commonly used for the murder of a
 female by a male relative for alleged misconduct.
 The Government supports seven shelters for battered women including one exclu-
 sively for Arab women. There are plans for a total of 12 shelters, including 2 for
 Arab women, although women's rights advocates consider this number inadequate.
 According to the 1991 Domestic Violence Law, a district or magistrate court may
 prohibit access by violent family members to their property. Women's gups cooper-
 ate with legal and social service institutions to provide women's rights education.
 While sentences handed down to men convicted of rape have increased in recent
 years, women's rights activists note that the penalties are not sufficiently harsh.
 Civil rights groups also expressed concern about an increased incidence of phys-
 ical attacks by Jewish religious extremists, particularly in Jerusalem, against
 women whom they consider to be immodestly dressed in public.
 Women's advocacy groups report that women routinely receive lower wages for
 comparable work, are promoted less often and have fewer career opportunities than
 their male counterparts. In March the Equal Pay Law, which required employers
 to pay male and female workers equal wages for equal work, was replaced by new
 legislation that redefines compensation to include important side benefits, and al-
 lows for class action suits. An amendment to the social security law allowed house-
 wives some access to the nation's social security pension system.
 Legislation in 1993, reinforced by a 1994 ruling of the High Court of Justice, or
 the Supreme Court in other circumstances, has increased the percentage of women
 on the boards of two-thirds of government-owned companies. Their numbers remain
 low overall, however. One study reported that in 1996 women made up more than
 30 percent of the boards in only 39 ofl18 government-owned companies.
 The adjudication of personal status law in the areas of marriage and divorce is
 left to religious courts, where Jewish and Muslim women are subject to restrictive
 interpretations of their rights (see Section 2.c.). Legislation passed in 1995 broadens
 the civil sanctions made available to rabbinical courts in cases where a wife has
 ample grounds for divorce-such as abuse-but the husband has refused to agree.
 In some cases however, rabbinical courts have failed to invoke these sanctions. In
 some cases where a wife has failed to agree, a husband has been allowed to re-
 marry; this permission is not given to wives. Such imbalances have been used by
 husbands to extort concessions from their wives in return for agreeing to divorce.
 In at least two cases during the year, the rabbinical court imposed civil sanctions
 on persons not citizens of Israel. This court asserted jurisdiction over Jewish U.S.
 citizens visiting Israel who had received civil divorces in the United States but
 whose former wives was seeking a religious divorce through the rabbinical court in
 
 
 1286
 
 Israel. The U.S. citizens were denied, permission to leave Israel until the courts
 heard the cases (see section 2.d.). In 1996 the court heard one of the cases and ruled
 in early 1997 that it had no jurisdiction in the matter because the U.S. citizen was
 not a resident or a citizen of Israel. However, the U.S. citizen was not permitted
 to leave the country when a second, related case was filed against him in the dis-
 trict rabbinical court.
 Religious law can be even more restrictive for Muslims: some Islamic law courts
 have held that Muslim women may not request a divorce, but that women may be
 forced to consent if a divorce is granted to a man.
 Jewish women are subject to the military draft but have been barred from combat
 positions. During the year the Israeli Air Force, acting on a landmark Supreme
 Court ruling handed down in 1995, for the first time admitted women to IDF pilot
 training, which would qualify them for combat aviation positions. Two classes with
 women members are in training. At the same time, a new petition before the Court
 charged the national police force with discrimination against women, in recruiting,
 assignments open to female officers, and promotions. The petition was still pending
 atyear's end.
 Children.-The Government is strongly committed to the rights and welfare of
 children, including in the areas of education and health care.However, resources
 are sometimes insufficient to put that commitment into practice, particularly in the
 case of low-income families. Education is compulsory to the age ofl5, or until the
 child reaches the 10th grade, whichever comes first. Government ministries, chil-
 dren's rights groups, and members of the legislature often cooperate on children's
 rights issues.
 Legislative landmarks in the area of children's rights during the year included the
 requirement that the psychiatric hospitalization of a child be reviewed by a court,
 as it must in the case of an adult; the extension to children of confidentiality in HIV
 testing, and the ruling that in any family status court case, such as divorce, the
 children affected or their legal representatives must be heard.
 The Government has legislated against sexual, physical, and psychological abuse
 of children, and has mandated comprehensive reporting requirements. Although
 there has been a sharp increase in reported cases of child abuse in recent years,
 activists believe that this is largely due to increased awareness of the issue rather
 than a growing pattern of abuse. There are now four shelters in Israel for children
 at risk, and a fifth is scheduled to open. The Stockholm Conference raised public
 awareness of the issue of child prostitution. The Ministry ofiJustice formed a com-
 mittee with police and NGO representatives that is attempting to assess the scope
 of the problem. Children's rights activists estimate that there may be several hun-
 dred prostitutes among the nation's children, and warn that the phenomenon is un-
 likely to be eradicated until the social problems that give rise to it-including child
 abuse and schools that give up too readily on dropouts-are addressed.
 NGO's in the field of children's welfare concentrate their efforts on public edu-
 cation, on promoting the conce t of children's rights as citizens, on improving legal
 representation for minors, and on combating the problems of poverty, which are
 most notable for the Bedouin children of the south. There has been concern over
 the children of Israel's growing population of foreign workers, many of them in the
 country illegally. Children of such families, believed to number in the thousands,
 exist in a legal and social limbo, without access to schools or adequate health serv-
 ices.
 Privately funded children's rights information centers have been established in
 some communities, and the Government assists in funding additional centers in
 other cities.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government provides a range of benefits, including
 income maintenance, housing subsidies, and transportation support for disabled per-
 sons, who comprise about 10 percent of the population. Existing antidiscrimination
 laws do not prohibit discrimination based on disability, and these citizens continue
 to encounter difficulties in areas such as employment and housing. A law requiring
 access for the disabled to public buildings is not widely enforced. There is no law
 providing for access to public transportation for people with disabilities. A new law
 extendeddisability assistance for deaf children from age 14 to maturity.
 Religious Minorities.-In civic areas where religion is a determining criterion,
 such as the religious courts and centers of education, non-Jewish institutions rou-
 tinely receive less state support than their Jewish counterparts. The status of a
 number of Christian organizations with representation in Israel has heretofore been
 defined by a collection of ad hoc arrangements with various government agencies.
 Several of these organizations are negotiating with the Government in an attempt
 to formalize their status. Attempts to establish meaningful negotiations are ongoing.
 
 
 1287
 NationalIRaciallEthnic Minorities.-The Government does not provide Israeli
 Arabs, who constitute 18 percent of the population, with the same quality of edu-
 cation, housing, employment, and social services as Jews. Government efforts to
 close the gap between Israel's Jewish and Arab citizens have resulted in an esti-
 mated 160 percent increase in resources devoted to Arab communities between 1992
 and 1996. Neverthe1ess, significant differences remain.
 Relative to their numbers, Israeli Arabs are underrepresented in the student bod-
 ies and faculties of most universities and in higher-level professional and business
 ranks. A small number of Israeli Arabs have risen to responsible positions in the
 civil service, generally in the Arab departments of government ministries. A 1994
 Civil Service Commission 3-year affirmative action progam to expand that number
 has had only modest results. The Government has allocated only very limited re-
 sources to enforce landmark 1995 legislation prohibiting discrimination in employ-
 ment.
 In practice, Israeli Arabs are not allowed to work in companies with defense con-
 tracts or in security-related fields. The Israeli Druze and Circassian communities
 are subject to the military draft although some have refused to serve. Some Bed-
 ouin and other Arab citizens who are not subject to the draft serve voluntarily.
 Those not subject to the draft have less access than other Israelis to those social
 and economic benefits for which military service is a prerequisite or an advantage,
 such as housing, new-household subsidies, and government or security-related in-
 dustrial employment. Under a 1994 government policy decision, the social security
 child allowance for parents who have not served in the military is being increased
 over a 3-year period to equal the allowance of those who have served in the military.
 The Government has yet to fulfill its commitment to resolve the legal status of
 unrecognized Arab villages. Eight villages have been recognized since 1994, but
 nearly a hundred more, of varying size and with a total population of nearly 70,000
 people, remain in limbo. Such villages have none of the infrastructure, such as elec-
 tricity, provided to recognized villages and towns. Private efforts have supplied some
 with water. In the Negev, a government program to provide housing for thousands
 of Bedouin in seven concentrated settlements has been criticized as likely to aggra-
 vate the severe poverty there and disrupt the indigenous culture.
 Arab children make up about a quarter of Israel's public school population, but
 government resources for them are not equal to those for Jewish children. Many
 schools in Arab communities are dilapidated and overcrowded, lack special edu-
 cation services and counselors, have poor libraries, and have no sports facilities.
 Arab groups also note that the public school curriculum stresses Israel's Jewish cul-
 ture and heritage.
 Unresolved problems of many years' standing also include claims by Arab groups
 that land expropriation for public use has affected the Arab community dispropor-
 tionately; that Arabs have been allowed too little input in planning decisions that
 affect their schools and municipalities; that mosques and cemeteries belonging to
 the Islamic Waqf have been unjustly expropriated for public use; and that successive
 governments have blocked the return of persons displaced in the early years of Isra-
 el's history to their homes. The Government has yet to agree with the pre-1948 resi-
 dents of the northern villages of Bir Am and Ikrit, and their descendants, regarding
 their long-time demand to be allowed to rebuild their houses; in the meantime, per-
 mission has been given to Jewish settlements to increase their land holdings in the
 disputed areas.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers may Join and establish labor organizations
 freely. Most unions belong to Histadrut (the deneral Federation of Labor in Israel),
 or to a much smaller rival federation, the Histadrut Haovdim Haleumit (National
 Federation of Labor.) These organizations are independent of the Government.
 Histadrut members democratically elect national and local officers, and officials of
 its affiliated women's organization Na'amat, from political party lists. Plant or en-
 terise committee members are elected individually.
 During the year, the Histadrut administration continued its drastic reshaping of
 the labor federation, with further reductions in staff and services, as Histadrut
 shifted its concentration to those areas directly related to employment. In 1995 a
 new national health insurance law severed the link between Histadrut and Kupat
 Holim Clalit, the nation's largest health maintenance organization, in the process
 ending Histadrut's chief source of income. Membership in Histadrut dropped sharply
 once it was no longer necessary to join the federation in order to have access to its
 health plan. Histadrut is seeking to expand its membership in areas not presently
 organized, such as small businesses and factories, even where collective bargaining
 
 
 1288
 agreements do not exist. At the end of 1996, membership-which once reached 1.8
 million people-had climbed back to about 700,000.
 The right to strike is exercised regularly. Unions must provide 15 days' notice
 prior to a strike unless otherwise specified in the collective bargaining agreement.
 However, unauthorized strikes occur. Strike leaders-even those organizing illegal
 strikes-are protected by law. If essential public services are affected, the Govern-
 ment may appeal to labor courts for back-to-work orders while the parties continue
 negotiations. There were a number of strikes in both public and private sectors dur-
 ing the year by employees protesting the effects of privatization. Worker dismissals
 and the terms of severance arrangements were often the central issues of dispute.
 Palestinians from the West Bnk and Gaa Strip who work in Israel may not join
 Israeli trade unions or organize their own unions n Israel. Palestinian trade umons
 in the occupied territories are not permitted to conduct activities in Israel (see Sec-
 tion 6.a. of the annex). However, nonresident workers in the organized sector are
 entitled to the protection of Histadrut work contracts and grievance procedures.
 They may join, vote for, and be elected to shop-level workers' committees if their
 numbers in individual establishments exceed a minimum threshold. Palestinian par-
 ticipation in such committees is minimal.
 Labor laws apply to Palestinians in East Jerusalem and to the Syrian Druze liv-
 ing on the Golan Heights.
 Unions are free to affiliate with international organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Israeli workers fully exercise
 their legal rights to organize and bargain collectively. While there is no law specifi-
 cally prohibiting antiunion discrimination, the law against discrimination could be
 cited to contest discrimination based on union membership. No antiunion discrimi-
 nation has been reported.
 Nonresident workers may not organize their own unions or engage in collective
 bargaining, but they are entitled to be represented by the bargaining agent and pro-
 tected by collective bargaining agreements. They do not pay union membership fees,
 but are required to pay a 1-percent agency fee which entitles them to union protec-
 tion by Histadrut's collective bargaining agreements. The Ministry of Labor may ex-
 tend collective bargaining agreements to nonunionized workplaces in the same in-
 dustrial sector. The Mimstry of Labor also oversees personal contracts in the non-
 organized sectors of the economy.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor. Neither Israeli citizens nor nonresident Palestinians working in Israel
 are sub  t to thi  ractice. Civil rights gups charge that unscrupulous employers
 often take advantage of illegal workers' lack of status (see Section 6.e.) to hold them
 in conditions amounting to involuntary servitude.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.--Children who have attained the
 age of 15 years, and who are liable to compulsory education under the Compulsory
 Education Law, may not be employed unless they work as apprentices under the
 Apprenticeship Law. Notwithstanding these provisions, children who are 14 years
 old may be employed during official school holidays. Employment of those ages 16
 to 18 years is restricted to ensure time for rest and education.
 There are no reliable data on illegal child workers. They are concentrated among
 Israel's Arab population and its newest Jewish immigrants. Illegal employment is
 found primarily in urban, light-industrial areas. Childrens rights roups have called
 for more vigorous enforcement of chld labor laws, combined with a parallel effort
 to deal with the causes of illegal child labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Legislation in 1987 established a minimum
 wage at 45 percent of the average wage, calculated periodically and adjusted for cost
 of living increases. At year's end, the minimum wage stood at about $620 (roughly
 2,000 new Israeli shekels) per month. The minimum wage is often supplemented by
 special allowances and is generally sufficient to provide workers and their families
 with an acceptable standard of living. Union officials have expressed concern over
 enforcement of minimum wage regulations, particularly with respect to employers
 of illegal non-rsident workers who sometimes pay less than the minimum wage.
 By law the maximum hours of work at regular pay are 47 hours a week, 8 hours
 per day, and 7 hours on the day before the weekly rest, which must be at least 36
 consecutive hours and include the Sabbath. By national collective agreements, the
 private sector established a maximum 45-hour workweek in 1988. The public sector
 moved to a 5-day, 42  hour workweek in 1989, while the military adopted it in
 1993.
 Employers must receive a government permit to hire nonresident workers from
 the occupied territories, certifying that no citizen is available for the job. All Pal-
 estinians from the occupied territories are employed on a daily basis and, unless
 
 
 1289
 they are employed on shiftwork, are not authorized to spend the night in Israel. Pal-
 estinians without valid work permits are subject to arrest.
 Nonresident workers are paid through the Employment Service of the Ministry
 of Labor, which disburses wages and benefits collected from employers. The Min-
 istry deducts a 1 percent union fee and the workers' required contributions to the
 National Insurance Institute (NIl), the agency that administers the Israeli social se-
 curity system, unemployment benefits, and other benefits. Despite these deductions,
 Palestinian workers are not eligible for all Nil benefits. They continue to be insured
 for injuries occurring in Israel and the bankruptcy of a worker's employer. They do
 not have access to unemployment insurance, general disability payments, low-in-
 come supplements, or child allotments. By contrast Israeli settlers in the occupied
 territories who work in Israel have the same benefits as other Israeli workers. The
 International Labor Organization has long criticized this inequality in entitlements.
 The Government agreed to transfer the NIl fees collected from Palestinian workers
 to the PA, which will assume responsibility for all the pensions and social benefit;
 of Palestinians working in Israel. Implementation of this change is still underway.
 Along with union representatives, the Labor Inspection Service enforces labor,
 health, and safety standards in the workplace, although resource constraints affect
 overall enforcement. Legislation protects the employment rights of safety delegates
 elected or'appointed by the workers. In cooperation with management, these dele-
 gates are responsible for the safety and health of the workplace. Workers do not
 have the legal right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations without
 jeopardy to continued employment. However, collective bargaining agreements pro-
 vide some workers with recourse through the work site labor committee. Any worker
 may challenge unsafe work practices through government oversight and legal agen-
 cies.
 There was increased public debate over the role in the workplace and society of
 foreign workers, who are estimated to number 200,000 or more, perhaps half of
 them undocumented and illegally employed. The majority of such workers come
 from eastern Europe and southeast Asia, and most are employed in the construction
 and agricultural sectors. The law does not allow such workers citizenship or perma-
 nent residence in Israel. As a result, they and their families live in a legal and so-
 cial limbo. Government deportations of such workers take place without benefit of
 due process.
 THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES
 (INCLUDING AREAS SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY)
 Israel occupied the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Golan Heights, and East Jerusalem
 during the 1967 War. The West Bank and Gaza Strip are now administered to vary-
 ing extents by Israel and the Palestinian Authority(PA). Pursuant to the May 1994
 Gaza-Jericho Agreement, Israel transferred most responsibilities for civil govern-
 ment in the Gaza Stri and Jericho to the PA. The Agreement on Preparatory
 Transfer of Powers and   sponsibilities of August 1994, and the Interim Agreement
 provided for the further transfer of civil authority to the Palestinians, including edu-
 cation, culture, health, tourism, taxation, social welfare, statistics, local government,
 insurance, commerce, industry, fuel, gs, agriculture, and labor. Israel continues to
 retain responsibility in the West Ban and Gaza Strip for external security, foreign
 relations, the overall security of Israelis, including public order in the Israeli settle-
 ments, and certain other matters. Negotiations on the final status of the occupied
 territories as well as of Jerusalem, borders, Israeli settlements, refugees, and other
 matters began in May but were immediately adjourned and did not resume by
 year's end. Israel and the Palestinian Authority agreed on January 15, 1997 to re-
 sume these talks within 60 days. According to the timetable set out in the DOP,
 the interim period is to conclude in May 1999.
 In addition to most of the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area, which was turned over
 to the Palestinians in May 1994, Israel began redeploying its forces in the West
 Bank and turning over major towns and villages to the PA in late 1995. Pursuant
 to the Interim Agreement and the "Protocol Concerning Redeployment in Hebron,"
 concluded on January 15, 1997, Israel redeployed its forces in Hebron. Israel contin-
 ues to control some civil functions and is responsible for all security in portions of
 the occupied territories categorized as Zone C, which includes the Israeli settle-
 ments. The PA has jurisdiction over civil affairs and shares security responsibilities
 with Israel in areas known as Zone B, and the PA has control over civil affairs and
 security in Zone A. The PA also has jurisdiction over some civil affairs in Zone C.
 Accordingly, this report discusses the policies and practices of both the Israeli Gov-
 
 
 1290
 ernment and the Palestinian Authority in the areas where they exercise jurisdiction
 and control.
 Israel continues to exercise civil authority in some areas of the West Bank
 through the Israeli Ministry of Defense's Office of Coordination and Liaison, known
 by He row acronym MATAK, which replaced the now defunct Civil Administration
 (CIVAD). The approximately 150,000 sraeli settlers living in the West Bank and
 Gaza Strip are subject to Israeli law and are better treated by Israeli forces than
 are Palestinians. The body of law governing Palestinians in the Israeli-controlled
 portions of the territories derives from Ottoman, British Mandate, Jordanian, and
 Egyptian law and Israeli military orders. In Palestinian-contrlled areas, regula-
 tions promulgated by the PA are also in force. The United States considers Israel's
 authority in the occupied territories to be subject to the Hague Regulations of 1907
 and the 1949 Geneva Convention relating to the protection of civilians in time of
 war. The Israeli Government considers the Hague Regulations applicable and states
 that it observes the Geneva Convention's humanitarian provisions.
 In January the Palestinian Authority chose its first popularly elected government
 in democratic elections, which were generally well-conducted. An 88-member Legis-
 lative Council and Ra'ees (president or chairman) of the executive authority were
 elected. The PA also has an appointed cabinet of 20 ministers who oversee 19 min-
 istries. PA Chairman Yasir Arafat continues to dominate the affairs of government
 and to make major decisions. Most senior government positions and positiins of au-
 thority in the PA are held by individuals who are members of, or loyal to, Arafat's
 Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The elected 88-person
 Legislative Council meets frequently and discusses a range of issues significant to
 the Palestinian people and the development of an open, democratic society in the
 Gaza Strip and West Bank. Pursuant to a series of agreements between the PA and
 Israel, the PA now also has full or partial control over major Palestinian population
 centers in the Gaza Strip and WestBank.
 Israeli security forces in Israeli-controlled parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip
 consist of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF); the General Security Service (GSS or
 Shin Bet); the police; and the paramilitary border police. Israeli military courts try
 Palestinians accused of committing security crimes in Israeli-controlled areas. Mem-
 bers of the Israeli security forces committed human rights abuses.
 The Palestinian Police Force (PPF) was established in May 1994 and includes the
 Palestinian National Security Force (PNSF); the Palestinian civil police; the Preven-
 tive Security Force (PSF); General Intelligence Service, or Mukhabarat; the civil de-
 fense force; and the Palestinian Presidential Security Force. Several other quasi-
 military security organizations, such as the coast guard and military intelligence,
 also exercise law enfoment powers. Palestinian police are responsible for security
 and law enforcement for Palestinians and other non-Israelis in PA-controlled areas
 of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israeli settlers in the occupied territories are not
 subject to Paestinian security force jurisdiction. Members of the PA security forces
 committed human rights abuses.
 The economies of the West Bank and Gaza Strip are small, poorly developed, and
 highly dependent on Israel. The economic situation deteriorated significantly during
 the year as a result of closures of the territories imposed by Israel after security
 including several serious terrorist bombings. Bot  areas rely on agri-
 culture, services, and to a lesser extent, light manufacturing. Many West Bank and
 Gaza workers are employed at day jobs in Israel and Jerusalem, making their em-
 ployment vulnerable to disruption due to closures. The West Bank and Gaza econo-
 mies were significantly damaged by a closure first imposed by Israel in 1993. In the
 wake of terrorist bombings in Israel in February and March and violent clashes be-
 tween Israeli and Palestinian forces in September, Israel temporarily tightened the
 existing closure, sealing off the West B    and Gaza Strip from Israel, prohibiting
 most travel between towns and villages within the West Bank (the "internal clo-
 sure"), denying Palestinian workers access to jobs in Israel, and hampering the flow
 of goods and people between Israel and the occupied territories. The "internal clo-
 sure was lifted in each case after about 2 weeks. The general closures of Gaza and
 the West Bank followed a pattern of being eased but then reimposed in the wake
 of new security threats. Partly as a result of the closures, the per capita Gross Na-
 tional Product of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip dropped by approxi-
 mately 39 percent between 1992 and 1996 (from $2,425 to $1,480.) By yeas end,
 however, the closure had eased in important ways.
 There were some improvements in the human rights situation in the territories.
 However, boeth Israel and the PA were responsible or serious human rights abuses.
 Two Islamic groups, the Islamic Resistane Movement (clAMAS) and the Pal-
 estine Islamic Jflhad (PIJ), made a oncerted effort this year to undermine the au-
 thority of the PA and restrict the Israeli-Palestinian peace process by killing Israeli
 
 
 1291
 
 civilians in a series of deadly suicide bombing attacks in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and
 Ashkelon. The most serious attacks occurred in late February and early March. On
 February 25, two Palestinian suicide bombers struck in Jerusalem and at a road
 junction near the southern coastal city of Ashkelon. The Jerusalem explosion killed
 25 persons, including three U.S. citizens. In Ashkelon one person was killed and 36
 injured. On March 3, another suicide bomber killed 19 persons, including Palestin-
 ian and Romanian workers, and wounded 7 in Jerusalem. The following day a
 fourth bomber killed 14 persons-including 6 children-and injured more than 100
 others at an intersection in central Tel Aviv.
 In the aftermath of those terrorist bombings, Israeli authorities arrested approxi-
 mately 1,000 Palestinians suspted of affiliation with extremist Islamic and secular
 opposition groups. Israeli authorities in some cases mistreated prisoners to obtain
 information on further terrorist attacks. Following the bombings, Israeli authorities
 demolished the homes of eight Palestinians implicated in terrorist attacks, com-
 pared with one demolition in 1995. Israel also tightened its existing closure of the
 West Bank and Gaa Strip, sealing off the territories from Israel and imposing an
 "internal closure." There was one credible report that an Israeli undercover unit
 killed a Palestinian, compared with 10 such deaths in 1995. There were also credi-
 ble reports that Israeli authorities continue to abuse and torture Palestinian detain-
 ees and prisoners. At least two Palestinians died in Israeli prisons, after possibly
 being tortured by other Palestinians in custody for cooperating with the Israelis.
 Prison conditions are poor.
 In its intensive efforts to counter and prevent terrorism, the Palestinian Authority
 used excessive force on occasion in its searches of homes, and ordered two opposition
 newspapers closed. In the wake of terrorist bombings, PA authorities arrested ap-
 proximately 1,000 Palestinians suspected of affliation with extremist Islamic and
 secular opposition groups and held all but one without charge. There were credible
 reports that PA authorities mistreated prisoners to obtain information on further
 terrorist attacks. The PA also continued to harass, detain, and abuse journalists and
 political activists who criticized the PA. Although the PA claims to tolerate expres-
 sion of a range of views, human rights watehers say that Palestinian commentators
 and critics practice self-censorship out of fear that they would be harassed or pun-
 ished by the PA if they criticized it. The PA strongly discourages dissenting views.
 There were also credible reports that the PA continues to abuse and torture detain-
 ees. Four Palestinians died in PA custody, two after having been tortured, one shot
 and killed by a prison guard, and one apparently have committed suicide. Prison
 conditions are very poor.
 In September Israel's opening of a controversial tunnel near Muslim and Jewish
 holy sites in Jerusalem and calls by the PA for mass demonstrations to protest the
 move sparked several days of violent clashes between Israeli security forces and Pal-
 estinian security officers and civilians. Fifty-eight Palestinians (including 11 Pal-
 estinian security officers) and 16 IDF soldiers and border police officers died in the
 fighting. Israeli and Palestinian security forces used excessive force during the
 clashes. During clashes in Ramallah and Rafahi, Israeli forces shot at demonstrators
 from a helicopter gunship and from elevated sniper positions; Israeli forces also shot
 persons who were trying to evacuate wounded Palestinians. Palestinian security
 forces in Gaza prevented the timely evacuation of wounded Israeli journalists.
 Terrorist attacks against Israelis continued after the series of deadly bombings in
 February and March. In April two gasoline firebombs were hurled at an Israeli com-
 muter bus at Beit Omar, a village near Hebron, injuring 5 people. Two Palestinians
 with alleged Hamas sympathies shot and killed an Israeli with American citizenship
 and wounded another Israeli at a settlement at Beit El in May. In November Is-
 lamic militant Mohammud Assaf, who was reportedly preparing to launch a suicide
 attack against Israel, was killed in the West Bank town of Qabatya, when a bomb
 exploded prematurely in his hands. Palestinians believed to be affiliated with ex-
 tremist Islamic and secular opposition groups killed two Israelis and wounded three
 in attacks in the West Bank.
 Israeli settlers continued to harass and threaten Palestinians in the West Bank
 and Gaza Strip, and they killed three Palestinians in 1996, whereas settlers killed
 four Palestinians in 1995.
 The number of Palestinians killed by other Palestinians for collaborating with Is-
 rael decreased again in 1996.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were credible reports that Is-
 raeli undercover units, disguised as Palestinians, operated in Palestinian areas dur-
 
 
 1292
 
 ing 1996. In June an alleged undercover unit shot and killed a 28-year old Palestin-
 ian man outside his home in the Ras al-Amud neighborhood of Jerusalem. In Octo-
 ber three Palestinians were shot and wounded by a probable undercover unit in an
 incident outside of Bethlehem. In 1995 there were 10 deaths attributed to under-
 cover units.
 According to human rights organizations, undercover units have deliberately
 killed suspects under circumstances in which they might have been apprehended
 alive. Such operations normally have taken place at night when there are few eye-
 witnesses. Accounts of witnesses, when available, often differ from the IDF version.
 Israeli authorities acknowledge that the undercover units conduct operations
 among Palestinians wanted for investigation, but claim that such units observe the
 same rules of engagement as other IF units. They further claim that the IDF in-
 vestigates all kilhngs and allegations of misbehavior. However, human rights groups
 state that the investigations are not conducted efficiently and rarely lead to serious
 punishment. The IDF does not announce the findings of its investigations.
 The IDF killed four Palestinians at military checkpoints and roadblocks at Israeli
 borders and inside the occupied territories in 1996. In these cases, the EDF said that
 the individuals were shot after they failed to obey soldiers' orders to halt.
 In January armed Palestinians in a car fired on three Israeli soldiers a West
 Bank checkpoint near Jenin. The soldiers returned fire, killing three armed Pal-
 estinians. Palestinian witnesses largely agreed with the MF's official account of the
 shootin.
 In February following a suicide bus bombing in Jerusalem, Israeli security forces
 and civilians shot and killed a Palestinian-American after he drove a rented car into
 a crowded bus stop in Jerusalem, killing 1 Israeli and injuring 22 others. Israeli au-
 thorities investigated the incident and determined that the man, who had a history
 of mental problems, acted deliberately.
 In November Israeli soldiers shot amd killed a Palestinian and wounded 11 others
 when a protest against expansion of a West Bank settlement near Ramallah turned
 violent. An Israeli army spokesperson said that the protesters hurled stones at the
 soldiers who at first tried to disperse the crowd with rubber bullets and gunshots
 into the air, but later shot into the crowd when they believed that their lives were
 in danger. Eyewitnesses dispute that Israeli soldiers lives were in danger. Also in
 November, Israeli soldiers shot and killed 18-year-old Iyad Mahmnoud Badran, a pas-
 senger in a vehicle that the soldiers ordered to stop. The vehicle stopped, but when
 it moved into reverse, the soldiers fired.
 A fine of less than $0.01 (one agora) fine was passed down by a military court
 in November on four soldiers who confessed to having killed a Palestinian in 1993.
 In January Hamas operational leader Yahya Ayyash was killed in the Gaza Strip,
 when a remote-controlled booby-trapped cellular telephone blew up as he Was using
 it. Ayyash was considered the mastermind of several suicide bombings that killed
 and wounded -dozens of Israelis in 1994 and 1995.
 At least two Palestinians died in an Israeli prison after being tortured, possibly
 by other Palestinians. 'Abdel-Rahman 'Omar Saleem Al-Kilani, an alleged Hamas
 member and suspected collaborator, died while in administrative detention in Isra-
 el's Megiddo military detention center on February 1. Human rights monitors and
 autopsy findings suggest that several Palestinian prisoners tortured him and that
 he died from the resulting shock. It is unclear why he was tortured. 'Adel 'Ayed
 Yousef Al-Shahateet, an administrative detainee, died at Megiddo military detention
 center in Israel on February 15 after being tortured. There are conflicting accounts
 as to whether Israeli prison officials or Palestinians tortured him.
 The Palestinian Authority security forces, which lack equipment and training in
 crowd control, used excessive force to break up demonstrations in a number of in-
 stances. In September Palestinian police in Nablus shot and killed one Palestinian
 and injured two while trying to stop fans from rioting during a soccer match. Pal-
 estinian police in Nablus kled one Palestinian when trying to break up a dem-
 onstration in August. In March PA police injured six persons while breaking up a
 demonstration in Nablus.
 In 1996 four Palestinians died in PA custody, two after being tortured, one after
 he apparently committed suicide. A fourth was shot and killed. The PA disciplined
 the officers involved in three of the four deaths.
 In the first case, Mahmoud Jmaiel, a 26-year-old resident of Nablus, died while
 in the custody of the Palestinian coast guard in Nablus in July. An autopsy revealed
 that Jmaiel, who was brain dead for a day before dying, had been severely tortured.
 The autopsy and photographs of the body revealed burns from cigarettes and a hot
 iron device, deep bruises, a fractured skull, and extensive bleeding in the brain.
 Hundreds of demonstrators marched on police headquarters in Nablus and de-
 nounced the officers who tortured Jmaiel. The city was paralyzed by a general
 
 
 1293
 
 strike, the first time this protest tactic was used against the PA. Three coast guard
 officials found responsible for Jmaiel's death were tried and sentenced to 15 years'
 imprisonment by the Palestinian security court within days of the death. The
 Mandela Institute for Political Prisoners alleges that the three coast guard officers
 did not have adequate legal representation or time to prepare their case.
 In a second case, there were reports that a Palestinian prisoner was killed in de-
 tention in A1-Bireh during interrogation on March 31. A PA military court in Jericho
 found two security officers, one a military intelligence officer and the other from the
 Preventive Security Service, guilty of "causing his death" and of "improper use of
 a weapon" in the incident.
 In the third case an elderly Palestinian man apparently hanged himself in PA
 custody in Ramallal after being arrested for beating to death a woman in a land
 dispute. The man's family initially accused the PA of torturing him. However, the
 PA maintained that the death had been a suicide; therefore, no disciplinary meas-
 ures were taken.
 In the final case, in December prison guard Assam Jalaiteh shot and killed a pris-
 oner in Jericho. The prisoner, Rahid Fityani, was arrested in January 1995 with
 his brother-in-law, Salman Jalayta, on suspicion of killing a member of Hamas and
 cooperating with Israel. Jalayta died after 2 days in custody, apparently as a result
 of torture. No disciplinary action was taken against guards in that death. The pris-
 on guard who shot and killed Fityani, however, was convicted of using excessive
 force and sentenced to life imprisonment within days of the shooting.
 Five members of the Palestinian security forces who allegedly killed suspected
 Palestinian collaborator Muhammad AI-Jundi in Gaza in 1995 have not yet been
 tried for the killing, according to the PA.
 In September clashes between Israeli security forces and PA security forces and
 Palestinian civilians resulted in numerous deaths (see Section 1.g.).
 Palestinians suspected of being members of organizations opposed to the peace
 process also killed six Israelis and wounded eight in attacks in the West Bank. On
 December 11, militants reportedly belonging to the Popular Front for the Liberation
 of Palestine ambushed a car with a family of seven Israelis at a crossroad outside
 the village of Surda. They killed a 12-year-old Israeli boy, Ephraim Tsur, and his
 mother, Etta Tsur, and wounded the five other persons in the vehicle. One week
 later, the PA State Security Court convicted three men for these killings. The Court
 sentenced two of the men-Abdel Nasser Qasi and brahim Qam-to life imprison-
 ment at hard labor. The third, Thrahim Mussad, was sentenced to 15 years' impris-
 onment for driving the getaway car. Two women were injured in a drive-by shooting
 near Bethlehem in August. A Palestinian with alleged Hamas sympathies stabbed
 and killed an Israeli soldier in Janin in January. Two Palestinians with alleged
 Hamas sympathies shot and killed an Israeli with American citizenship and wound-
 ed another Israeli at a settlement at Beit El in May. The Palestinian Authority ar-
 rested and is holding one of the killers, who has confessed to the killing at Beit El.
 Palestinian gunmen shot and killed two Israeli soldiers in January near the village
 of Halhoul, north of Hebron.
 Israeli settlers continued to harass and attack Palestinians. In October a 10-year-
 old Palestinian boy died after being beaten by a settler near Bethlehem. The settler
 was indicted for manslaughter. In February a settler shot and wounded a Palestin-
 ian teenager. In August a settler from Jerusalem stabbed a Palestinian near Jerusa-
 lem. In December Ibrihim Abdullah Hamdan Abu Nasir was killed by a Israeli set-
 tler in Gaza in December; charges are pending.
 Israel punished several settlers who attacked Arabs. One settler was sentenced
 to life in prison for killing a Palestinian in 1994. Rabbi Moshe Levinger served less
 than 5 months of a 7-month jail sentence for attacking Arabs in 1992. In February
 Israeli authorities arrested a Tapuah settler for allegedly shooting three Palestin-
 ians in 1995 and 1996.
 Palestinian civilians killed an estimated 8 Palestinians during the year, for sus-
 picion of collaboration with Israeli security services. In 1995, 14 Palestinians were
 killed for the same reason. Approximately six Palestinians suspected of collaboration
 with Israel were killed in the West Bank. Human rights organizations charge that
 at least two Palestinians suspected of collaboration were killed in jail by fellow Pal-
 estinian prisoners.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances
 attributed to either Israeli or Palestinian security services.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 International, Israeli, and Palestinian human rights groups and diplomats continue
 to provide credible reports that Israeli security forces were responsible for wide-
 spread abuse, and in some cases torture, of Palestinian detainees. The Landau Judi-
 cial Commission in 1987 condemned torture but allowed for the use of "moderate
 
 
 1294
 
 hSical and psychological pressure" to secure confessions and obtain information.
 here continued to be a high number of complaints of mistreatment and torture
 during interrogation, especially from those suspected of belonging to Islamic groups.
 Interrogation sessions are Iong and severe, and solitary confinement is used fre-
 quently for long periods. The GSS systematically uses interrogation methods which
 * not result in detectable traces of ill-treatment on the victims, or which leave
 marks that disappear after a short period of time.
 Common interrogation practices reportedly include hooding;, forced standing or
 squatting for longperiods of time; prolonged exposure to extreme temperatures;
 tying or chaining the detainee in contorted and painiul positions; blows and beatings
 with fists, sticks, and other instruments; confinement in small and often filthy
 spaces; sleep and food deprivation; and threats against the detainee's life or family.
 Israeli interrogators continued to subject prisoners to violent "shaking," which in at
 least one case has resulted in death. The apparent intent of these practices is to
 disorient and intimidate prisoners in order to obtain confessions or information. The
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) declared in 1992 that such prac-
 tics violate the Geneva Convention. Human rights groups and attorneys challenged
 the practice of shaking before the Israeli High Court. In a number of cases, the
 Court ordered the GSSto show cause for use of this method to obtain information.
 In many of the cases, the Court authorized the GSS to use the shaking method.
 Although the Israeli Penal Code prohibits the use of force or violence by a public
 official to obtain information, the GSS chief is permitted by law to allow interroga-
 tors to employ "special measures" that exceed the use of "moderate physical and
 psychological pressure" when it is deemed necessary to obtain information that
 could potentially save Israeli lives in certain "ticking bomb" cases. The GSS first
 permitted interrogators "greater flexibility" in applying the guidelines shortly after
 a bus bombing in Tel Aviv in October 1994 that killed 22 Israelis. The Government
 has not defined the meaning of "greater flexibility." At roughly quarterly intervals,
 the Government has approved the continued use of "special measures," arguing that
 they were vital because their use had prevented terrorist attacks. In November the
 Government granted another 3-month extension of the "special measures" provision.
 In November the Israeli High Court of Justice authorized the GSS to use "special
 measures" against a Palestinian prisoner, and "force" to extract information from
 another Palestinian prisoner. In both cases, the prisoners were alleged terrorists
 whom the Israelis believed had information concerning imminent terrorist attacks,
 making these "ticking bomb" cases.
 Israeli authorities maintain that torture is not condoned, but acknowledge that
 abuses sometimes occur and are investigated. However, the Government does not
 generally make public the results of such investigations. Israel conducted 60 inves-
 tigations into the 83 complaints received in 1996. In the investigations conducted,
 the Israeli Government concluded that the findings did not justify any steps being
 taken against the interrogators.
 Most convictions in security cases before Israeli courts are based on confessions.
 A detainee may not have contact with a lawyer until after interrogation, a process
 that may last days or weeks. The Government does not allow ICRC representatives
 access to detainees until the 14th day of detention. Human rights groups point to
 this prolonged incommunicado detention as contributing to the likelihood oabuse.
 Detainees sometimes claim in court that their confessions are coerced but judges
 rarely exclude such confessions. Human rights groups also assert that Palestinian
 detainees frequently fail to make complaints either from fear of retribution or be-
 cause they assume that their complaints will be ignored.
 There were 83 formal complaints submitted by Palestinian detainees resident in
 the occupied territories against the GSS for mistreatment during interrogation.
 Complaints of abuse are forwarded to the Department for Police Investigations at
 the Ministry of Justice, which investigates complaints against the GSS. During the
 year, there were no known cases in which a confession was disqualified because of
 improper means of investigation or interrogation.
 sraeli authorities also frequently treat Palestinians in an abusive manner at
 checkpoints. In November security officers were videotaped beating and humiliating
 a group of Palestinian workers. Following a public outcry in Israel when the video-
 tape was shown on television, the two policemen involved were suspended. The
 Prime Minister condemned the incident, calling it "unpardonable." The chief of the
 Israeli border police confirmed that many such incidents occur. More than 300 for-
 mal complaints were filed against border policemen, and the Ministry of Justice con-
 fi-med that complaints of violence and harassment had increased this year. Accord-
 ing to the Israeli government, 73 cases were closed because the petitioners did not
 cooperate with the investigation, 47 cases were closed for lack of evidence, and 26
 were dismissed as unjustified. In 33 cases border guards were prosecuted; in 14
 
 
 1295
 other cases they were referred for disciplinary action; and the rest remain under in-
 vestigation.
 Security officers who man checkpoints often act capriciously in honoring permits
 and travel passes held by Palestinians. Following the election of the Palestinian
 Legislative Council, PA council members from Gaza were subjected to long delays
 and searches at Israeli checkpoints in the West Bank, even though they were travel-
 ling on special passes issued by Israel. In September a leading Gazan businessman
 who had obtained Israeli approval to travel with foreign diplomats between Gaza
 and the West Bank was verbally abused and forced to walk almost a kilometer
 through the checkpoint to rejoin the diplomats. In October a blind Palestinian with
 American citizenship was detained at a checkpoint for 5 hours, verbally abused, and
 accused of "faking" her blindness. In March IDF soldiers in the northern West Bank
 arrested an elderly Palestinian man tending his animals, stripped him naked, and
 forced him to walk home.
 According to credible reports, PA security forces abused, and sometimes tortured,
 Palestinian detainees. Such abuse generally takes place after arrest and during in-
 terrogation. The PA does not prohibit the use of force or torture against detainees.
 In 1995 the Gaza Civil Police commander issued to police officers in the West Bank
 and Gaza a circular forbidding torture during interrogation and directing the secu-
 rity forces to observe the rights of all detainees. The circular, however, does not
 have the force of law; Palestinian security officers have not been issued formal
 guidelines on the proper conduct of interrogations.
 PA security officials reportedly abused prisoners by hooding, beating, tying in
 painful positions, sleep deprivation, threats, and burning detainees with cigarettes
 and hot instruments. A 1995 report by the Israeli human rights group B'tselem
 claimed that mistreatment of detainees and improper arrest and detention proce-
 dures by the Preventive Security Service (PSS) in Jericho reflects PA policy. The
 Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) and other Palestinian human rights
 groups denied that there is evidence of systematic abuse, but cited numerous inci-
 dents of mistreatment, especially of detainees accused of collaboration with the Is-
 raelis, affiliation with certain political or extremist groups, or the commission of
 crimes, such as drug dealing, prostitution, or rape. On some occasions prisoners
 were denied prompt and adequate medical care after being abused.
 In 1996 four Palestinians died in PA custody, two after being tortured, one after
 he apparently committed suicide, and one was shot and killed. In August Ayman
 Sabbah charged from his hospital bed that he had been tortured by PA security
 forces after being arrested during an anti-PA protest.
 Israeli settlers harassed Palestinians. For example, settlers rampaged through
 Arab neighborhoods in the old city of Jerusalem in June, stoned Arab cars in Beit-
 El in February, and shot at Palestinians in Bethlehem in February.
 Prison conditions in Israeli facilities are poor. Facilities are overcrowded, sanita-
 tion is poor, and medical care is inadequate. Palestinian inmates held strikes and
 protests in support of a number of causes and to protest prison conditions. Prisoners
 in Megiddo military detention center in Israel rioted in April over their treatment
 during investigations into the deaths of two Palestinians who were allegedly killed
 by other Palestinians. Palestinians in Israeli prisons also held several strikes to pro-
 test being held in administrative detention, lack of visits by family members or law-
 ers Israel's refusal to release female Palestinian prisoners, and to protest abuse
 y prson authorities. Israel permits independent monitoring of prison conditions, al-
 though human rights groups and diplomats encountered difficulties gaining access
 to specific detainees.
 Prison conditions in PA facilities are very poor. Facilities are overcrowded and di-
 lapidated. Food and clothing for prisoners is inadequate and must be supplemented
 by donations from families and humanitarian groups. Palestinian inmates held
 strikes and protests in support of a number of causes and to protest prison condi-
 tions. Palestinians who were arrested by PA authorities after a wave of terrorist
 bombings in February and March went on strike in April and June to protest poor
 prison conditions, being held in solitary confinement, and being held in administra-
 tive detention. The PA has not allocated its Ministry of Justice funds to make im-
 provements.
 The PA permits independent monitoring of prison conditions, although human
 rights groups encountered difficulties arranging visits or gaining access to specific
 detainees. In September the PA signed an agreement with the International Com-
 mittee of the Red Cross (ICRC) allowing the ICRC access to PA-run prisons. The
 ICRC had not had access to Palestinian detention facilities and prisons since 1995.
 In accordance with the agreement, the ICRC began prison visits in both the West
 Bank and Gaza in December.
 
 
 1296
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Any Israeli policeman or border guard
 may arrest without warrant a person who has committed, or is suspected of having
 committed, a criminal or security offense in the occupied territories, except for areas
 under exclusive PA control. Israeli soldiers may also detain Palestinians and hold
 them for questioning for the same reasons. Human rights groups say that the vast
 majority of arrests and detentions are for alleged security offenses. Persons arrested
 for common crimes are usually provided with a statement of charges and access to
 an attorney and may apply for bail. However, these procedures are sometimes de-
 layed. Authorities issue special summonses for security offenses. Israeli Military
 Order 1369 stipulates a 7-year prison term for anyone who does not respond to a
 special summons delivered to a family member or posted in the MATAK office near-
 est his home address. Bail is rarely available to those arrested for security offenses.
 The courts treat persons over the age of 12 as adults.
 Israeli authorities may hold persons in custody without a warrant for 96 hours;
 they must be released unless a warrant is issued. Prearraignment detention can last
 up to 11 days for Palestinians arrested in the occupied territories and up to 8 days
 for minors and those accused of less serious offenses. Authorities must obtain a
 court order for longer detentions-up to 6 months from the date of arrest. Detainees
 are entitled to be represented by counsel at their detention hearings, although the
 defense is routinely not allowed to hear the evidence against a suspect. Detainees
 must be released at the end of the court-ordered detention if they are not indicted.
 If there is an indictment, a judge may order indefinite detention until the end of
 the trial. Detainees have the right to appeal continued detention. A Palestinian ad-
 ministrative detainee who was arrested in 1992 for a security offense remains in
 detention in Israel, having had his detention orders extended eight times to enable
 the Government to prepare a case against him. A new administrative detention
 order was issued this fall against the Palestinian held since 1992.
 Although a detainee generally has the right to consult with a lawyer as soon as
 possible, in security cases authorities may delay access to ounsel for up to 15 days.
 Higher-ranking officials or judges may extend this period. Access to counsel is rou-
 tinely denied while a suspect is being interrogated, which sometimes can last sev-
 eral weeks. Authorities must inform detainees of their right to an attorney and
 whether there are any orders prohibiting such contact. In April Israeli authorities
 agreed to let lawyers visit two Palestinians suspected of involvement in a bus bomb-
 ing in Jerusalem after they had been in prison for nearly 1 month, according to
 press reports.
 A number of factors hamper contacts between lawyers and their clients in Israeli
 prison and detention facilities. Human rights groups charge that authorities some-
 times schedule appointments between attorneys and their detained clients, only to
 move the clients to another prison prior to the meeting. Authorities reportedly use
 such tactics to delay lawyer-client meetings for as long as 90 days. Israeli regula-
 tions permit detainees to be held in isolation during interrogation. The closure of
 the occupied territories, which was tightened after a series of terrorist bombings in
 Israel and Jerusalem in February and March, and again after Palestinian-Israeli
 clashes in September, also makes it difficult for lawyers to gain access to clients in
 prison inside Israel According to the Mandela Insttute, in February Israel began
 allowing only Palestinian lawyers with East Jerusalem identity cards and licenses
 issued by the Israeli Bar Association or by an official Israeli governmental body
 such as MATAK or the former Civil Administration to visit detainees in Israeli pris-
 ons.
 Israeli authorities claim that they attempt to post notification of arrest within 48
 hours. In February the Israeli High Court of Justice ordered the State to ensure
 that the families and attorneys of security prisoners are notified immediately that
 an arrest has occurred, the location of the prisoner, and whether the attorney may
 meet his client. Palestinian suspects are nonetheless often kept incommunicado for
 several days after their arrest.
 Palestinians generally locate detainees through their own efforts. Palestinians can
 check with their local ICRC office to determine whether it has information on the
 whereabouts of a family member. A senior officer may delay for up to 12 days notifi-
 cation of arrest to immediate family members, attorneys, and diplomatic officials.
 A military commander may appeal to a judge to extend this period in security cases
 for an unlimited time.
 Israeli district military commanders may order administrative detention (deten-
 tion without trial) for up to 12 months without formal charges. Administrative de-
 tention orders may be extended. Many Palestinians administratively detained over
 the past 2 years have had their detention orders renewed repeatedly with no mean-
 ingful chance of appeal.
 
 
 1297
 There were 270 Palestinians in administrative detention in Israel at year's end,
 compared with 220 at the end of 1995. Administrative detainees are usually held
 in the Megiddo prison. The Palestinian Society for the Protection of Human Rights
 and the Environment, and the Defence for Children International report that at
 least six children below the age of 16 are being held. in administrative detention and
 have had their orders extended.  "
 Evidence used at hearings for administrative detentions is secret and unavailable
 to the detainee or his attorney. Lawyers report that during hearings to appeal de-
 tention orders, the detainee and defense lawyer are required to leave the courtroom
 wh-n secret evidence is presented. Israeli authorities maintain that they are unable
 to present evidence in open court because to do so would compromise the method
 of acquiring the evidence, which is often provided by informers whose lives would
 be jeopardized if their identities were known. Detainees may appeal detention or-
 ders, or the renewal of a detention order, before a military judge.
 There were no deportations for security reasons in 1996.
 At year's end, an estimated 3,800 Palestinian prisoners and detainees were incar-
 cerated in Israeli prisons, military detention centers, and holding centers, a decrease
 from 4,900 incarcerated in 1995. The Israeli Government routinely transfers Pal-
 estinians arrested in Israeli-controlled areas of the occupied territories to facilities
 in Israel, especially Megiddo military detention center near Asula. In May Israel
 closed the Ketziot detention camp in the Negev desert and transferred its detainees
 to other prisons in Israel.
 Families, human rights organizations, and lawyers have encountered barriers try-
 ing to gain access to Palestinian detainees and prisoners held in facilities in Israel
 as a result of closures of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Family visits to Palestinian
 prisoners held in Israeli jails have sharply declined. Only immediate family mem-
 bers, including siblings under the age of 16, are allowed to visit relatives in facilities
 in Israel. Family members with security records are barred from visiting. Transfer-
 ring of prisoners between facilities also makes it difficult for families, lawyers, and
 human rights organizations to locate and visit detainees. Due to travel restrictions,
 the ICRC suspended its family visits program to detainees in Israeli prisons several
 times during the year.
 Israeli security forces conducted several mass arrests of Palestinians in response
 to acts or tbreats of violence against Israelis. Israel arrested approximately 1,000
 Palestinians suspected of affliation with Hamasthe Palestine Islamic Jihad, or the
 Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine ater a series of suicide bombings in
 February and March. Of these, approximately 100 were still being held in adminis-
 trative detention at year's end.
 The PA does not have a uniform law on administrative detention, and security
 officials do not always adhere to the existing Gazan and West Bank laws. Gazan
 law, whii is not observed in the West Bank, stipulates that detainees held without
 charge be released witbin 48 hours. Gazan law allows the Attorney General to ex-
 tend the detention period to a maximum of 90 days during investigations. Human
 rights organizations and the PA Ministry of Justice assert that PA security officials
 do not always adhere to this regulation. ive members of the Plestinian polce force
 were detained m Gaza without charge for several months in an internal dispute.
 Prevailing West Bank law allows a suspect to be detained for_24 hours before being
 charged. The Attorney General can extend the detention period.
 PA authorities generally permit prisoners to receive visits from family members,
 attorneys, and human rights monitors, except for prisoners held for security rea-
 sons. PA security officials are not always aware that lawyers have a right to see
 their clients. In principle, detainees may notify their families of their arrest, but
 thisis not always permitted.
 In 1996 the several PA security services had overlapping or unclear mandates. Al-
 though only the civil polic ae a uthorized to make arrests, other security services
 reportediy do so as well. The operating procedures and regulations for conduct of
 police in the various services are not well developed and have not yet been made
 available to the public.
 There are many detention facilities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip adminis-
 tered by the overlapping PA security services, a situation that complicates the abil-
 ity of families, lawyers, and even the Ministry of Justice, to track detainees' where-
 a bouts. Security services including the Preventive Security, General Intelligence,
 military intelligence, and the coast guard have their own interrogation and deten-
 tion facilities. In general, these services do not, or only sporadically, inform families
 of a relative's arrest. Most PA security officers remain ignorant of proper arrest, de-
 tention, and interrogation procedures as well as basic human rights standards. Ap-
 proximately 450 Pal-estinian security officers from various securty organizations i
 
 
 1298
 the West Bank were trained in basic human rights practices and principles in 1996
 by Palestinian human rights groups.
 PA security forces continued to arbitrarily arrest and detain journalists, political
 activists, and human rights advocates, who criticized the PA, such as Iyad Sarraj
 and Bassim Eid (see Sections 2.a. and 4).
 Palestinian security forces in the Gaza Strip and West Bank arrested approxi-
 mately 1,000 Palestinians in the wake of the suicide bombings in early 1996 and
 in response to pressure to crack down on terrorism. The majority of arrests were
 conducted without warrants, and approximately 150 individuals arrested in Feb-
 ruary and March remain in detention without being charged.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Palestinians accused by Israel of security offenses
 in Israeli-controlled areas of the occupied territories are tried in Israeli military
 courts. Security offenses are broadly defined and may include charges of political ac-
 tivity, such as membership in outlawed organizations. Charges are brought by mili-
 tary prosecutors. Serious charges are tried before three-judge panels- lesser offenses
 are tried before one judge. Defendants have the right to counsel ana to appeal ver-
 dicts to the court of military appeals, which may accept appeals based on the law
 applied in the case, the sentence, or both. The right ofappeal does not apply in all
 cases and sometimes requires court permission. The Israeli military courts rarely
 acquit Palestinians of security offenses, but sentences are sometimes reduced on ap-
 peal.
 Trials are sometimes delayed for several reasons: Witnesses, including Israeli
 military or police officers, do not appear;, the defendant is not brought to court; files
 are lost; or attorneys fail to appear, sometimes because they have not been informed
 of the trial date or because of travel restrictions on Palestinian lawyers. These
 delays add pressure on defendants to plead guilty to avoid serving a period of pre-
 trial detention that could exceed the sentence. In cases involving minor offenses, an
 "expedited" trial may be held, in which a charge sheet is drawn up within 48 hours
 and a court hearing scheduled within days.
 By law most Israeli military trials are public, although access is limited. Diplo-
 matic officials are allowed to attend military court proceedings involving foreign citi-
 zens, but there have been delays in gaining admission. Most convictions in military
 courts are based on confessions.
 Evidence which is not available to the defendant, his attorney, and occasionally
 the judges may be used in court to convict persons of security offenses. There is fre-
 quently no testimony provided by Palestinian witnesses because, Israeli authorities
 maintain, Palestinians refuse to cooperate with the authorities. Physical and psy-
 chological pressures and reduced sentences for those who confess make it more like-
 ly for security detainees to sign confessions. Confessions are usually spoken in Ara-
 bic, but translated into Hebrew for the record because, authorities maintain, many
 Israeli court personnel speak Arabic but few read it. Palestinian detainees seldom
 read Hebrew and therefore sign confessions that they cannot read.
 Crowded facilities and poor arrangements for attorney-client consultations in pris-
 ons hinder legal defense efforts. Appointments to see clients are difficult to arrange,
 and prison authorities often fail to produce clients for scheduled appointments. The
 temporary tightening of the closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip following ter-
 rorist bombings in February and March and violent Israeli-Palestinian clashes in
 the West Bank and Gaza Strip in September significantly decreased contact be-
 tween lawyers and clients in jails in Israel.
 Israeli settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip accused of security and ordinary
 criminal offenses are tried under Israeli law in the nearest Israeli district court. Ci-
 vilian judges preside and the standards of due process and admissibility of evidence
 are governed by the laws of Israel, not military occupation decrees. Settlers con-
 victed in Israeli courts of crimes against Palestinians regularly receive lighter pun-
 ishment than Palestinians convicted in Israeli courts of similar crimes against ei-
 ther'Israelis or other Palestinians.
 The PA inherited a court system based on structures and legal codes predating
 the 1967 Israeli occupation. The Gaza legal code derives from British Mandate law,
 Egyptian law, and PA directives and laws. Pre-1967 Jordanian law applies in PA-
 controlled areas of the West Bank: Bodies of law in the Gaza Strip and West Bank
 have been substantially modified by Israeli military orders. According to the DOP
 and the Interim Agreement, Israeli military decrees issued during the occupation
 theoretically remain valid in both areas and are subject to review pursuant to a spe-
 cific procedure. The PA is undertaking efforts to unify the Gaza and West Bank
 legal codes, but it has made little progress.
 Whe PA court system in general is recovering from years of neglect. Judges and
 staff are underpaid and overworked and suffer from lack of skills and training, court
 procedures and record-keeping are archaic and chaotic; and the delivery of justice
 
 
 1299
 is often slow and uneven. Judges suffer from a lack of police protection. The ability
 of the courts to enforce decisions is extremely weak, and there is administrative con-
 fusion in the appeals process.
 In June lawyers representing 10 Bir Zeit students arrested in March without a
 warrant by the PA for having suspected links to Hamas petitioned the PA to charge
 or release the students. In August the West Bank High Court of Justice in
 Ramallah demanded that the PA release the students for lack of cause. Senior PA
 officials, including Chairman Arafat and the Attorney General, ignored and failed
 to enforce the order in a timely fashion. According to a lawyer who represented the
 students, most of them were released more than a month after the order was hand-
 ed down.
 The PA Ministry of Justice appoints all civil judges for 10-year terms. The Attor-
 ney General, an appointed official, reports to the Minister of Justice and supervises
 judicial operations in both the Gaza Strip and West Bank.
 In 1995 the PA established state security courts in Gaza and the West Bank to
 try cases involving security issues. Three military judges preside over each court,
 which applies civilian law. A senior police official heads the state security court in
 Jericho, and three judges preside over it. There is no right of appeal, but verdicts
 may be either ratified or repealed by the PA chairman, asir Arafat. According to
 the PA, during the year, the PA State Security Court handed down sentences to 12
 defendants, ranging from a few years in prison to death. There are 10 Palestinians
 sentenced to death, but none of the sentences have been carried out. According to
 a press report, Chairman Arafat commuted the death penalties issued by PA courts.
 Normal limits on the length of prearraignment detention do not appear to apply
 to suspects held by a PA security court. Defendants are brought to court without
 knowledge of the charges against them or sufficient time to prepare a defense. De-
 fendants are represented by court-appointed lawyers. Court sessions often take
 place on short notice, sometimes even in the middle of the night, at times without
 awyers present, all violations of a defendant's right to due process. In some in-
 stances, security courts try cases, issue verdicts, and impose sentences in a single
 session lasting several hours. Terrorists who murdered an Israeli settler and her
 young son were arrested, tried, and convicted shortly after the crime.
 Local and international human rights groups have criticized the PA state security
 courts, arguing that they are subordinate to the power of the executive and that
 subordination undermines the independence of the judiciary and violates defend-
 ants' rights to a fair and open trial. The PA Ministry of Justice has no jurisdiction
 over the security courts, according to the PA Attorney General.
 The Palestine Center for Human Rights reported that as of April, 83 persons sus-
 pected of collaborating with Israel were in PA detention. PA facilities held 150 polit-
 ical prisoners at year's end.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Israeli
 military authorities in areas of the West Bank under their control may enter private
 Palestinian homes and institutions without a warrant on security grounds when au-
 thorized by an officer of the rank of lieutenant colonel. In conducting searches, the
 IDF has forced entry, and has sometimes beaten occupants and destroyed property.
 Israeli authorities say that forced entry may lawfully occur only when incident to
 an arrest and when entry is resisted. Authorities say that beatings and arbitrary
 destruction of property during searches are punishable violations of military regula-
 tions, and that compensation is due to victims in such cases. According to the Israeli
 Government, information on the claims against the Ministry of Defense for damages
 caused as a result of IDF actions has not yet been collected.
 In September IDF soldiers forced their way into the West Bank apartment of a
 Palestinian-American family during clashes with Palestinian demonstrators. The
 IDF forced the family members out of their apartment, roughed them up, hitting
 and pushing them, and pointed guns at them. When the family was allowed back
 into the apartment 3 days later, they found that the soldiers had smashed windows,
 destroyed furniture and clothing, and fouled the apartment with excrement. The
 family was later compensated by the Government.
 Israeli security forces may demolish or seal the home of a suspect, whether the
 owner or tenant, without trial. The decision to seal or demolish a house is made
 by several high-level Israeli officials, including the Coordinator of the MATAK (for-
 me rly Civil Administration) and the Defense Minister. Owners of houses ordered de-
 molished have 48 hours to appeal to the area commander; a final appeal may be
 made to the Israeli High Court. A successful appeal generally results in the conver-
 sion of a demolition order to sealing. After a house is demolished, military authori-
 ties confiscate the land and prohibit the owner from rebuilding or removing the rub-
 ble.
 
 
 1300
 
 Israeli authorities demolished eight homes for security reasons in 1996, compared
 with one in 1995. They also sealed one apartment, making it uninhabitable, com-
 pared with one partial sealing in 1995. The authorities carried out demolition orders
 issued in 1995 on the homes of 3 suicide bombers. In addition, authorities demol-
 ished the homes of five individuals implicated in suicide bombings, including one
 Palestinian involved in the 1995 bombing of a bus in Jerusalem who was tried and
 sentenced by the Palestinian Authority. Israeli authorities sealed the apartment of
 a suicide bomber after the High Court of Justice ruled that demolishing the apart-
 ment would harm other apartments in the building. Human rights groups rexort
 that Israeli security forces blew up five of eight houses that were demolished in
 many cases damaging surrounding homes. Israel compensated the owners of the
 damaged homes in some cases.
 Many human rights groups criticize the sealing or demolishing of homes because
 such acts target innocent families and children. The Israeli High Court has stated
 that the goal of such demolitions is to deter terrorists. An Israeli security official
 told the Israeli press that blowing up a home had a greater psychological effect than
 demolishing it using nonexplosive methods.
 Owners may apply to regional military commanders for permits to rebuild or
 unseal their homes. Since 1994 the Israeli Government has allowed the opening or
 rebuilding of homes sealed or demolished as a result of security offenses committed
 by a family member after that person has been released from prison. Each former
 prisoner must apply for a permit to rebuild or unseal a home, which the Govern-
 ment may deny. In 1996 the Government allowed one home to be unsealed.
 Israeli security services sometimes monitor the mail and telephone conversations
 of Palestinians, Israelis, and foreigners. The authorities sometimes interrupt tele-
 p hone and electricity service to specific areas. In January electricity in villages near
 Janin was interrupted for several days after a Palestinian killed an Israeli soldier
 there.
 In the Gaza Strip and PA-controlled areas of the West Bank, the PA requires the
 Attorney General to issue warrants for entry and searches of private property.
 These requirements are sometimes ignored in Palestinian police sweeps for security
 suspects. PA police have searched homes without the consent of their owners. In
 some cases, poie have forcibly entered premises and destroyedproperty. In March
 Palestinian security forces searched the homes of journalist Rabi Hussein Rabi and
 his brother and father without a warrant because they were believed to be affiliated
 with Hamas. Palestinian security in the Gaza Strip destroyedproperty during
 searches of private property and the Islamic University in Gaza in march.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-IDF regulations permit the use of live ammunition only when a soldier's life
 is in immediate danger, to halt fleeing suspects, to disperse a violent demonstration,
 or to firne on an "individual unlawfully carrying firearms." According to policy, sol-
 diers should direct fire at the legs only and may fire at a fleeing suspect only if they
 believe that a serious felony has occurred and they have exhausted other means to
 apprehend the suspect. It is forbidden to open fire in the direction of children or
 women, even in cases of severe public disorder, unless there is an immediate and
 obvious danger to a soldier's life. However, Israeli soldiers and police sometimes
 used live ammunition in situations other than when their lives were in danger and
 sometimes shot suspects in the upper body and head.
 On September 25, Yasir Arafat called or a general strike and marches to protest
 the opening of the Hasmonean Tunnel in Jerusalem. However, after the Palestinian
 reacton spiraled into spontaneous acts of violence and confrontations between Is-
 raeli security forces and Palestinians, intense gun battles erupted between Israeli
 and Palestinian security forces, causing Israeli and Palestinian casualties.
 Both sides used excessive force. According to the PA Ministry of Health and
 human rights groups, 58 Palestinians were killed (including 11 security officers).
 Fifteen of those Palestinians killed were children under age 18, according to Defense
 for Children International. Sixteen Israeli soldiers died of wounds from live fire, ac-
 cording to the Israeli Government. The fatalities from this one incident exceeded the
 number of Israelis and Palestinians killed in violent confrontations in all of 1995.
 Palestinian sources contend that Israeli forces in Ramoallah and Rafah fired on
 demonstrators and Palestinian security personnel from helicopter gunships and
 from elevated sniper positions. Israel also used nonlethal means to disperse rioters,
 including batons and tear gas. Israeli security forces fired on and killed medical per-
 sonnel and civilians while they were evacuating wounded. One Palestinian nurse
 was shot and killed in Gaza while evacuating wounded persons. Palestinian security
 forces prevented medical care from reaching a wounded Israeli journalist in the
 Gaza Strip.

 In the face of violence, the PA promptly took steps to improve command and con-
 trol of its forces. During the fighting, the head of the Palestinian security forces in
 the West Bank traveled with his Israeli central command counterparts to the scenes
 of the fighting to restore order and discipline. Before the fi htin ended, the PA in-
 stituted a new procedure barring protests in proximity to Israeli checkpoints. This
 procedure greatly reduces the possibility of clashes between Israeli security forces
 and Palestinian protesters. Palestinian security forces reinforced existing instruc-
 tions to their units forbidding the use of firearms without prior approval and have
 not hestitated to discipline those guilty of weapons infractions.
 During and following the September disturbances, the PA provided protection for
 and assisted in the evacuation of Israeli security forces stranded at Joseph's Tomb
 in Nablus.
 During the year, extremist Palestinians also killed 4 Israeli soldiers and civilians
 in the West Bank and PA areas and 58 people in terrorist bombings in Israel (see
 Section 1.g. of the Israel report).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Israeli Government generally respects free-
 dom of speech in the occupied territories, but prohibits public expressions of support
 for Islamic extremist groups, such as Hamas, and other groups avowedly dedicated
 to the destruction of Israel. Continuing a policy it began in 1994, the Israeli Govern-
 ment generally did not enforce its prohibition on the display of Palestinian political
 symbols, such as flags, national colors, and graffiti, acts which are punishable by
 fines or imprisonment. In May, however, the IDF raided an elementary school in
 Hebron and beat pupils for flying a Palestinian flag, according to press reports.
 Overall, censorship of specific press pieces continued to be low. Israeli authorities
 continue to monitor the Arabic press for security-related issues. Military censors re-
 view Arabic publications in Jerusalem for material related to the public order and
 security of Israel and the territories. Reports by foreign journalists are also subject
 to review by Israeli military censors for security issues, and the satellite feed used
 by many foreign journalists is monitored.
 Israelsometimes closes areas to journalists, usually in conjunction with a curfew
 or security incident. Israeli authorities have denied entry permits to Palestinian
 journalists travelling to their place of work in Jerusalem during closures of the ter-
 ritories.
 The IDF requires a permit for publications imported into the occupied territories.
 Imported materials may be censored or banned for anti-Semitic or anti-Israeli con-
 tent. Possession of banned materials is punishable by a fine and imprisonment. In
 1996 Israel refused to allow publications into the Gaza Strip when it tightened its
 closure of the occupied territories after terrorist bombings in February and March.
 Israel closed for 6 months at least six colleges, universities, and recreational and
 welfare institutions in Jerusalem and Israeli-controlled areas of the West Bank in
 March after a series of terrorist incidents. Israeli authorities claimed that the insti-
 tutions served as centers of Hamas activity. In September Israel extended the clo-
 sure orders on Hebron University, Hebron Technical Institute, and Islamic institu-
 tions. These closure orders were lifted in December in anticipation of IDF redeploy-
 ment in Hebron.
 Educational institutions in the West Bank and Jerusalem also closed for periods
 of time as a result of internal closures in the West Bank that Israel imposed after
 terrorist attacks in the spring and after clashes between Israeli security forces and
 PA security forces and Palestinians in September. These closures disrupted the op-
 erations of colleges, universities, and schools because significant numbers of stu-
 dents and staff could not travel to the schools from neighbog towns and villages.
 Following terrorist bombins in the spring, Israeli security forces arrested hundreds
 of Gazan students in the West Bank and returned them to Gaza. At years' end,
 Gazan students are still denied travel and residence permits to attend West Bank
 colleges and universities.
 The PA has a generally poor record on freedom of expression and freedom of the
 press, although it professes to tolerate varying political views and criticism. PA
 chairman Arafat enacted a press law in 1995 prior to Palestinian elections that Pal-
 estinian journalists criticize for not adequately protecting press freedoms. In a re-
 port issued in September 1995, Reporters Without Frontiers, a Paris-based journal-
 ists' rights group, charged the PA with resorting to "pressure, harassment, arrests,
 and suspensions" to stifle the independence of the press. It labeled the PA Press
 Law as restrictive, because it prevents criticism of the police and permits the sei-
 zure of newspapers that do so. The Israeli human rights group B tselem reported
 that Palestinian journalists now practice self-censorship to avoid antagonizing the
 
 
 1302
 PA. Editors readily admit that they practice self-censorship to avoid being shut
 down by the PA.
 PA officials imposed restrictions on the press in several instances, including clos-
 ing some opposition newspapers. PA authorities do not permit criticism of Yasir
 Arafat or his policies or style of government. Twice in 1996, the PA arrested and
 detained human rights activist lyad Sarraj for criticizing the PA and Yasir Arafat.
 On May 18, Palestinian policemen arrested Sarraj for investigation for "slander"
 based on comments Sarraj made to a Western journalist that were critical of arbi-
 trary arrest and torture committed by PA authorities. Sarraj was released on May
 26, and wrote a letter to Arafat reiterating his views. On June 9, police arrested
 Sarraj again. Sarraj alleged that he was beaten in custody. He was released from
 custody on June 26. In May the PA Preventive Security Fo    in Gaza pressured
 a journalist and his editor to reveal the source of a newspaper article on corruption
 in the Preventive Security Force. Also in May, PA Chairman Arafat fired a Voice
 of Palestine talk show host for allowing a caller to criticize the Palestinian security
 services. In Gaza PA authorities took a radio show off the air after the host com-
 plained that PA officials were driving luxury cars. In February and March, Palestin-
 ian authorities closed al-Watan and al-Istiqlal, the press organs of Hamas and the
 Palestinian Islamic Jihad. They have not been allowed to reopen by year's end. In
 September the PA shutdown the weekly independent Jenin allegedly because its
 editor criticized the policies of the Jenin municipality and the local trade organiza-
 tion. In August PA authorities prevented the distribution of books by one of raa
 most vocal critics, Edward Said.
 The PA has authority over all levels of education in the West Bank and Gaza
 Strip. There were no reports of PA interference with academic freedom.
 .b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Israeli military orders ban
 public gatherings of 10 or more people without a permit, but authorities relaxed en-
 forcement after the signing of the Declaration of Principles in September 1993. Ac-
 cording to the Palestinian Society for the Protection of Human Rights and the Envi-
 ronment, Israeli authorities began to enforce this order more vigorously in response
 to Palestinian demonstrations held in 1996 over land issues in the West Bank.
 Private organizations are required to register with the Israeli authorities, though
 some operate without licenses. The authorities permit Palestinian charitable, com-
 munity, professional, and self-help organizations to operate unless their activities
 are viewed as overly political or opposed to the DOP.
 PA officials maintain that they do not impose restrictions on freedom of assembly,
 although they do require permits for rallies, demonstrations, and many cultural
 events. These were rarely denied. In Gaza police approval is required for "political
 meetings at several specific large meeting halls. Written permission is also required
 for buses to transport passengers to attend political meetings. In West Bank cities,
 the PA requires permits for outdoor rallies and demonstrations and prohibits calls
 for violence, a display of arms, and racist slogans. In December the PA issued per-
 mits to a number of rejectionist groups (Hamas, PFLP, DFLP) to celebrate their an-
 niversaries on the condition they demonstrate peacefully and not advocate violence.
 At a Bir Zeit University rally Hamas supporters burned an Israeli bus in effigy, an
 act that suggested support for bus bombings. The PA reportedly approached Bir Zeit
 University officials to review security procedures for the rally.
 There were periodic complaints during the year from Palestinian political parties,
 social, and professional groups, and other non-governmental organizations that the
 PA tried to limit their ability to act autonomously.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Israeli Government respects freedom of religion and
 does not ban any group or sect on strictly religious grounds. It permits all faiths
 to operate schools and institutions. Religious publications are subject to the publica-
 tions laws (see Section 2.a.). The IDF temporarily closed three mosques in the West
 Bank for security reasons for several months. In April the IDF closed a mosque in
 the West Bank town of Burqa for security reasons and in May closed mosques in
 Qabalan and A-Ram for 6 months after finding "inciteful material" in them, accord-
 int human rights monitors and press reports.
 e PA does not restrict freedom of religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Occupied Territories, Foreign Travel, Emigra-
 tion, and Repatriation.-Israel requires that all West Bank and Gaza residents ob-
 tain identification cards to qualify for permits to enter Israel and Jerusalem. How-
 ever, Israel sometimes denies applicants ID cards and permits with no explanation,
 and does not allow effective means of appeal. Palestinian residents of Jerusalem are
 sometimes prohibited from entering PA-controlled areas of the West Bank, and they
 require written permits from Israel to travel to the Gaza Strip. Residents of the
 Gaza Strip are rarely able to obtain permission to travel to the West Bank. Israel
 
 
 1303
 
 and the PA have yet to establish "safe passage" to facilitate travel between the West
 Bank and Gaza Strip, as set out in the Interim Agreement.
 Israel continued to apply its policy begun in 1993 of closure of the West Bank and
 Gaza Strip in response to terror attacks. A closure was applied on February 25, fol-
 lowing suicide bombings in Jerusalem and Ashkelon. During "normal" closure condi-
 tions that prevailed for most of 1996, any Palestinian holding a Gaza or West Bank
 identity card was required to obtain a permit to enter Israel or Jerusalem. Palestin-
 ian workers employed in Israel were prohibited from entering Israel to work for a
 significant portion of the year. Most Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
 encountered difficulty obtaining permits to work, visit, study, obtain medical care,
 or attend religious services outside of the West Bank or Gaza. Israeli authorities do
 not permit Gazans to bring vehicles into Israel and rarely permit West Bank vehi-
 cles to enter Jerusalem or Israel.
 As a security precaution, Israel also routinely tightens closures on the West Bank
 and Gaza during major Jewish or Muslim holy day a, as well as during times of polit-
 ical sensitivity for Israel or the Palestinian authority, such as during the Israeli
 elections in May.
 Twice in 1996-in the spring following terrorist bombings in Israel and Jerusa-
 lem, and after Palestinian-Israeli clashes in September-Israel imposed a total clo-
 sure of the West Bank and Gaza as well as an "internal closure" on West Bank
 towns, isolating areas under PA control by preventing travel between them. The "in-
 ternal closure" imposed in the spring, the first time such a closure was used, lasted
 for about 2 weeks, as did the second. Israeli government officials acknowledged that
 closures have limited effectiveness as a security measure; since at least 1994, all
 known perpetrators of terrorist attacks in Israel were not in possession of valid per-
 mits but were nonetheless able to enter Israel.
 The tightening of these restrictions signficantly hampered the flow of food, medi-
 cine, students, doctors, and patients into and out of the occupied territories, and se-
 riously disrupted normal commerce. Human rights groups report that in February
 and March at least seven ll Paestinians, including three babies, died because they
 were unable to travel to hospitals in Jerusalem or  Israel. Another Palestinian child
 died at an Israeli checkpoint while awaiting permission to enter Israel for medical
 treatment. Emergency cases were handled on an ad hoc basis throughout the Sep-
 tember-October crisis. By year's end, more trucks and day laborers w'ere permitted
 to enter and leave the territories.
 Israel continues to impose periodic curfews in areas of the West Bank under its
 jurisdiction largely in response to security incidents, in anticipation of incidents, or
 as part of ongoing security operations. Israeli settlers are generally free to move
 about during curfews, while Palestinian residents are confined to their homes. Fol-
 lowing clashes between Israeli security forces and Palestinian security forces and ci-
 vilians in September, Hebron was put under a 20-hour per day curfew that lasted
 for 10 days. Palestinians periodically were allowed out o their omes for brief peri-
 ods of time to buy food anId other necessities.
 The Government restricted travel for 21 Israeli settlers, prohibiting them from en-
 tering sensitive locatians in the West Bank. The Yesha Council, an umbrella group
 of settler organizations, estimates that six Israelis were placed under administrative
 detention during the year.
 The Israeli Government requires all Palestinians resident in areas under its con-
 trol to obtain permits for foreign travel and has restricted the travel of some politi-
 cal activists. Bridge-crossing permits to Jordan may be obtained at post offices with-
 out a screening process. However, the fear of losing one's residency is an obstacle
 to travel. Palestinian males between the ages of 16 and 25 who cross into Jordan
 must remain outside the occupied territories for 9 months. Restriction on residence,
 tourist visas, reentry, and family reunification apply only to Palestinian residents
 of the occupied territories. Israeli authorities sometimes refuse to renew the laissez-
 passers of Palestinians from the occupied territories who live or work abroad, on the
 grounds that they have abandoned their residences.
 The Israeli Government ordinarily does not permit Palestinians who obtain for-
 eign citizenship to resume residence in Jerusalem; nor does it permit those who ac-
 quire legal residency abroad, or who remain outside Jerusalem for over 3 years, to
 resume their residency. Such persons are permitted to return only as tourists and
 are sometimes denied entry entirely. No such restrictions are applied to Israeli citi-
 zens.
 Israel enforced these residency restrictions in Jerusalem with greater stringency
 in 1996, according to human rights groups and foreign diplomats. In 1996 appron-
 mately 2,000 Arab residents of Jerusalem had their residency permits revoked, or
 were told by Israeli officials they could not retain their resident status if they trav-
 eled out of the country or if they did not renounce citizenship or residency in an-
 
 
 1304
 other country. The Israeli Government has denied that greater enforcement of the
 Jerusalem residency requirements reflects a concerted policy to decrease the Arab
 population in Jerusalem. The Government explained in September that Palestinian
 residents of Jerusalem are not losing their residency status as a result of more rig-
 orous enforcement of the Jerusalem residency requirements and that Israel had not
 changed its policies. The Government, however, has not yet responded to requests
 by foreign diplomats to explain why it revoked Jerusalem residency permits in sev-
 eral dozen individual cases, which apparently did not contradict Israeli policy.
 Israeli authorities also place restrictions on family reunification. Most Palestin-
 ians who were abroad before or during the 1967 war or who have lost their resi-
 dence permits for other reasons, are not permitted to reside permanently with their
 families in the occupied territories. Israeli security also singles out young (often un-
 married) Palestinian males for harsher treatment than other Palestinians, citing
 them as more likely to be security risks. They generally are prohibited from working
 in Israel.
 The MATAK usually denied permanent residency in the occupied territories to the
 foreign-born spouses and children of Palestinian residents, and to nonresident moth-
 ers. The Government usually issued temporary residency permits to persons in
 these categories.
 The PA generally does not restrict the travel of Palestinians in Gaza and PA cities
 in the West Bank. During clashes with Israeli security in September, PA authorities
 placed Nablus under a temporary curfew. Passports and identification cards for the
 residents of PA areas are issued by the PA. PA authorities issued travel documents
 freely to male Palestinians, and the PA Ministry of Civil Affairs rescinded this past
 summer the law requiring women to show the written consent of a male family
 member before issuing them a travel document (see Section 5).
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Palestinian residents of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem chose their
 first popularly-elected government on January 20. They elected an 88-member Pal-
 estinian Legislative Council and the head of the Executive Authority of the Council.
 Voter turnout was high, about 75 percent of the estimated 1 million registered vot-
 ers. Yasir Arafat won almost 89 percent of the vote in a two-person race for chief
 executive of the Council. Some 700 candidates ran for Council seats. Council mem-
 bers were elected in multi-member electoral districts. As many as 35 of the elected
 members were independent candidates or critics of Arafat and his Fatah faction.
 The Council convened on March 7 and proceeded to elect their officers. International
 observers concluded that the election could be reasonably regarded as an accurate
 expaession of the will of the voters, despite some irregularities.
 t Palestinians in Jerusalem do not recognize the jurisdiction of the Municipal-
 ity of Jerusalem; less than 7 percent of Jerusalem's Palestinian population voted in
 1993 municipal elections. No Palestinian resident of Jerusalem sits on the city coun-
 cil.
 Women are underrepresented in government and politics. There are five women
 in the 88-member Council, and two women serve in ministerial-level positions.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vest igation of Alueged Violations of Human Rights
 mostny l  o   ups-Israeli, Palstinian, and international-monitored the Israeli
 Government's human rights practices. The Israeli Government normally cooperates
 with human rights organizations; officials normally agree to meet with human
 rights monitors. The Israeli Government permits them to publish and hold press
 conferences.
 However, some individual human rights workers have been subjected to inter-
 ference. A fieldwork coordinator for the Paestinian human rights organization Al-
 Haq was arrested and detained without charge in February. A blind Palestinian-
 American human rights worker was detained at the Gaza border, intermogated, and
 prevented from presenting a human rights training session in Gaza.
 Many local human rights groups--mostly Palestinian-as well as several inter-
 national human rights organizations, monitored the PA's human rights practices.
 The PA generally cooperates with these organizations and PA officials normally
 meet with their representatives. Many of the Palestinian human rights organiza-
 tions work behind the scenes with the PA to overcome alleged abuses in certain
 areas. They also publish criticism if they believe that the PA is not responding ade-
 quately to private entreaties.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) operates in the PA areas
 under the terms of a memorandum of understanding signed in September between
 
 
 1305
 the ICRC and the PLO. The memorandum accords the ICRC access to all detainees
 held by the PA and allows regular inspections of prison conditions. Despite this
 memorandum, and an earlier one, the ICRC had not visited PA detention facilities
 since 1995. In September the PA signed an agreement with the ICRC allowing the
 ICRC access to PA-run prisons. The ICRC began prison visits in both the West
 Bank and Gaza in December in accordance with the agreement.
 The PA police twice arrested and detained for several days the chairman of" the
 Palestinian Independent Commission for Citizen's Rights, Iyad Sarraj, for criticizing
 the PA and its human rights practices (see Section 2.a.). In January Palestinian se-
 curity forces arrested and held B'tselem field worker Bassam Eid for several hours
 without specifying why he was being held. In September 1995, the head of the Pal-
 estinian Preventive Security Force in Jericho had labeled Eid "an agent of the Is-
 raeli police."
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Under the complex mixture of laws and regulations that apply to the territories,
 Palestinians are disadvantaged under Israeli law and practices compared with the
 treatment received by Israeli settlers. This includes discrimination in residency,
 land and water use, and access to health and social services.
 Women.-The problems of rape, domestic violence, and violence related to "family
 honor have gained greater prominence, but public discussion is generally muted.
 Victims are often encouraged by relatives to remain quiet and are themselves pun-
 ished or blamed for the "shame" that has been brought upon them and their fami-
 lies. Women's groups seek to educate women on these problems, but women's rights
 advocates claim that few resources are available to shelter the victims of violence.
 They also maintain that society has not been receptive to providing counseling or
 outreach services to victims of problems that they see as more widespread than is
 acknowledged. There are no reliable statistics available on family violence or other
 forms of violence against women.
 Palestinian women in the Israeli-controlled areas of the occupied territories and
 in the Palestinian Authority areas endure various forms of social prejudice and re-
 pression within their own society. Because of early marriage, girls frequently do not
 fimish the mandatory level of schooling. Cultural restrictions sometimes prevent
 them from attending colleges and universities. While there is an active women's
 movement in the West Bank and Gaza, attention has only recently shifted from na-
 tionalist aspirations to women's issues such as domestic violence, education, employ-
 ment, and marriage and inheritance laws.
 There are no laws providing for women's rights in the workplace. Some Palestin-
 ian women work outside the home. Women are underrepresented in most aspects
 of professional life. There are almost no women in decisionmaking positions in the
 legal, medical, educational, and scientific fields. However, a small group of women
 are prominent in politics, medicine, law, teaching, and in nongovernmental organi-
 zations.
 Personal status law for Palestinians is based on religious law. For Muslim Pal-
 estinians, personal status law is derived from Shari'a (Islamic law). In the West
 Bank and Gaza, Shari'a law pertaining to women is part of the Jordanian Status
 Law of 1976, which includes inheritance and marriage laws. Under the law, women
 inherit less than male members of the family. The marriage law allows men to take
 more than one wife, but few do so. Women are permitted to make "stipulations" to
 protect them against divorce and questions of child custody. However, only 1 percent
 of women take advantage of this section of the law, leaving most women at a dis-
 advantage when it comes to divorce or child custody. Following legal protests, the
 PA Ministry of Civil Affairs this year rescinded a law requiring women to obtain
 the written consent of a male family member before it would issue them a travel
 document.
 Children.-While the PA provides for compulsory education, it does not provide
 specific health services for children. Current British Mandate, Jordanian, and mili-
 tary laws, from which West Bank and Gaza law is derived, offer protection to chil-
 dren under labor and penal codes. While there is no juvenile court system, judges
 secializing in children's cases generally sit for juvenile offenders. In cases where
 t   child is the victim, *udges have the discretion to remove the child from a situa-
 tion deemed ha    l. However, the system is not advanced in the protection af-
 forded children.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse of children, either among Israelis or Palestin-
 ians.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no mandated accessibility to public facilities in
 the occupied territories under either Israeli or Palestinian authority. Approximately
 
 
 1306
 130,000 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza are disabled. Some Palestinian in-
 stitutions care for and train disabled persons; their efforts, however, are chronically
 underfunded. According to a report by the Palestinian human rights grup AI-Haq,
 many Palestinians with disabilities are segregated and isolated ffom Palestinian so-
 ciety; they are discriminated against in most spheres, including education, employ-
 ment, transportation, and access to public buildings and facilities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Labor affairs in the West Bank came under Palestin-
 ian authority with the signing of the Interim Agreement in September 1995. Until
 a new law being drafted by PA authorities comes into effect, labor affairs in the
 West Bank are governed by Jordanian Law 21 of 1965, as amended by Israeli mili-
 yorders, and in Gaza by PA decisions. The law permits workers to establish and
 joi unons without government authorization. The earlier Israeli stipulation that
 all proposed West Bank unions a pply for a permit is no longer enforced. No new
 unions were established in 1996. Israeli authorities have previously licensed about
 35 of the estimated 185 union branches now in existence. There are almost 30 li-
 censed trade unions in the West Bank and 6 in Gaza.
 Palestinian workers in Jerusalem are governed by Israeli labor law. They are free
 to establish their own unions. Although the Government restricts Jerusalem unions
 from joining West Bank trade union federations, this restriction has not been en-
 forced. Palestinian workers in Jerusalem may simultaneously belong to unions affili-
 ated with a West Bank federation and the Israeli Histadrut labor federation.
 West Bank unions are not affiliated with the Israeli Histadrut federation. Pal-
 estinian workers who are not resident in Israel or Jerusalem are not full members
 of Histadrut, but they are required to contribute 1 percent of their wages to
 Histadrut. Negotiations between Histadrut and West Bank union officials to return
 half of this fee to the Palestinian union -federation were completed in 1995.
 Histradut did not return half of the fee.
 Palestinians who work in Israel are required to contribute to the National Insur-
 ance Institute (NII), which provides unemployment insurance and other benefits.
 Palestinian workers are eligible for some, but not all, NII benefits. According to the
 Interim Agreement, Palestinians working in Israel will continue to be insured for
 injuries occurring in Israel, the bankruptcy of a worker's employer, and allowances
 for maternity leave. The Government of Israel agreed to transfer the NIl fees col-
 lected from Palestinian workers to the PA, which will assume responsibility for the
 pensions and social benefits of Palestinians working in Israel. Implementation of
 this change is still underway.
 The great majority of West Bank unions belong to the Palestinian Goneral Fed-
 eration of Trade Unions (PGFTU). The PGFTU acted as the informal coalition in
 the completion of the negotiations with Histadrut regarding workers' fees. The reor-
 ganization of unions under the PGFTU is intended to enable the West Bank unions
 and Gaza unions to better represent the union members' interests; the reorganiza-
 tion had not yet been finalized at year's end.
 An estimated 86,000 workers are members of the GFTU, the largest union bloc.
 The PGFTU estimates actual organized membership, i.e., dues-paying members, at
 about 30 percent of all Palestinian workers, and is working to add more.
 No unions were dissolved by administrative or legislative action this year. Pal-
 estinian unions seeking to strike must submit to arbitration by the PA Ministry of
 Labor. If the union disagrees with the final arbitration and strikes, a tribunal of
 senior judges appointed by the PA decides what, if any, disciplinary action is to be
 taken. There are no laws in the territories that specifically protect the rights of
 striking workers, and, in practice, such workers have little or no protection from em-
 ployers retribution.
 The PGFTU has applied for membership in the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions (ICFTU).
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiuely.-A majority of workers in the
 occupied territories are self-employed or unpaid family helpers in agriculture or
 commerce. Only 35 percent of employment in the territories consists of wage jobs,
 most with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), the PA, or in
 municipalities. Collective bargaining is protected. Labor disputes are adjudicated by
 committees of 3 to 5 members in businesses employing more than 20 workers.
 Existing laws and regulations do not offer real protection against antiunion dis-
 crimination. One industrial zone is being developed in the Gaza Strip.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labo.-There is no forced or compulsory
 labor in the'occupied territories.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum working age in the
 West Bank and Gaza is 14. This order is not effectively enforced, and underage
 
 
 1307
 workers are employed in agriculture and in some West Bank and Gaza factories.
 Work hours for young workers are not limited.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is currently no minimum wage in the
 West Bank or Gaza area. In the West Bank, the normal workweek is 48 hours in
 most areas; in Gaza the workweek is 45 hours for day laborers and 40 hours for
 salaried employees. There is no effective enforcement of maximum workweek laws.
 The Palestinian Authority Ministry of Labor is responsible for inspecting work
 places and enforcing safety standards in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The
 Ministry of Labor says that newer factories and work places meet international
 health and safety standards but that older ones fail to meet minimum standards.
