 MALTA
 
 Malta is a constitutional, democratic republic with a
 parliamentary government elected by universal suffrage. The
 president serves as chief of state, but direction of the
 executive is exercised by the cabinet under the leadership
 of the prime minister. Two parties occupy the sixty-five
 seats in the unicameral parliament. The judiciary is
 Independent. Malta is a member of the British Commonwealth.
 In terms of racial composition and religious affiliation,
 the Maltese population is generally homogeneous, with an
 established tradition of respect for legal norms.
 Reflecting this tradition, chapter four of the Maltese
 constitution states the general principle that every person
 in Malta is entitled to fundamental individual rights and
 freedoms regardless of race, place of origin, political
 opinion, color,*creed or sex.
 The potential threat to these generally observed high
 standards exists primarily in the intensely partisan spirit
 that frequently animates official decisions and has affected
 negatively even vital non-political institutions such as the
 judiciary, the national broadcasting system, hospitals and
 schools. Coverage of the 1981 general election campaign by
 the government-controlled television network impressed many
 observers as biased in favor of the incumbent party. The
 functioning of superior courts was suspended for several
 weeks in early 1981.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Section 37 of the Maltese constitution prohibits inhumane or
 degrading punishment. Torture is not practiced by the
 government of Malta.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from inhumane or degrading punishment is provided
 for by section 37 of the constitution and respected in
 practice. The approximately 100 persons who make up Malta's
 total prison population are provided with adequate living
 space, food, health care and recreational opportunities on a
 non-discriminatory basis.
 c.   Disappearances
 Abduction or secret arrest is not practiced by the
 government of Malta.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or detention is provided for
 in section 35 of the constitution and respected in
 practice. There are no political prisoners.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A fair public trial before an impartial-court is provided
 for in section 40 of the constitution and is respected in

 practice. The constitution provides for an independent
 judiciary and there is an appeals court. A court reform act
 passed in 1981 imposes new limits on the jurisdiction of the
 courts and gives the executive greater scope to operate
 independently of judicial oversight. Malta's system of
 military justice was taken over intact from the British
 forces. Only military personnel are subject to this system,
 and there are provisions for appeal to civilian courts.
 f.   Invasion of the Home
 Protection for privacy of the home is provided for by
 section 39 of the constitution and is respected in practice.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 These freedoms are guaranteed by the constitution and
 respected in practice. However, the government on occasion
 has interfered arbitrarily with the residency of
 non-nationals in Malta, as in the summary expulsion of a
 retired U.S. businessman in 1981.
 b.   Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel. Emigration and Repatriation
 These freedoms are guaranteed by the constitution and
 respected in practice.
 C.   Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 There is a high degree of participation in Malta's
 democratic political system. Voting is not compulsory, but
 approximately 94 percent of eligible voters cast a ballot
 during the'1981 parliamentary elections.
 Women take an active part in Malta's political life. A
 woman served in the cabinet as minister of labor, culture
 and welfare throughout the greater part of 1981. Both the
 Malta Labor Party and the Nationalist Party have active
 women's organizations, which are playing an increasingly
 prominent political role.
 There is an active trade union movement representing about
 one-third of the labor force. Approximately 70 percent of
 trade union members belong to the General Workers Union,
 which is formally integrated with the governing Malta Labor
 Party. Most of the remaining unions are affiliated with the
 Independent Confederation of Trade Unions (CMTU).
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No requests are known to have been made for outside
 investigation of the human rights situation in Malta. The
 government of Malta refused to permit a UNHCR role in the
 case of a non-national refugee who sought asylum in the
 American embassy in 1981.

 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 The constitution declares that availability to citizens of
 the highest grades of education and social welfare are
 fundamental aims of government. Both government and
 opposition are committed to pursuit of these aims and to
 support of the basic economic aspirations to own property,
 to work with just conditions and remuneration, to a standard
 of living adequate for health and wellbeing and to universal
 education. Maltese public education is free,
 nondiscriminatory and extensive in relation to Malta's
 limited resources. The literacy rate is over 80 percent,
 and education is compulsory to age 16.
 Traditionally, general standards of health care in Malta are
 relatively high. Government programs in health care have
 concentrated on providing inexpensive health services to the
 largest possible segment of the population, but a prolonged
 labor dispute between the government and the medical
 association has led to the departure from Malta of many
 local doctors, and the remaining church-run private
 hospitals have been closed by the government.
 Women participate freely in social and political life and
 continue to expand their economic role, although they are
 underrepresented in the professions and management. There
 are some limitations on women's property rights within.
 marriage, which derive from traditional Maltese social
 values and notions of women's property rights. Limitations
 on public sector employment of married women were removed in
 1981. Strong private sector demand for female labor has
 ensured a low level of unemployment among women, who
 constitute about 27 percent of the labor force. Public
 economic and social services are extended on a
 non-discriminatory basis.
 Malta's per capita GNP for 1980 was $3,866. Estimated life
 expectancy at birth is 69.4 years for males and 73.4 years
 for females, according to the 1980 official estimate. The
 infant mortality rate per thousand live births is 15.5,
 according to official estimate. The adult literacy rate is
 87 percent. The average annual rate of population growth,
 1975-1980, is 1.1 percent. The total fertility rate was
 estimated in 1980 at 2.08 percent. One hundred percent of
 the population has access to safe water. Virtually all
 Maltese boys and girls of primary school age attend school.
