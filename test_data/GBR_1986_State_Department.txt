 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 The United Kingdom (U.K.) is a constitutional monarchy, with
 government based on a multiparty, parliamentary democracy. As
 there is no written constitution, human rights are "residual",
 i.e., assumed unless limited by statute. Human rights have
 always been respected and guarded by the British people and
 their elected governments.
 The United Kingdom's highly developed industrial economy has a
 mix of private and state-owned industries. Individuals may
 freely own property and pursue their economic interests, and
 the population benefits from a comprehensive social welfare
 program. Public policy opposes discrimination on the basis of
 race, religion, sex, or political opinion.
 On the whole, the U.K. has a long tradition of respect for
 human rights. In Northern Ireland, however, that tradition
 has been tested by years of sectarian violence. As a result,
 while public safety in Great Britain is maintained by a
 civilian police force, the police in Northern Ireland receive
 support from army units.
 Recent proposals for a bill of rights for Northern Ireland
 drawn on the lines of the European Convention on Human Rights
 raise complex legal and constitutional questions.
 Nonetheless, the subject has been raised in discussions
 between the British and Irish Governments.
 On November 15, 1985, the British and Irish Governments
 concluded the Anglo-Irish Agreement which provides: (1) a
 framework for security coordination between the U.K. and
 Ireland; (2) a process which (a) enables the Republic of
 Ireland to advance proposals in specific areas related to
 Northern Ireland and north-south affairs, and (b) establishes
 an intergovernmental conference; and (3) a guarantee that any
 change in the status of Northern Ireland will occur only with
 the consent of the majority of its people.
 Although intended to safeguard the rights and identities of
 both communities in Northern Ireland, the agreement has met
 opposition. Paramilitary groups on both sides have continued
 their campaigns of violence. Unionist members of Parliament
 resigned their seats in protest against the agreement To
 demonstrate their opposition to the agreement, some Unionists
 turned to strike, boycott, and suspension of work in local
 councils and the Northern Ireland Assembly. In July 1986, the
 Secretary of State for Northern Ireland prorogued the Assembly
 before the end of its session. No new elections have been
 scheduled.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The British Government does not practice or condone killing
 for political motives.
 The Government reported that during 1986, 62 persons were
 killed by terrorists in incidents related to Northern Ireland
 during 1986. Twenty-four belonged to the security forces.
 During the same period, security forces killed five persons.
 
 
 1073
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 Since 1969, 2,525 persons have died in violence related to
 Northern Ireland.
 The Government continues to authorize the use of plastic baton
 rounds (PBR's or plastic bullets) for riot control. A
 Protestant youth in Portadown was shot with a PBR during a
 disturbance in March 1986 and later died. In September 1986,
 a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), charged in
 connection with the death of a Catholic man at a rally in
 1984, was acquitted. The judge found that the use of PBR's
 had not been inappropriate in the incident.
 In 1984 the European Parliament passed a resolution calling
 for a ban on PBR use in Northern Ireland. While acknowledging
 the danger of PBR's, the British Government contends they are
 less dangerous than live rounds. This view was supported in
 October 1984 when the European Commission on Human Rights
 dismissed as "manifestly ill-founded" a case involving PBR's,
 ruling that their use was "acceptable" and "less dangerous
 than alleged."
 A series of fatal shootings beginning in 1982, involving
 members of the RUC and the army, gave rise to allegations that
 the security forces in Northern Ireland practiced a
 "shoot-to-kill" policy when dealing with suspected
 terrorists. Manchester Deputy Chief Constable John Stalker
 was assigned to investigate these charges. His investigation
 was suspended for a time in 1986 when he was removed following
 charges against him (later dropped) arising from his other
 police duties.   In mid-1986 the investigation resumed under
 the direction of West Yorkshire Chief Constable Colin
 Sampson. These events fueled demands for an independent
 judicial inquiry.
 b. Disappearance
 Government authorities do not abduct, secretly arrest, or hold
 persons in clandestine confinement, nor do they sponsor or
 condone such activities,
 The Government reported that, during the first 11 months of
 1986, 69 persons were abducted or illegally detained by
 nongovernmental forces in incidents related to Northern
 Ireland. This figure includes both terrorist and other
 kidnapings.
 c. Torture, and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 British law forbids torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment of prisoners and provides penalties for such abuse.
 Confessions obtained by such methods are not admissible as
 evidence in court.
 Government policy seeks to prevent abuse of prisoners, and in
 January 1986 the Government put into effect a new Code of
 Practice for the police, with provisions for disciplinary
 action.
 In April 1985, an independent Police Complaints Authority was
 established in England and Wales. The Government has
 announced plans to establish a similar system for
 investigating complaints against police in Northern Ireland.
 
 
 1074
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 The Government acknowledges that some old British prisons are
 unsatisfactory and overcrowded and that many prisoners live in
 cramped, unhygienic cells. Britain's prison population is
 rapidly rising. The average prison population in 1985 was
 46,300, an increase of 2,950 from the 1984 figure. Prison
 facilities are officially capable of holding only 40,925
 persons. Prisons are also understaffed. Home Office figures
 show that in some prisons guards have-been working 80-hour
 weeks.
 To relieve overcrowding, the Government is expanding parole
 opportunities and has embarked on a building program. Three
 new prisons opened in 1985, six more are under construction
 for use by 1990, and nine more facilities are under discussion
 or in various stages of planning and design.
 Prison conditions in Northern Ireland differ in some respects
 from those in Great Britain. All prisons in the province,
 except for two centers for young offenders, are
 maximum-security institutions. Yet Northern Ireland prisons
 are newer and less crowded than those in Britain, and
 prisoners have visitation, mail, and clothing privileges not
 available to those in other U.K. prisons. In 1986, a new
 prison with an extensive range of educational and training
 facilities was constructed, and the old women's prison in
 Armagh was closed. The Northern Ireland prison population
 declined by one-tenth during 1985-86.
 Complaints continue about "strip searching", particularly of
 women, in Northern Ireland prisons. These searches involve a
 visual inspection conducted in special cubicles by female
 officers. Body cavity searches are not performed. Strip
 searching is routine for prisoners making home visits and
 conducted on a random basis for those making court
 appearances. Since prisoners who are on remand (awaiting
 trial) are brought to court every 8 to 14 days, they face the
 possibility of frequent strip searching. Proposed changes in
 remand rules would make court appearance less frequent,
 reducing the occasion for strip searching. For persons
 serving sentences, strip searching is conducted on a random
 basis and is less frequent than for remand prisoners. All
 visitors to prisons, including government officials, are
 subject to a "rub-down search." This involves an officer's
 passing his or her hands over the visitor's clothing.
 Visitors are not strip-searched.
 British legal practice provides for the indeterminate
 detention of minors convicted of serious crimes (murder). In
 Northern Ireland, where public attention has particularly
 focused on this issue, there are currently 47 persons serving
 indeterminate sentences (down from 63 in 1985). Thirteen of
 the 47 have been given provisional release dates in 1987,
 conditioned on continued good behavior.
 Britain has ratified the Council of Europe Convention on the
 transfer of sentenced persons, by which prisoners may be sent
 to their home countries to serve their sentences. Within the
 U.K., convicts are almost always required to serve their
 prison time in the general region where the crime was
 committed. Transfers can, however, be requested. Prisoners
 from Northern Ireland, who are serving time in Great Britain,
 for example, can apply for transfer to Northern Ireland to
 serve their sentences closer to their families. Several such
 requests were approved in 1986.
 
 
 1075
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 British law gives police broad discretionary powers to make
 arrests without warrant based on reasonable cause. Procedures
 for bail, judicial determination of the legality of detention,
 and suits for false imprisonment are routinely utilized in the
 U.K.
 Generally, persons arrested without a warrant must be released
 on bail if they cannot be brought before a magistrate's court
 within 24 hours. However, in some cases where the alleged
 offense is deemed serious, magistrates have repeatedly
 remanded persons for periods totaling up to 18 months before
 trial. The average length of time prisoners spent on remand
 increased from 51 days in 1984 to 55 days in 1985 for males,
 and from 34 days to 40 days for females. Prisoners on remand
 currently represent 19 percent of the total prison population.
 Subject to review by Parliament, British common law allows for
 the restriction of individual liberties by the Government in
 an emergency situation. Acting on the premise that the
 fundamental "right to life" has been in serious jeopardy due
 to the violence in Northern Ireland, the British Government
 has adopted two acts to deal with that threat: 1) the Northern
 Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act of 1973, now amended and
 consolidated as the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions)
 Act of 1978, which is applicable only to Northern Ireland; and
 2) the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act of
 1984 (originally enacted in 1976), almost all of which is
 applicable to the entire United Kingdom. Although both these
 acts empower the restriction of personal liberties, they are
 subject to parliamentary review and to mandatory renewal at
 frequent intervals.
 The 1984 Prevention of Terrorism Act empowers the police to
 arrest without warrant persons anywhere in the United Kingdom
 whom they reasonably suspect to be involved in terrorism.
 Such persons may be detained for up to 48 hours and up to a
 further 5 days on the authority of the Home Secretary. The
 powers of the Act were used in 1986 in respect to people
 suspected of acts of terrorism related to Northern Ireland,
 India, and the Middle East.
 Under the 1978 Emergency Provisions Act, the Northern Ireland
 police are empowered to arrest without warrant persons
 suspected of terrorism and to detain such persons for up to 72
 hours on their own authority. Similar authority is provided
 to arrest persons suspected of having committed, or being
 about to commit, a "scheduled" offense (i.e., one listed on a
 schedule attached to the law). For the purpose of doing so,
 the police may enter and search without a warrant any premises
 or other place where that person is or where the police
 suspect him of being. Also under this Act, members of the
 armed forces on duty may arrest without a warrant any person
 on suspicion of his having committed or being about to commit
 any offense. Such persons can be held for up to 4 hours,
 after which they must be transferred to police custody or
 released. There have been allegations that these limits have
 been exceeded by the police or the armed forces, but they
 have not been substantiated. In Northern Ireland, the police
 generally act pursuant to the provisions of the Prevention of
 Terrorism Act and the Emergency Provisions Act, thereby
 assuring that these arrestees have access to a solicitor after
 48 hours of detention. Human rights activists allege,
 however, that the 48-hour rule is not always followed.
 
 
 1076
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 An independent review of the 1978 Act by Sir George Baker,
 published in April 1984, concluded that its provisions were
 still necessary. In 1986, following Baker's recommendation,
 an order was issued increasing the Attorney General's
 discretion to try specific cases by regular rather than
 nonjury courts. The Government also proposed other changes in
 line with the report, e.g., to rationalize the police powers
 of arrest and limit the life of the legislation to 5 years,
 which Parliament is expected to approve in the near future.
 There is no forced or compulsory labor practiced in the United
 Kingdom.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair trial is guaranteed by law and observed in practi7e. All
 criminal proceedings must be conducted in public, with the
 exception of juvenile court cases and cases involving public
 decency or security. In a trial on charges under the Official
 Secrets Act, the court may be closed at the judge's
 discretion, but the sentence must be passed in public. A
 national, independent prosecution service was established in
 1985. It provides more consistency in determining which cases
 are prosecuted than was formerly possible when prosecutions
 were initiated by dozens of police departments across the
 country. This extends to England and Wales a system created
 in Northern Ireland in 1972.
 In Northern Ireland, certain cases involving terrorist-related
 offenses are tried by a judge without a jury. This court
 system (called "Diplock" courts) was established by
 legislation in 1973 at the -recommendation of the Diplock
 Committee, which had been empowered to consider legal
 procedures to deal with terrorist activity in Northern
 Ireland. The-1984 Baker Report found that conditions did not
 yet exist for the restoration of jury trials-for terrorist
 .offenses. However, the Government is committed to the use of
 jury trials whenever possible, and juries hear all cases not
 covered by antiterrorist legislation; these constitute the
 majority of criminal cases.
 Persons convicted by a Diplock court have an automatic right
 of appeal of conviction and/or sentence to a three-judge Court
 of Appeals, a right not granted to ,defendants tried before a
 judge and jury. The rate of conviction in Diplock courts of
 defendants who have pleaded not guilty is similar to that of
 defendants tried before juries. Judges in Diplock courts must
 make written explanations (which are made public) of their
 decisions. However, critics see an increased tendency to rely
 on confessions rather than to search for independent evidence
 of guilt or innocence. They also complain about the lengthy
 time-spent in custody awaiting trial and maintain that
 conviction rates by Diplock courts are unusually high.
 The use of evidence provided by terrorist accomplices
 ("supergrasses") in nonjury courts continues to be
 controversial. Although the evidence of an accomplice has
 always been admissible in U.K. courts, in nonjury courts the
 judge alone must decide whether the evidence of the
 supergrass" is credible, bearing in mind the danger of
 convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice.
 The Government maintains that the use of "supergrass"
 testimony is important in the legal fight against terrorism,
 but the recent reversal on technical grounds of several
 
 
 1077
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 convictions in "supergrass" cases has given ipetus to calls
 for tightening of prosecution procedures in Northern Ireland.
 In 1985 the 3 trials involving supergrass evidence resulted in
 43 convictions and 60 acquittals. There were no "supergrass"
 trials in 1986, and there is only one group of defendants
 presently awaiting trial in a case where "supergrass"
 testimony may be used.
 The Criminal Law Jurisdictions Act, enacted by both the
 British Government (1975) and Irish Government (1976), permits
 trial in the Republic of Ireland, in Northern Ireland, or in
 Britain of those accused of certain terrorist offenses,
 regardless of where the offense was committed.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The right of privacy is well respected in both law and custom.
 Warrants are generally required for a police search of private
 premises. However, under the Northern Ireland (Emergency
 Provisions) Act of 1978, any member of the armed forces on
 duty or any constable may enter any premises or other place,
 if he or she considers it necessary to do so to preserve peace
 or maintain order. This provision was introduced in
 recognition of the practical difficulty of obtaining a warrant
 in certain situations involving terrorist incidents, but it
 has been criticized for allowing excessively broad powers of
 entry on mere suspicion of wrongdoing.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 British tradition, an independent press, and a democratic
 political system combine to secure freedom of speech and press
 in the U.K. While the Government appoints the Board of
 Governors of the British Broadcasting Corporation, it does not
 seek to control the content of programs. Viewpoints
 independent and critical of the Government are well
 represented.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Except in cases of extreme civil disorder, in which public
 safety is judged to be at risk, the British authorities do not
 exercise their statutory right to limit individuals' freedom
 to attend public meetings of their choice. However, some
 critics claim that the 1986 Public Order law gives police too
 much discretion to restrict public assembly.
 The Prevention of Terrorism Act of 1984 and the Northern
 Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act of 1978 include sections
 prohibiting membership in, or support of, organizations
 (Loyalist and Republican) involved in terrorism. These
 organizations are specifically listed in the statutes. The
 lists do not include political parties, even those, such as
 Provisional Sinn Fein, which have close links to terrorist
 paramilitary organizations and openly support violence.
 The summer "marching season" in Northern Ireland presents
 special problems. Because these marches commemorate the
 traditions of opposing sectarian communities, they are
 controversial in the other community and can be a source of
 
 
 1078
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 public disorder. The RUC must approve specific marches and
 routes. During the 1986 marching season, several decisions
 connected with parades generated controversy. The Chief
 Constable of the RUC, in his 1986 annual report, recommended
 the establishment of an independent tribunal with authority to
 approve marches and their routing.
 British trade unions have immunities from prosecution for
 normal union activities involving the right to organize,
 bargain collectively, and strike on behalf of their own
 members. These are derived from common law rather than
 statute. The Employment Act of 1980, however, makes unions
 liable under civil law for losses resulting from "sympathy"
 strikes. In the rare instance where the right to strike is
 prohibited, e.g., for police officers, there are other means
 to resolve labor differences.
 The Government does not control, intimidate, harass, or
 persecute unions and other associations, nor does it limit in
 any way their freedom to maintain relations with recognized
 international bodies. However, in 1984, the Government
 prohibited continued trade union membership for public
 employees at its highly sensitive communications headquarters
 in Cheltenham on grounds of national security. The ban was
 first overturned and then upheld in the courts. Complaints
 concerning the Government's banning of unions at Cheltenham
 have been lodged and are under consideration by the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) and the European Court
 of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Government policy and general practice guarantees freedom of
 religion to all residents of the U.K.
 There is no religious or denominational bar to the holding of
 public office except in the case of the Sovereign, who must be
 a member of the Church of England.
 While both England and Scotland have established churches, the
 State makes no direct financial contribution to them, and
 their existence does not limit the freedom or access to public
 life of members of other churches. The Church of Ireland and
 the Church of England in Wales have been disestablished.
 In Northern Ireland, the Constitution Act of 1973 specifically
 prohibits discrimination on the basis of religious belief or
 political opinion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 In general, U.K. citizens enjoy freedom of movement within the
 country and in foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation.
 The Prevention of Terrorism Act of 1984 includes one exception
 to this general principle. The Act gives the Home Secretary
 the authority to exclude or prevent from entering mainland
 Britain anyone he believes may be connected with terrorism
 related to Northern Ireland, unless that person was born in
 Great Britain or has been ordinarily resident there for 3
 years. Similar authority is granted to the Secretary of State
 for Northern Ireland to exclude persons not native to or
 resident in that province. No one has been excluded under
 this law in the last 2 years. Nevertheless, these powers have
 
 
 1079
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 been referred to by many, including the National Council for
 Civil Liberties, as a system of internal exile.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The United Kingdom is ruled by a government formed on the
 basis of a majority of seats in the House of Commons won in
 freely contested elections. Participation in the political
 process is open to all persons and parties, of which there are
 several, representing a broad range of political views.
 For parliamentary and local elections, all citizens 18 years
 of age and over have the franchise. Women have full rights of
 participation and are represented at all levels of British
 life. Twenty-five women, including the Prime Minister, are
 currently members of Parliament.
 While racial minorities comprise about 5 percent of the total
 population, and while there are a few nonwhite members of the
 house of lords, only one nonwhite member of Parliament sits in
 the House of Commons. Many nonwhite Britons, however, have
 been elected to local government. The year 1986 saw the
 election of the first woman mayor of Asian extraction.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government generally maintains an open attitude toward
 international inquiries into alleged violations of human
 rights in the United Kingdom. It cooperates fully with the
 European Commission on Human Rights in investigations of
 complaints and has taken steps to rectify its own laws and
 policies when they were found not to be in conformity with the
 European Convention.
 The United Kingdom is a party to several human rights
 conventions, participates in international and regional human
 rights bodies, and is the host country to international
 nongovernmental human rights organizations, such as Amnesty
 International.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 British law bars discrimination on the basis of race, color,
 or national or ethnic origin. Through a highly developed
 welfare system available to all inhabitants regardless of
 race, religion, sex, ethnicity, or political opinion, the
 British Government meets the health, educational, and other
 basic needs of the people. The National Health Service
 provides comprehensive medical services to the entire
 population.
 Some studies, however, document a black unemployment rate that
 is nearly double that of whites, black concentration in manual
 jobs, and racial discrimination in job recruitment. In 1984 a
 Code of Practice on Employment, proposed by the Commission for
 Racial Equality and accepted by the Government, took effect.
 Although the Code does not have the force of law, it is used
 as a standard of good practice by industrial tribunals in
 racial discrimination cases and serves as a guideline for
 firms in eliminating all forms of discrimination.
 
 
 1080
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 Equal status and equal opportunity for women in professional
 fields is also provided by law. Enforcement mechanisms have
 been established, and progress toward women's equality is
 visible in many fields, including government hiring. Still,
 women have yet to achieve fully equal status. They hold
 three-quarters of Britain's lowest paying jobs, and the
 average female wage-earner takes home only three-quarters the
 pay of her male counterpart, up from 63 percent in 1970.
 Equal opportunity commissions were established in Britain in
 19-75 and in Northern Ireland in 1976 to assist in the
 enforcement of these laws.
 Historically, in Northern Ireland, the majority Protestant
 community has held a higher proportion of the skilled jobs,
 has controlled much of the local economy, and has been more
 prosperous than the Catholic community. The unemployment rate
 in Northern Ireland is substantially higher than that in the
 United Kingdom as a whole and continues to be on average twice
 as high for the minority Catholic population as for
 Protestants. The reasons for this situation are complex,
 involving a long history of discrimination by one community
 against the other for the purpose of maintaining its
 traditionally dominant position. In addition, higher Catholic
 populations in those younger age groups and rural areas which
 suffer from higher unemployment throughout the United Kingdom
 tend to skew this statistic, although Catholic youth
 unemployment is still higher than that for Protestants.
 British Government policy attempts to alleviate the problem by
 promoting equal opportunity, attracting more investment to
 Northern Ireland, and subsidizing the economy through public
 sector spending.
 Since 1972, when direct British rule was introduced in
 Northern Ireland, specific measures have been taken to combat
 religious discrimination against Catholics. These include:
 reform of the electoral rolls; prohibition of religious or
 political discrimination by any level of government;
 establishment of a Commissioner for Complaints to deal with
 grievances against local government; appointment of a Central
 Housing Authority to meet the problem of discrimination in
 housing; prohibition of discrimination in employment; and a
 special effort to recruit more Catholics into the Civil
 Service and the Police. In addition, the Standing Advisory
 Committee on Human Rights was established in 1973 to monitor
 human rights. Since 1976, the fair employment agency has
 served as the focal point of the Government's efforts to end
 job discrimination.
 While not disputing the value of these structures, critics are
 not satisfied and point to slow progress in remedying
 historical imbalances. In September 1986, the Government
 published a consultative paper containing proposals to make
 existing measures to counter discrimination in employment more
 effective.
 Within the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the proportion of
 Catholics reflects their proportion in the overall population
 in lower (under 35) age groups. In upper age groups and in
 the security forces, Protestants still dominate. Recruitment
 of Catholics into the security forces is made more difficult
 by terrorist threats, often carried out, to kill Catholics who
 join the Royal Ulster Constabulary or Ulster Defense
 Regiment. In 1986 a death threat from the Provisional Irish
 Republican Army (PIRA) caused a Catholic member of the Police
 Authority to resign. Similar death threats from the PIRA have
 
 
 1081
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 led to loss of jobs, particularly in the construction and
 service industries, and have affected investment in Northern
 Ireland.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Although Britain has no national minimum wage, about 48
 percent of the work force belong to labor unions that set
 their wages with employers. Until recently, organized labor
 resisted the setting of a national minimum wage. For workers
 employed in hotel, restaurant, and services sectors, where
 union representation is minimal (about 10 percent of all
 workers), wages councils comprising representatives of
 management, labor, and the public set minimum wages and other
 conditions of employment. The Government has abolished
 minimum wages set by wages councils for persons under 21.
 Basic rights for all nonunion workers, including white-collar
 professionals, are covered by employment protection
 legislation. Turn-of-the-century legislation limiting working
 hours for women employed in most manufacturing occupations was
 repealed in July 1986.
 Minors are allowed to do limited part-time work beginning at
 age 14 and are considered adults at age 16 for purposes of
 working hours and conditions. Working conditions and hours
 for minors are strictly regulated to ensure that a job does
 not interfere with school.
 Under the terms of the 1974 Health and Safety at Work Act, the
 Health and Safety Executive enforces strict occupational
 standards of health, safety, and working environment
 conditions. The Health and Safety Commission, consisting of
 management, labor, and public members, supervises the
 Executive and can develop new codes and regulations, subject
 to government approval.
