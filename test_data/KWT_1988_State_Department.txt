 KUWAIT
 For over 200 years Kuwait's Amirs, drawn from the Al-Sabah
 family, have traditionally governed in consultation with
 prominent commercial families and other community leaders.
 The 1962 Constitution, adopted after Kuwait gained full
 independence from the United Kingdom, provides for an elected
 National Assembly and details the powers and relationships of
 the branches of government and the rights of citizens.
 However, the Amir can suspend any or all provisions of the
 Constitution by decree. The majority Sunni community has
 experienced an Islamic revival, but the Government has
 rejected calls for adoption of a legal code based on Islamic
 law. The National Assembly, when functioning, has been
 permitted a degree of consultation with the ruling family and
 served as an outlet for popular expression, includino
 criticism of the Government. However, the Assembly was
 dissolved from 1976-1981, and again in 1986 when the Amir
 cited a breakdown in executive and legislative branch
 cooperation at a time when the nation faced serious economic
 and security problems. Since then, the Amir has ruled by
 decree. The Amir has stated that Kuwait will not abandon its
 parliamentary process but has not indicated when the Assembly
 might be reconvened. In addition to suspending the National
 Assembly, the 1986 decrees imposed prior censorship on the
 press and added to existing restrictions on the political and
 civil rights of all Kuwaiti residents. The Government,
 however, rarely violates the integrity of the individual.
 There is an independent judiciary.
 Kuwait maintains a small military force that includes army,
 navy, air force, and national guard units. The coast guard,
 frontier forces, and civil defense units are under the
 Interior Ministry. Kuwait's security apparatus is also
 centered in the Interior Ministry, whose Criminal
 Investigation Department (CID) is responsible for ordinary
 criminal cases. The Ministry's office of. Kuwait State
 Security (KSS) is charged with investigating internal
 security-related offenses. Both are active in investigations
 of terrorism and both work in collaboration with the uniformed
 police. The security organizations can deport foreigners
 summarily.
 Kuwaitis are a 42-percent minority in their own country,
 accounting for only about 764,000 of the 1.8 million
 population. Kuwaiti citizens are around 70 percent Sunni
 Muslim; the remainder are mostly Shi'a Muslim, although there
 is also a tiny community of Christians. The majority of
 Kuwait's inhabitants are noncitizen expatriate workers,
 including a Palestinian community of about 300,000, many in
 their second generation. Non-Kuwaitis are given due process
 under the law but have few other civil and political rights.
 The people of Kuwait enjoy a high standard of living, with an
 estimated per capita gross national product of $9,960 in
 1987. Most of the country's income derives from oil
 production and commercial investment.
 Kuwait's leadership in 1988 continued to face increasing
 Iranian-inspired subversion, a result of the Iranian
 revolution and the Gulf war. Measures adopted by the
 Government to combat terrorism led to increased restrictions
 on the rights of Kuwaiti citizens. The State Security Court
 
 
 1397
 KUWAIT
 conducted trials of Kuwaiti citizens, mostly Shi'as, for
 bombings and subversive activities. Some defendants sentenced
 to death remain in prison, but the majority tried were
 acquitted.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of government-instigated killings, but
 two persons died in terrorist incidents in 1988. On May 18, a
 car bomb exploded in downtown Kuwait, craiming the lives of
 two Kuwaitis suspected of transporting the bomb toward a
 nearby Kuwait airways office.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Unofficial but knowledgeable sources in both the Sunni and
 Shi'a communities believe that authorities have tortured at
 least some of the 12 Kuwaiti Shi'as arrested in January and
 February 1987 for involvement in the bombing of oil
 facilities. There are reports that senior officials, on
 learning of the torture and mistreatment, ordered that such
 practices be stopped. In its 1988 Report covering 1987,
 Amnesty International (AI) expressed concern about allegations
 it continued to receive of torture and ill-treatment by the
 State Security Intelligence Agency, and the torture of 9 of
 the 12 Kuwaiti Shi'as, arrested in 1987, in the Kuwait Central
 Prison. AI in May reported it had received reports of the
 death in custody of a Pakistani national and allegations that
 the death resulted from torture. Kuwaiti authorities did not
 respond to AI's requests for further information on the case.
 Alleged methods of torture included beatings while
 blindfolded, electric shock, sexual assault, alternate dousing
 with cold and hot water, threats of death or deportation, and
 threats against relatives.
 In routine criminal cases, police and security officials
 occasionally use physical violence when interrogating persons
 suspected of committing criminal acts. These incidents do not
 appear to be systematic or condoned. Non-Kuwaitis are mare
 likely to receive rough treatment than Kuwaitis, and the
 seriousness of the suspected crime also appears to play a
 role. Evidence of mistreatment during interrogation is a
 defense in Kuwait's courts, and confessions or other evidence
 obtained through torture are not admissible. The courts often
 hold police officers to account for abuses. Al's 1988 Report
 cites the criminal court conviction of three CID members
 charged with torture of a detainee accused of theft.
 Kuwait's prisons are managed along modern lines, with
 facilities for inmates' recreation and vocational training.
 By and large, guards treat inmates humanely, and the
 Government provides food and other necessities. However,
 there have been-credible reports of occasional beatings.
 Prisoners, including convicted terrorists held in maximum
 security facilities, are allowed to receive family and
 
 
 1398
 KUWAIT
 International Red Cross visits. Young offenders, few of whom
 are imprisoned, are separated from persons charged or
 convicted of serious crimes. There is no policy of
 discriminatory treatment among prisoners for racial or
 religious reasons. There are credible reports of substandard
 conditions in detention centers where expatriates facing
 deportation are typically held for several days prior to their
 departure.
 Kuwait's legal process, based primarily on the Napoleonic
 Code, is also inspired by Islamic law, but punishments such as
 mutilation or stoning are not permitted.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment are prohibited by the
 Constitution. In 1988 there were no reports of persons being
 detained for political reasons, and no reports of arbitrary
 detention. The penal code affirms a person's right to due
 process and stipulates that a detainee may not be held for
 more than 4 days without charge. A prosecutor's approval is
 required for detention periods beyond 24 hours. Thereafter,
 the suspect either must be released or charged by a
 prosecutor, who may authorize detention for up to an
 additional 21 days. Further detention pending trial may be
 authorized by a judge. Warrants are required unless a person
 is apprehended in the act of committing an offense. These
 legal safeguards are generally observed, with arrests being
 made openly and for specific violations of law. Reports of
 incommunicado detention are rare. Roadblocks and spot checks
 of outdoor gatherings of expatriates, especially of South
 Asians, are used sporadically by the police during searches
 for illegal immigrants and contraband liquor. Persons without
 proper identification may be detained by the police.
 No Kuwaiti citizen may be exiled or denied return to Kuwait.
 However, a noncitizen, even if a long-term resident, may be
 summarily expelled without charge or judicial recourse if the
 authorities deem him a troublemaker or security risk. The
 number of expatriates deported has declined since 1986, when
 approximately 27,000 were expelled as part of a sustained
 security crackdown in response to a terrorist attack on the
 Amir's motorcade in May 1985. As in previous years, the vast
 majority of the estimated 15,000 deportations in 1988 were
 based on immigration or residency violations.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Kuwait's judicial system is independent and, except for the
 State Security Court, provides for public trials and the right
 of appeal. Judges are appointed by the Amir on the
 recommendation of the Justice Ministry. Kuwaiti nationals
 serving as judges usually receive lifetime appointments, while
 the many non-Kuwaiti judges serve under 1- to 3-year
 contracts, which are renewable. Judges may be removed by the
 Justice Ministry for cause, but such removal is rare.
 By law, all defendants in felony cases must be represented by
 attorneys, court-appointed if necessary. In cases of
 misdemeanors, which include crimes punishable by less than 3
 years' imprisonment, legal counsel is optional, and the court
 is not required to appoint a defense attorney. The courts
 give consideration to defendants' allegations of police
 
 
 1399
 KUWAIT
 mistreatment in reaching verdicts and sentencing. Defendants
 tried in absentia have the right to an additional appeal.
 There are no reports of government interference in judges'
 issuance of verdicts or of discrimination against defense
 counsel. Translation of court proceedings, to ensure that
 they are understood by non-Arabic-speaking defendants, is
 sometimes inadequate.
 Defendants' rights are not always fully respected in the State
 Security Court, which convenes on an ad hoc basis to handle
 cases deemed of an internal security nature. Composed of
 judges normally serving in other courts, this tribunal
 conducts its proceedings in closed sessions; its judgments are
 not subject to appeal. Defendants are permitted to have an
 attorney,-who is allowed to conduct an active defense on
 behalf of the accused. The Amir has yet to approve the death
 sentences handed down to 6 defendants in the 1987 trial of 16
 Kuwaitis for oil field bombings in 1986, just' as he has failed
 to approve previous death sentences mandated by the Court for
 terrorist attacks, including for an attack on. the Amir himself
 in 1986.
 According to the Constitution, military coarts have
 jurisdiction only over offenses committed by members of the
 armed or security forces, except during periods of martial law
 (which has never been declared in Kuwait). The Amir has the
 power to pardon or commute sentences passed by either civilian
 or military courts and does so through the publication of an
 annual list of commutations following Kuwait's Independence
 Day, February 25. In 1988 the Amir's-commutations covered the
 release of 218 prisoners held for common crimes and reduced
 sentences for 474 others. The commutations did not apply to
 terrorists or others convicted by the State Security Court.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The right to individual privacy and sanctity of the home is
 provided for in the Constitution and generally respected in
 practice'. Search warrants are required, unless the police are
 in hot pursuit of a suspect fleeing the scene of a crime or
 there is an indication of the presence of alcohol or illegal
 narcotics. Search warrants to enter premises are issued by a
 public prosecutor. Expatriates, and particularly common
 laborers and servants who live in accommodations provided by
 their employers, may have their premises searched by the
 police with authorization only of the employer. Items
 arriving by mail for personal or institutional use are not
 usually opened before delivery unless the contents are
 suspected of being pornographic.
 In 1986 the Government restricted Kuwaiti males' right to
 marry foreigners, decreeing that official approval in advance
 would henceforth be required. The Government's action
 apparently was motivated by concern over how to meet its
 reponsibilities toward the children of non-Kuwaiti spouses
 residing outside the country. The Government, and the public
 at large, were also concerned about the growing number of
 Kuwaiti males marrying foreigners rather than Kuwaiti
 nationals.

 KUWAIT
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Constitutional provisions respecting these freedoms are often
 subject to such conditional phrases as "in accordance with
 conditions and manner specified by law." The Kuwaiti or
 foreign resident feels free to offer his opinion in private
 without fear of official retaliation. However, no one may
 make a written or public attack upon the Amir and the ruling
 family, upon Islam, or upon leaders of Arab states. Kuwait
 has an active censorship department, which reviews all books,
 films, videotapes, periodicals, and other material entering
 Kuwait in bulk or for commercial purposes. Radio and
 television are government owned and controlled.
 The Amir's July 1986 decrees that amended the press law to
 impose prior censorship on the Kuwaiti press and otherwise
 tighten press curbs remain in effect. These decrees also
 authorized the Government to suspend for up to 2 years any
 publication found to be serving foreign states or
 organizations, receiving assistance from foreign sources
 without the approval of the Information Ministry, or
 publishing material conflicting with Kuwait's national
 interests. The revised censorship regulations also toughened
 existing penalties for violators, prescribing prison sentences
 of up to 3 years and fines up to $17,000 for offending
 publishers, editors, and journalists.
 As before, the press was forbidden to publish material that
 contained direct criticism of the Amir and the ruling family,
 involved official confidential communications or treaties and
 agreements with other states, might disturb relations with
 Arab and friendly states, or, in a final category, "might
 incite people to commit crimes, create hatred, or spread
 dissension among the people." Prior to the Amir's decrees
 there was selective enforcement of the list of proscribed
 topics; violators were usually only issued warnings. Since
 July 1986, however, government censors have reviewed press
 items before their publication and ensured compliance by
 excising offending material or having it rewritten. There
 were no reports in 1988 of journalists arrested or journals
 confiscated. The daily Al-Rai Al-Aam was suspended for 1 day
 in February and 3 days in March 1988 for censorship
 violations, in the latter case for publishing a speech
 delivered by its editor critical of censorship. An estimated
 15 foreign journalists residing in Kuwait and associated with
 local newspapers were summarily deported in 1986, following
 the July decrees. There were no reports of deportations in
 1987 or 1988.
 Since the July 1986 decrees, senior government officials have
 held periodic meetings with Kuwait's chief editors. At a
 meeting in March, the Information Minister urged the editors
 to avoid sensationalism and warned that he would not hesitate
 to order the temporary closure of a newspaper for "something
 offending the homeland and its relations, or the security and
 stability of its citizens." By law, publishers lose their
 license, issued by the Information Ministry, if their
 publication does not appear for 6 months. On those topics not
 proscribed by censorship, the Kuwaiti press is vigorous and
 publishes a variety of opinions on numerous Middle East and
 international issues.
 
 
 1401
 KUWAIT
 Academic freedom is generally respected, within the same
 bounds that apply to the press. According to reliable
 unofficial reports, an academic was detained for several days
 in February 1988 by security forces, then released, following
 his publication abroad of a study perceived to be critical of
 the ruling family of another Gulf state.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Political parties are banned. Political activity finds some
 outlet in informal family-based social gatherings known as
 "diwaniyyas." The Constitution affirms the right to private
 assembly, public meetings, processions, and gatherings which
 are peaceful and not contrary to public morals. However, any
 group of more than three people desiring to meet for public
 discussion (or to meet privately, but to issue a public
 statement) must receive prior permission from the Ministry of
 Interior. The authorities may prevent such an assembly merely
 by ignoring the request.
 Professional groups, bar associations, and scientific bodies
 are permitted to establish international contacts without
 government interference. For a discussion of freedom of
 association as it applies to labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution declares that "freedom of belief is
 absolute," but must not "conflict with public policy or
 morals." Kuwait's state religion is Islam; the Shari'a
 (Islamic law) is, according to the Constitution, 'a main
 source of legislation." The ruling family and most of the
 prominent Kuwaiti families are Sunni Muslims. There is no
 overt official policy of discrimination against Shi'a Muslims,
 who constitute about 30 percent of Kuwait's population.
 However, Shi'as are less likely to be appointed to sensitive
 government positions. There are credible reports of Shi'a
 employees in the oil industry in 1987 losing their jobs or
 being denied promotion following the series of oil field
 bombings, attributed to Shia's. Kuwait has a tiny Arab
 Christian minority; there are a number of expatriate Christian
 congregations and churches. Expatriate practitioners of
 Eastern religions (e.g., Hindus, Sikhs, and Buddhists) not
 recognized by Islam are not allowed to establish places of
 worship but may worship privately in their homes.
 Proselytizing of Muslims by non-Muslims is prohibited.
 In recent years, pressure from Islamic groups has resulted in
 the National Assembly's barring the granting of
 citizenship to non-Muslims, prohibiting all importation of
 alcoholic beverages, and repeatedly attempting to establish
 Islamic law as the basis for all legal process. Assembly
 members also pressured, with some success, to separate the
 sexes in the classrooms and other facilities at "integrated"
 campuses of Kuwait University. The Government accommodated
 the National Assembly's demands for the application of some
 fundamentalist principles but blocked attempts in the Assembly
 tc apply Islamic law across the hoard. Commercial law, for
 example, is based on Western practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens generally are free to travel inside and outside the
 country, to emigrate, and to return. There is some
 
 
 1402
 KUWAIT
 restriction on foreign travel for young men who have not
 completed, or been exempted from, their compulsory military
 service. Those serving in the military must receive
 permission from the Defense Ministry before traveling abroad.
 Although there are no different legal standards regarding the
 internal or foreign travel or emigration of Kuwaiti women, in
 practice husbands can prevent their wives and minor children
 from leaving the country.
 There have been instances in which citizens' passports have
 been suspended temporarily. Generally, this has applied to
 criminal suspects. Representatives of societies,
 associations, and trade unions wishing to travel to and
 participate in international meetings must receive prior
 permission.
 Although the Constitution states that "no Kuwaiti may be
 deported from Kuwait or prevented from returning thereto,"
 some persons have been stripped of Kuwaiti citizenship and
 deported. In some cases, such action has been based on the
 voluntary acquisition by the individual of foreign
 citizenship. In other cases, individuals of Bedouin origin,
 with legitimate claims to citzenship in other states, who
 claimed Kuwaiti nationality in order to take advantage of
 various benefits accruing to citizens, lost their Kuwaiti
 citizenship. In September the press reported that the
 Government deprived 65 persons of their citizenship. One of
 these individuals lost his citizenship following an appearance
 before the State Security Court; the others reportedly had
 acquired their citizenship "on an unsound legal basis." In
 1987 an amendment to Kuwait's nationality law made it easier
 to withdraw citizenship from naturalized Kuwaitis for criminal
 activity.
 All non-Kuwaitis over the age of 21 residing in Kuwait must be
 sponsored by a Kuwaiti citizen. Kuwait does not extend
 permanent residence to its expatriate population, and 1987
 amendments to the alien residence law mandate stiffer
 penalties--fines and, in some cases, prison sentences--for
 expatriates who reside in Kuwait illegally or are not properly
 documented. Employers have the power to restrict both job
 mobility and the continued residence in Kuwait of their
 expatriate employees. Many expatriates (including some
 government employees) must surrender their travel documents to
 their employers, thus preventing them from leaving the country
 without the employer's consent. Those employed by government
 agencies are given residence visas which require an exit
 permit or "no objection" letter in order to leave the
 country. In accordance with the law, non-Kuwaitis convicted
 of crimes are rdutinely deported after serving their sentences.
 Illegal entrants to Kuwait are normally returned to their home
 countries. Exceptions have been made for those, mostly
 Iranians and Afghans, who are considered by the Government to
 be legitimate refugees. Some of these persons have been
 permitted to remain in Kuwait or have been sent to third
 countries. While most members of Kuwait's large Palestinian
 population have Jordanian passports, others are stateless and
 carry Lebanese or other Arab laissez-passers. In recent
 years, the Government has indicated that laissez-passer
 holders could stay even without sponsors. Palestinian youths
 over 21 years of age who travel or study outside Kuwait often
 have difficulty rejoining their families in Kuwait.
 
 
 1403
 KUWAIT
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Kuwait has no formal democratic institutions. Consequently,
 most of its citizens do not have a say in the choice of
 leaders or in changing the political system. The Al-Sabah
 have ruled Kuwait for over 200 years. The 1962 Constitution
 limited succession to descendants of Mubarak the Great, the
 ruler at the turn of this century. In practice, the ruler and
 senior family members choose the Crown Prince from either the
 Al-Jaber or the Al-Salim branch of the Al-Sabah. Under the
 Constitution this choice is confirmed by majority vote of the
 National Assembly. Executive power is vested in the ruler
 and, under him, in an appointed Council of Ministers,
 currently numbering 24, headed by the Crown Prince, who
 traditionally doubles as Prime Minister.
 At independence Kuwait inaugurated a National Assembly
 composed of 50 deputies elected by secret ballot, plus cabinet
 members sitting ex officio. The electoral law provides that
 candidates for the National Assembly be self-nominated, with
 multiple candidates permitted to compete for the 50 seats.' A
 "grandfather clause" effectively limits suffrage to adult
 males who resided in Kuwait before 1920 and maintained a
 residence there until 1959, and their adult male descendants.
 In 1986 the National Assembly approved an amendment to the
 1966 Nationality Law that delayed for 10 years, until 1996,
 the granting of voting rights to Kuwait's so-called "second
 category" citizens. The latter are certain long-time Arab and
 non-Arab residents who do not meet the "pre-1920"
 qualification. The Nationality Law was further amended in
 1987 to extend from 20 to 30 years the period that naturalized
 Kuwaitis must wait before acquiring the right to vote.
 Efforts since 1982 to gain suffrage for women have been
 unsuccessful. Distinctions made on the basis of parentage,
 length of residence, and gender appear to establish a limited
 class of citizenship which restricts participation in the
 political system.
 The dissolution of the National Assembly, decreed by the Amir
 in July 1986, remains in effect. The 1986 decrees also
 suspended various constitutional provisions, including article
 107, which specified that, within 2 months of the Assembly's
 dissolutlon, either special elections be held for a new
 Assembly or the dissolved one be reinstated. The Assembly was
 previously dissolved in 1976 and reinstated in 1981. In the
 Assembly's absence, the Amir rules by decrees having the force
 of law.
 The Assembly's 1986 dissolution represented a setback for
 citizens' political rights. Far from being a rubber stamp, it
 had served over the years as an important forum for the
 expression of diverse political views, some sharply at odds
 with those of the Government and not all serving the cause of
 civil and human rights.
 There are reports of former parliamentarians petitioning the
 Amir in 1987 and 1988 for the Assembly's restoration. In 1987
 the Government established an appointive consultative body,
 the Supreme Planning Council, and named to it members of the
 dissolved Assembly as well as Islamic religious leaders,
 government ministers, and other prominent personalities.
 Informal contacts between rulers and ruled are an important
 feature of the Kuwaiti political system. Traditionally, adult
 
 
 1404
 KUWAIT
 male Kuwaitis have had relatively easy access to their
 leaders, including the heads of the prominent merchant clans
 and the ruling family itself, through the system of
 "diwaniyyas," informal family-based discussion groups to which
 anyone can come and freely speak his mind. That custom has
 endured, as has the tradition that the Amir should govern in
 consultation with the other community leaders. Following the
 Assembly's dissolution in 1986, cabinet ministers instituted
 the practice of setting aside several hours a week to receive
 the public in their offices.
 While most male Kuwaiti citizens can participate directly or
 indirectly in the political process, noncitizens, who
 outnumber Kuwaitis by three to two, have no role. Kuwait has
 been reluctant to extend citizenship to those of non-Kuwaiti
 origin, with the exception of certain stateless Bedouin.
 Naturalization of even Kuwait-born persons is rare.
 Citizenship has been extended only to a few Palestinian
 families who made significant contributions to Kuwait before
 the early 1970's. The Government has established a committee
 to revise criteria for granting citizenship, but to date it
 has been without effect. Expatriates seldom engage in
 political activities for fear of exposing themselves to
 possible deportation.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has permitted visits by representatives of
 international human rights organizations. In its 1988 Report,
 Amnesty International (AI) cites discussions in 1987 with
 Kuwaiti officials on imprisonment of persons who may have been
 imprisoned for political reasons; on allegations of torture
 and death resulting from torture; and alleged cases of
 deportations to countries where deportees feared persecution.
 Despite promises from authorities to provide information, and
 subsequent AI correspondence, the organization reports that no
 substantive reply was received to any of its.communications.
 Some prominent Kuwaitis are members of international human
 rights organizations, such as the Arab Organization of Human
 Rights. There are no human rights groups in Kuwait, but the
 Government has an in-house council on human rights, composed
 of senior officials and working-level experts.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Kuwaiti women are allotted a subordinate role by statute and
 practice. Denied the vote, women are also limited by
 tradition from freely choosing their role in the society,
 though less so than in some other Islamic countries.
 Nevertheless, there are Kuwaiti women who are outspoken in
 their demand for a broader role in society. In contrast to
 the practice in some neighboring countries, a Kuwaiti woman is
 permitted to drive a car, may wear Western dress in public,
 and has legal access to higher education inside and outside
 the country. Women have the right to litigate against men
 (for example, in child custody suits). In recent years, more
 Kuwaiti women have joined the work force and compete for
 government and corporate employment. According to the latest
 census, in 1985, women account for approximately 19 percent of
 the total paid labor force in Kuwait. Some have reached
 
 
 1405
 KUWAIT
 senior government positions, up to the level of assistant
 under secretary and director general.
 Women are well represented in the field of education through
 university level. As yet, there are no female judges, but in
 1986 the Government named the first woman as a prosecutor.
 Kuwaiti women have also represented Kuwait in international
 financial meetings. There is no evidence of discrimination
 among citizens in the administration of Kuwait's extensive
 social welfare programs, designed to provide housing, family
 allowances, retirement income, medical care, education, and
 employment. Although some members of Kuwait's Shila minority
 perceive themselves to be largely excluded from leadership
 positions in the Government, many have achieved great wealth,
 and there.is no evidence that they are discriminated against
 in matters of social welfare. Foreign residents, who
 constitute about 58 percenE of the country's 1.8 million
 population, do not share in many of the rights and benefits
 Kuwaiti nationals enjoy. Ownership of commercial
 establishments (above 49 percent), real estate, and shares on
 the local stock market is open only to Kuwaitis.
 White-collar and skilled expatriate workers earn the same base
 pay as Kuwaitis, but receive less in frihge benefits.
 Benefits restricted to Kuwaiti citizens include higher
 government salaries, additional government stipends and social
 allowances, and, in general, retirement pensions. Resident
 expatriates are entitled to medical benefits. Public
 schooling is offered, with some exceptions, only to children
 of expatriates who arrived in Kuwait.prior to 1957, although
 the Government.subsidizes tuition for students in a number of
 Arabic-language elementary and secondary schools. Kuwaitis
 are given preference for admission to the University of
 Kuwait. Because of limited space for new enrollees,
 non-Kuwaiti university entrants may equal no more than 10
 percent of the number of Kuwaiti entrants. Unskilled
 expatriate workers usually are not permitted to bring their
 families to Kuwait. Some of these workers live in crowded
 apartments or work camps.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Kuwaiti workers have the right to establish and join unions.
 Kuwait's labor movement has about 27,000 members, organized
 into 13 unions. All but one of the 13, that of the bank
 workers, are affiliated with the Kuwait Federation of Trade
 Unions (KFTU). Expatriate workers, who comprise about 80
 percent of the roughly 700,000-strong labor force, are
 permitted to join unions after 5 years' residence but only as
 nonvoting members who cannot hold office. Kuwait labor law
 stipulates that, for any new union to be formed, it must
 include at least 100 Kuwaitis. Unions are independent
 organizations, free from government control. Unions must,
 however, follow a standard format for internal rules and
 constitutions which includes a prohibition on any involvement
 in political, sectarian, or religious issues.
 The vast majority of union members are Kuwaitis. The KFTU,
 grouping together nine civil service unions and three oil
 sector unions, is a member of the International Confederation
 of Arab Trade Unions (ICATU) as well as the Communist-
 dominated World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU). Both the
 KFTU and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor are.active
 
 
 1406
 KUWAIT
 in the International Labor Organization (ILO) and its regional
 counterpart, the Arab Labor Organization (ALO). The local ILO
 office was established in 1974 and provides the Government and
 unions with technical assistance in the areas of vocational
 education and manpower planning.
 The right to strike is recognized, but in recent years there
 have been few work stoppages, and in 1988 there were no
 reports of any at all. The tranquil labor/management
 relations stem in large part from a generous social welfare
 system, and the Government's willingness to provide
 employment for Kuwaitis in the public sector, which features
 one of the most liberal government retirement systems in the
 world.
 Kuwaiti labor law has a provision allowing for compulsory
 dissolution of any union that "commits an act considered to be
 violating the provisions of this law and of the laws connected
 with the preservation of public order and morals." Under the
 law, a union can only be dissolved by a court decision; such a
 court decision can be appealed. No unions have been dissolved
 in this manner.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Kuwaiti workers have the right to organize and bargain
 collectively. Union rights are incorporated in the labor law
 and generally respected in practice. Kuwait labor law
 provides for direct negotiations between employers and
 "laborers or their representatives." If an amicable agreement
 is not reached, the parties may petition the Ministry of Labor
 and Social Affairs for settlement. If no agreed solution is
 reached by this means, the dispute is referred to a Labor
 Arbitration Board composed of officials representing the High
 Court of Appeals, the Attorney General's Office, and the
 Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs. Union activity is
 concentrated in the government, banking, and oil sectors.
 While non-Kuwaiti workers do not enjoy the same union rights
 as Kuwaitis, there is little overt discontent among expatriate
 workers. There are several reasons for this: most
 expatriates are drawn to Kuwait by comparatively high wages;
 the Government will summarily deport any non-Kuwaiti deemed a
 troublemaker; and a non-Kuwaiti cannot remain in Kuwait
 without employer sponsorship. Union members have the right to
 elect representatives of their own choosing provided the
 candidates can obtain a "good conduct certificate" (absence of
 criminal record).
 There are no export processing zones in Kuwait.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Kuwaiti Constitution prohibits forced labor "except in
 cases specified by law for national emergency and with just
 remuneration," This prohibition appears to be generally
 respected.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age under Kuwait law is 18 years for full-time
 work and 14 years for part-time work. This law appears to be
 generally observed and enforced, particularly in urban areas,
 by both labor inspectors from the Ministry of Labor and Social
 Affairs and truant officers of the Ministry of Education.

 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 General conditions of work are established by Kuwaiti labor
 law for both the public and private sector, with the oil
 industry treated separately. The law limits the workweek to
 48 hours, provides for a minimum of 14 days' leave per year,
 and establishes a compensation schedule for industrial
 accidents. A 1979 ministerial decree created a permanent
 commission to coordinate activities in the field of public
 health and occupational safety. It has had some success in
 raising safety awareness and improving government coordination.
 Reflecting the importance of the petroleum industry in Kuwait,
 the law governing employment in this sector is more generous
 than the general laws. It provides for a 40-hour workweek,
 overtime pay for shift work, 30 days' annual leave, and a
 generous sick leave policy. Women are permitted to work,
 except in "dangerous industries and trades harmful to the
 health," and are promised "equal remuneration to that of a man
 provided she does the same work." There is no legal minimum
 wage, but this has little impact since Kuwait is not a
 low-wage country. By and large, employers appear to respect
 provisions of the labor law and provide suitable working
 conditions, although abuses occur in the treatment of
 unskilled foreign workers, particularly household maids and
 servants. There were credible reports that sizable groups of
 South Asian expatriate workers doing manual labor were not
 paid promised salaries in 1988, with similar reports of
 underpayment of salaries for servants.
