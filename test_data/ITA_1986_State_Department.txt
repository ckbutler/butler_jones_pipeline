 ITALY
 Italy is a democratic, multiparty republic with a
 parliamentary system of government. Legislative power is
 invested in the Parliament, which is directly and freely
 elected on the basis of universal adult suffrage. Executive
 authority is concentrated in the Council of Ministers. Italy
 has an independent judiciary. The Chief of State, the
 President, is elected by Parliament and representives of
 Italy's 20 regions.
 Terrorist violence of both the left and right has remained at
 low levels in recent years, due to the effective work of
 police and magistrates and its overwhelming rejection by the
 people as a whole. Although terrorism has yet to be
 completely overcome, its considerable reduction has freed
 increased law enforcement resources for the struggle against
 organized crime, which remains a serious problem.
 Italy has an industrialized market economy ranking among the
 top 10 in the world in gross national product. It is
 characterized by sizable government ownership in the primary
 industrial sectors and by a dynamic private sector, especially
 at the level of small and medium-sized companies.
 The drafters of Italy's post-World War II Constitution were
 strongly influenced by Roman Catholic and social democratic
 traditions. The Constitution contains guarantees of political
 and civil rights that are generally observed in practice.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 In 1986, there was one confirmed killing by an Italian
 terrorist organization, the Red Brigades. The victim was
 Lando Conti, former Mayor of Florence. A related group
 carried out a failed assassination attempt in which a member
 of the terrorist command was killed. The would-be victim was
 an economic adviser to the Prime Minister. Levels of
 terrorism have dropped in recent years. Italian terrorists of
 the far left now generally concentrate on sporadic attacks on
 persons associated with the defense establishment, NATO, and
 government economic policy.
 Various criminal investigations have yielded evidence that
 Middle Eastern groups involved in terrorism have been active
 in Italy, some possibly supported by governments in the area.
 However, the only confirmed attack of Middle Eastern origin
 involving Italy in 1986 occurred in April, when an explosive
 device killed four people on a TWA flight from Rome to
 Athens. It is unclear whether the bomb was brought aboard the
 airplane in Rome or at another point along its route.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no cases of disappearance linked to or condoned by
 the State or its agents. There were no kidnapings by
 political terrorist groups in 1986.

 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. Cruel and degrading punishment is forbidden by law
 and is not generally employed by officials. Law enforcement
 officers accused of breaking these rules have faced criminal
 charges. In its 1986 report covering 1985, Amnesty
 International reported the death in police custody of
 Salvatore Marinto and said it had information indicating the
 body showed signs of torture by the authorities. The
 Government subsequently arrested 18 officers for involvement
 in the death. Fourteen of the 18 were later released
 conditionally.
 Conditions of confinement vary, and some places of detention
 are outdated and crowded but not inhumane or degrading.
 Prisoners charged or convicted of terrorist acts are generally
 separated from other prisoners. Amnesty International in its
 1986 report stated that one prisoner held for 5 years in
 preventive detention and reportedly suffering ill health had
 been denied medical treatment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Police procedures in Italy are carefully circumscribed by law
 and judicial oversight. Arbitrary arrest is not practiced.
 Anyone detained by the authorities must be charged within 48
 hours, In normal criminal cases, the duration of pretrial
 detention permitted varies according to the gravity of the
 crime. Under reforms passed in 1984, the maximum that any
 person may be held in preventive detention, even for the most
 serious crimes, is 6 years, and no more than 2 years at each
 step of the trial and the long appeals process. Nevertheless,
 Amnesty International has complained about the excessive
 length of pretrial detention. As a safeguard against abuse,
 "Liberty Tribunals" are empowered to review evidence in cases
 of persons awaiting trial and to decide whether continued
 detention is warranted,
 There is no forced or compulsory labor. Exile as a form of
 punishment is unknown.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A fair trial is assured by law and observed in practice in
 almost all cases. Counsel is provided for the accused, free
 of charge if necessary. The judiciary is independent of the
 executive, and there are no political or security courts. All
 cases may be appealed to the highest appellate court, the
 Court of Cassation. There are no political prisoners.
 Considerable debate continued in 1986 over procedures which
 allow reduced sentences for confessed offenders willing to
 testify against associates and accomplices. The system was
 used effectively to combat terrorism and is now being employed
 against organized crime.
 Although there is no evidence of a systematic abuse of the
 procedure by authorities, a series of highly publicized
 acquittals on appeal in 1986 brought increased criticism of
 magistrates for overreliance on it. Critics maintain that
 such plea-bargaining allows too much latitude to individual
 magistrates, who may be tempted to make an arrest before
 
 
 961
 ITALY
 obtaining evidence to corroborate testimony by plea-bargainers
 (which may not always be reliable--particularly in organized
 crime investigations). It is also claimed that the procedures
 violate the principle of equal penalties for equal crimes.
 A number of political parties and private organizations have
 banded together to promote a series of national referendums on
 judicial reform which are scheduled to be held in 1987. If
 passed, they would bring major changes in Italian court
 procedures and rules, as well as in the use of preventive
 detention. Tho Government is also studying proposals for
 judicial reform which, if passed in the meantime, could render
 some, if not all, of these referendums unnecessary.
 Amnesty International has complained that, in one case in
 1985, two defendants were charged with crimes for which they
 had already been tried.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The concept of the privacy of the home is legally safeguarded
 and respected by the authorities. Searches and electronic
 monitoring may be carried out only under judicial warrant and
 in carefully defined circumstances.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Free speech and a free press are assured under Italy's
 democratic political system, which allows full expression of a
 wide spectrum of political views. Although there is no
 censorship, publications may be seized for violations of
 obscenity laws or for defamation of state institutions. These
 powers are seldom invoked. Government-run radio and
 television are politicized at the administrative level but are
 open to widely differing views. A large number of private
 broadcasters air vigorous debate on political and social
 issues.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Italian citizens' right of free assembly is limited only in
 cases where national security or public safety is endangered.
 Trade unions are not government controlled, and their right to
 organize, engage in collective bargaining, and strike are
 fully protected by the Constitution. They associate with
 international labor bodies freely and without interference.
 According to Government figures, about 40 percent of the work
 force is organized. Professional and employer associations
 also organize and represent their constituencies freely.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Italy's relations with the Roman Catholic Church are governed
 by a 1984 agreement (Concordat) between the Italian Government
 and the Holy See, ratified in 1985. The new agreement,
 replacing the Concordat of 1929, recognizes the rights and
 place of the Church but no longer accords it the status of a
 state religion. The Roman Catholic Church continues
 informally to enjoy special standing in Italy because of the
 presence of the Vatican and because the overwhelming majority
 
 
 962
 ITALY
 of Italians are at least nominally Roman Catholic.
 Nevertheless, persons are free to profess and practice any
 religious faith. All religions are free to organize and
 proselytize within the limits imposed by the laws governing
 public order. The Government has reached agreements with some
 other religious groups to define their rights and standing.
 Roman Catholic religious instruction is offered in public
 schools as an optional subject.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Italian citizens may travel freely both within the country and
 abroad. Emigration is unrestricted. Citizens who leave are
 guaranteed the right to return, and the Constitution forbids
 deprivation of citizenship for political reasons. Italy has
 been a haven for many persons fleeing persecution in other
 countries. There were no cases of forced repatriation of
 political refugees in 1986.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Italy is ruled democratically under its free parliamentary
 system. Although the Constitution outlaws the Fascist party,
 a wide range of organized and active political parties exists
 from the far left of the political spectrum to the far right.
 Election campaigns are free and open, and voting is by secret
 ballot. The two chambers of Parliament and regional,
 provincial, and municipal councils are elected at regular
 intervals. Opposition groups are active and are frequently
 able to alter or reject government policies. The regions of
 Trentino-Alto Adige and Val D'Aosta are organized under
 special statutes aimed at safeguarding the rights of their
 respective German- and French-speaking minorities.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Italian Government and nongovernmental human rights
 organizations support human rights around the world. Italy
 participates fully in various international human rights
 organizations. Political parties and religious groups
 participate in activities related to human rights.
 Organizations active in human rights affairs include Amnesty
 International, the Official Interministerial Committee for the
 Rights of Man, the Institute of Humanitarian Law, and Caritas
 International.
 Nongovernmental organizations are free to investigate
 conditions in Italy, attend trials, and publish their
 findings. For example, in 1986 a number of suicides among
 recently conscripted army recruits drew widespread attention
 to the basic training system and to the traditional hazing of
 newcomers by more senior recruits. In addition to the Defense
 Ministry's official investigations, political parties,
 newspapers, and private organizations (including pacifist
 organizations) have examined and reported on the issue in
 detail. Statistics indicate that the suicide rate among
 Italian recruits is lower than in other NATO conscript
 armies. However, some of these reports have been critical of
 the armed forces. A wide range of proposals, both official
 
 
 963
 ITALY
 and nongovernmental, have been made for the improvement of
 conscription, training, and barracks regimen.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Food, shelter, health care, and education are available to all
 inhabitants regardless of race, religion, sex, ethnic
 background, or political opinion.
 Women generally have equal status under the law and
 participate freely in social and political life, though they
 are underrepresented in the professions and management and
 continue to work to expand their role. There are legal
 limitations on women's property rights in marriage which
 derive from traditional social practices.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Minimum work and safety standards are established by law and
 buttressed and extended in collective labor contracts. The
 basic law of 1923 provides for a maximum work week of 48
 hours--no more than 6 days per week and 8 hours per day. The
 8-hour day may be exceeded for some special categories. Most
 collective labor agreements provide for a 36- to 38-hour
 week. Overtime may not exceed 2 hours per day or an average
 of 12 hours per week.
 There is no minimum wage set under Italian law; basic wages
 and salaries are set forth in collective labor agreements.
 National collective labor agreements set forth minimum
 standards to which individual employment agreements must
 conform. In the absence of agreement between the parties, the
 courts may step in to determine fair wages on the basis of
 practice in related activities or related collective
 agreements.
 Basic health and safety standards and guidelines for
 compensation for on-the-job injury are set forth in an
 extensive body of law and regulations. In most cases, these
 standards are exceeded in collective bargaining agreements.
 Under current legislation, no child under 15 years of age may
 be employed (with some specified exceptions). The Ministry of
 Labor, having consulted with the labor organizations, may
 exceptionally authorize the employment on specific jobs of
 children over 12 years of age. The minimum age is 15 for men
 employed in dangerous, fatiguing, and unsanitary work; 16 for
 men employed: underground; in quarries, mines, and tunnels
 without mechanical vehicles; in weight lifting and carrying;
 in loading and unloading sulphur ovens in Sicily; and in
 occupations harmful to the workers' morale. No worker under
 18 years may be employed in driving and pulling trucks and
 carriages, or in jobs for the manufacture, handling, and
 salvaging of explosives. No women, regardless of age, are
 permitted to be employed underground, in quarries, mines, or
 tunnels. Only women over 21 are allowed to work on dangerous,
 fatiguing, and unsanitary jobs, on the cleaning and servicing
 of engines, or on moving machinery.
