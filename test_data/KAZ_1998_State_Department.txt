KAZAKHSTAN
 The Constitution of Kazakhstan concentrates power-in-the presidency. President
 Nursultan Nazarbayev is the-dominant political figure. The Constitution, adopted
 in 1995 in a referendum marred by irregularities, permits the President to legislate
 by decree and dominate the legislature and judiciary; it cannot be changed or
 amended without the Presidents consent. President Nazarbayev was elected to a
 new 7-year term on January 10, 1999 in an election that fell far short of inter-
 national standards. Previous presidential elections originally scheduled for 1996 did
 not take place, as President Nazarbayev's term in office was extended in a separate
 1995 referendum, also marred by irregularities. Under the 1995 Constitution, Par-
 liament's powers are more limited than previously. However, members of Par-
 iaient have the right to introduce legislation and some bills introduced by Par-
 liament have become laws. The judiciary remained under the control of the Presi-
 dent and the executive branch. The lack of an independent judiciary made it dif-
 ficult to root out corruption, which was pervasive throughout the Government.
 The Committee for national Secity (the KNB, successor to the KGB) is respon-
 sible for national security, law enforcement activities on the national level, and
 counterintelligence. An external intelligence service, Barlau (thee Kazakh word for
 intelligence) was created in 1997, but during the year, Barlau's functions were reab-
 sorbed into the KNB. The KNB reports directly to the President. The Ministry of
 Internal Affairs, which is subordinate to the KNB, supervises the criminal police,
 who are poorly paid and widely believed to be corrupt. The KN  continued efforts
 to improve its public image by focusing on fighting government corruption, religious
 extremism, terrorism, and organized crime. Members of the security forces commit-
 ted human rights abuses.
 Kazakhstan is rich in natural resources, chiefly petroleum and minerals. The Gov-
 ernment has made significant progress toward a market-based economy since inde-
 peence. After a 5-year decline, overall production began to rise in 1996, although
 the rate of growth slowed in 1998. The Government has been successful in stabiliz-
 ing the local currency (tenge) and? reducing inflation to less than 10 percent a year.
 The average annual wage was approximately $1,500. The agricultural sector has
 been slow to privatize. The Government has privatized successfully small and me-
 dium-sized firms and most large-scale industrial complexes. However, living stand-
 
 
 1322
 ards for the majority of the population continue to decline. According to several sur-
 veys, in 1997 approximately 33 percent of citizens lived below the government-de-
 fined poverty line of $50 per month.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens in some
 areas, but serious problems remain in others. Democratic institutions are weak. The
 Government infringed on citizens' right to change their government, notably in its
 flawed conduct of preparations for the January 1999 presidential election. The Orga-
 nization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) publicly cited flawed elec-
 tion preparations in declining the Government's request for election observers. The
 -Government used a new amendment to the presidential decree on elections to pro-
 hibit some government opponents from running in the election because they were
 found guilty of participating in unauthorized public meetings-and demonstrations.
 The Government repeatedly harassed its opponents during the election campaign
 and appeared complicit in at least four assaults on perceived opponents.
 The legal structure, including the Constitution adopted in -1995, does not fully
 safeguard human rights. Members of the security forces often beat or otherwise
 abused detainees, and prison conditions remained harsh. There were allegations of
 arbitrary arrest and detention, and prolonged detention is a problem. The judiciary
 remains under the control of the President and the executive branch, and corruption
 is deeply rooted. A political prisoner, Labor Movement-leader Madel Ismailov, was
 sentenced to I year in prison for insulting the President. The Government infringed
 .on citizens' rights to privacy.
 Government tolerance of the independent media markedly deteriorated, as some
 opposition newspapers and other media outlets were ordered to close, forced to sell
 to progovernment interests, or brought under pressure by regulatory authorities.
 The Government reportedly pressured media not to cover the opposition during the
 presidential campaign. The media practiced self-censorship and the Government
 maintained control of most printing presses and facilities. Academic freedom is not
 respected. Freedom of assembly sometimes was restricted. Some organizers of
 unsanctioned demonstrations were arrested and fined or imprisoned. Freedom of as-
 sociation, while generally respected, sometimes was hindered by complicated and
 controversial registration requirements that restrict this right for organizations and
 political parties. Domestic violence against women remained a problem. There was
 discrimination against women, the disabled, and ethnic minorities. The Government
 discriminated in favor of ethnic Kazakhs. The Government limited worker rights;
 it tried to limit the influence of independent trade unions, both directly and through
 its support for state-sponsored unions, and members of independent trade unions
 were harassed. The courts removed the legal status of two independent unions in
 Kentau for holding unauthorized demonstrations to protest unpaid wages.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings.
 There were a number of deaths due to brutal hazing and mistreatment in the
 army (see Section 1.c.).
 Villagers in Podgornaya alleged that Interior Ministry militiamen had badly beat-
 en Yalkynzhan Yakupov, a suspected thief, whose body was found hanging in the
 Chunja District police station (see Section 1.c.).
 There have been no arrests or known government investigation in the case of the
 young man killed while in detention in Almaty in January 1997.
 The Interior Ministry. reported in September that 1,290 prisoners, or more than
 1 percent of all prisoners, had died since the beginning of the year of disease, mostly
 tuberculosis, aggravated by harsh prison conditions and inadequate medical treat-
 ment (see Section l.c.). Estimates by human rights monitors are not substantially
 different from government figures.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution states that "no one must be subject to torture, violence or other
 treatment and punishment that is cruel or humiliating to human dignity;" however,
 there were credible reports that police beat or treated detainees abusively to obtain
 confessions. Human rights observers report that detainees sometimes are choked,
 handcuffed to radiators, or have plastic bags placed over their heads to force them
 to divulge information. Training standards for police are very low and individual
 law enforcement officials often are supervised poorly. According to television reports
 in November, villagers in Podgornaya near.the Chinese border alleged that Interior
 Ministry militiamen had beaten badly Yalkynzhan Yakupov, a suspected cattle thief
 
 
 1323
 whose body was found hanging in the Chunja District police station. A man arrested
 with Yukupov, Renat Yemelyanov, reportedly suffered kidney damage from police
 beatings. The International Human Rights Bureau reported that an official medical
 investigation concluded that a man detained by Interior Ministry militiamen in May
 in Almaty suffered hemorrhages and other injuries as a result of blows from a blunt
 object while in custody. An independent television station reported that a disabled
 man detained by Almaty police in March was beaten with an iron object while hand-
 cuffed.
 On August 29, Amirzhan Kosanov, the press secretary to former prime minister
 and presidential contender Akezhan Kazhegeldin, was robbed and beaten by four
 masked assailants as he and his wife approached their home in Astana. Human
 rights observers contended that the attack probably was motivated politically be-
 cause the assailants were masked and asked the victim whether his name was
 Kosanov before they attacked him. On October 24, an unknown assailant beat
 Yelena Nikitenko, a public relations adviser to Kazhegeldin's presidential campaign,
 outside her apartment in Almaty. She suffered a broken nose and other injuries.
 The assault came at the end of a week in which she was forced to resign from the
 A1-Farabi National University faculty for "unpatriotic" activities and interrogated by
 the tax police about her political consulting business. A private course on political
 consulting organized by Nikitenko might have provoked these actions against her.
 The course ended prematurely as a result of the attack. The attack appeared politi-
 cally motivated and government sanctioned (see Section 3). On December 8, two as-
 sailants beat German journalist Minette von Krosigt and a Kazakhstani colleague,
 shortly after they returned to Almaty from a reporting trip to Semipalatinsk and
 Kurchatov. The assailants took von Krosigt's camera equipment and film. The at-
 tack might have been motivated politically because von Krosigt's earlier reporting
 had been critical of the Government, but the evidence is inconclusive (see Section
 2.a.). On December 22, three assailants beat a Kazakhstani employee of a foreign
 embassy in Almaty outside his apartment. The employee, whose work included as-
 sisting embassy officers to maintain contacts with political opposition and human
 rights figures, suffered a cracked rib and some internal injuries, and required stitch-
 es around both eyes to close wounds from blows to his face and head. The attack
 appeared to be motivated politically (see Section 3).
 On October 13, former Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin reported that two
 gunshots were fired at him as he was riding a horse on the outskirts of Almaty.
 The shooting came on the eve of Kazhegeldin's formal announcement of his inten-
 tion to run against President Nazarbayev in the January 1999 presidential elec-
 tions. Kazhegeldin believes that the shots were intended to scare him, but not to
 harm him. A few days before the shooting, the Government withdrew the business
 license and seized the weapons of the private security company that protected
 Kazhegeldin.
 Victor Mikhailov, chairman of the "Lad" Slavic movement of Kazakhstan, was at-
 tacked and beaten by an unknown assailant on November 6. Human rights observ-
 ers believe that the attack was politically motivated because the attacker did not
 try to rob Mikhailov. The attack followed Mikhailov's strong criticism of President
 Nzarbayev at an October 31 Lad meeting and Lad's public announcement that it
 would not support Nazarbayev in the upcoming presidential election. On November
 8, Lad's accountant, Natalya Zubenko, was beaten and robbed as well.
 Opposition leader Madel Ismailov alleged that following his arrest in June 1997
 for organizing an unauthorized demonstration against the Government, he was
 forced to stand for hours and deprived of sleep. Ismailov was sentenced to 9 months
 of "corrective labor" accompanied by garnishment of 15 percent of his wages. He is
 currently serving a sentence of I year in prison for insulting the President. In De-
 cember 1997, four assailants beat Petr Svoik, one of leaders of the political opposi-
 tion movement Azamat, at his hotel in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. Despite a request by
 President Nazarbayev for a cooperative investigation with Kyrgyz authorities there
 has been no apparent investigation and no arrests have been made.
 Army personnel subjected conscripts to brutal hazing, including beatings and
 verbal abuse. The Deputy Chief of the General Staff reported 17 cases of death due
 to mistreatment as of May 20, a 50 percent decline over the same period in 1997.
 Reportedly the Government has taken action occasionally against officials charged
 with abuses, levying administrative sanctions such as fines for those found guilty.
 The Army launched an aggressive campaign to punish violators of a new antihazing
 policy, but at year's end there were no specific details on the results of the program.
 Prison conditions remained harsh due to inadequate resources. The Interior Min-
 istry Chief of Prisons reported that his Department received from the national budg-
 et only 19 cents (15 tenge) out of the $1.62 (130 tenge) needed to cover daily ex-
 penses for each prisoner. The Minister of Interior requested $142.5 million (11.4 bil-
 
 
 1324
 lion tenge) to maintain the prison system,-but only $58.7 million (4.7 billion tenge)
 was allocated by the Government. However, the Government faced a large budget
 deficit and planned to cut the allocation by 30 percent. In September the Ministry
 of Interior reported that there were 87,000 prisoners (including 27,000 in halfway
 houses) and another 15,000 detainees in facilities designed to hold 60,000. Local
 human rights observers agreed with these figures. In July and August, a prisoners'
 rights activist and state television reported that approximately 70 prisoners at-
 tempted suicide by cutting open their stomachs and slitting their throats and veins
 to protest mistreatment at the Shangis Tobe prison in the East Kazakhstan oblast.
 Three senior officials of the prison were fired. There were no reports of action by
 the Government at the maximum security prison in Aktyubinsk where 10 prisoners
 reportedly cut open their stomachs in October 1997 to protest administrative regula-
 tions and prison conditions.
 Overcrowding, inadequate prison diet, and a lack of medical supplies and person-
 nel contributed to the spread of tuberculosis and other major diseases. In September
 the Chief of Prisons reported that 1,290 prisoners had died since the beginning of
 the year of disease, including 962 from tuberculosis. These figures represented an
 improvement over the same period in 1997, when 1,491 prisoners died of disease,
 1,034 from tuberculosis. The official Russian-language newspaper reported in Sep-
 tember that 12,600 prisoners suffered from tuberculosis or nearly 15 percent of all
 prisoners. The Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and the Rule
 of Law (IBHR) estimated that 17,000 prisoners suffer from tuberculosis and other
 major illnesses. In July the IBHR visited a prison near Pavlodar, where it reported
 that 1,200 of 1,350 prisoners suffered from tuberculosis. In 1997 the Government
 also acknowledged that AIDS is becoming a concern. Prison guards, who are poorly
 paid, steal food and medicines intended for prisoners. Violent crime among prisoners
 is common.
 The General Prosecutor's Office reported that there were no amnesties in 1997 or
 1998. In the past, the Government has used mass amnesties to reduce prison over-
 crowding. However, the Ministry-of Internal Affairs reported that through August
 6,434 persons were released from prison under.provisions of the new Criminal Code
 that allow retroactive- application of new sentencing guidelines favorable to pris-
 oners.
 I Prisoners are allowed one 4-hour visit every 3 months, but additional visits may
 be granted in emergency situations. Some prisoners are eligible for 3-day visits with
 close relatives once every 6 months. Juveniles are kept in-separate facilities.
 Human rights monitors wishing to visit prisons must receive authorization from
 the MVD. The Government was reluctant to work with local human-rights groups
 to improve prison conditions and created obstacles for those who requested access
 to prisons. One activist for prisoners' rights complained that she sometimes was de-
 nied access to prisons. The IBHR, however, reported that its representatives regu-
 larly received authorization. The IBHR visited men's prisons in addition to women's
 and juveniles' prisons during the year. Two international NGO's, the Dutch inter-
 church Aid, and Penal Reform International, accompanied IBHR on prison visits in
 Pavlodar.
 d.-Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Government used minor infractions
 of the law, frequently related to unsanctioned assembly, or manufactured charges
 to arrest and detain government opponents arbitrarily. Under a May amendment
 to the presidential decree ,that serves as the election law, convictions on such
 charges allowed the Government to exclude government opponents from running for
 president or other public office (see Section 3). In October, less than a week after
 the Government called for early presidential elections, an Almaty court summoned
 five leading government opponents with less than 24-hour notice on charges of par-
 ticipating in a meeting of an unregistered organization called For Fair Elections. All
 five-Akezhan Kazhegeldin, Dos Kushim, Irina Savostina, Petr Svoik, and Mels
 Yeleusizov-were convicted. Svoik and Yeleusizov served 3-day jail sentences. The
 others paid fines. On September 18, police in the new capital, Astana, arrested Mi-
 khail Vasilenko, an advisor to former prime minister and presidential contender
 Kazhegeldin, as he delivered documents proposing constitutional and election law
 reforms at Parliament and government offices. The next day Vasilenko was con-
 victed of hooliganism for allegedly refusing to leave the Parliament building when
 asked by guards, and using foul language with the guards. (Although the new
 Criminal Code eliminated the old Soviet criminal offense of hooliganism, Vasilenko
 was convicted under the Administrative Code, which still contains provisions
 against hooliganism.) He was released 2 days after the conviction (see Section I.e.).
 In February following a meeting of the Popular Front. opposition movement, Almaty
 police arrested Labor Movement leader Madel Ismailov in connection with charges
 that he insulted President Nazarbayev during-a November 1997 political rally (see
 
 
 1325
 Section i.e.). Labor Movement activist Yuriy Vinkov was arrested at the same time
 for interfering with law enforcement officials as they arrested Ismailov. Vinkov's
 case was dismissed in September after he fled to Russia. In June the director of the
 Almaty office of Kazakhstan 1 television and radio corporation, Yermek Torsynov,
 was detained by KNB officers for allegedly misappropriating corporate funds. The
 detention followed a press conference at which Torsynov had accused the president
 of the corporation of embezzling the station's advertising revenue. Torsynov was re-
 leased the next day following a protest by the IBHR, which alleged that the charges
 were baseless. Authorities filed no charges against Torsynov, who nevertheless lost
 his job (see Section 2.a.). Two youths were detained for 5 months prior to their trial
 for spraying antipresidential graffiti on a building (see Section 2.a.). The Govern-
 ment also arbitrarily arrested, detained, fined, and sometimes imprisoned dem-
 onstrators (see Section 2.b.).
 The February 1997 arrest of Leonid Solomin for currency law violations was dis-
 missed in September 1997.
 The law sanctions pretrial detention. According to the Constitution, police may
 hold a detainee for 72 hours before bringing charges. The new Criminal Code (in
 effect since January) allows continued detention for up to 12 months with the ap-
 proval of the General Prosecutor of the Republic. Lower-ranking prosecutors may
 approve interim extensions of detention. The General Prosecutor's office acknowl-
 edged that some cases do not come to trial within prescribed limits, but stated that
 they are rare. However, in practice police routinely hold detainees, with the sanction
 of a prosecutor, for weeks or even months without bringing charges, and prolonged
 detention is a serious problem. Additionally, short (3-hour) and long (72-hour) deten-
 tions for "suspicion" are used widely.
 According to the General Prosecutor's office, a system of bail created in 1997 is
 not widely used. No statistics were available.
 According to the Constitution, every person detained, arrested, or accused of com-
 mitting a crime has the right to the assistance of a defense lawyer from the moment
 of detention, arrest, or accusation. This right generally is respected in practice.
 However, Mikhail Vasilenko (see Section i.e.) reported that he was denied access
 to a lawyer during his detention and trial. Human rights activists allege that mem-
 bers of the security forces have pressured prisoners to refuse the assistance of an
 attorney, sometimes resulting in a delay before the accused sees a lawyer. Detainees
 may also appeal the legality of detention or arrest to the prosecutor before trial, but
 in practice most persons refrain from making an appeal from fear that they will be
 punished for doing so. If the defendant cannot afford an attorney, the Constitution
 provides that the State must provide one free of charge. Human rights organizations
 allege that many prisoners are unaware of this provision of the law. Although some
 lawyers are reluctant to defend clients unpopular with the Government, there were
 no reports of attorneys being sanctioned by the Government for their decisions to
 defend particular clients.
 The Constitution prohibits forced exile, and the Government does not use it.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Government interference and pressure com-
 promised the court system's independence throughout the year-a situation codified
 in the Constitution's establishment of a judiciary fully under the control of the
 President and the executive branch.
 There are three levels in the court system: local; oblast (provincial); and the Su-
 preme Court. According to the Constitution, the President proposes to the upper
 house of Parliament (the Senate) nominees for the Supreme Court. (Nominees are
 recommended by the Supreme Judicial Council, a body chaired by the President,
 which includes the chairperson of the Constitutional Council, the chairperson of the
 Supreme Court, the Prosecutor General, the Minister of Justice, senators, judges,
 and other persons appointed by the President). The President appoints oblast judges
 (nominated by the Supreme Judicial Council) and local level judges from a list pre-
 sented by the Ministry of Justice. The list is based on recommendations from the
 Qualification Collegium of Justice, an institution made up of deputies from the
 lower house of Parliament (the Majilis), judges, public prosecutors, and others ap-
 pointed by the President.
 According to legislation passed in December 1996, judges are appointed for life,
 although in practice this means until mandatory retirement at age 65. The 1995
 Constitution abolished the Constitutional Court and established a Constitutional
 Council. The President directly appoints three of its seven members, including the
 chairman. The Council rules on election and referendum challenges, interprets the
 Constitution, and determines the constitutionality of laws adopted by Parliament.
 Under the Constitution, citizens no longer have the right to appeal directly to a
 court about the constitutionality of a government action; this appeal is now the sole
 prerogative of the courts. The Constitution states that "if a court finds that a law
 
 
 1326
 or other regulatory legal act subject to application undermined the rights and lib-
 erties of an individual and a citizen, it shall suspend legal proceedings and address
 the Constitutional Council with a proposal to declare the law unconstitutional."
 However, it does not grant citizens the right to approach the courts on a constitu-
 tional issue.
 Local courts try less serious crimes, such as petty theft and vandalism. Oblast
 courts handle more serious crimes, such as murder, grand theft, and organized
 criminal activities. The oblast courts also may handle cases in rural areas where
 no local courts are. organized. Judgments of the local courts may be appealed to the
 oblast-level courts, while those of the oblast courts may be appealed to the Supreme
 Court. There is also a military court. Although they do not currently exist, special-
 ized and extraordinary courts also can be created-for example, economic, taxation,
 family, juvenile, and administrative courts-which would have the status of oblast
 and local courts.
 The Constitution and the law establish the necessary procedures for a fair trial.
 Trials are public, with the exception of instances in which an open hearing could
 result in state secrets being divulged, or when the private life or personal family
 concerns of a citizen must be protected.
 According to the Constitution, defendants have the right to be present, the right
 to counsel (at public expense if needed), and the right to be heard in court and call
 witnesses for the defense. Defendants enjoy a presumption of innocence, are pro-
 tected from self-incrimination, and have the right to appeal a decision to a higher
 court. Legal proceedings are to be conducted in the state language, Kazakh, al-
 though Russian also may be used officially in the courts. Proceedings also may be
 held in the language of the majority of the population in a particular area.
 In most cases, these rights are respected. Cases involving government opponents,
 however, frequently are closed. Courthouse guards did not allow the public to ob-
 serve the October 15 trial of five government opponents on charges of attending a
 meeting of an unregistered organization (see Section I.d.). The trial in March and
 April of Labor Movement leader Madel Ismailov for insulting the honor and dignity
 of the President was closed to the public and press. Mikhail Vasilenko (see Section
 1.d.) reported that his September trial for hooliganism was held in secret and that
 he was not given access to a lawyer, allowed to call witnesses in his defense, or to
 hear and cross-examine witnesses against him.
 The problem of corruption is evident at every stage and level of the judicial proc-
 ess. Judges are poorly paid; the Government has not made a vigorous effort to root
 out corruption in the judiciary. According to press reports, judicial positions can be
 purchased. Anecdotal evidence stemming from individual cases suggests that judges
 solicit bribes from participants in trials and rule accordingly.
 In May 1996, the Government instituted a procedure that required recertification
 of all judges. Completed this year, the process was intended to ensure that judges
 are familiar with current law. The recertification resulted in a significant turnover
 of personnel, particularly at the lower levels. Although the recertification process
 addressed a legitimate need to improve judicial competence, it was used in some
 cases by local governments to remove individual judges for political reasons.
 A new Criminal Code took effect on January 1. Although human rights organiza-
 tions considered the new criminal code a step forward, they raised a number of con-
 cerns regarding the code's effect on individual political and civic rights. The new
 code extends the maximum term of imprisonment from 15 to 30 years and gives
 judges and law enforcement officials more flexibility in determining appropriate
 charges. Previously, after a certain number of civil code violations, a defendant auto-
 matically would be charged with a criminal offense. The new code also eliminated
 a number of legal holdovers from the Soviet period, including public condemnation
 as a punishment, enforcement of restrictive passport regulations, and prosecution
 for vagrancy or a parasitic way of life.
 There was one political prisoner. In April an Almaty district court sentenced
 Workers Movement leader Madel Ismailov to 1 year's imprisonment for insulting
 the honor and dignity of President Nazarbayev, a constitutional offense, during a
 November 1997 political rally in Almaty. Ismailov reportedly called President
 Nazarbayev "a scoundrel." Ismailov was convicted of the most serious form of insult-
 ing-using the mass-media to insult the honor and dignity of the President-be-
 cause an independent television station had recorded Ismaiov's offending remark.
 In June the conviction was upheld on appeal by an Almaty court. Ismailov, a resi-
 dent of Almaty, was sent to serve his sentence in a prison in the North Kazakhstan
 oblast. In an appeal to the General Prosecutor that remains pending at year's end,
 lawyers for Ismailov contended that his imprisonment in the North Kazakhstan ob-
 last violated the Criminal Executive Code, which stipulates that "Persons sentenced
 
 
 1327
 
 to imprisonment should serve out their terms in prisons located on the territory of
 the oblast where they lived before their arrest or where they were sentenced."
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Despite
 constitutional protections, the Government infringed on these rights. The Constitu-
 tion provides that citizens have the right to "confidentiality of personal deposits and
 savings, correspondence, telephone conversations, postal, telegraph and other mes-
 sages." Limitation of this right is allowed "only in cases and according to procedures
 directly established by law." However, the KNB and Ministry of Internal Affairs,
 with the concurrence of the General Prosecutor's office, can and do arbitrarily inter-
 fere with privacy, family, home, and correspondence. The law requires the police,
 who remain part of the internal security structure, to obtain a search warrant from
 a prosecutor before conducting a search, but they sometimes search without a war-
 rant. The KNB has the right to monitor telephone calls and mail, but under the law
 it must inform the General Prosecutor's office within 24 hours of such activity. Some
 human rights observers complained that the Government monitored their move-
 ments and telephone calls (see Section 4.)
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution and the 1991 Press and Media
 law provide for freedom of the press, but the Government closed or otherwise har-
 assed much of the independent media. A new law on national security passed in
 June gave the General Prosecutor of the Republic the authority to suspend the ac-
 tivity of news media that undermine national security. Following the government
 decision in October to call early presidential elections, many members of the inde-
 pendent media reported government pressure not to cover opposition candidates. In
 late April, the General Prosecutor publicly charged that 10 newspapers violated the
 Press and Media Law, although the Minister of Information publicly opposed the ac-
 tion and none of the cases came to trial. The Government continued to own and con-
 trol most printing and distribution facilities and to subsidize periodicals, including
 many that supposedly were independent. The potential for government control and
 widespread belief that the Government was cracking down on independent media
 resulted in widespread media self-censorship. The key subject considered "off limits"
 by journalists was personal criticism of the President and his family. The press gen-
 erally was permitted to criticize government decisions, official corruption, and the
 powerlessness of the Parliament.
 In September the Ministry of Justice issued an order revoking the legal registra-
 tion of the Russian-language opposition newspaper Twenty-First Century (XXI Vek).
 The official notice delivered to the publisher gave no reason for the revocation. The
 notice arrived 2 days after an unknown person tossed a firebomb into the news-
 paper's office. The day before the firebombing, Twenty-First Century had published
 extensive coverage of the arrest of Milhail Vasilenko, an advisor to former prime
 minister Kazhegeldin (see Section 1.d.). Ministry of Justice officials subsequently no-
 tified Twenty-First Century that they would take no immediate action to enforce the
 order closing down the newspaper, which continued to publish at year's end al-
 though the order revoking its registration has not been withdrawn.
 In July tax police raided the offices of the only national Kazakh-language opposi-
 tion newspaper, Dat. ("Dat" is a Kazakh language expression used after interrup-
 tions to mean, "let me speak"). Tax police allegations of financial irregularities
 against Dat did not appear credible. According to a press release issued by Dat, tax
 agents acting without a required warrant seized the newspaper's computers,
 records, and payroll money. The press release suggested that the newspaper closed
 because it regularly published articles exposing government corruption and criti-
 cized the President and his family.
 On November 4, Dat was raided again by the customs police and the Internal Af-
 fairs Police (MVD), who seized all copies of the current week's edition as well as
 leftover previous editions. The pretext for the raid was that the paper allegedly had
 failed to file a customs declaration for the current issue when it was brought from
 Russia. When the editor-in-chief produced the customs declaration later that day,
 the MVD changed its tactics. It charged that since the newspaper had not paid a
 $500,000 (35 million tenge) civil judgment for "publication of false information"
 about the President of the state television station KAZ-1, it was authorized to seize
 all available copies of the newspaper and other newspaper assets. The court report-
 edly levied 5 million of the 35 million tenge judgment against the editor-in-chief per-
 sonally. As a result, on October 22 the tax police and militia sealed his apartment
 and impounded his personal property until his portion of the civil judgment was
 paid. Dat filed an appeal to revoke the judgment. On December 3, a court ordered
 Dat to close following the newspaper's failure to pay its fine. The judgment was
 issued in favor of the President of the Kazakhstan 1 Television and Radio Corpora-
 
 
 1328
 tion, who alleged that Dat had slandered him by publishing a transcription of a
 Radio Liberty interview in which a former Kazakhstan 1 employee accused him of
 embezzlement (see Section 1.d.).
 In early November in Astana, the customs office seized all copies of the current
 issue of the independent newspaper Center. After the seizure, Center was subjected
 to a series of inspections by the tax and customs offices and the Ministry of Informa-
 tion. The Ministry first charged that the newspaper officials had not filled out the
 customs declaration properly and then said that they failed to fill out a special form
 for importing newsprint from Russia. Throughout November the editor-in-chief and
 staff members of Center received threats of death and violence.
 On December 8, two assailants beat a visiting German journalist, Minette von
 Krosigk, and a Kazakhstani colleague, shortly after they returned to Almaty from
 a reporting trip to Kurchatov and Semipalatinsk. The assailants took von Krosigk's
 camera equipment and the film and notes that she had taken during the trip. Von
 Krosigk had been investigating the continuing medical and social effects of nuclear
 testing carried out near Semipalatinsk during the Soviet era. During her trip, von
 Krosigk reportedly collected information about the current disposition of hazardous
 nuclear materials. The attack on von Krosigk and her colleague, and the theft of
 their journalistic materials, might have been motivated by official concern over her
 reporting, but the evidence is inconclusive.
 According to credible observers in the independent press and human rights com-
 munity, in June the tax authorities coerced the owners of the independent Karavan
 media group-composed of the Karavan newspaper, KTK television station, and the
 Franklin Press publisher-into selling the group to business interests closely associ-
 ated with the President. Several months after the sale, three independent news-
 papers reported that Franklin Press, previously Kazakhstan's only independent
 newspaper publisher, doubled the price of newsprint and cancelled its contracts with
 the newspe newspape newspapers all sought new publishing contracts outside
 Kazakhstan with mixed success. By autumn the Government ordered customs offi-
 cials to seize any newspapers coming from Kyrgyzstan. Some newspapers are being
 printed in Russia.
 In April the General Prosecutor announced that the Russian-language newspapers
 Tselina, Lad, Rabochnaya    Zhizn, Communist, Azamat Times, Karavan,
 Kazakhskaya Pravda, and Biz-My would receive subpoenas to appear before the po-
 lice. Among reasons given for the subpoenas was "imprecise coverage" of strikes in
 1997. In June the General Prosecutor announced indictments under the Law on
 Press and Mass Media against Karavan, Kazakhskaya Pravda, and Biz-My, as well
 as the Kazakhstan edition of the Russian newspaper Argumenty i Fakty. The Gen-
 eral Prosecutor cited articles about relations between Kazakhs and ethnic Russians
 in Kazakhstan and an article that allegedly violated the privacy of prominent per-
 sons as bases for indictments. No further action on these cases had been taken by
 year's end. In October the Government brought criminal charges of inciting intereth-
 nic ethnic discord, which carry a possible sentence of 7 years imprisonment, against
 opposition leader Petr Svoik for his newspaper article about relations between eth-
 nic Russians and Kazakhs. Subsequently the case was suspended indefinitely.
 In November guards at an army base in Almaty destroyed the equipment of two
 crews from the independent KTK television station who were attempting to enter
 the base to report on a recris suicide.
 The newspaper Economika Segodnya, which came under government pressure in
 1997 for publishing criticism of the President, closed following the emigration of its
 editor-in-chief. The Communist Party's national newspaper, which the Government
 closed in 1997, has not been able to resum epublication.
 About 80 percent of newspapers are subject to direct government control. All daily
 newspapers are government-run. There are also a large number of newspapers that
 are produced by government ministries, for example, Kazakhstan Science, published
 by the Ministry of Science. However, many newspapers receive a government sub-
 sidy, including about 90 percent of Kazakh language newspapers, although most of
 these would call themselves independents. Therefore, including newspapers that re-
 ceive subsidies, about 80 percent of newspapers are government-run. Each major
 population center has at least one independent weekly newspaper. There are seven
 major independent newspapers in Almaty.
 The Government controls nearly all broadcast transmission facilities. Independent
 television and radio stations were threatened with closure or nonrenewal of their
 broadcast lcenses. On June 17, the Minister of Information said, in the context of
 new frequency auctions, that it would be necessary to close certain stations or refuse
 to renew their broadcast licenses, if they were not in conformity with the rule re-
 quiring 50 percent Kazakh language content in broadcasting. At that time, report-
 edly no stations (government or private) met the 50 percent Kazakh requirement,
 
 
 1329
 
 but the threat of nonrenewal was directed at a few, out-of-favor independent sta-
 tions.
 There are 35 independent radio and television stations. Twelve of these are in
 Almaty. In November 1996, there were 57 independent stations in the country; 8
 were in Almaty. Of the 26 stations that went out of business in 1997, half closed
 due to government auctions of radio and television frequencies. The other 13 went
 bankrupt before the auctions began or joined forces with other broadcasting compa-
 nies to compete in the auctions. There are only two government-owned, combined
 radio and television companies; however, they represent five channels and are the
 only stations that can broadcast nationwide. Regional governments own several fre-
 quencies; however, independent broadcasters have arranged with local administra-
 tions to use the majority of these. An Association of Independent Electronic Media
 of Central Asia (ANESMI) exists, but it is fractured and weak.
 The Government continued to auction radio and television broadcast frequencies.
 A change in rules allowed the Government to award a frequency in cases where only
 one bidder participated in an auction; a minimum of two bidders was required pre-
 viously. Many members of the independent media and human rights activists be-
 lieved that the Government used the auctions to harass and even eliminate inde-
 pendent media. High minimum bids required by the Government deterred many
 small independent broadcasters from competing for frequencies, particularly in the
 provinces. Auctions of frequencies this year, however, reportedly appeared to be
 based on merit. Nevertheless, the Minister of Information, who chairs the commis-
 sion, effectively can impose his decisions at any time.
 There was no further action by the Prosecutor General concerning the legality of
 the frequencies auction in 1997, given the absence of a response from the Prime
 Minister to the Prosecutor's request for a ruling on the law guiding the auctions.
 There was no law passed on the tender procedures during the year.
 The only independent electronic media in Shymkent, the television station Otyrar
 and radio station Umax, were threatened with closure for failing to comply with the
 50 percent Kazakh language requirement imposed by the Press and Media Law. Ap-
 plication of this law, which generally is not enforced, against the stations appeared
 arbitrary, especially since the stations broadcast more Kazakh language program-
 ming than most other stations. According to credible although unverified reports,
 owners of these stations and other media might have been under legal pressure to
 sell their-outlets to business interests favorable to the Government.
 The Constitution provides for the protection of the dignity of the President and
 the law against insulting the President and other officials remained on the books.
 Labor movement leader Madel Ismailov was sentenced to 1 year in prison for violat-
 ing the law (see Section I.e.). In February a court in Uralsk convicted three
 youths-Ainur Kurmanov, Sergey Kolokolov, and Vasya Nikolayev-of insulting the
 honor and dignity of the President after they were arrested in 1997 for spraying
 antipresidential graffiti on a building in Uralsk. Two of the youths, who had been
 detained for 5 months, were sentenced to 21/2 years on probation. The third, a minor
 who had been released into the custody of his parents, received a sentence of I year
 on probation.
 Several laws control advertising in the mass media. One law restricts alcohol and
 tobacco advertising on television, as well as "pornography" and "violence" during
 prime viewing hours. Another law restricts advertising in each issue of a newspaper
 to 20 percent of the total material. The Minister of Justice and the Minister of Infor-
 mation have interpreted this law as restricting paid articles, but not commercial ad-
 vertisements.
 Academic freedom is circumscribed. As is the case for journalists, academics can-
 not violate certain taboos, such as criticizing the President and his family. There
 were widespread credible reports that universities and schools coerced faculty, stu-
 dents, and the parents of schoolchildren to sign nominating petitions for the reelec-
 tion campaign of President Nazarbayev. The Al-Farabi national university in
 Almaty forced Yelena Nikitenko, an adviser to opposition presidential candidate
 Akezhan Kazhegeldin, to resign from the faculty in October because of her outside
 political activities (see Sections 1.c. and 3). An academic critic of the Government,
 Nurbulat Masanov, was not reappointed to his position in the political science de-
 partment at the same university; some independent observers alleged that govern-
 ment pressure was responsible for the decision. Course topics and content generally
 are subject to approval by the university administration.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 peaceful assembly; however, the Government and the law impose significant restric-
 tions. In June the Government passed a new law on national security that defined
 as a threat to national security "unsanctioned gatherings, public meetings, marches,
 
 
 133.0
 
 demonstrations, illegal picketing, and strikes" that upset social and political stabil-
 itAccording to the law, organizations must apply to the local authorities for a per-
 mit to hold a demonstration or public meeting at least 10 days in advance, or the
 activity is considered illegal. In some cases, local officials routinely issued necessary
 permits. However, human rights activists complained that complicated procedures
 and the 10-day notification period made it difficult for all groups to organize public
 meetings and demonstrations. They reported that local authorities, especially those
 outside of the capital, turned down the majority of applications submitted or refused
 to allow rallies to take place in central locations. Municipal authorities in Uralsk
 rejected requests by Communists in May and June to hold commemorative rallies
 for victims of political repression. Authorities in Karaganda denied permission for
 Communists to hold a rally in June. An amendment to the presidential decree on
 elections that bars candidates for public office who have been convicted within the
 preceding year of criminal or administrative offenses was used against leading gov-
 ernment opponents who participated in unsanctioned meetings and demonstrations
 (see Section 3).
 In January the President announced a "year of political accord" and asked politi-
 cal and social movements to agree to a 1-year moratorium on political actions. Al-
 though many state-supported organizations agreed, most independent organizations
 refused.
 There were numerous peaceful, unsanctioned demonstrations by workers and pen-
 sioners protesting difficult economic conditions and the nonpayment of wages and
 pensions. For the most part, law enforcement authorities did not interfere in the
 emonstrations, and no action was taken against the individuals who participated.
 However, pensioners were arrested occasionally at the peaceful, monthly pensioners
 demonstration in front of the city hall in Almaty.
 There were also cases in which the Government arrested, detained, fined, and
 sometimes imprisoned the participants and organizers of unsanctioned rallies. In
 June 124 persons were summoned to Kentau city court forparticipating in an
 unsanctioned protest march calling for payment of back wages. Fourteen persons re-
 ceived prison sentences ranging from 5 to 15 days, two were fined, and the rest re-
 ceived warnings. A Kentau court subsequently stripped two unions of their legal sta-
 tus for holding repeated unsanctioned demonstrations (see Section 6.a.).
 In February poi  in Almaty arrested five participants in an unsanctioned protest
 organized by the ethnic Kazakh political movement Azat and the antinuclear testing
 movement Attan. The demonstration Was in support of metallurgical workers strik-
 ing for unpaid wages in southern Kazakhstan. F our of those arrested were convicted
 of disturbing the peace and received 3-day sentences; the fifth received a warning.
 In November the Central Elections Commission cited the jail sentence given to
 Attan leader Amantai Asylbek as its justification for refusing his application to run
 for president (see Section 3).
 Madel Ismailov, leader of the Worker's Movement, was convicted in September
 1997 of-"active participation in or organization of public disorder" and sentenced to
 1 year of "corrective labor." He appealed the sentence, but no action was taken on
 the case after Ismailov was sentenced in another case to 1 year in prison for insult-
 ing the President (see Section i.e.).
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association; however, the Government
 and the law impose significant restrictions on this right. Organizations, movements,
 and political parties that conduct public activities, hold public meetings, participate
 in conferences, or have bank accounts must register annually with the Government.
 Registration on the local level requires a minimum of 10 members and on the na-
 tional level, a minimum of 10 members in at least 7 of the 14 oblasts. In addition
 a registration fee is required, which many groups consider a deterrent to registra-
 tion. Many groups had difficulties trying to register with local officials. According
 to the Pokoleniye pensioners movement, registration documents submitted by its af-
 filiate in Ust-Kamenogorsk were rejected on technicalities in September 1997, and
 officials made the movement pay another application fee.
 The Government harassed organizers of a new association called "For Fair Elec-
 tions." Five leading government opponents who participated in the group's October
 2 and 3 meeting in Almaty were convicted of participating in a meeting of an unreg-
 istered organization (see Section 3). Approximately 10 law enforcement officials ob-
 served and videotaped, but did not disrupt, the proceedings. Group members argued
 that the meeting was a constituent assembly of a newly formed organization called
 in order to discuss administrative issues such as registration. The group reported
 that it applied for registration on October 13, but received no response from the
 Ministry of Justice, despite a legal requirement for action on registration applica-
 tions within 15 days.
 
 
 1331
 
 On October 20, the Medeo district court in Almaty convicted former prime min-
 ister Kazhegeldin in absentia of the administrative violation of participating in this
 meeting. The court assessed a fine of approximately $75 (6,000 tenge).
 The Constitution prohibits political parties established on a religious basis. The
 Government has refused to register ethnic-based political parties on the grounds
 that their activities could spark ethnic violence. The Constitution bans "public asso-
 ciations'---including political parties-whose "goals or actions are directed at a vio-
 lent change of the constitutional system, violation of the integrity of the republic,
 undermining of the security of the state (and), fanning of social, racial, national, re-
 ligious, class, and tribal enmity." Nonetheless, unregistered parties and movements
 hold meetings and publish newspapers. All of the major religious and ethnic groups
 have independently functioning cultural centers.
 To participate in elections, a poitical pay must register with the Government.
 Under current law, a party must submit a list of at least 3,000 members from a
 minimum of 7 oblasts. The list must provide personal information about members,
 including date and place of birth, address, andplace of emploment. For many citi-
 zens, submitting such personal data to the Government is reminiscent of the tactics
 of the former Soviet KGB and inhibits them from joining parties. The nationalist
 Alash Party and the Social Democratic Party have refused to register on the prin-
 ciple that they should not have to submit personal information about their members
 to the Government. Under the law, members of unregistered parties may run for
 elected office as individuals, but not as party members.
 The manager of an Almaty hotel tried to block an October 20 news conference
 thatwas to be held at the hotel toxeport about former prime minister Kazhegeldin's
 conviction for participating in a meeting of an unregistered organization (see Section
 3). The hotel manager reportedly said that the Government had told the hotel not
 to permit the press conference. The press conference was held anyway, even after
 the hotel turned off the lights.
 Leading government opponents headed by former prime minister and disqualified
 presidental candidate Akezhan Kazhegeldin began efforts in December to form the
 new Republican People's Party. The group held its first congress in Moscow to avoid
 government harassment directed at Kazhegeldin and other members of the opposi-
 tion during the run-up to the January 1999 presidential election (see Section 3). Ac-
 cording to conference organizers, authorities at the Moscow hotel where the congress
 was to have been held denied the group access to conference facilities on the eve
 of the meeting. Organizers said that approximately 10 other Moscow hotels subse-
 quently refused to allow the group to use conference facilities before organizers
 f0und a suitable location. Or anizers of the congress credibly alleged that
 Kazakhstani authorities used infuence with Russian officials to try to disrupt the
 congress.
 There are no statistics available regarding the number of registered political par-
 ties (approximately 25 are registered nationwide). Representatives of the Com-
 munist Party and the labor movement report frequent difficulties in registering and
 reregistering. During the year, the Workers Movement disbanded as a national
 movement following the imprisonment of Ismailov and the departure of Vinkov, but
 its Almaty branch was registered. The Communist Party also was registered.
 The Constitution prohibits foreign political parties and foreign trade unions from
 operating. In addition the Constitution prohibits the financing of political parties
 and trade unions by foreign legal entities and citizens, foreign states, and inter-
 national organizations. In January independent trade union leader Leonid Solomin
 was accused of violating the Constitution by accepting foreign financial support (see
 Section 6.a.). The case was dismissed in October when the General Prosecutor's of-
 fice dropped its appeal.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 various denominations worship without government interference. However, the Con-
 stitution also requires that the appointment by foreign religious centers of the heads
 of religious associations must be carried out "in coordination with the Government,"
 as must the activities of foreign religious associations. The chief of the KNB testified
 to Parliament in June that preventing the spread of Islamic and Christian "religious
 extremism" was a top priority of the internal intelligence service. In general the
 Government does not interfere with the appointment of religious leaders or the ac-
 tivities of foreign religious associations. However, during the year, criminal and de-
 portation proceedings were brought against foreign Muslim missionaries perceived
 to be teaching "radical fundamentalist Islam." Other foreign missionaries, unwel-
 come to some Orthodox and 'Muslim citizens, have complained of occasional harass-
 ment by low-level government officials. In particular evangelical Protestants work-
 ing in NGO's and social services have alleged government hostility toward their ef-
 forts to proselytize.
 
 
 1332
 In July the KNB and the General -Prosecutor launched a criminal investigation
 of the activities of Muslim missionaries from Egypt, Sudan, and Jordan in the
 southern Kazakhstan oblast. Inestigators allege   at the activities of the foreign
 missionaries violated Criminal Code and National Security Law provisions against
 threatening the national constitutional system. In September the authorities de-
 tained and issued deportation orders against six unaccredited Muslim missionaries
 from Pakistan who planned to attend a religious conference in the Zhambyl region.
 A Muslim missionary from Uzbekistan reportedly was deported in the latter half of
 the year for preaching "radical Islamic fundamentalism" in Kyzyl Orda.
 In April    at po ice prevented members of the Union of Semirechiye Cossacks
 dressed in traditional military uniforms from entering the Holy Ascension Cathedral
 on Orthodox Easter. Law enforcement authorities considered that wearing such uni-
 forms was a violation of the provision in the law on public associations against the
 creation of "military organizations with military uniforms and special signs." Dis-
 trict and appeals courts in Ahmaty rejected subsequent efforts by the Almaty city
 prosecutor's office to suspend activities by the Union of Semirechiye Cossacks.
 The Islamic mufti and the Russian Orthodox archbishop appeared together sev-
 eral times in public to promote religious and ethnic harmony, usually at the invita-
 tion of and with the President.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for the right to emigrate and the right of re-
 atriation; both are respected in practice. The new law on national security pro-
 bits persons who had access to state secrets through their work from taking up
 permanent residence abroad for 5 years after leaving government service. Citizens
 have the right to change their citizenship, but are not permitted to hold dual citi-
 zenship.
 According to the Constitution, everyone who is legally present on the territory of
 the Republic has the right to move freely on its territory and freely choose a place
 of residence except in cases stipulated by law. This provision formally abolished the
 "propiska" system of residence permits, a holdover from the Soviet era, and replaced
 it with a system of registration. However, in practice, citizens still are required to
 register in order to prove legal residence and obtain city services. Registration in
 most of the -country generally was routine, but it was difficult to register in Almaty
 due to its relative affluence and local officials' fears of overcrowding. The Govern-
 ment can refuse to register a citizen, just as it did under the propiska system, in
 order to limit the number of persons who can move to a certain city or area.
 There were a few reports of government efforts to restrict the movement of for-
 eigners around the country. Foreigners were detained for wandering into restricted
 areas that were not clearly marked. Some foreigners reported that they either were
 denied access or required to pay exorbitant entry fees to ostensibly free national
 parks. Internal visas are no longer required for foreigners traveling outside Almaty.
 An exit visa is required for citizens who wish to travel abroad, although refusals
 are rare. There have been reports of some officials demanding bribes for exit visas.
 It is usually necessary to meet a number of bureaucratic requirements before the
 exit visa is issued. For example, close relatives with a claim to support from the
 applicant must give their concurrence. Intending emigrants- also must obtain evi-
 dence that they have no outstanding financial obligations. Foreigners must have
 exit visas, although they receive them routinely as part of their entry visa. Foreign-
 ers who overstay their original visa, or who did not receive an exit visa as part of
 their original visa, must get an exit visa from the immigration authorities before
 leaving. Foreigners staying at least 3 days in the country, regardless of whether
 they are staying 3 days in any individual city, must register with the local visa reg-
 istry office. Many have complained that the process is bureaucratically cumbersome.
 Immigration authorities refused to allow foreigners without proof of registration to
 leave the country.
 The Government accords special treatment to ethnic Kazakhs and their families
 who fled during Stalin's era and wish to return. Kazkhs in this category are enti-
 tled to citizenship and many other privileges. Anyone else, including ethnic Kazakhs
 who are'not considered refugees from the Stalin era, such as the descendants of
 Kazakhs who moved to Mongolia during the previous century, must apply for per-
 mission to return. However, it is the stated policy of the Government to encourage
 and assist all ethnic Kazakhs living outside the country to return, if they so desire.
 � The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. There
 were no reports of the forced expulsion of refugees. Following the passage of a 1997
 migration law and creation of the Agency for Migration and Demography, the Gov-
 ernment began in April to register asylum seekers and to determine their status in
 consultation with the UNHCR. Ethnic Kazakh migrants are automatically eligible
 
 
 1333
 for citizenship. Migrants from other Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)
 countries are not considered to be refugees as they may travel and settle freely in
 any CIS country. All non-CIS citizens are considered to be intending immigrants.
 In practice, however, the Government is tolerant in its treatment of local refugee
 populations. Only the President can grant political asylum. The issue of the provi-
 sion of first asylum has arisen, but the Government has not passed legislation and
 implementing procedures in conformity with internationally recognized norms.
 The UHCR estimated that there were approximately 14,000 forcibly displaced
 persons in the country (about 6,000 each from Tajikistan and Chechnya and 2,000
 from Afghanistan). By October the Government had registered approximately 900
 asylum seekers and accorded refugee status to about 10 percent of them. The Gov-
 ernment continues to give priority to the return of ethnic Kazakhs in order to in-
 crease the percentage of Kazakhs in the overall population and to offset the large-
 scale emigration of ethnic Russians and Germans. Since independence approxi-
 mately 155,000 ethnic Kazakhs, mostly from other CIS countries, Iran, Afghanistan,
 Mongolia, Turkey, China, and Saudi Arabia have immigrated. The Government
 struggled to find resources for integration programs for these immigrants, some of
 whom lived in squalid settings.
 Agreements between Kazakhstan and Russia that established broad legal rights
 for the citizens of one country living on the territory of the other, and provided for
 expeditious naturalization for citizens of one country who moved to the other, en-
 tered into force in 1997.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Although the Constitution provides for a democratic government, in practice the
 Government infringed on the right of citizens to change their government. The Con-
 stitution concentrates power in the presidency, granting the President considerable
 control over the legislature, judiciary, and local government. The Constitution can-
 not be modified or amended without the consent of the President. In 1995 President
 Nazarbayev extended his term of office to the year 2000 by referendum without a
 contested presidential election (which, according to the Constitution then in force,
 should have been held in 1996).
 The President appoints and dismisses the Prime Minister and the Cabinet. He
 has the power to dismiss Parliament and to rule by decree should he so choose. He
 appoints judges and senior court officials and appoints all regional governors. The
 President also directly appoints the chairman of the Central Election Commission
 and the members of the Commission.
 On October 7, President Nazarbayev and the Parliament passed, without any
 prior public notice, a series of 19 constitutional amendments that enabled them on
 the following day to call for an early presidential election on January 10, 1999.
 Nazarbayev won the election. Among other changes, the constitutional amendments
 extended the presidential term of office from 5 to 7 years and lifted the 65-year age
 limit on government service. (President Nazarbayev will be 65 before the end of his
 7-year presidential term beginning in January 1999.) The constitutional amend-
 ments also extended the terms of Members of Parliament from 4 to 5 years for the
 lower house (Majilis), and from 4 to 6 years for the Senate. Government opponents
 and international observers criticized the short-notice call of early elections because
 it did not leave enough time for the Government to implement promised electoral
 reforms and for intending candidates to organize effective campaigns.
 The Government imposed onerous requirements on candidates hoping to qualify
 for the presidential ballot. Candidates were required to submit petitions with ap-
 proximately 170,000 signatures collected in equal proportions from at least 11 of the
 country's 14 regions. They also were required to pass a Kazakh-language test and
 to make a nonrefundable payment of 1,000 times the minimum monthly wage (ap-
 proximately $30,000), though an equal sum was then provided to each registered
 candidate for campaign expenses. Although three candidates, in addition to Presi-
 dent Nazarbayev, qualified for the ballot, two of them, Senator Engels Gabassov and
 Customs Committee Chairman Gani Kasymov, were known as supporters of the
 President and widely believed to be running at government behest.
 Less than a week after the early presidential election was called, the Government
 resorted to a new amendment to the presidential decree on elections, signed into law
 in May, that prohibited persons convicted of criminal or administrative offenses
 from running for public office within 1 year of their conviction. On October 14, a
 district court in Almaty summoned on less than 24 hours' notice 5 leading govern-
 ment opponents-former prime minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin, Azat (ethnic
 Kazakh) movement leader Dos Kushim, Pokoleniye Pensioners Movement leader
 Irina Savostina, Azamat movement co-chairman Petr Svoik, and Tabigat ecological
 
 
 1334
 movement leader Mels Yeleusizov-to face charges of participating in the October
 2 and 3 meeting of an unregistered organization called For Fair Elections. The court
 convicted all five. Despite the judgment against him, Kazhegeldin, widely considered
 the strongest challenger to President Nazarbayev, applied or registration as a can-
 didate in the presidential election. The presidentialy-appointed Central Elections
 Commission (CEC) disqualified his candidacy on October 27 under the May amend-
 ment to the- presidential decree on elections that serves as the election law. The Su-
 preme Court upheld the disqualification on November 24. The CEC also used the
 election law amendment retroactively to disqualify the presidential candidacy of
 Amantai Asylbek, leader of the Attan antinuclear testing movement, because of the
 3-day jail sentence he received in February for participating in an unsanctioned
 demonstration (see Section 2.b.).
 The Government harassed the opposition throughout the presidential election
 campaign. According to credible reports, government agents repeatedly pressured
 managers of conference facilities to deny access at the last moment to government
 opponents who had arranged to use the facilities for meetings and press conferences.
 When opposition meetings and press conferences did take place, electricity at the
 facilities was often interrupted. Government attempts to disrupt opposition meet-
 ings appeared to have extended beyond national borders when management of a
 Moscow hotel withdrew permission at the last moment for a December 4 and 5 oppo-
 sition congress (see Section 2.b.). Communist Party leader Serykbolsyn Abdildin, the
 only candidate from the ranks of the preelection opposition who qualified for the
 presidential ballot, publicly complained that local officials loyal to the President im-
 peded his attempts to hold campaign rallies and meetings.
 Unsolved assaults on Kazhegeldin and two of his advisers appeared to be politi-
 cally motivated and, government critics alleged, sanctioned by the Government. In
 October two gunshots of unknown origin were fired at Kazhegeldin on the eve of
 the press conference at which he announced his presidential candidacy. Unknown
 assailants beat his press spokesman, Amirzhan Kosanov, and one of his public rela-
 tions advisers, Yelena Nikitenko (see Section 1.c.). Several days before the attack,
 officials of the A1-Farabi national university in Almaty forced Nikitenko to resign
 from the faculty because of her political work. Government officials alleged that the
 Kazhegeldin campaign staged all three attacks. Kazhegeldin's chief of staff, Mikhail
 Vasilenko, was jailed for 3 days in Astana in September after he was arrested while
 distributing Kazhegeldin's proposed reforms to the election law and Constitution at
 Parliament (see Section 1.d.). Following the announcement of Kazhegeldin's can-
 didacy, the first deputy chairman of the National Security Committee (KNB) held
 an unprecedented press conference at which he made admittedly unsubstantiated
 allegations of financial malfeasance against Kazhegeldin. The tax authorities
 brought an action against Kazhegeldin during the campaign and, according to credi-
 ble reports, threatened actions against other government opponents. At a news con-
 ference, the Kazhegeldin campaign showed videotape of police repeatedly pulling
 over Kazhegeldin's car for unspecified "inspections." Kazhegeldin also claimed that
 border control officials at the Almaty airport tried to prevent him and his family
 from taking a flight out of the country. An attack on a Kazakhstani employee of
 a foreign embassy also appeared to be politically-motivated and, human rights ob-
 servers believe, sanctioned by the Government. On December 22, three men beat the
 employee outside his apartment building as the employee returned home from work
 at his regular time. The employee suffered a cracked rib, some internal injuries, and
 required stitches to close wounds near both eyes. The attackers made no attempt
 to take the employee's money or other valuables. The absence of robbery as a motive
 and the fact that the employee's responsibilities included assisting embassy officers
 in contacts with political opposition and human rights figures suggested that the at-
 tack was politically motivated.
 The Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) of the Organi-
 zation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) announced in December that
 it would not meet the Government's request to send a presidential election observa-
 tion mission. In its public explanation, ODIHR cited concerns about the exclusion
 of two opposition candidates, unequal access to the media, and coerced support for
 President Nazarbayev. ODIRH sent a small election assessment team to report to
 OSCE on the full election process.
 A bicameral legislature took office in January 1996. The lower house (Majilis),
 consisting of 67 members, was elected directly. Under amendments to the Constitu-
 tion passed in October, Majilis membership will be increased at the next election
 by 10 seats. The new seats will be assigned proportionally to political parties based
 on the percentage of votes they receive nationally (with a minimum vote threshold
 of 7 percent). The upper house (the Senate), with 42 members, was elected indi-
 rectly, by members of oblast and city parliaments, with 7 of its members appointed
 
 
 1335
 directly by the President. (The number of Senate seats was reduced in 1997 in ac-
 cordance with the Government's decision to reduce the number of oblasts from 19
 to 14.) The election law requires candidates for both houses to meet minimum age
 and education requirements, and to pay a nonrefundable registration fee of 100
 times the minimum monthly wage (in a by-election in June, this fee was about
 $3,000 (240,000 tenge). The election law does not require Majilis candidates to col-
 lect a certain number of signatures in order to be placed on the ballot; however,
 Senate candidates must obtain signatures from 10 percent of the members of the
 local assemblies in their oblasts in order to be placed on the ballot. Opposition fig-
 ures, human ights monitors, and OSCE/ODIHR believe that the election require-
 ments, especially the registration fee, are a barrier to participation. The Constitu-
 tion mandates that participation in elections is voluntary. One of the constitutional
 amendments passed in October rescinded the requirement that at least 50 percent
 of eligible voters participate in order to make an election valid. Experts had cited
 the old requirement as one of the causes of fraud and vote inflation in past elec-
 tions.
 The legislature cannot exercise oversight over the executive branch. However, the
 Parliament has asserted itself with regard to the budget, rejecting, for example, a
 presidential austerity proposal to pay only 67 percent of the minimum wage until
 2004. Should Parliament fail to pass within 30 days an "urgent' bill brought by the
 President, the President may issue the bill by decree. While the President has broad
 powers to dissolve Parliament, Parliament can remove the President only for dis-
 ability or high treason, and only with the consent of the Constitutional Council,
 which largely is controlled by the President.
 Although the President has the right to legislate by decree, he respected the par-
 liamentary procedures laid out in the Constitution. During the Parliamentary ses-
 sion from September 1997 to June 1998, none of the four bills that originated in
 Parliament became law. One of the bills, which would have established an inde-
 pendent auditing agency, was reintroduced by Parliament following a presidential
 veto. Parliamentary activity decreased compared with 1997, when Parliament intro-
 duced 19 draft laws, largely due to the move of Parliament and much of the rest
 of the Government to the new capital, Astana.
 In general political parties are very weak, and with the exception of the Com-
 munist Party and some of the ethnically-based political movements, they have very
 little influence outside the former and new capitals, Almaty and Astana, with total
 membership estimated at about 100,000. The majority of parliamentary deputies are
 independents; they are active in Parliament, but most support the President and the
 Government. Parties represented in the Parliament include several propresidential
 parties, the Communist Party, and the Socialist Party. Most opposition leaders de-
 cided not to participate in the flawed December 1995 elections and therefore are not
 represented in the Parliament.
 Although most activities of Parliament remained outside public view, the Par-
 liament held some open committee meetings with nongovernmental participants.
 Topics included the nonpayment of wages and the national educational and health
 care systems. Draft bills were held closely and published in the press only after pas-
 sage and signature by the President. Constituent relations were virtually nonexist-
 ent, although in August a group of parliamentarians met members of the Pokoleniye
 pensioners movement and in November a group of parliamentarians took part in a
 town hail meeting with voters in Shymkent.
 In a parliamentary by-election in June in Almaty, local poll officials in approxi-
 mately one-third of the voting precincts did not allow candidates' representatives
 and independent observers to observe the vote count. Authorities in the remaining
 precincts counted the votes openly. Municipal and national election commission offi-
 cials did not publish precinct-by-precinct tallies or make them available to inter-
 national observers. Observers also reported the extensive use of mobile ballot boxes,
 which are hard to monitor, as well as repeated cases of family voting and voting
 by individuals without identification.
 The Constitution significantly constrains the independence of the judiciary. A
 Constitutional Council replaced the Constitutional Court in August 1995 when the
 new Constitution was adopted. The President appoints three of its seven members,
 including the chairman. A two-thirds majority of the Council is required to overrule
 a presidential veto. All judges are appointed directly by the President.
 According to the Constitution, the President selects governors of oblasts (the
 "akims"), based on the recommendation of the Prime Minister; they serve at the dis-
 cretion of the President, who may annul their decisions.
 Opposition parties, including the intellectuals' movement Azamat, the Communist
 Party, the Socialist Party, the ethnic Kazakh movement Azat, the ethnic Slavic
 movement Lad, and the Workers Movement held an organizational meeting for their
 
 
 1336
 
 new People's Front in February. The movement was disbanded in December. An-
 other attempt to form a unified opposition movement began in December with the
 formation of the Republican People's Party under the leadership of former prime
 minister and disqualified presidential candidate Akezhan Kazhegeldin (see Section
 2.b.). However, some other opposition figures declined to join and announced the for-
 mation of their own parties.
 All adult citizens (at least 18 years of age) have the right to vote. Membership
 in political parties or trade unions is forbidden to members of the armed forces, em-
 ployees of national security and law enforcement organizations, and judges.
 There are no legal restrictions on the participation of women and minorities in
 politics, but the persistence of traditional attitudes means that few women hold high
 office or play active parts in political life. At the end of the year, there was one fe-
 male minister, but no female provincial governors (akims). Of 47 Senate members,
 6 are women; of 67 Majilis members, 9 are women.
 Although minority ethnic groups are represented in the Government, Kazakhs
 hold the majority of leadership positions. Non-Kazakhs head only 3 of 14 govern-
 ment ministries. Non-Kazakhs are well represented in the Majilis and the Senate.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Almaty Helsinki Commission and the Kazakhstan Bureau for Human Rights
 (formerly the Kazakhstan-American Bureau on Human Rights) are the most active
 of a small number of local human rights organizations. They cooperate on human
 rights and legal reform issues. Although these groups operated largely without gov-
 ernment interference, limited financial means hampered their ability to monitor and
 report human rights violations. Some human rights observers complained that the
 Government monitored their movements and telephone calls.
 The Government permitted international and foreign nongovernmental organiza-
 tions (NGO's) dealing with human rights issues to visit the country and meet with
 local human rights groups as well as government officials. The International Labor
 Organization, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies,
 and the UNHCR have permanent offices in the country. The Organization for Secu-
 rity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in which Kazakhstan is a member, opened
 an office in Almaty in January 1999. The Constitution forbids "the financing of po-
 litical parties and trade unions by foreign legal entities and citizens, foreign states
 and international organizations." In January the independent Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions and its leader, Leonid Solomin, were charged for the second time
 within a year with violating this provision (see Section 6.a.).
 The Civil Code requires NGO's to register with the Government and most NGO's
 are registered; however, some continue to operate without legal standing. Although
 some government officials made an effort to work with domestic and foreign NGO's,
 others persisted in asserting that foreign NGO's promote instability. Some NGO's
 chose not to register because they objected to the requirement of registration in
 Erinciple or because they did not have the money to pay the registration fee. Others
 elieve that they were not eligible to register because they promoted the interests
 of one ethnic group or religion and are considered by some to violate the constitu-
 tional ban on inciting social, racial, national, religious, class, and tribal enmity. The
 new Criminal Code that took effect in January criminalized the activity of NGO's
 that are not registered. Five leading opposition figures were convicted for participat-
 ing in a meeting of an unregistered NGO, the "For Fair Elections" group (see Sec-
 tions 1.d., 2.b., and 3).
 The Presidential Commission on Human Rights is a consultative body. For the
 first time the Commission made public its annual report to the President by pub-
 lishing its report for 1997 on December 29. The report focused almost exclusively
 on "economic and social rights," for example, the right to a decent standard of living.
 It concluded that the country consistently abides by human rights principles and
 suggested that those who blame the Government for social problems should realize
 that individual well-being ultimately is the responsibility of the individual. The
 Commission reached out to independent human rights organizations, but made little
 progress in establishing itself as an ombudsman. In general the Government tended
 to deny or ignore charges of specific human rights abuses that were levied by
 human rights monitors and individual citizens. In June the Commission and the
 U.N. office in Almaty-cohosted a human rights round table that produced a public
 report containing statements by both senior government officials and human rights
 NGO leaders. In general topics covered were either not specific to Kazakhstan or
 pertained to Kazakhstani law, not practice. In its report to the President for 1997,
 the Commission charged that many domestic NGO's are oriented towards developed
 countries' standards and do not realize that progress towards a market economy and
 
 
 1337
 civil society is a slow, gradual process. It said that NGO's sympathetic to "left-wing
 radicals" have nothing constructive to offer and concluded its section on NGO's by
 noting that citizens must recognize that "a person's well-being-is his own respon-
 sibility."
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that "everyone is equal before law and court. No one may
 be subjected to any discrimination for reasons of origin, social position, occupation,
 property status, sex, race, nationality, language, attitude to religion, convictions,
 place of residence, or any other circumstances." However, the Government does not
 effectively enforce this provision on a consistent basis. The Government has favored
 ethnic Kazakhs in government employment and, according to many citizens, in the
 process of privatizing state enterprises.
 Women.-According to human rights groups, there is considerable domestic vio-
 lence against women. A local NGO, the Feminist League, estimates that hundreds
 of thousands of women are the victims of spousal abuse. Police often are reluctant
 to intervene, considering it to be the family's business, unless they believe that the
 abuse is life threatening. The maximum sentence for wife beating is 3 years, but
 few such cases are prosecuted. The Government has not addressed the problem spe-
 cifically. Law enforcement authorities reported an adjusted figure of 2,025 cases of
 rape for 1996. More recent figures were unavailable. The punishment for rape can
 range from 3 to 15 years. There is very little coverage of rape in the press, and
 rapes often go unreported. There is no law specifically against spousal rape, which
 is proscribed under general rape laws.
 Women's rights groups and the International Organization for Migration report
 anecdotal evidence of trafficking in women from Kazakhstan. No observers have
 tried to quantify the extent of traf'ficling and the Government has no programs to
 target trafficking in women.
 There is no legal discrimination against women, but traditional cultural practices
 limit their role in everyday society and in owning and managing businesses or real
 property. The President and other members of the Government speak in favor of
 women's rights and official state policy (adopted in March 1997) states that constitu-
 tional prohibitions on sex discrimination must be supported by effective government
 measures. Women are severely underrepresented in higher positions in government
 and state enterprises and overrepresented in low-paying and some menial jobs.
 Women have unrestricted access to higher education. Approximately 30 women's
 rights organizations are registered, including the Feminist League, Women of the
 East, the Alnaty Women's Information Center. and the Businesswomen's Associa-
 tion.
 mhildren.- The Government is committed inprinciple to children's rights, but as
 in many other areas, budget stringencies and other priorities severely limit its effec-
 tiveness in dealing with children's issues. Education is mandatory through the elev-
 enth grade, although students may begin technical training after the ninth grade.
 There is no societal pattern of abuse against children. Rural children normally work
 during harvests (see Section 6.d.).
 People With Disabilities.-Citizens with disabilities are entitled by law to assist-
 ance from the State. There is no legal discrimination against people with disabil-
 ities, but in practice, employers do not give them equal consideration. There are
 laws mandating the provision of accessibility to public buildings and commercial es-
 tablishments for the disabled, but the Government does not enforce these laws. Dis-
 abled persons are a low priority for the Government. Mentally ill and mentaliy re-
 tarded citizens can be committed to institutions run by the State. These institutions
 are poorly run and inadequately funded. The NGO, Kazakhstan Bureau for Human
 Rights, reported that the Government provides almost no care for the mentally ill
 and mentally retarded due to a lack of funds.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The population is between 16 and 17 million
 and consists of approximately 45 percent Kazakhs and 35 percent ethnic Slays (Rus-
 sians, Ukrainians, Belorussians, and others) with many other ethnic groups rep-
 resented. In 1997 for what appeared to be political reasons, the Government an-
 nounced that ethnic Kazakhs composed 51 percent of the population; most neutral
 observers agree that this figure is not accurate.
 The Government continued to discriminate in favor of ethnic Kazakhs in govern-
 ment employment, where ethnic Kazakhs predominate, as well as in education,
 housing, and other areas. However, the Government has continued to back away
 from its "Kazakhification" campaign of the first year of indepeence (199 1-1992).
 President Nazarbayev has emphasized publicly that all nationalities are welcome,
 but many non-Kazaths are anxious about what they perceive as expanding pref-
 
 
 1338
 
 erences for ethnic Kazakhs. Many ethnic Kazakhs believe that such preferences are
 needed to reverse 200 years of discrimination. In April President Nazarbayev stated
 that some 1.5 million Russians and some 800,000 Germans had emigrated to date.
 He argued that many of these persons were descended from deportees and had cho-
 sen to return to their ancestors lands.
 Most of the population speaks Russian; only about one-half of ethnic Kazakhs
 speak Kazakh fluently. According to the Constitution, the Kazakh language is the
 state language. The Constitution states that the Russian language is officially used
 on a basis equal with that of the Kazakh language in organizations and bodies of
 local self-administration. Some ethnic Russians believe that Russian should be des-
 ignated as a second state language. The Government is encouraging more education
 of children in the Kazakh language, but has done little to provide Kazakh-language
 education for adults. A 1997 language law intended to strengthen the use of Kazakh
 without infringing on the rights of citizens to use other languages has not been
 funded sufficiently to make Kazakh language education universal. In 1997 the Par-
 liament committed itself to compile a list of positions requiring Kazakh language
 fluency but at year's end had not completed the task.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and the Labor Code provide for
 basic worker rights, including the right to organize and the right to strike; however,
 the Government at times infringed on worker rights. Activist unions came under
 government pressure for holding unsanctioned demonstrations and marches. The
 courts dissolved two unions in June for violating laws against unauthorized dem-
 onstrations, marches, and rallies.
 The draft Labor Code before Parliament was withdrawn in 1997. The Government
 directed the Ministries of Justice and Labor to draft a new code, but by year's end
 it was not complete.
 Most workers remained members of state-sponsored trade unions established dur-
 ing the Soviet period, when membership was obligatory. At most enterprises, the
 state-sponsored unions continued to deduct 1 percent of each worker's wage as dues.
 The state unions under the Communist system were, and for the most part still are,
 organs of the Government and work with management to enforce labor discipline
 and to discourage workers from forming or joining independent unions.
 The law gives workers the right to join or form unions of their choosing and to
 stop the automatic dues deductions for the state unions. The Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions (CFTUK, formerly the Independent Trade Union           Center of
 Kazakhstan) claims membership of about 250,000; however, the actual number of
 independent trade union members is estimated to be much lower. The state-spon-
 sored Federation of Trade Unions claims 4 million members; however, the figure is
 too high. To obtain legal status, an independent union must apply for registration
 with the local judicial authority at the oblast level and with the Ministry of Justice.
 Registration is generally lengthy, difficult, and expensive. The decision to register
 a union appears to be arbitrary, with no published criteria. No unions were reg-
 istered or denied registration during the year. The two major independent trade
 union confederations are registered. Judicial authorities and the Ministry of Justice
 have the authority to cancel a union's registration, as a provincial court did in
 Kentau.
 The law does not provide mechanisms to protect workers who join independent
 unions from threats or harassment by enterprise management or state-run unions.
 Members of independent unions have been dismissed, transferred to lower paying
 or lower status jobs, threatened, and intimidated. According to independent union
 leaders, state unions work closely with management to ensure that independent
 trade union members are the first fired in times of economic downturn.
 Unions and individual workers exercised their right to strike during the year, pri-
 marily to protest the nonpayment of wages and in an attempt to recover back wages
 owed to workers. Nonpayment of wages continued to b   e priority issue for work-
 ers. According to the law, workers may exercise the right to strike only if a labor
 dispute has not been resolved by means of existing conciliation procedures. In addi-
 tion the law requires that employers be notified that a strike is to occur no less than
 15 days before its commencement. There were numerous unsanctioned strikes
 throughout the country to protest the nonpayment of wages. In 1997 workers at a
 phosphate mining enterprise in Zhanatas began a strike to protest nonpayment of
 wages since 199. Strike actions included blocking rail lines into Zhanatas. In Janu-
 ary more than 100 of the workers began a hunger strike, which was called off when
 1 worker, Zhumagali Yegentayev, died of starvation n February.
 tIn June the Southern Kazakhstan oblast court legally dissolved two independent
 unions representing striking workers from the Archpolimetal metallurgical plant in
 
 
 1339
 
 Kentau. The court order found that the unions had "systematically and flagrantly
 violated" laws against unauthorized demonstrations, marches, and rallies. Since
 1992 the unions had staged demonstrations, marches, strikes, and hunger strikes
 to protest chronic nonpayment of wages. Following their dissolution, union leaders
 and CFTUK leader Leonid Solomin announced that the unions were forming a new
 political party to represent workers' interests. The Supreme Court did not rule on
 the legality of the protest march against the Achpolimetal plant in October 1997,
 but the wages in question were paid. New arrears, however, have accumulated.
 The workers involved in the May 1997 strike at the Kapchagai power company
 were paid their arrears, but it is not clear w her they were paid because of a fa-
 vorable court decision.
 As a result of their inability to pay salaries, many enterprises continued to pay
 wages in scrip rather than in cash, a practice at odds with International Labor Or-
 ganization Convention 95 on the protection of wages other than in the legal cur-
 rency without the express consent of the workers. Enterprise directors claimed that
 the enterprises were not being paid in cash by their traditional trading partners in
 other parts of the former Soviet Union, which also were experiencing cash flow dif-
 ficulties as a result of the general economic crisis. The scrip often was not accepted
 at stores or was accepted only at devalued levels.
 By law unions freely may join federations or confederations and affiliate with
 international bodies. Most independent trade unions belong to the CFTUK,
 headquartered in Almaty. The Independent -Miners Federation of Kazakhstan and
 the State Miners' Union of Karaganda are members of the Miners' International
 Federation. Unions belonging to the CFTUK are not members of international fed-
 erations but are able to maintain contacts with foreign trade union federations.
 Independent unions complain about a provision in the Constitution that forbids
 the financing of trade unions by foreign legal entities and citizens, foreign states,
 and international organizations. Since independence in 1991, independent trade
 unions have received financial assistance from the AFL-CIO's Free Trade Union In-
 stitute (FTUI). Most of this assistance ended in 1996 when funding was reduced and
 FTUI- now provides no funding. Independent trade unions have sought new means
 of support; some associations of trade unions were able to receive financing from for-
 eigL sources by registering as "public organizations" rather than labor unions.
 In January CFTUK leader Leonid Solomin was summoned to court for the second
 time in a year on charges of violating the constitutional ban on obtaining financial
 support from foreign sources. The case was postponed repeatedly and was dismissed
 in October when the General Prosecutor's office dropped its appeal. (A case brought
 in 1997 against Solomin also was dropped due to lack of evidence.)
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There are significant limits
 on the right to organize and bargain collectively. Collective bargaining rights are not
 spelled out in the law, although in some instances unions successfully negotiated
 agreements with management. If a union's demands are not acceptable to manage-
 ment, it may present those demands to an arbitration commission composed of man-
 agement, union officials, and independent technical experts. Unions routinely ap-
 pealed to arbitration commissions. There is no legal protection against antiunion
 discrimination.
 There are no export processing zones. Several free economic zones enjoy all the
 -privileges of export processing zones, as well as other tax privileges and abatements,
 but labor conditions, there appear to be no different than elsewhere in the country.
 c. -Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor except-"at the sentence of the court or in the conditions of a state of emergency
 or martial law," and it is generally not known to occur. However, in the north some
 persons still were required to provide labor or the use of privately owned equipment
 with no, or very low, compensation to help gather the annual grain harvest.
 The Constitution does not prohibit specifically forced and bonded labor by chil-
 dren, but such practices are not known to occur.
 d, Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The mini-
 mum age -for employment is 16 years. A child under age 16 may work only with
 the permission of-the local administration and the trade union in the enterprise in
 which the- child would work. Such permission, rarely is granted. Although the Con-
 stitution does not prohibit specifically forced and-bonded labor by children, there
 were no-reports of such practices (see Section 6.c.). Abuse of child labor is generally
 not a problem, although child labor is used routinely in agricultural areas, especially
 during harvest season.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In 1997 the Government resumed setting a
 minimum wage. The- minimum monthly wage was approximately $30 (2,440 tenge)
 during the last guarter of the year. This amount does not provide a decent standard
 of living for a worker and family and fell far short of the approximately $45 (3,644
 
 
 1340
 
 tenge) a month calculated by the Kazakhstan Institute of Nutrition as necessary for
 minimum subsistence for one person.
 The legal maximum workweek is 48 hours, although most enterprises maintained
 a 40-hour workweek, with at least a 24-hour rest period. The Constitution provides
 that labor agreements stipulate the length of working time, vacation days, holidays,
 and paid annual leave for each worker.
 Although the Constitution provides for the right to "safe and hygienic workin
 conditions," working and safety conditions in the industrial sector are substandard.
 Safety consciousness is low. Workers in factories usually do not wear protective
 -clothing, such as goggles and hard hats, and work in conditions of poor visibility
 and ventilation. Management largely ignores regulations concerning occupational
 health and safety, which are enforced by the Ministry of Labor and the state-spon-
 sored unions. Workers, including miners, have no legal right to remove themselves
 from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to continued employment.
