 COSTA RICA
 Stronq democratic traditions have served to give Costa
 Rica an outstanding human rights record. Human rights
 and democracy are guiding principles of the country's
 domestic and foreign oolicy. Costa Rica has effectively
 cooperated on international human rights issues. For
 example it has taken the initiative in calling for
 the establishment of the Inter-American Human Riqhts
 Court and the creation of the *ost of High Commissioner
 for Human Rights at the Unitei Nations.
 Costa Rica is a democratic renublic, with the Government
 divi-ed into three branches: executive, legislative,
 an3 judicial. Although the President is the undisputed
 head of the Government, he does not exercise overwhelming
 control over the other branches. After recent elections
 Government transitions have taken nlace smoothly. In
 1978 the Liberation Party, which had governed the
 country for eight years under two Presidents, was turned
 out in favor of an ooposition coalition.
