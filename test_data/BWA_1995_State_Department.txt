 BOTSWANA
 Botswana is a longstanding, multiparty democracy. Constitutional power is
 shared between the President, Sir Ketumile Masire, and the 44-member popularly
 elected lower house of parliament. The ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP),
 continued to dominate the National Assembly, holding 31 of 44 seats. The opposition
 Botswana National Front (BNF) holds the remaining 13 seats. In October 1994, the
 President was reelected in free and fair elections for a third 5-year term. The Gov-
 ernment respects the constitutional provisions for an independent judiciary.
 The civilian Government exercises effective control over the security forces. The
 military, the Botswana Defense Force (BDF), is responsible for external security.
 The Botswana National Police (BNP) are responsible for internal security. Members
 of the security forces occasionally committed human rights abuses.
 The economy is market-oriented with strong encouragement for private enter-
 prise. Steady diamond revenues and effective economic and fiscal policies resulted
 in steady growth, although the economy grew at a relatively modest annual rate of
 4 percent following a downturn from 1991 to 1993. Per capita gross domestic prod-
 
 
 uct was approximately $2,800 in 1995. Over 50 percent of the population is em-
 poyed in the informal sector, largely subsistence farming and animal husbandry.
 Rural poverty remains a serious problem, as does a widely skewed income distribu-
 tion.
 The Constitution provides for citizens' human rights, and the Government gen-
 erally respects those rights in practice. Despite some continuing problems, Bot-
 swana s overall human rights record has been consistently positive since independ-
 ence. There were credible reports that the police sometimes mistreated criminal sus-
 pects in order to coerce confessions, and members of the police riot squad were ac-
 cused of using excessive force in quelling violent student demonstrations in Feb-
 ruary. Women continued to face legal and societal discrimination, and violence
 against women is a continuing problem. Some Batswana including groups not num-
 bered among the eight "principal tribes" identified in the Constitution, because they
 live in remote areas, still do not enjoy full access to social services and, in practice
 are marginaized in the political process. In many instances the judicial system did
 not provide timely fair trials due to a serious backlog of cases. Trade unions contin-
 ued to face some legal restrictions, and the Government did not always ensure that
 labor laws were observed in practice.
 The Government took a number of steps to address human rights problems in
 1995. In September the Government announced plans to construct a separate deten-
 tion facility for refused asylum seekers, and in August Parliament ratified the Citi-
 zenship Amendment Act, designed to bring Botswana legislation into conformity
 with the Constitution, and remedy citizenship gender inequities. In March Bot-
 swana ratified the International Convention on the Rights of the Child.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Exrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings.
 In a case related to February's violent student protest, a member of the riot police
 (the Special Support Group--SSG) was convicted of the murder of a young man who
 apparently had no connection with the demonstrations. Hearings in mitigation of
 sentence were scheduled for February 1996.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution explicitly forbids torture, inhuman, and degrading treatment or
 punishment. The authorities generally respect this prohibition in practice, and in
 some cases have taken disciplinary or judicial action against persons responsible for
 abuses. However, instances of abuse do occur. While coerced confessions are inad-
 missible in court, evidence gathered through coercion or abuse may be used in pros-
 ecution. There were credible reports that police sometimes used intimidation tech-
 niques in order to obtain evidence or elicit confessions. In the past, police sometimes
 suffocated criminal suspects with a plastic bag. In 1995 there were no allegations
 of similar mistreatment, and beatings and other forms of extreme physical abuse re-
 mained rare.
 In February some poorly trained members of the SSG reportedly used excessive
 force to quell violent student demonstrations over the Government's failure to pros-
 ecute suspects in a ritual murder of a 14-year-old girl. In separate incidents related
 to the demonstrations, one person was killed and another paralyzed. Several stu-
 dents arrested after the riots alleged police assault. Students who had been detained
 were released and charges against them dropped.
 Unlike past years, there were no reports that Department of Wildlife and Na-
 tional Parks (DWNP) wardens tortured suspected poachers in remote areas. Both
 the DWNP and the rest of the Government have long condemned such practices.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, although overcrowding
 is a problem. The Government permits visits by human rights monitors, and women
 in custody are placed in the charge of female officers.
 The Government neither forcibly repatriates nor deports failed asylum seekers,
 but it has incarcerated them alongside convicted felons. By mid-year all previously
 incarcerated asylum seekers had been permitted to move to Dukwe Refugee Camp,
 and only a few new arrivals suspected to be economic migrants were being incarcer-
 ated. In September the Government announced plans to build a dedicated facility
 for refused asylum seekers.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Under the Constitution "every person in
 Botswana" is entitled to due process, the presumption of innocence, and freedom
 from arbitrary arrest. The authorities respected these guarantees in practice. Upon
 arrest, suspects must be informed of their legal rights, including the right to remain
 
 
 14
 silent, to be allowed to contact a person of their choice, and generally to be charged
 before a magistrate within 48 hours. A magistrate may order a suspect held for 14
 days through a writ of detention, which may be renewed every 14 days. Most citi-
 zens charged with noncapital offenses are released on their own recognizance; some
 are released with minimal bail. Detention without bail is highly unusual, except in
 murder cases, where it is mandated. Detainees have the right to hire attorneys of
 their choice.
 Poor police training and poor communications in rural villages make it difficult
 for detainees to obtain legal assistance, however, and authorities do not always fol-
 low judicial safeguards. The Government does not provide counsel for the indigent,
 except in capital cases, and there is no public defender service. Two nongovern-
 mental organizations (NGO's)-the University of Botswana Legal Assistance Center
 and the Botswana Center for Human Rights--provide pro bono legal services, but
 their capacity is limited. Constitutional protections are not applied to illegal immi-
 grants, although the constitutionality of denying them due process has not been
 tested in court.
 Following student demonstrations in February (see Section 1.c.), police arrested
 several hundred persons. All detainees were subsequently released and charges
 were dropped.
 The Government does not use exile for political purposes.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice.
 The judiciary consists of both a civil court (including magistrates courts, a High
 Court, and a Court of Appeal) and a customary (traditional) court system. The law
 provides for the right to a fair trial. The civil courts remained unable to provide for
 timely, fair trials in many cases, however, due to severe staffing shortages and an
 accumulated backlog of pending cases. The courts are making a major effort to clear
 this backlog, especially in murder cases.
 Most trials in the regular courts are public, although trials under the National
 Security Act (NSA) may be held in secret. As a rule, courts appoint public defenders
 only for those charged with capital crimes (murder and treason). Those charged with
 noncapital crimes are often tried without legal representation if they cannot afford
 an attorney. As a result, many defendants may not be informed of their rights in
 pretrial or trial proceedings.
 Implementation of the 1994 Anticorruption Act assuaged earlier concerns that it
 would weaken the defendant's constitutional presumption of innocence.
 Most citizens encounter the legal system through the customary courts, under the
 authority of a traditional leader. These courts handle minor offenses involving land,
 marital, and property disputes. In customary courts, the defendant does not have
 legal counsel and there are no precise rules of evidence. Tribal judges, appointed
 by the tribal leader or elected by the community, determine sentences, which may
 be appealed through the civil court system. The quality of decisions reached in the
 traditional courts varies considerably. In communities where chiefs and their deci-
 sions are respected, plaintiffs tend to take their cases to the customary court; other-
 wise, people seek justice from the civil courts.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the protection of privacy and the security of the person,
 and government authorities generally respect these rights.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion, both individual and corporate, and the Government respects this right in prac-
 tice. Botswana has a long tradition of vigorous, candid, and unimpeded public dis-
 course.
 The independent press is small, but lively and frequently critical of the Govern-
 ment and the President. It reports without fear of closure, censorship, or intimida-
 tion. The Government also subsidizes a free daily newspaper which depends heavily
 on the official Botswana Press Agency (BOPA) for its material. The broadcast media
 remain a government monopoly, with radio the most important medium of informa-
 tion in this highly dispersed society. Radio Botswana follows government policies
 and draws most of its stories from BOPA. Opposition leaders have access to the
 radio, but they complain-with some justification-that their air time is signifi-
 cantly limited. There are no privately owned radio or television stations, but there
 is a semilegal television station broadcasting to viewers in the capital city. Inde-
 pendent radio and television from neighboring South Africa are easily received.

 On occasion the Government has taken steps, under loosely defined provisions of
 the NSA, to limit publication of national security information. However, the courts
 dismissed in March the only recent case, filed in 1993, against two journalists.
 Academic freedom is not restricted.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no barriers to domestic and international travel or migration.
 Citizenship is not revoked for political reasons.
 The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and
 other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. There were no reports of
 forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status. While asylum seek-
 ers entering Botswana are still occasionally placed in prisons with convicted felons
 on arrival, the Government has made substantial progress in providing a more se-
 cure environment for those whose applications for permanent asylum have been re-
 jected. In August it released a number of failed asylum seekers from prison and per-
 mitted them to reside at Dukwe Refugee Camp, and in September announced plans
 to build a separate facility for asylum seekers.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal adult (21 years) suffrage. The Botswana
 Democratic Party continued to dominate Parliament following the October 1994
 elections, ensuring the reelection of BDP leader Sir Ketumile Masire as President.
 The opposition Botswana National Front, the only opposition party to win seats, in-
 creased its representation from 3 to 13 seats.
 The House of Chiefs, an advisory upper chamber of Parliament with limited pow-
 ers, is constitutionally restricted to the eight "principal tribes" of the Tswana nation.
 Consequently, other groups (e.g., the Basarwa "bushmen," Herero, Kalanga,
 Humbukush, Baloi, or Lozi) are not represented there. Given the limited authority
 of the House of Chiefs, the impact of excluding other groups of Botswana citizens
 is largely symbolic, but it is viewed as important in principle by some non-Setswana
 speakers. Members of the National Assembly are required to be able to speak Eng-
 lish. This restriction has never been challenged in court.
 In practice, women are underrepresented in the political process. Although women
 constitute just over 50 percent of the population, there are only 4 women among the
 44 members of the National Assembly, and only 2 women in the Cabinet.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Domestic and international human rights groups operate without government re-
 striction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Govern-
 ment officials are generally cooperative and responsive to such inquiries.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution and Penal Code forbid discrimination on the basis of ethnicity,
 nationality, or creed, but do not address discrimination based on sex. These provi-
 sions are implemented in practice by the government authorities.
 Women.-Violence against women, primarily beatings, remains a serious problem.
 Under customary law and in common rural practice men have the right to "chastise"
 their wives. Statistics are believed to underreport the levels of abuse against
 women. Police are rarely called to intervene in cases of domestic violence, and there
 were no court cases related to domestic violence in 1995. Spousal abuse is beginning
 to receive increased attention both from the media and from local human rights
 groups.
 Women in Botswana do not have the same civil rights as men. However, one im-
 portant step was the resolution of the "Unity Dow" case through the ratification of
 the Citizenship Amendment Act in August. This Act brought an end to discrimina-
 tion against women in transmitting citizenship to children.
 A number of other laws, many of which are attributed to traditional practices, re-
 strict civil and economic opportunities for women. A woman married in "common
 property" is held to be a legal minor, requiring her husband's consent to buy or sell
 property, apply for credit, and enter into legally binding contracts. Women have,
 and are increasingly exercising, the right to marriage "out of common property," in
 
 
 which case they retain their full legal rights as adults. Polygyny is still legal under
 traditional law and with the consent of the first wife, but it is rarely practiced. The
 Government announced its intention to review all potentially discriminatory legisla-
 tion, although the precise modalities of this review had not been finalized at year's
 end.
 Well trained urban women enjoy growing entry level access to the white collar job
 market, but the number of opportunities decreases sharply as they rise in seniority.
 Discrimination against women is most acute in rural areas where women work pri-
 marily in subsistence agriculture.
 A number of women's organizations have emerged to promote the status of
 women. The Government has entered into a dialog with many of these groups.
 While some women's rights groups reportedly felt that the Government has been
 slow to respond concretely to their concerns, women's NGO's say that they are en-
 couraged by the direction of change, and by the increasingly collaborative relation-
 ship with government authorities. Within the Ministry of Labor and Home Affairs,
 the coordinator of the small Women's Affairs Unit is charged with handling women's
 issues.
 Children.-The Government provides 7 years of education for children. The rights
 of children are addressed in the Constitution and the 1981 Children's Act. Under
 the Act, Botswana has a court system and social service apparatus designed solely
 for juveniles. There is no pattern of societal abuse against children. Botswana rati-
 fied the Convention on the Rights of the Child in March.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government does not discriminate on the basis of
 physical or mental disability, although employment opportunities for the disabled
 remain limited. The Government does not require accessibility to public buildings
 and public conveyances for people with disabilities, and the NGO community has
 only recently begun to address the needs of the disabled.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Tswana majority, of which the Constitu-
 tion recognizes eight principal tribes, has a tradition of peacefully coexisting with
 "minor" tribes. Each of the eight principal tribes is represented in the advisory
 House of Chiefs, while the other groups are permitted only a subchief, who is not
 a member of the House. Other than the lack of schooling in their own language and
 representation  in  the House of Chiefs, Botswana's Bantu       minorities and
 nonindigenous minorities, such as the white and Asian communities, are not subject
 to discrimination. However, the nomadic Basarwa remain marginalized and have
 lost access to their traditional land. The Basarwa are vulnerable to exploitation, and
 their isolation, ignorance of civil rights, and lack of representation in local or na-
 tional government have stymied their progress.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of associa-
 tion, and in practice, all workers, with the exception of government employees, are
 free to join or organize unions of their own choosing. Government workers may form
 associations that function as quasi-unions but without the right to negotiate wages.
 The industrial or wage economy is small, and unions are concentrated largely in the
 mineral and to a lesser extent in the railway and banking sectors. There is only one
 major confederation, the Botswana Federation of Trade Unions (BFTU), but there
 are no obstacles to the formation of other labor federations.
 Unions are independent of the Government and are not closely allied with any
 political party or movement. Unions may employ administrative staff, but the law
 requires elected union officials to work full time in the industry the union rep-
 resents. This severely limits union leaders' professionalism and effectiveness and
 has been criticized by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
 (ICFTU).
 In addition, the law severely restricts the right to strike. Legal strikes are theo-
 retically possible after an exhaustive arbitration process, but in practice none of the
 country's strikes to date has been legal.
 Unions may join international organizations, and the BFTU is affiliated with the
 ICFTU. The Minister of Labor must approve any affiliation with an outside labor
 movement, but unions may appeal to the courts if an application for affiliation is
 refused.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution provides for
 collective bargaining for unions that have enrolled 25 percent of a labor force. In
 reality, only the mineworker unions have the organizational strength to engage in
 collective bargaining, and collective bargaining is virtually nonexistent in most other
 sectors.
 
 
 17
 Workers may not be fired for union related activities. Dismissals may be appealed
 to labor officers or civil courts, but labor offices rarely do more than order 2-months'
 severance pay.
 Botswana -has only one export processing zone-in the town of Selebi-Phikwe-
 which is subject to the same labor laws as the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution specifically for-
 bids forced or compulsory labor, and it is not praticed.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Although education is not compul-
 sory the Government provides 7 years of free education to every child, and most
 chilQren in Botswana take advantage of this opportunity. Only an immediate family
 member may employ a child 13-years-old or younger, and no juvenile under 15 years
 may be employe in any industry. Only persons over 16 years may be hired to per-
 form night work, and no person under 16 years is allowed to assume hazardous
 labor, including in mining. District and municipal councils have child welfare divi-
 sions which are responsible for enforcing child labor laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum monthly wage for full time labor
 is $100 (270 pula), which is just under 50 percent of what the Government cal-
 culates is necessary to meet the basic needs of a family of five. The Ministry of
 Labor is responsible for enforcing the minimum wage, and each of the country's dis-
 tricts has at least one labor inspector. The Ministry of Labor began developing a
 small number of potential cases to take to the Industrial Court, but none had been
 brought before the Court by year's end.
 Formal sector jobs almost always pay well above minimum wage levels. Informal
 sector employment, particularly in the agricultural and domestic service sectors
 where housing and food are included, frequently pay below the minimum wage. The
 Ministry of Labor recommends a monthly minimum wage of $92.60 (250 pula) for
 domestics, but this is not mandatory. Illegal immigrants, primarily Zambians and
 Zimbabweans, are easily exploited as they would be subject to deportation if they
 filed grievances against employers.
 Botswana law permits a maximum 48-hour workweek, exclusive of overtime
 which is payable at time and a half for each additional hour. Most modern private
 and public sector jobs are on the 40-hour workweek.
 Workers who complain about hazardous conditions cannot be fired. The Govern-
 ment's institutional ability to enforce its workplace safety legislation remains lim-
 ited, however, by inadequate staffing and unclear jurisdictions between different
 ministries. Nevertheless, worker safety is generally provided for by employers, with
 the occasionally notable exception of the construction industry.
