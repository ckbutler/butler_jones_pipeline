 MAURITANIA
 Mauritania is an Islamic republic. The 1991 Constitution provides for a civilian
 government composed of a dominant executive branch, a Senate and National As-
 sembly, and an independent judiciary. President Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya
 has governed since 1984, first as head of a military junta, and since the 1992 elec-
 tion as head of a civilian government. President Taya won 62 percent of the vote
 in the four-way presidential contest, which was widely regarded as fraudulent. Most
 opposition parties boycotted the subsequent parliamentary elections. The President
 and the Government have strong military support.
 The Government maintains order with regular armed forces, the National Guard,
 the Gendarmerie (a specialized corps of paramilitary police), and the police. The
 Ministry of Defense directs the armed forces and Gendarmerie; the Ministry of Inte-
 rior directs the National Guard and police. The armed forces are responsible for na-
 tional defense. The National Guard performs police functions throughout the coun-
 try in areas in which city police are not present. The Gendarmerie is a paramilitary
 group responsible for maintenance of civil order in and outside metropolitan areas.
 Some members of the security forces committed human rights abuses.
 Mauritania, with a population of 2.2 million, has a generally market-oriented
 economy based on subsistence farming, herding, and a small commercial sector.
 Drought, desertification, insect infestation, rapid urbanization, extensive unemploy-
 ment, pervasive poverty, and a burdensome foreign debt handicap the economy. In-
 
 
 166
 adequate recent rainfall has contributed to urbanization, further straining govern-
 ment finances. Annual per capita national income is estimated at $560. Mauritania
 receives foreign assistance from various bilateral and multilateral sources each year.
 The Government's human rights record improved, but problems remain in certain
 areas. During January riots in Nouakchott, The authorities detained and subse-
 quently released opposition leaders and forcibly broke up peaceful demonstrations
 to protest the detentions. Although in the case of the pro-Iraqi Baathists rounded
 up in October, the Government held public trials and defendants were represented
 by attorney, there were credible reports that the police tortured approximately a
 dozen persons during pretrial detention. According to credible sources, the trial was
 marred by abuses, including the conviction of some defendants on questionable evi-
 dence. The December convictions of Baathists for membership in an illegal political
 organization were subsequently overturned on appeal, and the persons released. The
 Government in November took an important step to resolve a serious abuse from
 the 1989-91 period, in which approximately 70,000 Mauritanians were expelled or
 fled, by authorizing the Mauritanian Red Crescent Association, with the technical
 assistance of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, to assist the returnees from
 the refugee camps in Senegal. The Government has yet to address fully another
 major abuse from the 1989-91 period, when some 503 members of the military were
 killed, tortured and maimed, almost entirely from the Halpulaar ethnic group. In
 1993 the Parliament passed an amnesty bill to preclude legal pursuit of those re-
 sponsible. The Government has, however, compensated, but not apologized to most
 survivors and families of those killed. Democratic institutions are still rudimentary,
 and the Government circumscribes citizens' right to change their government.
 Ethnic tensions persist, and many members of the Halpulaar, Soninke, and Wolof
 ethnic groups are underrepresented and feel excluded from effective political rep-
 resentation.
 Although the Government has instituted some judicial reforms, the executive con-
 tinues to influence the judiciary, and in practice the right to a fair trial continues
 to be restricted. Police often used brutal methods, arbitrary arrest, and prolonged-
 and often incommunicado-detention. Prison conditions are harsh and unhealthy.
 The Government continued to restrict political activity, seize publications and limit
 freedom of religion. Societal discrimination against women continues and female
 genital mutilation remains a serious concern.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings, but two persons are known to have died while in police custody. A Gha-
 naan arrested in June died after less than 24 hours in police custody; police stated
 that the cause of death was a drug overdose but would not allow an autopsy. Credi-
 ble observers believe that police mistreatment was the cause of death.
 In December a National Guard patrol fatally beat an army officer who protested
 to them their rough treatment of students in Aleg who were protesting price in-
 creases. The officer subsequently collapsed at guard headquarters and died en route
 to the hospital. Informed sources confirmed that beating was the cause of death.
 Extrajudicial killings from past years, primarily of African-Mauritanians, re-
 mained unresolved. The principal example of such killing involves the 1990-91
 deaths while in military custody of 503 largely Halpulaar and Soninke military -
 sonnel and civilians detained in the investigation of an alleged coup attempt. We
 military has not released the results of its 1991 internal investigation, and in 1993
 the National Assembly passed an amnesty law which prevents any charges from
 being brought against members of the armed forces, security forces, or other citizens
 involved in the abuses committed between January 1990 and April 1992. In June
 1993, the Government passed a law granting compensation to relatives of those who
 were killed. In July 1993 the Government began to pay compensation to widows and
 families of those killed.
 The Government's failure to bring to justice officials who committed extrajudicial
 killings and other abuses has contributed to widespread popular dissatisfaction with
 the judicial system.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture and other forms of cruel or inhuman punishment, but the
 police continue on occasion to beat criminal suspects while in custody. Police used
 excessive force to break up peaceful demonstrations or disperse crowds. There were
 credible reports that a dozen or so of the 72 suspected pro-Iraqi Baathist sympathiz-
 ers arrested in October were tortured by police during pretrial detention. Authori-
 
 
 167
 ties rarely tried or punished persons suspected of committing such abuses. In July
 the Government suspended special security measures in the Guidimaka area and
 reduced security forces, resulting in fewer abuses. Later in July two army officers
 received unspecified sanctions for their failure to observe the new and more strict
 Prison conditions are harsh and do not meet minimum humanitarian standards.
 There is severe overcrowding, unsanitary conditions, and inadequate food and medi-
 cal treatment. The independent press reported the suspicious death in May of an
 inmate in Rasso; authorities cited natural causes, although witnesses claimed to
 have evidence of mistreatment. There was also a report of a detainee's death (see
 Section 1.a.). The central prison in Nouakchott, which was built for a prison popu-
 lation of 200 men, now houses more than 700. Observers report better conditions
 at the women's prison and children's detention center in Nouakchott. A French non-
 governmental organization (NGO), Pharmaciens sans Frontieres, which was asked
 in 1994 by the Government to coordinate international assistance for a large-scale
 project to irprove overallprison conditions, has completed its plans and is soliciting
 international assistance. To ease overcrowding, the Government plans to construct
 a new prison in Akjoujt.
 d. Arbitrary Arret, Detention, or Exle.-The Constitution provides for due process
 and the presumption of innocence until proven guilty by an established tribunal. It
 stipulates that authorities cannot arrest, detain, prosecute, or punish anyone except
 as provided for under the law. Actual application of these safeguards continued to
  e case to case.
 The aw reqires that courts review the legality of a person's detention within 48
 hours of arrest. The plice may extend the periadfor another 48 hours, and a ros-
 ecutor or court may detain pe rsons foru up to days in national security cases. Dur-
 ing the October crackdown against Baathist elements, the authorities held suspects
 incommunicado and without access to counsel in prearraignient detention fr 14
 days. They were subsequently released on appeal.
 Only afer the prosecutor submits charges can a suspect contact an attorney.
 There were credible reports that police detained other persons incommunicado for
 extended periods without charge. In January, following rioting in Nouakhott that
 was sparked by increases in bread prices, the authorities detained eight opposition
 political leaders for 2 weeks, holding them incommunicado in the interior of the
 Pretrial detention is extensive, and approximately 50 percent of the prison popu-
 lation has not been tried. In one case, six individuals arrested in 1992 for the mur-
 der of a shopkeepr in the Southern town of Sry-Male were tried in 1995 after 3
 years of p rerial detention; three defendants were found guilty and three were ac-
 quitted of the charges. Some indicted prisoners are released before trial without ex-
 planation; familial, tribal, or olitical connections may explain some of these cases.
 There is a prvision for granting bail, but it is rarely used.
 Occasional reports of arbitrary arrests and intimidation committed by security
 forces continued articularly in communities along the Senegal River, but the ex-
 tent of abuses decined.
 e. Denial t Fair Public Tria.-Although the Constitution provides for the inde-
 pendnce of the judiciary, in practice the executive branch exercises significant con-
 trl and influence over the judiciary, which is only nominally independent. The Min-
 istry of Justice appoints judges and subjects the courts to pressure in reaching ver-
 dicts. In addition to government influence over verdicts, the judicial system's fair-
 ness is limited by poorly educated and poorly trained judges who are susceptible to
 tribal, social, and financial pressures. Moreover, Islamic law (Shari'a), tribal rela-
 tions, and personal connections continue to dominate some judicial decisions, par-
 ticularly concerning personal status issues such as inheritance and divorce.
 The formal judicial system includes a system of lower, middle, and upper level
 courts, each with specific jurisdictions. Bridging the traditional and modern systems
 of justice are 43 department-level tribunals staffed by Qadis, traditional Islamic
 magistrates trained primarily in Koranic law. Mauritanians seeking legal redress in
 civil matters must address themselves to one of these tribunals, which operate on
 the basis of both Shari'n and secular legal codes. Three regional courts of appeal
 handle challenges to decisions at the department and regional levels. Nominally
 independent, the Supreme Court is headed by a magstrate appointed to a 5-year
 term by the President. The Supreme Court reviews decisions and rulings made by
 the courts of appeal to determine their compliance with the law. Constitutional re-
 view is the purve w of a six-member Constitutional Council, composed of three mem-
 bers named by the President, two by the National Assembly president, and one by
 the Senate president. Annual review of judicial decisions is undertaken by the Su-
 preme Council of the Magistrature, over which the President presides; the President
 
 
 and senior vice president of the Supreme Court, the Minister of Justice, three mag-
 istrates, and representatives from the Senate and National Assembly are members
 of this Council. This year the Government began work to codify laws and establish
 a court of arbitration.
 In theory, all defendants, regardless of the court or their ability to gay, have the
 legal right to representation by counsel during the proceedings, which are open to
 the public. There is ne provision for public defenders for those unable to pay for
 their own counsel. The law provides that defendants may confront witnesses,
 present evidence, and appeal their sentences, but in practice, these rights are not
 regularly a pp lied.
 hecause Sbari'a is practiced, courts do not treat women as equals of men: for ex-
 ample, the testimony of two women is necessary to equal that of one man. In addi-
 tion, in awarding an indemnity to the family of a woman who has been killed, the
 courts grant only hal the amount they would award for a man's death. In addition,
 there are no female magistrates.
 According to legal sources, the 10 persons convicted and serving prison terms in
 connection with the December Baathist trial may be regarded as political priconers
 because their conviction on questionable evidence suggested political considerations
 played a role. The December convictions of Baathists for membership in an illegal
 political organization were subsequently overturned on appeal, and the persons re-
 leased.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 requires judicial warrants in order to execute home searches, but the authorities
 often ignore this requirement. During the detention of opposition politicians follow-
 ing the January bread riots, authorities searched some opposition partie3' offices
 without warrants. During the anti-Baathist crackdown, authorities conducted
 searches without warrants of offices of the Baathist Party and of a party member.
 Government surveillance of dissidents and the political opposition is believed to
 continue, although the extent to which the Government used informants is un-
 known.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, but the Government continues to restrict these rights through
 prepublication press censorship by the Interior Ministry. NGO's and the privately
 owned press openly criticized the Government and its leaders. Antigovernment
 tracts, newsletters, and petitions circulate widely in Nouakchott and other towns.
 All newspapers and political parties must register with the Ministry of the Inte-
 rior. Although the Government did not refuse to register any journal, it permanently
 banned publication of two allegedly pro-Baathist Arabic language weekly news-
 papers, Akhbar A1-Usbou and AI-Ufuq Al-Arabi. Twenty-nine independent privately
 owned newspapers were published this year, many on an irregular basis. For the
 most part, these journals are weeklies, published in Arabic or French, and reach
 only a limited audience. However, the country's first independent daily, Mauritanie
 Nouvelles, began publication in September.
 The Ministry of the Interior reviews all newspaper copy prior to publication. The
 Press Law provides that the Minister of the Interior can stop publication of material
 discrediting Islam or threatening national security. Although the Ministry did not
 excise material from journals or otherwise censor individual articles, the authorities
 seized 14 individual issues of various journals; by comparison, in 1994 at least 20
 individual issues were seized. In some cases, the Government explained its action,
 by claiming that certain newspapers which it seized contained false allegations con-
 cerning neighboring countries which could impinge on national security. In other in-
 stances, the Government provided no specific reason for the seizures. The Govern-
 ment has expressed its willingness to work with the independent press on revision
 of the restrictive Press Law, with a view to circumscribing government censure and
 increasing press autonomy.
 The electronic media (radio and television) and two of the country's three daily
 newspapers, Horizon and Chaab, are government owned and operated. Radio is the
 most important medium in reaching the public, and the official media strongly sup-
 port government policies. Although the radio is required by law to provide equal
 broadcast time to all political parties during electoral campaigns, which it did dur-
 ing the 1994 municipal elections, opposition parties' access to the radio is sharply
 limited at other times.
 The country's one university is government funded and operated. Academic free-
 dom is generally respected, and there were no cases in which the government pre-
 vented professors from pursuing their research interests, from publication, or
 censored their lectures.
 
 
 169
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, and for the most part the Government respects
 this right, although there were occasions when it restricted public gatherings. The
 law requres that all recognized political parties and NGO's apply to the local pre-
 fect for permission for lage meetings or assemblies. Permission is generally freely
 and objectively granted, athouh on a few occasions the prefect denied permission
 for opposition gatherings. In January, security forces forcibly dispersed peaceful
 marches and demonstrations held following the bread riots to p rotest the detention
 of opposition leaders. In March police prevented the opposition Union for Democracy
 and Progress (UDP) from using vans to brimg supprters to a rally, and prevented
 the party from publicizing the event. Also in March, the authorities denied another
 opposition party, the Union of Democratic Forces/New Era (UDF-EN) access to radio
 and television to publicize a rally.
 The number of political parties, labor confederations, and NGO's continued to in-
 crease. Some 20 political parties and a wide array of NGO's, many of them highly
 critical of the Government, met openly, issued public statements, and chose their
 own leadership. The Government recognized a number of newly formed NGO's. It
 has not yet granted some NGO's official standing but allowed them to operate. It
 has not yet recognized, for example, the Mauritanian Association for Human Rights,
 claiming that it appeals to specific ethnic groups, namely the African-Mauritanian
 community, and is a potentially divisive force. However, the Government allows the
 association to function.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Mauritania is an Islamic republic, and the law provides
 that all citizens are Sunni Muslims and prohibited from converting to another reli-
 gion. The Government prohibits proselytizing by non-Muslims. Christian churches
 have been established in Nouakchott, Atar, Zourat, Nouadhibou, and Rosso. The ex-
 patriate community of Christians and the few Mauritanian citizens who are consid-
 ered Christians from birth practice their religion openly and freely in these church-
 es. Mauritanian Muslims freely attend Christian weddings and funerals when in-
 vited and on occasion have performed the formal witness role at Catholic weddings.
 The possession of bibles and other Christian religious materials in private homes
 is not illegal. There have been no reports in recent years of Mauitanians being har-
 assed for possessing non-Islamic religious materials or for showing interest in ob-
 taining infration on Christianity.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement and residence with-
 in all pvarts of the territory, and garantees the freedom to enter and leave. Histori-
 cally there were few restrictions on travel in Maritania's traditional nomadic soci-
 ety. With urbanization and automobile travel, the Governmen t  up regular road
 checkpoints where the Gendarmerie checks papers of travelers. The Government
 also imposed a nighttime curfew for 8 days in Nouakchott and other cities in re-
 sponse to the bread riots. The number of curfews in the Senegal border region was
 significantly lower than in previous years, reflecting gradual normalization in the
 area and reduction in the frequency of cross-border raids. There were no reported
 cases of prsons being denied passports for political reasons.
 Of the approximately 70,000 African-Mauritanians who were expelled by Mauri-
 tania or fledt Senegal during the 1989-1990 crisis, an estimated 20,000 have re-
 turned. However, the estimated 65,000 refugees currently in refugee settlements in
 Senegal include 15,000 children born there since 1989. Results of a census con-
 ducted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in July
 have yet to be released. Many of the 15,000 Mauritanian Halpulaar who took refuge
 in Mali during the crisis have integrated into the population, and the UNHCR dis-
 continued at the end of 1994 the limited assistance it had been providing to them.
 According to the UNHR, the Government is making satisfactory efforts to assist
 refugees returning from Senegal. Authorities are issuing identification cards to
 some, and returning land, houses, and even personal property when it can be lo-
 cated and identified. Many whole villages have returned. Many individuals have re-
 turned without fomally leaving the refugee camps, to which they return periodi-
 cally for free food and medical care.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government, but
 the Government circumscribes it in practice. The 1992 multiparty election of a civil-
 ian president ended 14 years of military role, but beth the opposition and inter-
 national observers concluded that the elections were fraudulent. Following the ele-
 tions, the military continued to provide strong support to the regime, and some
 
 
 170
 members of the former Military Council, in addition to President Taya, remained
 inpositions of power within the Government and armed forces.
 Because the major opposition parties, including the UDF-EN, boycotted the 1992
 National Assembly elections, the President's party, the Republican, Democratic and
 Social Party (PRDS), dominates the General Assembly, holding 66 of 79 seats. The
 PRDS and opposition political parties, as well as independent candidates, partici-
 pated in the 1994 Senate elections, and PRDS candidates won all but 1 of the 18
 seats at stake. Both the opposition and the government parties committed fraud
 during 1994 elections for Municipal Councils, which in turn elect Senators.
 Women have the right to vote, and are active in election campaigns, although few
 are in positions of political leadership. There are seven women in senior government
 ositions, including one Cabinet member and one mayor, there are no women mem-
 ers   of the   National Assembly. Halpulaars, Soninkes, and       Wolofs  are
 underrepresented in senior government positions. Of the Government's 24 ministe-
 rial posts, 2 incumbents are Haratine, 3 Halpulaar, and 1 Soninke; the remainder
 are either white (Moors) or of mixed white Moor/Haratine ethnicity (see Section 5.).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There is an increasing number of human rights organizations. The oldest is the
 Mauritanian League for Human Rights, an independent but government-recognized
 body. The League has occasionally played a mediating role between the Government
 and representatives of the refugees in Senegal and victims of the 1990-91 military
 K urge. A second and as yet unrecognized organization, the Mauritanian Human
 ights Association (AMDH), while not affiliated with the opposition, has many oppo-
 sition members. It has been more critical of the Government than the League, par-
 ticularly on the unresolved abuses of the 1989-91 period. The AMDH called on the
 Government to be more forthcoming in addressing the vestiges of slavery (see Sec-
 tion 6.c.).
 Various other organizations were established to address human rights issues. The
 pan-African organization Gerddes-Africa, or International Study and Research
 Group on Democracy and Economic and Social Development in Africa, established
 a branch in Mauritania. Two other groups, SOS-Esclaves and the National Commit-
 tee for the Struggle Against the Vestiges of Slavery in Mauritania focus their efforts
 on overcoming the country's vestiges of slavery. The Committee of Solidarity with
 the Victims of Repression in Mauritania is concerned with the plight of the 1989
 expellees. The Committee of the Widows focuses on the victims of the 1990-91 mili-
 tary purge and their families, and in August, the victims formed a new group, the
 Collective of Survivors. In September the Consultative Group for the Return of the
 Refugees was founded to promote the return of the remaining Mauritanian refugees
 in Senegal. These groups function openly, but their activities are somewhat cir-
 cumscribed because they are not officially recognized (see Section 2.b.).
 A delegation from the Interafrican Union for Human Rights made a 7-day visit
 to Mauritania in July; representatives of Freedom House also visited. Government
 officials met with both groups, which reported that authorities had allowed them to
 meet with whomever they wished. There were no reports of harassment or reprisal
 against Mauritanian interlocutors during or following the visits. In previous years,
 the Government and the Human Rights WatclfAfrica, which has published articles
 strongly critical of the Government's human rights record, could not agree on the
 terms for a visit. The organization sought written government guarantees concern-
 ing freedom of movement and unimpeded access to citizens; the Government would
 only give verbal assurances.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equality before the law for all citizens, reg ardless
 of race, national origin, sex, or social status, and prohibits racially or et~inically
 based propaganda. In practice, the Government often favors individuals on the basis
 of ethnic and tribal affiliation, seial status, and political ties. Discrimination
 against women is endemic, although the situation is improving.
 Women.-Traditional forms of mistreatment of women continue, mostly in isolated
 rural communities, but these practices appear to be on the decline. Such mistreat-
 ment consists of forced feeding of adolescent girls (gavage) and female genital muti-
 lation (see below).
 Human rights monitors and women lawyers report that physical mistreatment of
 women by their husbands is limited. The police and judiciary occasionally intervene
 in domestic abuses, but women in traditional society usually do not seek legal re-
 
 
 171
 dress, relying instead upon family and ethnic group members to resolve domestic
 disputes.
 Women have legal rights to property and child custody, and, among the more
 modern and urbaniz ed population, these rights are recognized. In theory, marriage
 and divorce do not require the woman's consent. Polygyny exists and, as sanctioned
 by the teachings of Islam, a woman does not have the right to refuse her husband's
 wish to marry additional wives. However, it is common in Moor society for a woman
 to obtain, at the time of marriage, a contractual agreement that stipulates that her
 husband must grant her a divorce if he chooses an additional wife. In practice, po-
 lygyny and arranged marriages are increasingly rare, particularly among the Moor
 population. Women also frequently initiate a divorce.
 There are no legal restrictions on the education of women, and increasing num-
 bers of women attend university.
 The Government seeks to open new employment opportunities for women in areas
 which are traditionally filled by men, such as health care, communications, police,
 and customs services.
 The law provides that men and women receive equal pay for equal work. While
 not universally applied in practice, the two largest employers, the civil service and
 state mining company, respect this law. In the modern wage sector, women also re-
 ceive genrous family benefits, including 3 months of maternity leave.
 Children.--The Government does not require attendance at school and a lack of
 financial resources limits available educational opportunities. The law makes special
 prvisions for the rotection of children's welfare, and the Government has pro-
 rams to care for abandoned children. These programs are, however, hampered by
 inadequate funding. The Government relies on foreign donors in such areas as child
 immunization. Moreover, it does not enforce existing child labor laws, and children
 perform a signifFicant amount of labor in support of family activities. There are iso-
 lated but credible press reports of parents agreeing, in exchange for money, to send
 their young children to work in foreign countries. The most common cases are of
 boys aged 8 to 10 years sent to work as 'jockeys" or herders in the United Arab
 Emirates or Qatar.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM) is widely condemned by international health ex-
 perts as damaging to both physical and psychological health. It is performed most
 often on young girls and continues among all ethnic groups except the Wolof. Re-
 portedly, 95 percent of Soninke and Halpulaar women undergo FGM, as do 30 per-
 cent of Moor women. For the most part, the least severe form of excision is prac-
 tied, although some grups practice nfibulation, the most severe form of FGM. Evi-
 dence indicates that the practice of FGM is decreasing in the modern urban sector.
 The Government does not attempt to interfere with th~esepractices, although public
 health workers try to educate women to the dangers of FGM and to the fact that
 FGM is not a requirement of Islam.
 People With Disabilities.-The law does not specifically provide for people with
 disabilities, and the Government does not man ate preference in employment or
 education or public accessibility for disabled persons. It does, however, provide some
 rehabilitation and other assistance for the disabled.
 NationallRaciallEthnic Minorities.-Ethnic and cultural tension and discrimina-
 tion arise from the geographic and cultural line between traditionally nomadic Ara-
 bic-speaking(Hassaniya) Moor herders and African-Mauritanian sedentary cultiva-
 tors of the Halpuaar, Soninke, and Wolof ethnic groups in the south. Although cul-
 turally homogeneous, the Moors are divided among numerous tribal groups and are
 racially distingished as White Moors and Black Moors. The majority of what are
 known as Black Moors are Haratine, literally "one who has been freed," although
 some Black Moor families were never enslaved. The Halpulaar (the largest African-
 Mauritaniang1  ), the Wolof, and the Soninke ethnic groups are concentrated in
 the south. "White Moors, large numbers of whom are dark-s inned after centuries
 of intermarriage with members of Sub-Saharan African groups, dominate positions
 in government, business, and the clergy. The Halpulaar, Soninke, and Wolof ethnic
 groups are undrrepresented in the military and security sectors.
 Ethnic tensions surfaced dramatically in the mass expulsions of African-
 Mauritanians in 1989-90 and the purge of Afro-Mauritanians from the military in
 1991. Not all have regained their positions.
 The Constitution designates Arabic along with Pulaar, Soninke, and Wolof as
 Mauritania's national languages. Successive government regimes--both civil and
 miitary-rhave pursued various poiies of "Arabization" in t e schools and in the
 workplace, which non-Arnic-speaking ethnic gups have protested.
 Overt tensions between ethnic grups have lessned since the explosive ethnic vio-
 lence of 1989 to 1991, when the Government conducted extrajudicial expulsions and
 purges of the security forces clearly based on ethnicity. Nevertheless, some hostility
 
 
 and bitterness persist between ethnic groups and there is little cultural identity or
 political cohesion among them.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for freedom of association
 and the right of citizens to join any political or labor organization. All workers ex-
 cept members of the military and police are free to associate in and establish unions
 at the local and national levels.
 Prior to the 1993 amendment of the Labor Code, which repealed provisions re-
 stricting trade union pluralism, the government-controlled labor central, the Union
 of Mauritanian Workers (UTM), was the only labor confederation allowed by law.
 Since 1993 two new labor confederations have formed and the UTM, which many
 workers still view as closely allied with the Government and the PRDS, has lost
 ground to these. The Government recognized a new confederation in 1994, the Gen-
 eral Confederation of Mauritanian Workers (CGTM). The CGTM is not affiliated
 with any political party, although most of its members favor the oposition; it
 gained considerably in strength during the year. In 1994 it organized some new
 locals, largely from the heretofore unorganized self-employed workers, and has since
 attracted a number of member unions from the UTM. The CGTM has protested
 what it characterized as preferential treatment of the UTM by the Government. A
 third labor confederation, the Free Confederation of Mauritanian Workers, formed
 in March, has not yet been recognized by the Government, but it is allowed to func-
 tion.
 International trade union activity is minimal, but unions are free to affiliate with
 international bodies. The UTM participated in regional labor organizations, and the
 CGTM was accepted as a member of the Ghana-based United Organization of Afri-
 can Workers.
 The bulk of the labor force is in the informal sector, with most workers engaged
 in subsistence agriculture and animal husbandry; only 25 percent are employed in
 the wage sector. However, nearly 90 percent of the industrial and commercial work-
 ers are organized. The law provides workers with the right to strike, and there were
 several strikes and partial work stoppages. In August CGTM-affiliated striking
 workers in a road construction firm were successful in efforts to improve their
 health benefits. Most strikes were settled quickly due to limited worker and union
 resources and government pressure. Moreover, the law provides for tripartite arbi-
 tration committees composed of union, business, and government representatives.
 Once all parties agree to arbitration, the committee may impose binding arbitration
 that automatically terminates any strike.
 The Government did not petition the United States for reconsideration of General-
 ized System of Preferences (GSP) trade privileges. The United States revoked GSP
 benefits in July 1993 for failure to respect freedom of association or to take steps
 to eliminate forced labor, including vestiges of slavery (see Section 6.c.).
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides that unions
 may freely organize workers without government or employer interference. Wages
 and other benefits are generally decided informally among individual unions, em-
 ployers, and the Government. However, the Government plays a dominant role in
 the wage negotiations and in practice limits collective bargaining.
 Laws provide workers protection against antiunion discrimination and employees
 or employers may bring labor disputes to three-person labor courts that are over-
 seen jointly by the Ministries of Justice and Labor.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Mauritania has officially abolished
 slavery several times, most recently in 1980. Nevertheless, the legacy of slavery re-
 mains in its economic and psychological manifestations, and there are reports of
 persons continuing to live in conditions of involuntary servitude. Tens of thousands
 of persons whose ancestors were slaves still occupy positions of servitude and near-
 servitude, although such practices as coercive slavery and commerce in slaves ap-
 pear to have virtually disappeared. In most cases, those remaining in a situation
 of un paid or poorly paid servitude do so for lack of better alternatives, or lack of
 knowledge about their own status.
 Some freed slaves (Haratine) have either stayed with, or returned to, their former
 masters and continue to provide labor in exchange for room, board, and other basic
 necessities. Others live independently but continue in a symbiotic relationship with
 their former masters, performing occasional pald or unpaid labor in exchange for
 food, clothing, and medical care. There are no reliable statistics for the number of
 Haratines who continue to work for the same families for which they worked before
 the emancipation of 1980, whether as paid or unpaid labor. Reports of cases of invol-
 untary servitude are rare and unconfirmed.
 
 
 Inheritance disputes between Haratines and the descendants of their former mas-
 ters arose several times and were adjudicated in court. While most such disputes
 are decided in accordance with the law and rule that the descendants of the former
 slaves should inherit their property, the independent press reported one case in
 which a magistrate (Qadi) in Nema in 1994 ruled in favor of the former master, the
 implementation of this ruling was blocked in 1995 while the former slave's descend-
 ants appealed. In another instance, the Supreme Council of the Magistrature re-
 moved a magistrate from the bench because he ruled, contrary to the law, that a
 former master, rather than the former slave's descendants, should inherit the pos-
 sessions of an ex-slave.
 The El Hor (literally "The Free Man') Movement continued to pursue its agenda
 to eradicate the vestiges of slavery and its associated mentality among former slaves
 and slave holders. Two new NGO's, SOS-Esclaves and the more moderate National
 Committee for the Struggle Against the Vestiges of Slavery in Mauritania, were es-
 tablished in 1995 to promote former slaves' rights.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Education is not compulsory, and
 for financial reasons, 30 percent or more of school-age children do not regularly at-
 tend government schools. Labor law specifies that no child under the age of 13 may
 be employed in the agricultural sector without the permission of the Minister of
 Labor, nor under the age of 15 in the nonagricultural sector. The law provides that
 employed children of age 14 to 16 should reeive 70 percent of the minimum wake,
 and those from age 17 to 18 should receive 90 percent of the minimum wage. The
 Labor Ministry's few inspectors provide only limited enforcement of child labor laws
 (see Section 5).
 Young children in the countryside commonly pursue herding, cultivation, fishing,
 and other significant labor in support of their families' activities. In keeping with
 longstanding tradition, many children serve apprenticeships in small industries and
 in the informal sector.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage for adults is approxi-
 mately $67 (Ouguiya 8,300) per month and has not been raised since October 1992.
 It is difficult for the average family to meet its minimum needs and maintain a de-
 cent standard of living at this salary. The standard, legal, nonagricultural workweek
 may not exceed either 40 hours or 6 days without overtime compensation, which is
 paid at rates that are graduated according to the number of supplemental hours
 worked. The Labor Directorate of the Ministry of Labor is responsible for enforce-
 ment of the" labor laws, but in practice inadequate funding limits the effectiveness
 of the Directorate's enforcement.
 The Ministry of Labor is also responsible for enforcing safety standards but does
 so inconsistently, due to inadequate funding. In principle workers can remove them-
 selves from hazardous conditions without risking loss of employment; in practice,
 they cannot.
