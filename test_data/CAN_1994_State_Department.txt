 CANADA
 Canada is a constitutional monarchy with a federal parliamentary form of govern-
 ment. Representatives in the multiparty political system are elected by universal
 suffrage at local, provincial, and federal levels. An independent judiciary interprets
 the Constitution.
 Elected civilian officials control the federal, provincial, and municipal police
 forces. The armed forces have no role in domestic law enforcement except in na-
 tional emergencies. Laws requiring the security forces to respect human rights are
 strictly observed, and violators are punished by the courts.
 Canada has a hiphly developed market-based economic system. Laws extensively
 protect the well-being of workers, and provide for workers' freedom of association.
 Canadians enjoy, in law and in practice, a wide range of freedoms and individual
 rights as providedfor in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which was appended
 to Canada's revised Constitution in 1982. Principal complaints concerning human
 rights issues have to do with discrimination against minorities, aboriginals, the dis-
 ab led, and women. The Constitution and laws provide avenues for legal redress of
 such complaints, and the Government and private organizations seek to ensure that
 human rights are respected in practice at all levels of society.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated or other extrajudicial killings. Several members of a Canadian military
 unit faced or are currently facing courts-martial for torturing and killing a sus-
 pected thief in their custody during a peacekeeping mission in Somalia in 1993. The
 primary suspect was found to be mentally       or trial. Several defendants were
 found guilty, including one who was convicted of torture.
 In July the Federal Government amended the Criminal Code to further restrict
 use of deadly force bypolice officers against fleeing suspects.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture and other cruel or inhuman treatment, and the authorities
 generally respect this. During 1994 there were isolated reports of excessive use of
 force by police. Such incidents often strained relations between minority commu-
 nities and the police. In Toronto, police developed a cross-cultural course on race re-
 lations that is to start in 1995, and expanded other training. Minorities continued
 to be underrepresented on most police forces, although new hiring procedures seek
 to correct this.
 In December a Quebec Court ruled that five officers from the Montreal Urban
 Constabulary (MUC) must stand trial on aggravated assault charges stemming from
 the alleged beating of a suspect in 1993. A provincial-level inquiry into this and pre-
 vious incidents recommended various specific corrective measures after it found the
 
 
 MUC to be poorly supervised, insufficiently trained, inadequately equipped, and rac-
 ist. The new police chief began to implement many of the recommendations. A mul-
 tiracial independent committee on police ethics found that a 1991 MUC lethal shoot-
 ing was a justifiable use of force.
 Prisons in Canada are open to independent monitoring by human rights groups
 and the media.
 (See also the case cited in l.a.)
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest and
 imprisonment, and is respected in practice. It requires arrests to be made under
 warrants issued by judicial authorities, except in cases involving violation of the Of-
 ficial Secrets Act. Suspects must be charg abefore a justice of the peace or a judge
 within 72 hours of arrest. During national emergencies, the Federal Government is
 authorized to take special measures, including the suspension of civil liberties, to
 ensure safety and security.
 In September a Supreme Court decision strengthened the rights of individuals to
 receive unmediate legal advice before questioning by authorities can begin.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The judicial system is based on English common
 law at the federal level as well as in most provinces; in the province of Quebec it
 is based on the Napoleonic Code. Throughout Canada, judges are appointed. I
 criminal trials, the law provides for a presumption of the defendant's innocence and
 the rights to a public trial, to counsel (free for indigents), and to appeal.
 In 1994, judges occasionally exercised their power to close courtrooms to the
 media in order to protect victims (mainly, children) and to guarantee fair and im-
 partial hearings. Such actions caused considerable controversy (see Section 2.a.).
 he overwhelming majority of trials, including military courts-martial, remain open
 to the public and the media.
 Under the Official Secrets Act, which prohibits the private possession, distribu-
 tion, or publication of information deemed prejudicial to the interests of the State,
 trials involving classified government information may be held in secret, with cer-
 tain presumptions in favor of the State. Prosecutions under this statute are ex-
 tremely rare, and convictions have proven hard to sustain on appeal. During 1994,
 federal authorities seized material from a television station in conjunction with an
 ongoing investigation of possible violations of the Act by a former government em-
 ploye.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution affords Canadians strong legal protection from arbitrary interference,
 and federal and provincial governments generally do not interfere with an individ-
 ual's basic rights without due process. Intrusive searches may be carried out only
 when there is a demonstrable, reasonable basis for presuming the affected person
 is involved in criminal activity. Police officials face judicial penalties for abuse of
 a person's privacy if they do not obtain a judicial search warrant in advance.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and press, and the authorities generally respect this. In 1993 an Ontario judge
 banned news reports about a trial concerning a grisly murder; in 1994 a group of
 media organizations unsuccessfully tried to have this ban declared unconstitutional,
 and in May a judge fined an individual for violating the ban. In December the Su-
 preme Court ruled that the Charter of Rights and Freedoms gives equal standing
 to the right of free speech and the right to a fair trial; it is unclear how this ruling
 will affect media restrictions already m place.
 Some restrictions on free speech and press are imposed by provincial-level film
 censorship, broadcasters' voluntary codes curbing graphic violence, and laws against
 hate literature and pornography. In 1994 television stations canceled a show for
 children after complaints about its violent content.
 Federal customs authorities confiscate sexually explicit material when inspecting
 imported material. During 1994 human rights and homosexual organizations pro-
 tested such a seizure of books intended for a store in British Columbia. Toronto po-
 lice confiscated paintings of children which they claimed were indecent under Fed-
 eral statutes.
 The Canadian Human Rights Act prohibits repeated communications by telephone
 that expose a person or group to hatred or contempt. In 1994 federal courts jailed
 several individuals who violated this law.
 The Constitution protects the linguistic and cultural rights of minorities. Laws in
 the province of Quebec stipulate that French is the working language of most busi-
 nesses, and require most children to receive publicly-funded education in French. In
 1993 Quebec liberalized its law restricting public display of signs in languages other
 
 
 775
 than French; in 1994 the province dropped charges against several individuals who
 had violated the old law while it was still in effect.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Associaton.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, and the authorities respect this. Permits are
 not required for meetings.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is complete freedom of religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens are free to travel within, from, or back to the country, and to
 emigrate or repatriate. Canada continues to be a haven for many refugees and asy-
 lum seekers. The Government cooperates with the Office of the U.N. High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees.
 There are no credible reports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to
 refugee status.
 Canada recognizes refugee claims from applicants facing persecution because of
 gender. Although the guidelines on granting refugee status to women do not have
 the status of laws, they are based on the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
 and other human rights legislation. In 1994, the first full year in which the guide-
 lines were in effect, some two-thirds of such claimants were granted refugee status.
 The Government's policy of deporting noncitizen immigrants who have a record
 of serious criminal convictions was challenged before the U.N. Human Rights Com-
 mittee by a Toronto resident.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Federal and provincial governments are freely elected by secret ballot through
 universal suffrage. The Governor General represents Canada's Head of State, Queen
 Elizabeth II. In practice, power is exercised by the Prime Minister and the Cabinet,
 who usually are elected members of the 295-seat House of Commons. Legislative
 elections at both the federal and provincial levels must be held at least every 5
 years.
 The official opposition in Parliament, as well as the Quebec Provincial Govern-
 ment, supports independence for Quebec.
 All citizens have equal political rights, and these rights are respected in practice.
 There are no impediments de jure or de facto to participation by women, minorities,
 and aboriginals at any level in politics or government. Women have headed major
 political parties and served as Prime Minister and Governor General. Although
 aboriginals are usually consulted on decisions affecting their interests, many bands
 continue to press the Government to grant them more autonomy.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The numerous private human rights organizations in the country operate freely.
 The Canadian Human Rights Commission and its provincial counterparts inves-
 tigate and seek to resolve complaints of discrimination and abuses of civil rights.
 Canada has a long-standing record of cooperation with outside investigations of al-
 leged human rights abuses.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Charter of Rights and Freedoms provides for equal benefits and protection
 of the law regardless of race, sex, religion, mental or physical disability, national
 or ethnic orin or age. The Government generally respects these rights, but there
 are occasiona   arges of violations by officials.
 In September a new law in Ontario, the Employment Equity Act, required the
 vast majority of employers to begin removing discriminatory barriers against
 women, aboriginals, people with disabilities, and racial minorities. The Act covers
 about three-fourths of the work force in Ontario. It does not apply to employers in
 the private sector with under 50 employees, to employers in the public sector with
 under 10 employees, to police forces covered by the Police Services Act (which has
 its own equity regulations), or to federally-regulated employers such as banks.
 Ontario's public sector is also covered by earlier, similar legislation, which specifi-
 cally designates French-speakers as one of the groups thus assisted.
 Despite Canada's policy of bilingualism, English-speakers in Quebec and French-
 speakers in other provinces generally use the majority language. In Quebec, lan-
 guage laws allow access to public English-language schools only for children whose
 arents received English-language education in Canada. While the other provinces
 go not have similar laws restricting access to public French-language schooling,
 many of their localities have inadequate facilities. The recent establishment of
 
 
 776
 French-language school boards in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba are in-
 tended to help alleviate such problems.
 Women.-The law prohibits violence against women, including spousal abuse. En-
 forcement may be hindered, however, by a recent Supreme Court ruling which es-
 tablished extreme drunkenness as a valid defense. Defendants in a rape trial and
 in a spousal abuse trial used this defense and were acquitted. The Government is
 considering legislation to restrict this defense.
 Federal and provincial governments and nongovernmental *organizations are con-
 tinuing to fund various educational and preventive programs dealing with family vi-
 olence, largely focusing on violence against women. Many police forces now run
 courses that train officers to deal with family violence.
 Women are well represented in the labor force, including business and the profes-
 sions, but government reports show that women generally still earn considerably
 less than men in similar work, despite recent gains. Other surveys indicate there
 is little if any such disparity for women who are university graduates. Women enjoy
 the same marriage rights and property rights as do men.
 The law prohibits sexual harassment, and the Government respects this provision.
 Official data released in December indicated that 23 percent of adult women had
 suffered sexual harassment in the workplace. Labor unions and other interest
 groups have been taking steps against such offenses; e.g., in the automobile indus-
 try, the most recent contracts between the union and major manufacturers provide
 for employer-funded assistance to women victimized by harassment on the job or
 abuse at home.
 Children.-Federal and provincial regulations protect children from abuse, over-
 work, and discrimination, and dulypenalize perpetrators of such offenses.
 Indigenous People.-Treatment of its native peoples continues to be one of the na-
 tion's most important human rights issues. Tensions are rife on many reserves, due
 to disputes over self-government, treaty rights, land claims, taxation, duty-free im-
 ports, fishing and hunting rights, and alleged harassment by police. Aboriginals re-
 main underrepresented in the work force, overrepresented on welfare rolls, and
 more susceptible to poverty and suicide than other groups. In 1994 the Royal Ab-
 original Commission continued hearings on aboriginals' concerns.
 The British Columbia Treaty Commission facilitated negotiations among aborigi-
 nal groups, the Provincial Government, and the Federal Government which are ex-
 pected to provide aboriginals with considerable benefits: cash compensation for and/
 or title to lands claimed by them; a share in fishing and forestry revenues from
 those lands; and new powers of self-government. In its first annual report, this Com-
 mission noted that the federal and provincial governments "do not appear to have
 a consistent approach" to the treaty process.
 The Federal Government decided to dismantle the Department of Indian and
 Northern Affairs, a move welcomed by aboriginal groups. In December the Minister
 heading the Department signed an accord with native leaders transferring power
 from it in Manitoba to native governments. Also during 1994, Nova Scotia estab-
 lished a native police force and created a framework for native self-government and
 education.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The law prohibits racial discrimination, and
 the authorities respect this provision. As before, nevertheless, there were isolated
 incidents of racially motivated discrimination, some involving violence.
 Several hospitals in Ontario compensated employees affected by past discrimina-
 tory practices against racial minorities, and instituted measures to guard against
 such practices.
 An Ontario commission reported overt and systemic racism in the province's pris-
 on system; the Solicitor General publicly declared his intention to follow up the com-
 mission's recommendations.
 The Halifax City Police Force, continuing to address minority concerns, appointed
 its first race relations coordinator.
 People With Disabilities.-The Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Human
 Rights Act explicitly prohibit discrimination against people with disabilities. Under
 Treasury Board guidelines, all facilities leased and owned by the Government were
 to be accessible to persons with disabilities by the end of the year. Progress toward
 this goal was noteworthy, but incomplete.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Except for members of the armed forces, workers in
 both the public and private sectors have the right to associate freely. The Labour
 Code, protects these rights for all employees under federal jurisdiction, while provin-
 cial legislation protects all other organized workers.
 
 
 Trade unions are independent of the Government. They are free to affiliate with
 international organizations. 37.5 percent of the nonagricultural work force is union-
 ized.
 All workers have the right to strike, except for those in the public sector providing
 essential services.
 The law prohibits retribution against strikers and union leaders, and the Govern-
 ment enforces this provision.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers in both the public
 sector (except for some police) and the private sector have the right to organize and
 bargain collectively. While the law protects collective bargaining, for some public-
 sector workers providing essential services there are limitations, which vary from
 province to province. In 1994 the federal and some provincial governments insti-
 tuted a freeze on wages of civil servants, an action that the unions decried as inter-
 ference with their right to collective bargaining.
 The law prohibits antiunion discrimination, and requires employers to reinstate
 workers fired for union activities.
 There are effective mechanisms for resolving complaints and obtaining redress.
 All labor unions have full access to mediation, arbitration, and the judicial sys-
 tem.
 Canada has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is illegal, and there
 were no known violations.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Child-labor legislation varies from
 province to province. The Federal Government does not employ youths under 17
 years of age while school is in session. Most provinces prohibit those under age 15
 or 16 from working without parental consent, or at night, or in any hazardous em-
 ployment. These prohibitions are effectively enforced trugh inspections conducted
 by the federal and provincial Labor Ministries.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The federal minimum wage, established by
 ministerial order and enforced by the Department of Labor, applies to employees in
 industries under federal jurisdiction (about 8 percent of the work force); since 1986
 it has remained at $2.97 (4.00 Canadian dollars). i all the provinces, the minimum
 wage is higher than the federal minimum. For youths and students, Ontario, Al-
 berta, British Columbia, and the Northwest Territories have a minimum wage lower
 than the respective standard minimum, as does Nova Scotia for "inexperienced
 workers". A family whose only employed member earns the minimum wage would
 be considered below the poverty line.
 Standard workhours vary from province to province, but in all the limit is 40 or
 48 a week, with at least 24 hours of rest.
 Federal law provides for safety and health standards for employees under federal
 jurisdiction, while provincial and territorial legislation provide for all other employ-
 ees. Labor departments monitor and enforce these standards.
 Federal, provincial, and territorial laws protect the right of workers with "reason-
 able cause" to refuse dangerous work.
