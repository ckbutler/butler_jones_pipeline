 LEBANON~*
 Lebanon's Constitution provides for a directly elected,
 unicameral Parliament which chooses the President. Political
 power is theoretiqelly divided in accordance with the
 Constitution and with the unwritten, confessionally based
 National Pact-of 1943. The latter provides for a Maronite
 Catholic president, a Sunni Muslim Prime Minister, and a Shi'a
 Muslim speaker of the National Assembly. The Pact also
 provides for the prDportional allocation of government
 positions among various sectarian groups on the basis of the
 last national census, which was-taken in 1932. However, 14
 years of civil war have altered this arrangement greatly.
 Parliamentary elections, which should take place every 4
 years, were last held in 1972. Since that time, one-fourth of
 the elected parliamentarians have died and have not been
 replaced. In 1988"Parliament was unable to elect a president
 before the constitutional deadline of September 23. As a
 result, for Much of 1989 there were two rival cabinets in-East
 and West Beirut, each claiming to be the legitimate
 government. As a result of an agreement reached at Taif,"
 Saudi Arabia, membets of the most recently elected Parliament
 met in November 1989 and approved the Taif Agreement which
 amends the Constitution and alters the 1943 National Pact.
 They also elected a new President, Rene Moawad. After Moawad
 was assassinated on November 22, the deputies met again,
 electing as President Elias Hrawi, like Moawad a Maronite
 Christian.
 The prolonged civil war and the establishment of rival
 cabinets virtually eliminated the authority of any recognized
 central Lebanese government and its ability to safeguard human
 rights. Extralegal militias and local chieftains control much
 of the country where they, in effect, govern the civilian
 population and enforce their own version of justice with
 little regard for the Constitution or legal norms. The
 presence of foreign forces further contributes to the
 inability of any Lebanese central authority to exercise
 control over the entire country. Israel continued to maintain
 a "security zone" that encompasses 13 percent of Lebanese
 territory. Israeli attacks against Palestinian strongholds,
 terrorist headquarters, and staging zones led to civilian
 casualties when targets hit were located in or near civilian
 neighborhoods.
 Syrian troops in Beirut, north Lebanon, and the Biqa' valley
 numbered over 40,000 at the end of 1989. In those areas,
 which comprise 70 percent of Lebanon's territory, the Syrian
 authorities carried out certain security and other functions
 normally reserved to a central government. Syrian military
 operations in these areas resulted in civilian casualties and
 material damage. Syrian forces were also direct participants
 in the heavy shelling of East Beirut and the enforcement of a
 naval blockade against the predominantly Christian area.
 Militia and terrorist groups, including Amal (supported by
 Syria), Hezballah (supported by Iran), and several Palestinian
 splinter groups also operated in the region.
 *The United States has had no official observers present in
 Lebanon since September 5, 1989, when the Embassy staff was
 withdrawn since it was no longer possible to assure its
 security or effectiveness. This report therefore draws in
 part on unofficial sources.

 LEBANON
 As a consequence of continued shelling and'the imposition of
 naval and ground blockades, Lebanon's free-enterprise economy,
 already seriously disrupted by more than a decade of war,
 deteriorated sharply after March 1989. The value of the
 Lebanese pound deteriorated steadily during the spring and
 summer. However, in the fall the pound began to appreciate in
 response to a sustained cease-fire agreement.
 The year witnessed a serious deterioration in the human rights
 situation. Nearly 6 months of virtually continuous artillery
 exchanges throughout densely populated areas of East and West
 Beirut brought injury and death to thousands of civilians.
 Most parties to the conflict, including Syrian forces,
 Lebanese army units, and militias, often deliberately located
 their headquarters and military emplacements in or near
 populated areas, including in areas close to schools,
 hospitals, and religious institutions. Noncombatants were
 also the victims of terrorist bombings, sniping, abductions,
 summary executions, and assassinations.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 As in the past, rival Muslim and Christian factions routinely
 killed for political motives, with civilians killed and
 wounded by car bombs exploded in crowded areas and by
 indiscriminate sniping and other exchanges of fire between
 opposing factions. There were numerous assassinations of
 political and religious leaders, including newly elected
 President Rene Moawad and the Sunni Mufti, claims of hostage
 execution, and death threats aimed at forcing specific
 political actions. Militia forces outside of the nominal
 control of the Government were responsible for most of these
 actions, but each of the competing cabinets in early and
 mid-1989 charged that security forces and elements of the
 Lebanese Armed Forces loyal to the other carried out both
 indiscriminate and-planned attacks, including assassinations
 (see also Section 1.g,).
 Foreign diplomats and embassies also were targeted. In July a
 Hezballah militant Islamic group, "The Organization of the
 Oppressed on Earth," claimed to have executed Col. William
 Higgins, an American serving with the U.N. observer mission in
 Lebanon. He had been held by them since his abduction in
 1988. Numerous political and religious figures received death
 threats in the course of the year.
 b. Disappearance
 Thousands of Lebanon's inhabitants have been kidnaped or have
 disappeared since the beginning of the war in 1975. Illegal
 militias and foreign forces, rather than official Lebanese
 security services, appear to be responsible for most of these
 kidnapings. Some victims probably were summarily executed.
 Most of these persons remain unaccounted for, but occasionally
 hostage exchanges and releases occurred.
 There were more politically motivated kidnapings in 1989.
 Abductions and disappearances took place throughout Lebanon,
 especially in the south, along the dividing line between East
 and West Beirut, and in West Beirut's southern suburbs. There
 
 
 1470
 LEBANONi
 were also numerous reports that military personnel and
 civilians were seized while crossing between the two sides of
 Beirut. Various Islamic groups continued to hold hostage
 journalists, educators, and relief workers--including 9
 Americans. In addition, a number of foreign relief and other
 workers, including Red Cross workers, were kidnaped near Sidon
 and Tripoli; some were released after being held for a short
 time. In south Lebanon, Israeli forces seized several
 prominent Shi'a religious and militia leaders, most of whom
 were also. released.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Overwhelmed by the presence of. illegal militias and foreign
 forces and divided during much of 1989 between rival cabinets,
 the official Lebanese security services controlled little
 territory, and relatively few allegations of torture were made
 against them. There were many allegations of brutal treatment
 by Lebanese militias, Syrian and Israeli occupying forces, the
 Israeli-funded Army of South Lebanon, Palestinian factions,
 and Hezballah, which includes several groups that receive
 support from Iran. The truth of these allegations, often
 brought by fiercely partisan elements, could rarely be
 verified.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Lebanese law requires that a suspect be arraigned before an
 accusation committee (a panel of three judges). and the
 prosecutor within 48 hours of -arrest, but government
 prosecutors-sometimes hold suspects indefinitely for
 interrogatidn. without reference to a court or judge. Every
 defendant has the right to legal counsel, and bail is
 permitted in most cases. There is'no public defender's
 office. However, if a defendant cannot afford a lawyer, and
 the judge deems he needs one, the judge requests the lawyers'
 association to appoint a lawyer to handle the case. No
 militia or foreign occupying force observes the above legal-
 safeguards applicable to arrest cases, In general, persons
 arrested by these groups are denied access to the judicial ï¿½
 system. Some of the major militia groups periodically turn.
 individuals accused of civil crimes over to the legal
 authorities. Normally, however, the various militias detain
 individuals arbitrarily for indefinite periods, often to be
 exchanged for persons held by rival militias. Such detainees
 are frequently held incommunicado. In addition to politically
 motivated abductions, .some militias presume to enforce law and
 order in regions under their control, arresting, imprisoning,
 and executing persons on purely criminal charges. The Army of
 South Lebanon maintains a detention center in al-Khiyam. The
 militia groups hold small numbers of prisoners in different
 locations and have not concentrated them in one place as far
 as is known.
 Although neither of the two rival cabinets attempted, as a
 rule, to arrest or exile its political opponents (in a notable
 exception, former- President Amine Gemayel was compelled to
 leave Lebanon in late 1988 by the new Maronite leadership),
 repeated instances of intimidation and threats of violence led
 increasing numbers of prominent Lebanese to seek temporary
 refuge abroad. Many ordinary Lebanese also fled, seeking to
 avoid the shelling and disruption in basic services which took
 place during much of the year.
 
 
 1471
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Despite the breakdown of central government authority, Lebanon
 continued its efforts to maintain a regular court system for
 criminal and civil cases, and each confessional group had its
 own court for family and personal status cases. The military
 also had its own courts-martial system. Lebanese law,
 practice, and custom provide the right to a fair public
 trial. Fourteen years of war, however, have disrupted the
 judicial process, and many cases remained unadjudicated.
 Trial delays result, for example, from the difficulty of
 conducting investigations when most of the country remains
 beyond effective government control, from a shortage of
 judges, and, most importantly, from the general breakdown in
 security.
 Although the judiciary is considered independent and
 relatively impartial, and courts exist throughout the country,
 the disposition of criminal cases ultimately depends on the
 group in power locally. For example, militias frequently
 intervene to protect their supporters from detention and
 prosecution.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Lebanese authorities generally evince no interest in
 controlling personal life. The law requires that government
 prosecutors obtain the equivalent of a warrant before entering
 homes, except when the Lebanese army pursues an armed
 attacker. Rights of privacy, however, were violated
 frequently in the course of military operations mounted by the
 army, militias, and foreign forces in Lebanon and in the
 militias' administration of areas under their control. All of
 these groups have attempted to gather intelligence on their
 adversaries; these efforts include informer networks and
 telephone monitoring.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 Significant violations of accepted international humanitarian
 standards with respect to treatment of prisoners taken during
 internal armed conflict occurred during 1989. Prisoners
 seized as the result of interfactional and intracommunal
 conflict were often subjected to'prolonged incommunicado
 detention and physical'and psychological abuse, including
 torture. As a rule, permission for humanitarian organizations
 to visit detention facilities was denied by the parties
 responsible.
 The fighting between Lebanese Christian forces in February and
 the 6-month exchange of heavy shelling between East and West
 Beirut were marked by considerable disregard for the
 consequences of the fighting for the civilian population and
 resulted in indiscriminate killing. All participants in the
 fighting appear to have adopted a deliberate policy of
 applying pressure for political concessions through
 intimidation of the civilian population. The
 practice--especially by Syrian forces in West Beirut--of
 placing military facilities, particularly artillery, rocket
 launchers, and tanks, in the midst of densely populated
 residential neighborhoods also contributed to the
 
 
 1472
 LEBANONN
 disproportionate (10:1) ratio of civilian to military deaths.
 As a result of the fighting, more than 900 people, most of
 them civilians, were reported-to have been killed.
 Intracommunal fighting also took place during 1989; Shi'a
 militias of Amal and Hezballah fought in Beirut's southern
 suburbs.and in south Lebanon. This fighting became heavy in
 December,' with over 70 people killed and 200 wounded.
 Exchanges between rival Palestinian factions., particqlarly in
 the Sidon area, also occurred. In East Beirut, a clash in
 February-betpeen the Lebanese Armed Forces and the Lebanese
 Forces, militia-i-fought in heavily populated residential
 areas--killed and )'ounded hundreds.
 From March to September 1989, following a declaration by East
 Beirut authorities-of a naval blockade of what they considered
 illegal ports located in other parts of the country, Syrian
 forces imposed a blockade on the predominantly Christian East
 Beirut enclave. This blockade, which was enforced through
 Syrian shelling of ships attempting to land in the enclave as
 well as bofibardment of the coastal portion of the Christian
 area, was applied to all shipments, including attempted
 delivery of humanitarian supplies and fuel. As a consequence
 of the blockades, shortages of basic commodities such as
 flour, drinking water, and cooking gas occurred. This
 blockade was lifted in September as part of a, pease-fire
 arrangement.
 Section 2 Respect fox Civil Liberties, Including:.
 a.. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Lebanon has a strong heritage of freedom of opinion, speech,,..
 and press, Governmental authorities traditionally have
 respected the rights of those who opposed government policies
 through, peaceful means. As a consequence of 14,years of civil
 war, and jai'cua   rly,.heemergence.of rival cabinets after
 failure to elect   president in 1988, efforts to control or
 influence th6'medfa for propaganda purposes became more
 widespread than had been the case previously.
 Dozens of newspapers an4 magazines are published throughout
 Lebanon, traditionally representing a wide spectrum of
 opinion. By the end ot 1989, however, the press had largely
 come to ref1e9tthe political views of those forces
 controlIng .Plapes of' pulication.. 4lso, while the press in
 Lebanon was .eminplly independen4,, virtually all newspapers
 and many magaijies, relied upon financing from specific
 Lebanese and'foreign groups. As a result, these groups, which
 included Lebanese political and militia figures as well as
 foreign governments, were able to exercise considerable
 influence over the content of the press.
 Distributionof. the press.was severely limited. Christian
 authorities and militias.prevented the regular distribution in
 East Beirut of several leftist and Islamic publications, and
 during mot of the year preventedntry of all but one
 newspaper published ih West Beirut. Militias in West Beirut
 periodicaly refused to allow distribution of Christian militia
 and rival Muslim militia publications in their areas of
 control.
 Lebanon's.,two "official" television channels (one each
 originating in East and West Beirut) were directly taken over
 by the rival cabinets in those areas, with coverage of
 
 
 14q3
 LEBANONI
 Lebanese developments tailored in accordance with, and to
 support, each side's position. Since the election of a
 President, the East Beirut station has fallen outside the
 control of the Government while continuing to support General
 Aoun. A wide variety of illegal radio and television stations
 were operated by many diverse political groups, particularly
 militias. These stations typically carried heavily slanted
 propaganda as part of their daily programming.
 The widespread breakdown in security and intimidation of
 university faculty, administrators, and students continued to
 seriously threaten academic freedom. In at least one
 instance, university administrators-received death threats as
 the result of disciplinary action taken against a staff
 member. Virtually all Lebanese educational institutions were
 forced to close from March to October, due to the heavy
 shelling.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Lebanese were theoretically free to assemble and associate in
 a peaceful manner. However, with the outbreak of fighting in
 early 1989 between the Lebanese Armed Forces and the-Lebanese
 Forces' militia, followed by hostilities between factions in
 East and West Beirut, tolerance for demonstrations or
 assemblies other than those organized by or in support of the
 authorities in each area evaporated. In areas under the
 exclusive control of one militia, demonstrations or open shows
 of support for rival militias or political groups were not
 permitted.
 Israel did not permit political groups which opposed the
 Israeli occupation to operate freely in areas under the
 control of the Israeli army or the South Lebanon Army. The
 Syrians did not, in general, allow groups openly hostile to
 them to remain in areas they occupied, much less to assemble
 freely.
 The most significant constraint on freedom of assembly
 continued to be the restrictions imposed by authorities and
 militias in East and West Beirut on the ability of Parliament
 to gather for an electoral session. Parliamentarians were
 unable to cross the line dividing East and West Beirut during
 much of the year; no parliamentary session was held between
 August 1988 and November 1989 when Parliamentarians met to
 ratify the Taif Agreement and elect a new president (twice).
 (See also Section 3.)
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 In the past, Lebanese practiced their various religions with a
 great degree of liberty. There is no state religion, nor are
 there restrictions on particular religious groups, on foreign
 clergy, or regarding places of worship. Lebanon has long been
 a center for theological training, and there are numerous
 seminaries in the country. The various religious groups are
 free to publish religious material, participate in charitable
 activities, and provide religious education for their
 children. Many religious groups operate private schools.
 However, the intensification of religious hatred has led away
 from confessional mixing and towards confessional
 segregation. Today, Lebanese live more and more in
 
 
 1474
 LEBANON~
 neighborhoods and villages inhabited exclusively by one
 religious community. In militia-controlled areas, this
 exclusivity sometimes is maintained by force.
 Lebanese are free to practice the religion into which they
 were born, and the confessional character of Lebanese society
 makes conversion to another religion difficult, except in the
 case of women, who normally adopt the religion of the man they
 marry. Conversion can mean ostracism from one's family and
 friends and having to live among strangers" In the smaller
 villages, local religious leaders often exert pressure on
 members of their congregation not to participate in the
 religious activities of other religious groups.
 d: Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Lebanese traditionally have enjoyed freedom of internal
 travel, but the'reality of civil war restricted the ability of
 Lebanese to cross freely between the Christian enclave and the
 rest of Lebanon during' much of 1989. The Green Line dividing
 East and West Beirut was frequently closed during the year, as
 were other internal land crossings. Even when the crossings
 were open, passage-was often rendered difficult by sniping,
 arbitrary controls imposed by militias and other authorities,
 and demands for bribes by officials. In addition to the
 problems affecting passage into the Christian enclave,
 militias throughout Lebanon often imposed controls on entry
 into areas under their domination. The Army of South Lebanon
 maintained tight restrictions on the movement of people and
 goods into and out of areas which it occupied. Today,
 Lebanese young people rarely travel into areas other than
 their own.
 Foreign travel by Lebanese citizens was not officially
 restricte&'by Lebanese'state authorities-, although militias
 and foreign forces present at ports of entry and exit often
 prevented certain persons from entering or leaving the
 country. Because of the'frequent closure of the Green Line,
 the shutting down of Beirut International Airport from March
 to September, and the naval blockade imposed on ports serving
 the Christian enclave, most Lebanese encountered considerable
 difficulties in traveling abroad. During the March to
 September period, Lebanese had the option of either traveling
 overland to Damascus or using a ferry/Hovercraft serving
 Jounieh in East Beirut and Larnaca, Cyprus. The ferry was
 frequently the target of shelling. Emigration and dual
 citizenship were permitted. There was no legal impediment to
 voluntary repatriation by Lebanese with valid identity papers.
 Lebanon historically has been a land of asylum. During this
 century, it has given refuge to hundreds of thousands of
 Armenians and Palestinians as well as to smaller numbers from
 other Middle Eastern ethnic and religious groups. However,
 Lebanon's grave political and economic troubles in recent
 years have virtually ended its attractiveness to new refugees.
 Lebanon's relationship with the Palestinian community has been
 difficult. Most Palestinians, like other foreigners, have not
 been able to obtain Lebanese citizenship. Their status as a
 "state within a state" under the 1969 Cairo Accords (abrogated
 in 1987) and their involvement in internal fighting from 1975
 to 1982 and again from 1985 until 1988 brought upon them the
 bitter enmity of many other groups. In the wake of the 1982
 conflict, many Palestinians encountered difficulty in renewing
 
 
 1475
 LEBlANON
 residence permits and travel documents, and delays still
 continue.
 Estimates of the Palestinian population in Lebanon vary from a
 high of 500,000 to 600,000 (Lebanese officials) to a lower
 figure of 300,000 (United Nations Relief and Works
 Administration (UNRWA). Palestinians have been hit hard by
 the collapse of Lebanon's once thriving economy and increasing
 numbers of them depend on UNRWA's relief, education, and
 medical facilities. These facilities operate in a difficult
 and sometimes dangerous environment. Various factions
 controlling the areas where UNRWA. schools, clinics, and relief
 centers are located impose limits on UNRWA activities. There
 are at least 17 Palestinian factions operating in Lebanon,
 ranging from several characterized as "Islamic" to numerous
 pro- and anti-Arafat organizations, many built around prominent
 individual leaders. Lebanon does not grant citizenship to
 Palestinians or to other foreign residents. Most Palestinians
 live in refugee camps, better described as neighborhoods or
 ghettos under the control of one or more of the political
 factions. Leaders are not elected, nor are there any
 representative institutions which would permit popular
 participation in running the camps. There is no functioning
 judicial system in the Palestinian camps. Fundamental
 protections and freedoms expected of governments do not exist
 in Palestinian areas.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 In practice, Lebanese citizens do not enjoy the right to
 change their government. Formally, Lebanon is a parliamentary
 democracy. According to the Constitution, direct elections
 must be held for the Parliament every 4 years. Parliament, in
 turn, elects a president every 6 years, and the president
 appoints a cabinet which must obtain the confidence of
 parliament. Political parties may be formed.
 Since the emergence of the post-1943 Lebanese state, national
 policy has been determined largely by a relatively restricted
 elite of traditional regional and sectarian leaders. The 1943
 National Pact essentially allocated political power on a
 confessional basis, according to the proportion of various
 religious groups in Lebanon as determined by the 1932 census.
 The unwritten National Pact stipulated that the president
 would be a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a Sunni
 Muslim, and the speaker of parliament a Shi'a Muslim. Seats
 in the Parliament were divided on a six-to-five ratio of
 Christians to Muslims. Positions in the government
 bureaucracy were allocated on a similar basis. Efforts to
 alter or abolish the confessional system of allocating
 political power have been at the center of Lebanese politics
 for more than 3 decades. Those religious groups most favored
 by the 1943 formula have sought to preserve it, while those
 disadvantaged by it have sought to revise it on the basis of
 new demographic realities or to abolish it entirely. This
 struggle has given a strongly religious coloration to Lebanese
 politics and to the continuing civil strife there.
 In the past 15 years, political violence has robbed democratic
 institutions of much of their remaining substance. No
 parliamentary elections have been held since 1972, and
 Parliament was unable to decide upon a new president before
 the incumbent president's term expired on September 23, 1988.
 Through the mediation of Saudi Arabia and other Arab
 
 
 1476
 countries, Lebanese parliamentary deputies reached agreement
 in Taif, Saudi Arabia, for political reform and new
 presidential elections. The Taif Agreement, ratified by
 Parliament in November, gives Muslims and Christians an equal
 number of seats in an expanded 108-seat parliament, and
 transfers some powers from the President to the Prime Minister
 and the Council of Ministers. The Parliament on November 5
 elected Rene Moawad as President and, after he was
 assassinated, they chose Elias Hrawi on November 24. A
 stalemate remains, however, since not all factions accept the
 Taif agreement. Rival forces continue to paralyze what little
 authority the central Government manages to exercise. Most of
 the country is under foreign or militia control.
 Section-4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigatio' of Alleged violations
 of:Human Rights
 Lebanese authorities have a mixed record in: dealing with
 international human rights groups, and indigenous'groups have
 not pressed the authorities strongly on human rights issues.
 The Lebanese Government-(and both rival cabinets during 1989)
 affirms its'support for international human rights and basic
 international documents and declarations on the subject.
 However, the chaotic situation within the country, especially
 the limited control exercised by the government over foreign
 forces and militias, has hindered its ability to be responsive
 to inquiries regarding human rights abuses.
 The Army of South Lebanon has refused requests for access by
 international humanitarian groups to the prison facility it
 maintains at al-Khiyam in south Lebanon.
 Section 5 Diicrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Ldnguage, or Sbcial Status
 Discrimination based on religion is built into the system of
 government. As a result of the National Pact of 1943,
 government jobs are allbcated on the ratio of six Christians
 for every five Muslims. Within each'religion, distribution of
 positions is further subdivided among specific Christian 'and
 Muslim sects and denominations. Many of the larger
 corporations adhere to these standards as well. Since the
 National Pact was instituted, however, the Shi'a Muslim
 community has become the largest confessional group in
 Lebanon, and the proportion of Christians in the population
 has declined significantly. The siz-to-five ratio thus works
 to the disadvantage of the MdsIim commdnity in general and the
 Shi'a in particular.
 Palestinians also have suffered discrimination in the area of
 employment, because the Government has denied them permission
 to obtain wdrk permits. The traditional position of the
 Lebanese authorities has been that there were not enough jobs
 for Lebanese Who sought employment, and so it could not open
 up the Lebanese work fbrce to outbiders.' The result was that
 Palestinian refugees, who were often skilled workers, were
 compelled to take menial or marginal jobs.
 There is little public or private debate on the issue of
 violence towards women, and no official statistics are
 produced on the subject. It is therefore difficult to
 estimate the extent to which it may be a problem in Lebanon.
 Each confessional group has its own family and personal status
 
 
 1477
 LEBANONi
 laws. Generally, it is difficult for women to obtain
 divorces, and, in divorce, difficulties often arise with
 respect to child custody. There are no restrictions on women
 owning property.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Lebanese labor law gives workers the right to unionize; choose
 their own representatives, provided they are employed within
 the bargaining unit; and determine their own policies and
 programs as long as the unions do not involve themselves in
 politics. Workers enjoy the right to strike and exercise it.
 Lebanese authorities do not control or restrict unions, except
 that government employees may not unionize or strike. The
 operation of trade unions has been affected by the internal
 strife of recent years. There is no special protection for
 trade union members or their property. There are 160 local
 labor unions in Lebanon; the major umbrella labor
 organization, the General Confederation of Lebanese Workers
 (CGTL), comprises 18 federations of labor unions. There are
 no comprehensive statistics on union membership, although the
 CGTL claims 200,000 to 250,000 dues-paying members, about
 one-third of the 600,000 employed persons in Lebanon. The
 CGTL is affiliated with the International Confederation of
 Arab Trade Unions, based in Damascus. Thirteen of its
 affiliated federations belong to the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions. Another affiliated
 federation is a member of the Communist-controlled World
 Federation of Trade Unions. Lebanon has ratified ILO
 Convention 98 on collective bargaining, but not Convention 87
 regarding freedom of association.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right of workers to organize and to bargain collectively
 exists in law and practice in Lebanon. Most workers' groups
 engage in some form of collective bargaining with their
 employers. The stronger federations are able to obtain
 significant gains through their own collective bargaining
 efforts. The weaker unions rely heavily on the mediation of
 the CGTL which, prior to the civil war, used to negotiate
 annual across-the-board pay increases with the private
 employers' association. The CGTL often has assisted unions
 not affiliated with it in their bargaining efforts, and on
 occasion has assisted nonunionized workers. There is no
 government mechanism to promote voluntary worker-employee
 negotiations, and workers are not protected against antiunion
 discrimination. On several occasions in 1989, militia forces
 intervened to suppress strikes and impose binding resolutions
 on all parties to the dispute. Lebanon has no special
 economic incentive or export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Lebanese law does not prohibit forced labor, and the
 Government does not practice forced labor. In the present
 anarchy, however, militias have forced workers, especially
 non-Lebanese manual laborers, to perform unpaid duties such as
 fortifying buildings, cleaning offices, and performing basic
 day labor.
 
 
 1478
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 .4 -
 Lebanese -labor law specifies the minimum age for employment of
 children as 8 years. In fact, few children under 16 years of
 age are employed.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 According to Lebanese labor law, the minimum wage was about
 $55 per month, calculated at the exchange rate in effect at
 the end of the year.. From this sum, income and social
 security taxes are deducted. Persons living in
 militiacontrolled areAs are also compelled to pay certain
 "taxes" to, the militias. Labor union leaders and government
 officials agree that the ayerage family requires a monthly
 income of $150 to $g0O to live decently.
 The Lebanese.worX a 6-day week. According to Lebanese labor
 law, the waximumn number of hours a person may work per week is
 48. In practice, workers in tOe industrial sector work an
 average of 35, ,hours a week, and workers in the other sectors
 of the economy work an average of 30 hours a week. Lebanese
 labor law includes specific occupational health and safety
