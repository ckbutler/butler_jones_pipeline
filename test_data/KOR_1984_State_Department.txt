 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 In the Republic of Korea, President Chun Doo Hwan, with the
 support of the country's military establishment, dominates the
 political scene. The elected legislature has some influence
 but continues to be controlled by the executive branch. The
 Government, which assumed power with primarily military
 support in 1980, is organized under a Constitution adopted by
 referendum in October 1980. Because of the threat from an
 aggressive Communist regime in North Korea, all Korean
 governments since the Republic's founding in 1948 have felt it
 necessary to give top priority to maintaining external and
 internal security; their policies in this respect, as
 implemented in part by the large and well-organized security
 services, have brought charges that dissent and peaceful
 opposition political activity are suppressed, and to many
 Koreans the degree of legitimacy of the Chun Government is
 open to question. At the time of the next presidential
 election, scheduled for 1988, President Chun has promised to
 step down to provide for a peaceful and constitutional change
 of power.
 The Republic of Korea has a mixed economy with extensive
 public sector intervention to stimulate and influence the
 direction of private sector activity. Since adopting an
 outward-looking development strategy in the mid-1960's, the
 Republic of Korea has had one of the highest real growth rates
 in the world and has achieved middle-income, "middle power"
 status. Since 1981, the economic leadership has moved toward
 a more open, freer market system.
 Korea is an ethnically homogeneous nation. Surrounded by
 great powers--China, Japan, and in modern times the
 USSR--Korea historically focused its foreign policy on the
 objective of avoiding subjugation by these neighbors. In
 1910, Korea was annexed by the Japanese Empire. Liberated in
 1945, it was then divided into temporary Soviet and American
 zones of military administration, organized in 1948 as,
 respectively, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, or
 North Korea, and the Republic of Korea, or South Korea.
 Since the division of the peninsula in 1945, reunification has
 been a major goal of Koreans on both sides of the dividing
 line. North Korea, however, has insisted on reunifying the
 nation on its own terms and through any means, including use
 of military force or terrorist activities. Despite North
 Korea's delivery of flood relief goods to the South in 1984
 and its positive response to South Korean proposals to hold
 North-South talks on economic cooperation and family
 reunification, military activities against the South
 continued, including continuing forward deployment of its
 armed forces. The memory of the 1983 Rangoon bombing against
 South Korean leaders, which the Burmese government determined
 was carried out by North Korea, is still fresh in the minds of
 South Koreans. The area on either side of the Demilitarized
 Zone remains one of the most heavily armed regions in the
 world. During the defection of a Soviet language student
 across the DMZ on November 23, 30-40 North Koreans soldiers
 crossed tne DMZ and exchanged fire with South Korean and
 American UN Command guards in an effort to retrieve the Soviet
 student.
 Furthermore, North Korea continues to strengthen its offensive
 force structure. Over the years, unremitting North Korean
 propaganda, overt and covert, has been directed at South
 
 
 799
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 Korea, calling for the destruction of American and South
 Korean installations, violence against South Korean leaders,
 and the overthrow of the South Korean Government.
 Thus, fear of another invasion from the North is a fundamental
 factor in South Korean thinking, and successive governments
 have held that for security reasons the Republic cannot afford
 the unfettered dissent and discord which would be permitted in
 an open political system. Nonetheless, many Koreans question
 the rationale for this position.
 Korea's traditional sociopolitical ideology, Confucianism,
 with its emphasis on order, conformity, consensus and filial
 piety, retains great strength, coexisting uneasily with the
 Western democratic ideals and industrial-age values to which
 Koreans have been exposed in this century.
 Koreans of both sexes participate in politics. Constitutional
 safeguards against ex post Tacto laws and double jeopardy are
 generally observed. Although the Constitution guarantees
 freedom of speech and the press, in practice both are
 abridged. Politicians and others who publicly criticize the
 Government are aware that there are limits beyond which they
 may be subject to some form of government action. Newspapers
 are expected to practice self-censorship, and failure to
 comply with this requirement has led to interrogation and, on
 occasion, dismissals of reporters and editors. The law limits
 the freedom to assemble and demonstrate, although in 1984, in
 a break with pasE practice, the Government did not apply the
 law to university campuses and arrests have accordingly been
 sharply reduced. Religious freedom, though otherwise
 complete, does not 4xtend to churches' involvement in
 political and some forms of social action. There is freedom of
 movement within the country and freedom to travel abroad,
 except that passport applications from persons with a history
 of political opposition are considered on a case-by-case basis
 and some are not allowed to leave the country.
 During 1984 the Government took several significant positive
 steps in the human rights field. More than 220 students
 jailed for campus demonstrations were released from prison
 during the year in three separate amnesties, and about 1,400
 students previously expelled for political activism were
 allowed to reenroll at their old campuses. About half this
 number had actually returned by the fall term. Some 86
 dissident professors, banned from teaching since 1980, were
 also permitted to teach again at their original campuses. In
 early 1984 the Government initiated a policy of 'campus
 autonomy" under which it withdrew security forces from
 university campuses, a major student demand; allowed peaceful
 demonstrations on campuses; and stated that henceforth
 universities would bear the primary responsibility for
 enforcing campus discipline. In the face of increased student
 resistance measures, the Government in November warned that it
 was prepared to have police enter campuses even without
 intervention requests by school officials. In practice,
 however, security forces only entered campuses on a few
 occasions. However, students have accused the Government of
 maintaining campus networks of police informers. Student
 attempts to move demonstrations off campus were met by large
 government security forces, which led to violent
 confrontations at university gates and, on occasion, elsewhere
 in downtown Seoul.
 
 
 800
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 In another amnesty move, the Government restored civil rights
 to more than than 700 former political prisoners, including
 some prominent intellectuals and human rights activists, and
 many convicted under emergency decrees of the Park Chung Hee
 government. The Government also announced that journalists
 who had been banned from employment since 1980 could be
 reemployed at the discretion of their former employers, and
 some have gone back to work. As a result of the large-scale
 amnesties carried out early in the year, the number of
 prisoners in politically-related cases was reduced to about
 110, the lowest since the Fifth Republic came into being in
 1980. About one-third that number are Korean residents of
 Japan convicted of espionage on behalf of North Korea, and
 most of the rest are convicted of National Security Law
 violations or activities involving the use or planned use of
 violence. However, the Government's current tactic of holding
 off-campus demonstration leaders in jail for brief periods,
 after summary convictions on minor charges, means that the
 total number of prisoners at any one time may be greater than
 the number of arrested and convicted persons on the 'prisoner
 of conscience" list.
 In 1980, the Government imposed an eight-year ban on political
 activities of 551 former politicians. Following Government
 action in 1983 to lift the ban on 250 of them, in 1984 the
 Government lifted the ban on 286 more, leaving a total of 15
 still affected. The 15, however, included several of Korea's
 major former opposition party leaders. One of the most
 prominent of these, Kim Dae Jung, has been in the United
 States for two years for medical treatment. Although he faces
 possible arrest and an unexpired prison sentence in Korea, he
 has announced plans to return early in 1985.
 Torture or severe physical mistreatment by the police occurred
 in 1984, but there were no reports of this abuse occurring in
 politically sensitive cases. Some female student
 demonstrators, however, charged that they were subjected to
 abusive strip searches by the police. The Government has said
 that it is trying to eliminate the deeply-rooted problem of
 abusive treatment by police, especially beatings of suspects
 during interrogation. This effort apparently has high-level
 support within the Government, as indicated by the passage in
 December 1983 of a law providing penalties up to life
 imprisonment for officials committing acts of torture.
 However, the problem, though diminished, has not disappeared.
 In addition to the police, there are two other security
 services whose agents are alleged to have beaten or otherwise
 mistreated suspects as well as dissidents, including students
 and activist workers, who were not in custody.
 Prison conditions remain spartan, and there are reports of
 hunger strikes and other protests, especially by students.
 There were no allegations of murder against the Government in
 1984.
 Strong forces within Korea seek improvements in human rights
 and liberalization of the Governing structure, notably some
 Christian churches' leadership and the rising middle class.
 Formidable obstacles to these forces exist, primarily Korea's
 Confucianist hierarchical traditions and the lack of
 enthusiasm on the part of the powerful military officer corps
 for direct participation by all Koreans in the democratic
 process and for freedom of expression. Furthermore, the
 
 
 801
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 perceived need for unity in the face of the North Korean
 threat inhibits efforts for political change which might
 affect stability.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports in 1984 of politically motivated
 killings by the Government.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no cases of permanent disappearance in 1984,
 although the police sometimes waited for more than the legal
 maximum of 40 days before notifying the families of arrested
 persons.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture. Confessions determined to
 have been induced by duress are inadmissible in the courts,
 and a confession alone is not legally sufficient to secure a
 conviction. The Government insists that it has issued
 injunctions against torture and that these are strictly
 enforced and violations sternly punished. Nevertheless, while
 there were no allegations of torture in politically sensitive
 cases in 1984, there were continuing reports of beatings by
 police during interrogations of prisoners. Two female
 students who had been detained for participating in an
 off-campus demonstration filed suit against police whom they
 accused of conducting abusive strip searches. The use of
 excessive force by the police, despite high-level efforts to
 reduce or eliminate it, has proven to be a pervasive and
 ingrained problem. In violent confrontations with student
 rioters, police units have generally remained well-disciplined
 but rioters have also been beaten on apprehension.
 Accusations of police beatings in non-political cases occur
 fairly frequently and are sometimes reported in the press. No
 case has yet been brought under the law adopted by the
 National Assembly in 1983 toughening sentences for those
 convicted of killing or injuring through torture.
 Human rights groups allege, in addition, that the police and
 other government security agencies have been responsible for,
 or have not intervened to prevent, the beating of some
 students, workers and other dissidents not in custody. A
 human rights activist leader was beaten at his church by men
 that some Christian activists linked to the security
 services. The Government denied the connection.
 In early 1984 the Government arrested a prominent clergyman
 and two professors who had been conducting a study of
 reunification policies and charged them with violating the
 National Security Law. These dissidents were subsequently
 released without trial, but Christian activists state that the
 Government used threats to coerce the defendants into making
 public expressions of regret as a condition of their release.
 Activists also accuse police of forcing students under
 investigation for connection with workers issues into signing
 
 
 802
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 confessions of subversive activities. There is no evidence on
 the record to support these charges.
 Conditions in Korean correctional institutions are spartan,
 and discipline is strict. While prisoners who break rules or
 protest conditions are sometimes beaten, under normal
 circumstances convicts are not subjected to physical
 punishment. Prisoners may receive visits only from their
 lawyers and immediate families. There does not seem to be a
 difference between the treatment of political and
 non-political prisoners, although the authorities have
 occasionally allowed special provisions for political
 prisoners, such as heaters during the winter or examination by
 outside physicians. There is no apparent difference in the
 treatment of prisoners on the basis of wealth, social class,
 race, or sex.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 From time to time, the security services have not only
 detained persons accused of violating laws on political
 dissent but have also increased surveillance of, or put under
 house arrest, those they think intend to violate the laws.
 Dissidents who openly criticize the Government are sometimes
 picked up for short periods and then released. Arrest
 warrants are required by law but are sometimes not produced at
 the time of arrest in politically-related cases.
 Korean law requires that, within 40 days after making an
 arrest, the police notify an arrested person's family of his
 detention and whereabouts. The police normally wait at least
 several days, and occasionally more than 40 days, before
 making notification. The Constitution guarantees the right of
 prompt legal assistance and the right to request court review
 in case of arrest. For persons deemed 'socially dangerous'
 the law allows preventive detention under provisions of the
 Social Protection and Social Stability Laws. Preventive
 detention is for a fixed term, which, however, a judicial
 panel may extend for periods of up to 10 years. Human rights
 activists and foreign observers are aware of two persons now
 in preventive detention for politically-related offenses,
 their detention having been renewed in 1984 for two more years.
 Habeas corpus, not traditional in Korean law, was introduced
 after World War II, abolished in the 1970's, and reintroduced
 in 1980. It does not apply to those charged with violations
 of the National Security Act or laws punishable by at least 5
 years imprisonment, which include most political offenses.
 The Government released 229 students from jail in four
 amnesties between February and May. All the students had been
 arrested for anti-government campus demonstrations, though
 some had also been convicted of National Security Law
 violations. With these releases, the total of student
 demonstators released since December 1983 grew to 360, and the
 jails were empty of student demonstrators for the first time
 in years. A small number of students convicted under the
 National Security Law for carrying out subversive activities
 is still imprisoned. In a Liberation Day amnesty the
 Government restored civil rights to 714 former political
 offenders, including a number of human rights leaders,
 intellectuals and former politicians. The Government also
 announced that it will erase the criminal records of about
 5,000 Koreans for wartime collaboration with North Korean
 
 
 803
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 occupation forces, thus easing employment and other social
 difficulties for those affected.
 Following the last student release in May, a list of
 .prisoners of conscience' maintained by the Human Rights
 Committee (HRC) of the Korea National Council of Churches
 contained 52 names, a low since the beginning of the present
 Government. (The HRC definition of "prisoner of conscience'
 does not exclude those convicted of crimes involving the
 advocacy or use of violence, contrary to Amnesty
 International's definition.) This figure compares to 325 at
 the end of 1983, 417 in November 1982, and 272 in November
 1981. Subsequent arrests and the addition of newly discovered
 cases, mainly Korean residents of Japan convicted, in prior
 years, of espionage for North Korea, brought the number on the
 list to about 110. However, student-police confrontations
 off-campus and student violence on-and off-campus in the fall
 of 1984 resulted in a large number of persons being arrested
 and sentenced to brief periods of detention on minor charges
 after summary convictions. These do not figure in the
 political prisoner list.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution guarantees many rights of defendants: the
 right to presumption of innocence; the right against
 self-incrimination, ex post facto laws, and double jeopardy;
 the right to a speedy trial; and the right to legal counsel.
 These rights are generally observed, although there have been
 cases in the past in which defendants in politically-sensitive
 trials have not been able to obtain lawyers, reportedly
 because of lawyers' reluctance to accept such cases in the
 fact of actual or potential government pressure.
 The President appoints the members of the Supreme Court, whose
 Chief Justice in turn appoints lower-level judges. The
 judiciary is considered independent in ordinary criminal and
 civil cases but much less so in politically-sensitive cases.
 It is generally assumed, for example, that the original and
 appeal verdicts in the case of six Chinese airplane- hijackers
 tried before Seoul courts were guided by foreign relations
 considerations.
 Trials are usually open to the public, but trial documents are
 not part of the public record. Charges against defendants in
 the courts are clearly stated, with the exception that, in
 lengthy and complex indictments, the relationship between
 specific acts alleged and violations of specific sections of
 the penal code may not always be clearly drawn. In cases
 involving a mixture of political and criminal charges this can
 bring into question the fairness of proceedings.
 The same courts try political and ordinary criminal cases.
 The military courts do not try civilians. Defendants have the
 right of appeal in felony cases, a right which is often
 exercised and frequently results in substantial reductions in
 sentences. Death sentences are automatically appealed.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The security apparatus is large and highly developed. Many
 opposition figures and political and religious dissidents are
 subjected to surveillance. During politically sensitive
 
 
 804
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 periods, this surveillance by one or more security agencies
 may increase or a form of house arrest may be imposed. There
 have also been charges of telephone tapping and opening or
 interception of correspondence. Koreans who meet with
 foreigners, particularly with journalists and embassy
 officials, are often questioned afterwards. While the
 Constitution requires a warrant, issued by a judge upon
 request of a prosecutor, for search and seizure in a
 residence, the police have at times forced their way into
 private homes without warrants.
 Korean police practice requires police commanders to know a
 good deal about the personal and business affairs of all
 residents in their jurisdictions. This system is effective in
 crime control, and urban residents generally credit it with
 keeping their streets safe. By contrast, the presence of
 police informer networks on college campuses with the primary
 purpose of keeping track of political activities there has
 been a key issue among students, including those who are not
 politically active. Students have accused the Government of
 maintaining police informers on-campus even after uniformed
 forces were withdrawn in accordance with the 'campus autonomy'
 policy.
 In most other respects the Government honors the right of
 personal privacy and the integrity of the home and family.
 Parental rights to educate children are broad, and
 restrictions on study in foreign-administered schools (whether
 in Korea or overseas), originally imposed to force wealthy
 Koreans to involve themselves in the nation's social and
 educational development, have been relaxed in recent years.
 The state rarely seeks to intervene in such inherently
 personal decisions as marriage, choice of vocation, and
 formation of social and familial ties. However, the state, by
 setting graduation levels at higher education institutions,
 does seek to guide the mixture of graduates according to
 predicted future manpower needs.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although freedom of speech and press are guaranteed by the
 Constitution, in practice the expression of opposition
 viewpoints is severely limited. Dissidents are sometimes
 restricted in their meetings and movements in periods judged
 volatile by the Government. Members of the National Assembly
 frequently criticize particular government actions or policies
 but are careful to stop short of fundamental criticism of the
 Government itself, such as attacks on its legitimacy or
 personal attacks on the President. However, formal proposals
 for votes of "no confidence' at the Assembly and the stated
 rationale therefore are given full publicity. Likewise,
 criticism of government policies (for example, the campus
 autonomy policy) is reported by the media. While no direct
 actions against Assemblymen were taken in direct response to
 opinions expressed in the legislature, two Assemblymen who
 attempted to switch allegiance to a new opposition party were
 detained for three days in December. Discussion of security,
 formulas for political settlement with North Korea, the
 legitimacy of the Chun administration, and other sensitive
 topics is sharply curtailed. Academic freedom is subject to
 some political limitations, although 86 professors who lost
 their jobs in the political upheavals of 1980 were allowed
 
 
 805
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 during 1984 to return to teaching at the schools at which they
 had last taught.
 The domestic media engage in self-censorship, according to
 verbal or written guidelines the Government regularly gives to
 editors. Journalists who object to or ignore these guidelines
 or criticize the guidance system have, in the past, been
 picked up for questioning, and on occasion dismissed or sent
 out of the country on assignment. There was a reliable report
 in 1984 of a journalist whose columns were critical of the
 Government being sent abroad for study.
 The extent of journalistic free expression varies. For
 example, when the National Assembly is in session, opposition
 viewpoints have been rather fully reported in the press.
 Increased reporting in 1984 was permitted by government
 authorities on the activities of dissident politicians and
 groups, including student movements. Reporting on dissidents
 was factual without editorial comment; reporting on student
 demonstrations was marked by editorial comment highlighting
 the socially disruptive nature of their activities. Also,
 increased press exposure was given to certain topics
 considered politically sensitive by the Government. For
 example, a public seminar on the nature of the political
 transition in 1988 was fully reported. However, a subsequent
 magazine article carrying complete texts, though planned,
 never appeared. Articles by opposition and dissident
 politicians increased, both in number and directness of
 criticism against the Government. A scandal allegedly
 involving a leading member of the ruling party received full
 coverage in the press and the publicity led to his
 resignation.
 More books by dissident religious and political figures
 appeared in bookstores than in recent years. Some books,
 however, continue to be confiscated or banned from sale.
 Approved books on Communist and socialist theory are studied
 in universities and can be found in bookstores, but many books
 and artistic works with "socialist' themes are banned.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are thousands of private organizations in Korea. Most
 peaceful non-political assemblies take place entirely without
 official supervision or restriction.
 The Law on Assembly and Demonstrations prohibits specified
 categories of assembly, including those considered likely to
 undermine public order or cause social unrest. The law also
 requires that demonstrations of all types and outdoor
 political assemblies be reported in advance to the police.
 Violation of the law carries a maximum sentence of seven years
 or a fine of about $3,750. Under this law, police have at
 times intervened and broken up meetings.
 Before the release this year and last of all students
 imprisoned for taking part in demonstrations, far more than
 half of all Korea's 'prisoners of conscience* were imprisoned
 for violation of this law.  In 1984 students have not been
 arrested for taking part in on-campus demonstrations; almost
 all students arrested in connection with demonstrations
 off-campus have been charged with minor offenses against
 public order and released after short periods of time, rather
 than convicted under this law. Only a small number of people
 
 
 806
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 were convicted and sentenced under this law in 1984, in
 particular ten taxi drivers who were convicted in connection
 with demonstrations in Taegu and Pusan. They were sentenced
 and released.
 The single national labor federation, the Federation of Korean
 Trade Unions (FKTU), and its 16 national affiliate unions are
 not controlled by the government. Their freedom of action,
 however, is severely circumscribed by law. Labor
 organizations are forbidden to support politicians or
 political parties, though the FKTU does lobby national
 assemblymen, particularly of the ruling Democratic Justice
 Party, and assemblymen often attend labor-organized
 gatherings. All local unions must be organized within
 individual enterprises, creating a structure of thousands of
 individual unions, most of them small and weak. Direct
 participation in local unions' bargaining activities by
 outside agencies such as the Asian-American Free Labor
 Institute, which maintains an office in Korea, is forbidden.
 The Asian-American Free Labor Institute maintains an office in
 Korea. The FKTU and its constituent national unions can and
 sometimes do bargain on behalf of the locals and conduct
 education programs, but only with government and employer
 approval. Collective actions and strikes, though technically
 legal, are to all intents and purposes forbidden. Religious
 labor ministries such as the Catholic Young Christian Workers
 and the Protestant Urban Industrial Mission are also severely
 limited in the assistance which they can provide the unions.
 Under these circumstances, government and employer influence
 has greatly exceeded that of unions in setting wages and
 resolving other major labor issues.
 According to FKTU figures, dues-paying union membership in
 1984 increased by four percent, after four years of decline.
 International contacts by the unions increased, with the FKTU
 and its member unions hosting three regional conferences,
 including the Asian meeting of the International Confederation
 of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). The Republic of Korea sent an
 observer delegation to the annual conference of the
 International Labor Organization in 1984. The FKTU is
 affiliated with the ICFTU, and FKTU member unions are
 affiliated with recognized international trade union
 federations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state-favored religion in Korea. There is
 complete freedom of proselytizing, doctrinal teaching, and
 conversion. Minority sects are not discriminated against, and
 adherence to a faith confers neither advantages nor
 disadvantages in civil, military, or official life. Churches
 and religious groups are subject to the same restrictions on
 political activity and criticism of the Government as are all
 other institutions in Korea. Conscientious objectors are
 subject to arrest.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is essentially complete freedom of movement and freedom
 to change employment in Korea. Because Korea is one of the
 most densely populated areas of the world, the Government
 encourages a modest level of emigration. It does not
 discriminate against prospective emigrants. Most people can
 obtain passports, except for criminals or, in some cases,
 persons considered politically suspect. A number of
 
 
 807
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 dissidents, former political prisoners, and persons banned
 from political activity have been allowed to travel abroad.
 Foreign exchange considerations have caused the Government to
 limit to some extent the number of tourist passports issued.
 Passports, when issued, are typically limited to one year,
 although there are exceptions in which passports are issued up
 to the legally maximum 5-year validity.
 A small continuing influx of Vietnamese boat refugees is
 admitted to first asylum in Korea. They are cared for at a
 camp in Pusan by the Korean Red Cross until they can be
 resettled abroad. Over 600 such refugees have passed through
 Korea in the last several years.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Korea's Constitution and statutes, as well as its traditions,
 concentrate their political power in the President, a
 concentration further intensified by the support the President
 enjoys from the military establishment. The President and the
 members of the National Assembly are the only elected
 officials in Korea. Under the 1980 Presidential Election Law,
 the President is chosen by an electoral college of about 5,000
 members. By law, presidential campaigns are brief, and
 candidates are severely restricted in campaigning, including
 both the amount they may spend and the methods they may use to
 appeal to voters. In the 1981 Presidential election these
 restrictions, together with the authorities' careful screening
 of electoral college candidates and the reluctance of several
 strong potential presidential candidates to run, resulted in
 the virtual absence of effective opposition to incumbent
 President Chun Doo Hwan, who won by a nearly unanimous
 electoral vote. The Constitution limits the President to a
 single seven-year term and cannot be amended to allow the
 incumbent President to continue in office.
 The next presidential election is scheduled for 1988.
 President Chun has reaffirmed that he intends to step down at
 that time to provide for a peaceful and constitutional
 transfer of power.
 The National Assembly, although politically weak, is important
 as a forum for the expression of divergent views of the
 Government's programs. Recent changes in the Assembly Law
 have given the Assembly a somewhat increased role in examining
 government actions. Interpellations of Ministers have been
 increasingly pointed and debate among the parties increasingly
 vigorous. Legislation normally originates with the executive
 branch, although the Assembly has at times passed or blocked
 laws contrary to the President's wishes. Members of the
 Assembly, who serve a four-year term, are Korea's only
 directly-elected public officials. The election laws passed
 in 1981 provide for a proportional representation system that
 reserves 92 of the Assembly's 276 seats for members appointed
 by the parties, with two-thirds of those seats awarded to the
 party which gains a plurality of the popular vote. In the
 Assembly elections of March 1981, the authorities brought
 various forms of pressure to bear to discourage some potential
 candidates but did not interfere in the voting. Of the 184
 Assembly seats to be filled by elections, the government party
 ran candidates for 92, of which it won 90, along with a 36
 percent plurality of the popular vote. The government party
 was accordingly awarded 61 proportional representation seats,
 
 40-387 0 - 85 - 52
 
 
 808
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 giving it a comfortable majority in the National Assembly.
 Opposition parties divided the remaining seats. During 1984
 preparations were being made for the next Assembly elections,
 expected early in 1985. Korean observers expect these
 elections to provide a benchmark of the extent of progress in
 increasing freedom of political choice.
 While the Constitution provides for local autonomy, the
 Government has resisted implementation on the grounds that the
 financial preconditions established by law have not been met.
 The laws governing participation in the political process were
 enacted in 1981 just prior to the lifting of martial law. All
 existing parties were disbanded and new ones were formed. At
 that time, a law was enacted barring 551 persons from taking
 part in any political activity for eight years. The
 Government in February and November 1984 reduced the number of
 banned politicians to 15. The most prominent persons affected
 by this ban remain covered by it, although during 1984 many of
 the banned politicians were being allowed to carry out limited
 political activity.
 One of the most prominent of those still banned, Kim Dae Jung,
 has said he will to return to Korea early in 1985 from his
 two-year stay in the United States. In the 1971 presidential
 election, he garnered nearly half the vote. Subsequently, his
 political activity in Korea and abroad cost him time in jail
 and a death sentence (later commuted to 20 years'
 imprisonment). He was released from prison in 1982 to come to
 the United States for medical treatment. The Government's
 official position is that it will 'take necessary measures in
 accordance with the law if he returns home.'
 Koreans, other than those under this political ban, are free
 to belong to and participate in the activities of political
 parties. However, these parties have had difficulty
 attracting a popular following for a number of reasons. The
 Government may dissolve any party it deems contrary to "basic
 democratic order;' the electoral laws put time and fiscal
 constraints on campaigning which cause all parties, and
 particularly the opposition, significant difficulties in
 publicizing their programs; and the Government can and does
 veto their choices of leaders, candidates, and policy
 positions.
 In December 1984, two members of the opposition Democratic
 Korea Party who had defected to a new opposition party were
 detained for three days by a security service. The new party
 is being formed with significant participation by politicians
 from whom the ban on political activity had been lifted this
 year. Many observers believe that the detention was a
 government effort to discourage greater participation in the
 new opposition party.
 Limitations on freedom of the press also cause opposition
 parties particular difficulties. Opposition parties have not
 succeeded in modifying the election laws significantly in time
 for the 1985 elections.
 Women are free to vote, become government officials and run
 for the National Assembly; they hold seven Assembly seats, all
 but one appointed by their parties. In practice, the power
 structure remains male-dominated.

 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Republic of Korea does not belong to any international
 human rights bodies and usually does not welcome outside
 involvement in the human rights area. The Government
 tolerates the existence of domestic human rights groups but
 closely monitors their operations.
 There are no government agencies charged with the protection
 of human rights, although political parties and the National
 Assembly have committees which are concerned with oversight of
 some aspects of the issue. A number of private organizations
 are also active in this area, chiefly the Human Rights
 Committee of the Korean National Council of Churches, the
 Catholic Justice and Peace Committee, and the Korea Legal Aid
 Center in Seoul. The Human Rights Committee has ties with the
 World Council of Churches. The Committee and other human
 rights organizations submit petitions to the Government and
 make their views known both inside and outside Korea. Most
 observers believe that these organizations have been
 relatively effective in furthering their aims, depending on
 the issue. People working with these groups are sometimes
 questioned and, on occasion, visited or detained by the
 security services, though apparently none have been arrested
 in the past several years.
 The Amnesty International 1984 Report expressed its concern
 about the detention of prisoners of conscience, reports of
 torture and unfair trials, widespread arrest of students, the
 use of short-term detention without charge, and house arrest
 against students and other critics of the Government. Freedom
 House lists Korea as "partly free.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Republic of Korea is one of the most densely populated
 countries in the world, with 7.4 persons per acre of arable
 land. Only 22 percent of its 24.4 million 8cres are arable.
 The nation's physical wealth is sparse; most of the natural
 resources of the Korean peninsula are found in North Korea.
 The Republic's major economic asset is its well-educated and
 productive work force. The population reached 42 million in
 1984, but the growth rate has dropped to 1.5 percent, due in
 part to concerted efforts by the Government to popularize
 voluntary family planning.
 Skillful management by Korean economic technocrats, many of
 them graduates of leading Western universities, has given
 Korea one of the world's most dynamic economies. Since 1965,
 economic growth in real terms has averaged about 9 percent per
 year; in 1984 it was about 8 percent. Per capita gross
 national product has grown from $100 in 1965 to about $1,900
 in 1982. The widespread distribution of income gains and the
 approximate parity between rural and urban household incomes
 have increased dramatically the nutrition, health, living
 conditions, and economic choices of the entire population.
 The economy is a blend of private sector firms and individuals
 and public sector enterprises. As the gross national product
 has grown to almost $75 billion in 1982, the Government has
 begun to rely increasingly on market forces to allocate
 
 
 810
 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 resources and is gradually liberalizing its control over
 imports, foreign investment, and the domestic financial sector.
 Participation in the economy and a share of its benefits are
 effectively open to all. The right to own property, alone and
 in association with others, is recognized in law and
 practice. There is no economic discrimination based on race
 or religion. Discrimination against women is declining,
 although as in most traditional Asian societies men still tend
 to be the primary income earners and property owners.
 A series of major revisions to the legal code in recent years
 has given women rights in inheritance, child custody, family
 headship, and other areas which law and Confucian tradition
 had long denied them. Women enjoy full access to educational
 opportunities at all levels. They are increasingly
 represented, though still largely at entry levels, in the
 military, the police, the civil service, the professions, and
 private industry. They are not legally protected against
 discrimination in hiring, pay, or advancement, and these
 remain problem areas. For example, according to the Korea
 Employers' Federation, the average wage of female workers is
 46.8 percent of that of male workers. Korea has not developed
 a politically powerful feminist movement, but consciousness of
 women's issues has been increasing. During 1984 women's
 groups organized a federation to campaign for revision of the
 Family Law, including provisions concerning the head of family
 system, and in favor of equal property rights in case of
 divorce and equal rights in child custody. Traditional
 Confucian influence remains strong, however. The Government
 announced that it would ask the National Assembly to ratify
 the U.N. Convention on the Prevention of Discrimination
 Against Women with a reservation on Articles 9 and 16, which
 conflict with present domestic Korean law.
 Improved health care and nutrition were responsible for
 increasing Korean life expectancy at birth to 68 years in
 1984. By 1984 infant mortality declined to 30.4 deaths per
 1,000 live births. Access to safe drinking water increased to
 71 percent of the population in 1979. Caloric intake in 1981
 was 126 percent of minimum nutritional requirements.
 Education receives high priority in government policy. The
 adult literacy rate increased to 93 percent in 1978. Primary
 school education is universal for both sexes, and over 90
 percent of elementary students enter secondary school.
 Entrance to institutions of higher education is highly
 competitive. Only about 50 percent of those who wish to
 attend are able to do so. There is a substantial amount of
 social mobility based on the merit system in education and
 employment.
