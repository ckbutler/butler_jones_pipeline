 LESOTHO
 Lesotho is a constitutional monarchy with King Letsie III as Head of State. Under
 the 1993 Constitution, the King fills a ceremonial role, has no executive authority,
 and is proscribed from actively taking part in political initiatives. Prime Minister
 Pakalitha Mosisili, the leader of the Lesotho Congress for Democracy Party (LCD),
 took office in June and is the Head of Government. In the May 23 elections, the
 LCD won 79 seats in the expanded 80-member Parliament. The Basotho National
 
 
 Party (BNP) won the one remaining seat Over 700 foreign and national election ob-
 servers concluded that the poll met international standards for a transparent
 multiparty election. The LANGA Commission, a group of election auditors from the
 Southern African Development Community (SADC), reported that while there was
 no evidence to substantiate charges of electoral fraud, mismanagement of polling
 data made it impossible to confirm that fraud did not occur. However, opposition
 parties alleged that the election result was corrupted by fraud and launched a pro-
 longed and aggressive protest at the royal palace in Maseru on August 4. The pro-
 test destabilized the Government, as armed opposition supporters engaged in gun
 batties with the police and ruling party supporters, and used violence to disarm the
 police, intimidate workers and business owners, and shut down government and
 business operations on three occasions during August and September. Opposition
 protesters urged the King, who had staged a coup in 1994, to take an unconstitu-
 tional initiative to dissolve Parliament and install a government of national unity
 on the basis of their allegations that the LCD Government was illegitimate. The op-
 position protest facilitated a junior officer rebellion in the army on September 11
 as army rebels aligned themselves with the opposition, resulted in a virtual coup,
 and severely strained relations between the Head of State and the Government. The
 protest led to an unprecedented level of politically motivated violence, injury, de-
 struction of property, the death of civilians and law enforcement officers, and com-
 promised the neutrality of the King in political affairs. The 1998 opposition alliance
 palace vigil and antigovernment protests precipitated intervention at the Govern-
 ment's request by a SADC military task force on September 22, in accordance with
 an SADC agreement to ensure the security of the democratically elected govern-
 ment. The SADC military task force was composed of troops from Botswana and the
 Republic of South Africa. In the past the judiciary had been subject at times to gov-
 ernment and chieftainship influence; however, there are no credible reports of the
 use of such influence during the year.
 The security forces consist of the Lesotho Defense Force (LDF), the Royal Lesotho
 Mounted Police (RLMP), and the National Security Service (NSS). The Prime Min-
 ister is the Minister of Defense. In 1996 and 1997, the Parliament passed the Leso-
 tho Defense Act (1996), Regulations for Military Justice (1997), and amended the
 Royal Lesotho Mounted Police Force Act. This new legislation was designed to bring
 these services under direct civilian control. However, the politicized armed services
 have a history of intervening in the country's politics and government. The LDF
 ruled Lesotho with two successive military regimes from 1985-90, and 1990-93. In
 September an SADC task force put down an army rebellion, arrested LDF rebels,
 and disarmed the remaining soldiers. The LDF is now the subject of a national de-
 bate on the-structure, size and role of the military. The NSS is accountable directly
 to the Prime Minister, and the RLMP reports to the Minister of Home Affairs. The
 NSS and the RLMP are also under review in a national debate on comprehensive
 reform of the security services. Members of the security forces on occasion commit-
 ted human rights abuses.
 Lesotho is a landlocked country surrounded by South Africa and almost entirely
 dependents on its sole neighbor for trade, finance, employment, and access to the
 outside world. A large proportion of the adult male work force is employed in mines
 in South Africa. Basotho miners' remittances account for slightly over one-third of
 gross national product (GNP). Real GNP grew an estimated 9 percent in 1997, with
 inflation estimated at less than 7 percent. Per capita GNP was approximately $790
 (4740 maloti). State-owied organizations predominate in the agroindustrial and ag-
 ribusiness sectors, but private sector activity dominates in the small manufacturing
 and construction sectors. The opposition palace protest and the SADC military inter-
 vention resulted in a wave of political violence and arson that destroyed nearly 80
 percent of the commercial infrastructure in Maseru and two other major towns.
 Thousands of jobs were lost and many entrepreneurs were forced into bankruptcy.
 Losses in the range of hundreds of millions of dollars were sustained. Under the
 traditional chieftainship structure, land use and tenure is controlled by the chiefs
 and formally owned by the Kingdom (i.e., crown lands).
 The Government generally respected many of the human rights of its citizens;
 however, there continued to be problems in some areas. Members of the security
 forces committed a few extrajudicial killings. Police also killed several persons and
 wounded others during clashes with opposition protesters during the August-Sep-
 tember crisis period. There were allegations that police on occasion have used exces-
 sive force against suspects during arrests and while in custody. Discipline in the se-
 curity services was shattered during the August-September political crisis. At least
 one death occurred when the police failed to keep rival political factions apart. Fire-
 fights between police and soldiers resulted in the killing of at least one policeman
 and the wounding of several others. Clashes with SAC forces initiated by armed
 
 
 opposition supporters and army mutineers in September resulted in the death of
 nine members of the South African National Defense Force, 60 LDF soldiers, and
 more than 40 opposition-allied civilians. A total of 33 members of the RLMP face
 sedition and high treason charges following their involvement in a February 1997
 police mutiny, which reflected entrenched mistrust and political competition be-
 tween the Government and some elements within the police force, and an uneasy
 institutional rivalry between elements of the police and the army. The LDF initially
 stayed out of but ultimately quelled the police mutiny. This step away from active
 partisan engagement in politics to a more professional civil/military relationship
 was reversed by the junior officer mutiny, which undermined the integrity of the
 security forces. Prison conditions are poor, and lengthy pretrial detention is a prob-
 lem. There are long delays in trials; the 33 RLMP members have remained in the
 maximum security prison for 18 months without significant progress to try their
 cases. The security forces infringed on citizens' privacy rights. Women's rights con-
 tinued to be restricted severely, and domestic violence remained common. Societal
 discrimination against the disabled is common. Government enforcement of prohibi-
 tions against child labor is lax in commercial enterprises that involve hazardous
 working conditions. The Government restricts some worker rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Members of the security forces com-
 mitted a few extrajudicial killings. In February police fired shotguns into a group
 of workers protesting at a textile plant, killing two persons and wounding 20 others.
 In December members of the Lesotho Defense Force killed three South Africans
 who had crossed the border allegedly to recover their cattle stolen earlier by
 Basotho raiders.
 During and following the palace protest, violent clashes between opposition and
 LCD supporters resulted in at least four civilian deaths. Soldiers and police ex-
 changed gunfire on several occasions, and one policeman was shot and killed. About
 10 policemen were wounded in clashes with armed opposition supporters. Approxi-
 mately four opposition members were killed in exchanges with the police in the vi-
 cinity of the palace. Violent clashes between opposition and LCD supporters at the
 village level resulted in several deaths.
 Between September 21 and 28, nine South African soldiers were killed while sup-
 pressing the army mutiny. Over 50 LDF soldiers and 40 opposition-allied civilians
 died in firefights with SADC troops. Many civilians were arrested for arson, assault,
 looting and weapons possession. All LDF soldiers were disarmed, and those believed
 responsible were arrested and later charged with mutiny and other capital offenses
 against the defense and national security acts.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution expressly prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading punishment
 or other treatment, and the Government generally respects these provisions. How-
 ever, there were allegations that police and prison officials occasionally used exces-
 sive force against suspects in their custody. Some alleged victims and NGO's
 claimed that police beat suspects.
 Opposition leaders claimed that the 32 mutinous soldiers who were arrested after
 the September 22 SADC military intervention were tortured by government and
 prison officials. However, no clear evidence to that effect has been presented. Am-
 nesty International (AI) personnel investigated these and other claims of human
 rights abuses in October, but AI had not issued a report of its findings by year's
 end.
 Allegations of criminal activity by SADC forces were investigated, and those found
 guilty were disciplined immediately by South Africa in accordance with the Status
 of Forces Agreement signed on September 17. Soldiers who committed minor dis-
 ciplinary infractions were sent home.
 Prison conditions are poor. Prison facilities are overcrowded and in disrepair, but
 conditions do not threaten the health or lives of inmates.
 Prison conditions are not monitored independently.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention, and there were no reports of such abuses. However, opposition
 leaders alleged that the Government engaged in "political victimization" by arrest-
 ing their supporters for allegedly unlawful acts and punishing alleged mutinous sol-
 diers with incarceration during the crisis. During the crisis, a number of persons
 were arrested for arson, looting, and possession of stolen property and unlawful fire-
 arms. Many homes were searched for weapons, ammunition, and stolen property.
 
 
 226
 
 Some of those searched and arrested were opposition supporters. However, there
 were no court cases or clear evidence that demonstrated that authorities targeted
 opposition supporters. The Government's intention to court martial alleged army
 mutineers was criticized by opposition parties, which demanded their release and
 a blanket amnesty for both soldiers and civilians for acts committed during the cri-
 sis.
 The legal fraternity remains concerned that the 33 police mutineers who were ar-
 rested in February 1997 continued to be held without significant progress toward
 their trial. Although charges have been filed and some preliminary procedures have
 been completed, no formal trial had been held. There was some concern that persons
 who allegedly were involved in arson and the looting of public and private establish-
 ments in September filled the district and central lock-ups with little prospect for
 speedy trials. A significant number of persons arrested in interior districts for these
 infractions were tried and sentenced to fines and/or incarceration. Local observers
 believe that pretrial detainees on remand constitute up to half the prison population
 in some locations. Because of serious backlogs of the court's caseloads, the period
 of pretrial remand for some suspects can last months or years.
 In 1997 the Government repealed the provisions of the Internal Security Act (ISA)
 of 1984 allowing for investigative detention.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary; however, in the past, magistrates appeared to be subject at times to govern-
 ment and chieftainship influence. The High Court Chief Justice's decision in 1994
 to swear in a provisional ruling council, in defiance of the Constitution, raised ques-
 tions about the independence of the judiciary. Opposition parties alleged that the
 High Court was biased against their cases following the May elections, but court
 officials stated that the opposition did not succeed in its cases due to a lack of evi-
 dence to support its claims.
 The judiciary consists of the Court of Appeal (which meets semiannually), the
 High Court, magistrate's courts, and customary or traditional courts (which exist
 largely in rural areas to administer customary law).
 The High Court also provides procedural and substantive advice and guidance on
 matters of legal procedure to military tribunals; however, it does not participate in
 arriving at judgments in such courts. Military tribunals operating under the De-
 fense Act have jurisdiction only over military cases, such as the impending prosecu-
 tion of rebel junior army officers. Decisions by military tribunals may not be ap-
 pealed.
 Accused persons have and freely exercise the right to counsel and public trial. The
 authorities generally respect court decisions and rulings. There is no trial by jury.
 Criminal trials normally are adjudicated by a single High Court judge who presides,
 with two assessors in an advisory capacity. In civil cases, judges normally hear
 cases alone.
 Persons detained or arrested in criminal cases and defendants in civil cases have
 the right to legal counsel. There is no system to provide public defenders. The 1981
 Criminal Procedures and Evidence Act, as amended in 1984, makes provision for
 granting bail. Bail is granted regularly and generally fairly.
 There is a large case backlog, which leads to lengthy delays in trials. The
 firebombing of the High Court on September 22 destroyed case files and other im-
 portant documents and further hampered the normal operation of the courts.
 Under the Constitution, in custom and tradition, certain rights and privileges ac-
 corded to men are denied to women. When traditional law and custom is invoked
 in a court case, a male plaintiff can opt for customary judgments by a principal chief
 rather than a civil court and the judgment legally is binding. This system greatly
 disadvantages women.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f, Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Al-
 though search warrants usually are required under normal circumstances, the 1984
 Internal Security Act (ISA) provides police with wide powers to stop and search per-
 sons and vehicles and to enter homes and other places for similar purposes without
 a warrant. There are no prohibitions against monitoring telephone conversations,
 and the security services are believed to monitor routinely telephone conversations
 of Basotho and foreigners on national security grounds. Following the opposition
 palace protest, police searched the homes of numerous opposition members for
 weapons.
 The residences of the Prime Minister and four other cabinet members were de-
 stroyed by arson on September 22, allegedly by opposition provocateurs.
 
 
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government generally respects these rights in practice.
 There are several independent newspapers-including one each controlled by the
 Roman Catholic and Lesotho Evangelical Churches, and two English-language
 weeklies-that routinely criticize the Government. The official state-owned or con-
 trolled media, consist of one radio station, a 1-hour daily newscast on a local tele-
 vision channel, and two weekly newspapers, which all faithfully reflect official posi-
 tions of the ruling party. There are no private radio or television stations.
 The 1997 case of four government ministers who filed a civil lawsuit against a
 newspaper editor, seeking compensation for alleged slander and defamation, was de-
 cided in favor of the editor. The editor of the newspaper believed that this lawsuit
 amounted to press harassment and was an effort to influence the editorial policy
 of a private news organ. The editor's publication displayed a clear bias in favor of
 the opposition during the August-September crisis. However, despite damage to a
 number of news publications caused by arson and looting after September 22, the
 opposition newspaper, Mo Africa, continued to publish and the Government took no
 steps to close or limit its circulation. The editor of Mo Africa received one of the
 few private radio licenses issued in the last quarter of the year. Mo Africa Radio
 planned to begin broadcasting in early 1999. Destruction caused by the crisis re-
 sulted in the temporary suspension of publication by five newspapers, the Southern
 Star, the Sun, Thebe, Mopme-the Survivor, and Mo Africa. By the end of the year,
 all these publications, except for Thebe, were back in operation.
 The National Press Association objected to rules established by the Independent
 Electoral Commission, which barred reporters from entering polling stations on elec-
 tion day. No other barriers to press coverage of the elections existed.
 The Government fully respects academic freedom. Although the Government owns
 and administers the country's only university, the academic staff represent the full
 political spectrum and are free to express their views.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Under a 1993 revision of the
 ISA, a public meeting, rally, or march no longer requires prior police permission,
 only advance notification. The police and local authorities generally respected these
 rights in practice. Political party meetings and rallies occur regularly throughout
 Lesotho.
 The Government authorized the August 4 opposition protest march against the
 election, which evolved into the months-long palace protest. The palace vigil became
 an unlawful assembly after the authorized time limit expired, but opposition pro-
 testers maintained the palace vigil until the end of October.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association, and the Government gen-
 erally respects this right in practice. In addition to the LCD, the Basotholand Con-
 gress Party (BCP), the Basotholand National Party (BNP), six smaller parties and
 independent candidates contested the May general election.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--Citizens generally are able to move freely within the country and across
 national boundaries. The Government places no obstacles in the way of citizens who
 wish to emigrate.
 In September numerous serious incidents and threats to the safety of citizens by
 opposition supporters who carried out assaults, caijackings, residential attacks, and
 sniper attacks led thousands of foreigners and ruling LCD supporters to flee the
 country to South Africa in the weeks immediately following the SADC military
 intervention.
 In 1994 the Government allowed about 25 refugees registered with the U.N. High
 Commissioner for Refugees to study in Lesotho. They were expected to return to
 their countries of first asylum after completing their studies. Other than these stu-
 dents, Lesotho has no resident refugee population.
 There were no cases in which the Government provided first asylum to refugees,
 nor did it force any person to return to a country were they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercised this right in the May 23 national elections.
 In the first multiparty democratic elections in 1993, after more than 20 years of
 undemocratic authoritarian and military rule, the BCP came to power with complete
 control of the National Assembly. Despite its landslide electoral victory, the BCP
 Government was forced to contend with a number of challenges to its power includ-
 ing a violent opposition destabilization campaign based on allegations that the BCP
 
 
 had won by fraud. These challenges culminated in August 1994 when King Letsie
 III unconstitutionally suspended the Parliament and installed a ruling council.
 Many Basotho responded by demonstrating their support for the democratically-
 elected BOP government. Organized labor and others held two national demonstra-
 tion-"stayaways"--to express support for the ousted government, and there were
 numerous rallies at the National University. As a result of both local and inter-
 national pressure, the King reversed himself, and the BCP regained control of the
 Government.
 The 1994 Memorandum of Understanding between King Letsie III and Prime
 Minister Dr. Ntsu Mokhehle-which was brokered by South Africa, Botswana, and
 Zimbabwe-called for reinstatement of the King's father, Moshoeshoe II, who had
 been deposed by the previous military government and exiled in 1990, and for steps
 to broaden the political process. In early 1995, Moshoeshoe II was reinstated as
 king. However, King Letsie III again was sworn in as King in January 1996, upon
 the death of his father. The 1994 suspension of the Constitution by Letsie, although
 short-lived, highlighted the fragility of rule within the constitutional monarchy. The
 formal coronation of King Letsie III was held on October 31, 1997.
 The August-September political/security crisis was similar to that of the 1993-94
 postelectoral period. Opposition party members alleged electoral fraud, suborned
 army supporters, sought to involve the King, and effectively overthrew the Govern-
 ment. However, the King did not take an active role in the opposition campaign as
 he did in. 1994, and the Prime Minister asked SADC countries to intervene mili-
 tarily, based on the 1994 Memorandum -of Understanding, to stabilize the situation.
 In the May 23 election, the LCD won 79 of 80 parliamentary seats. The BNP won
 the other seat. International observers concluded that the poll met international
 standards for a multiparty election and reflected the will of the voters. Despite the
 opposition coalition claims, the LANGA Commission reported no definitive findings
 of vote rigging or fraud. However, post-election management of electoral and polling
 station data was poor. Consequently, the Commission stated that the documentation
 was in such disarray that it could not prove that fraud had not occurred. This in-
 ability encouraged the opposition to charge that errors short of fraud could have af-
 fected the results.
 In October the LCD and the opposition alliance agreed to hold early elections
 within 2 years as a means of resolving the ongoing political crisis. Local elections,
 scheduled to be held late in the year, were postponed because of the crisis. In Octo-
 ber all political parties signed an agreement to create an Interim Political Authority
 (IPA) to govern in the period leading to elections in 2000. The IPA was sworn in
 in December and consists of two representatives from each party of the nine parties
 that contested the May general election.
 There are no legal impediments to women's participation in government or poli-
 tics, but women remained underrepresented. There are two women in the 80-mem-
 ber House of Assembly and seven women in the 33-member Senate. Women serve
 as the Minister of Youth Affairs and Environment and as Deputy Speaker of the
 Assembly.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government did not hinder the activities of various non-governmental human
 rights groups. These groups freely criticized the Government. The Government did
 not object to the AI investigation in October of human rights abuses.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, color, sex, language, reli-
 gion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, birth or other status, and
 the Government generally respected these prohibitions in practice. However, the
 Constitution also recognizes customary law as a parallel legal system, and women's
 inheritance and property rights are restricted severely under the traditional
 chieftainship system.
 Women.-Domestic violence, including wife beating, occurs frequently. Reliable
 statistics were not available, but the problem is believed to be widespread. In
 Basotho tradition, a wife may return to her "maiden home" if physically abused by
 her husband. Under common law, wife beating is a criminal offense and defined as
 assault. However, few domestic violence cases are brought to trial. A national con-
 ference on the empowerment of women held in March noted that of 100 cases of
 human rights abuses, 90 percent of the victims were women, e.g., victims of domes-
 tic violence, rape, and sexual harassment.
 
 
 229
 
 Both law and custom under the traditional chieftainship system severely limit the
 rights of women in such areas as property, inheritance, and contracts. Women have
 the legal and customary right to make a will and sue for divorce. However, under
 customary law, a married woman is considered a minor during the lifetime of her
 husband; she cannot enter into any legally binding contract, whether for employ-
 ment, commerce, or education, without her husband's consent. A woman married
 under customary law has no standing in court and may not sue or be sued without
 her husband's permission. Senior government officials have criticized publicly cus-
 tomary practice, which discriminates against women. In 1996 the Government stat-
 ed its commitment to implement the plan of action from the Fourth International
 Conference on Women, held in Beijing in September 1995. During the year, the Gov-
 ernment created a Ministry of Gender Affairs and debates began in Parliament on
 legal reforms in support of women's rights.
 Women's rights organizations, such as the local chapter of the International Fed-
 eration of Women Lawyers, have taken a leading role in educating women regarding
 their rights under customary and common law, highlighting the importance of
 women fully participating in the democratic process.
 Children.-The Government has not addressed adequately children's rights and
 welfare, although it has devoted substantial resources to primary and secondary
 education. Education is not compulsory even at the primary levels, and there are
 sig ificant instances, particularly in rural areas, where children do not attend
 school because they are involved in subsistence activities-in support of their family's
 welfare, or families cannot afford the costs associated with school attendance (for
 example, fees for purchase of uniforms, books, and materials). This problem of
 school nonattendance affects boys disproportionately more than girls. In traditional
 rural Basotho society, livestock herding by young boys is a rite of passage and a
 prerequisite to manhood in the community.
 There is no pattern of societal abuse against children, but many children work
 at a young age (see Section 6.d.). Familial stress, poverty, and divorce have led to
 a rise in the incidence of homelessness and child abandonment, creating a growing
 number of street children.
 People With Disabilities.-Discrimination against physically disabled persons in
 employment, education, or provision of other government services is unlawful. How-
 ever, societal discrimination against the disabled is common. The Government has
 not legislated or mandated accessibility to public buildings for the disabled.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Most citizens speak a common language and
 share common historical and cultural traditions. Small numbers of Asians (pri-
 marily ethnic Chinese and Indians) and South African whites are active in the coun-
 try's commercial life. Economic and racial tension between the Chinese business
 community, specifically textile and garment industry employers, and the Basotho re-
 mained a problem.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers have the legal right to join or form unions
 without prior government authorization, with the exception of civil servants.
 The Labor Code prohibits civil servants from joining unions. The Government re-
 gards all work by civil servants as essential. In a 1997 judgment by the High Court
 concerning a petition filed by the Lesotho Union of Public Servants (LUPE) against
 the registrar of law, the Chief Justice dismissed the LUPE's application to form a
 union on the grounds that it was not consistent with the Labor Code. The LUPE
 filed an appeal with the Appeals Court, but it had not been heard by year's end.
 Under the 1993 Labor Code, prepared with the assistance of the International
 Labor Organization (ILO), all trade union federations require government registra-
 tion. There are two small trade union federations, which rarely cooperate with each
 other: the Lesotho Trade Union Congress and the Lesotho Federation of Democratic
 Unions. Unions are not formally affiliated with or tied to political parties.
 The labor and trade union movement is very weak and fragmented. There are sev-
 eral small unions in the public and industrial sectors but there is no unified trade
 union congress. There are cases of multiple unions competitively organizing small
 numbers of workers in the same sector. Overall, unionized workers represent only
 about 10 percent of the work force. Consequently, efforts toward collective bargain-
 ing and tripartite policymaking are not amenable to strong trade union influences.
 There is credible evidence that some employers inhibit union representatives and
 organizers from gaining access to factory premises to organize workers or represent
 them in disputes with owners or managers.
 A large percentage of the male labor force works in the gold and coal mines of
 South Africa. The remainder are engaged primarily in traditional agriculture. A ma-
 jority of Basotho mine workers are members of the South African National Union
 
 
 of Mineworkers (NUM). However, as a foreign organization, the NUM is not per-
 mitted to engage in union activities in Lesotho.
 No legally authorized strike has occurred since independence in 1966. Civil serv-
 ants generally are not allowed to strike, and all public sector industrial actions are
 by definition unauthorized. In the private sector, the Labor Code requires an esca-
 lating series of procedures to be followed by workers and employers before strike
 action is authorized. Some small unions and their members have undertaken wild-
 cat strikes or spontaneous industrial actions without following the procedures for
 dispute resolution. Legal protection for strikers against retribution has not always
 been enforced in cases of illegal strikes. Employers dismissed several hundred tex-
 tile workers following wildcat strikes in 1994, and the Government maintained that
 it could not oblige their employers to reinstate them. However, the Government was
 successful in negotiating the reinstatement of employees following several illegal
 strikes in 1995 and 1996. Security forces violently suppressed some of the strikes
 in the textile, garment, and construction industries in 1994, 1996, and again in
 1998. In February police fired shotguns into a group of workers protesting at a tex-
 tile plant for better wages and conditions of work. Two workers were killed as a re-
 sult, and more than 20 were injured.,
 There were no instances of governmental restrictions on international affiliations
 or contacts by unions or their members.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-All legally recognized trade
 unions in principle enjoy" the right to organize and bargain collectively; however, in
 practice the authorities often restrict these rights. Employers often are not coopera-
 tive in this area. Employees often are threatened with expulsion and loss of employ-
 ment once they join unions. There is credible evidence to suggest that some employ-
 ers in the textile and garment sector engage in the use of blacklists to deny employ-
 ment to workers who have been fired by one employer within that sector. Although
 there was some collective bargaining activity between unions and employers to set
 wage and benefit rates, employers generally continued to set wage rates through
 unilateral action.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The 1987 Employment Act pro-
 hibits forced or compulsory labor including children, and there is no indication that
 such labor is practiced.,
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The legal
 minimum age for employment in commercial or industrial enterprises is 14. In prac-
 tice, however, children under age 14 often are employed in the textile and garment
 sector and in family-owned businesses. As much as 15 percent of the textile work
 force of some 15,000 may be children between the ages of 12 and 15, according to
 a 1994 study by a foreign government. The ILO was not able to confirm allegation
 of illegal child labor after visiting all 14 of Lesotho's garment producers in 1994 in
 response to a complaint by trade unions in the textile and clothing industry.
 There are prohibitions against the employment of minors in commercial, indus-
 trial, or non-family enterprises involving hazardous or dangerous working condi-
 tions, but enforcement is very lax. The Ministry of Labor and Employment's
 inspectorate is severely understaffed. Youths under 18 years of age may not be re-
 cruited for employment outside of the country. In traditional society, rigorous and
 occasionally dangerous working conditions for the country's young livestock
 herdboys are considered a prerequisite to manhood and a fundamental feature of
 Basotho culture beyond the reach of labor laws. The Government specifically pro-
 hibits forced and bonded labor by children, and there were no reports that it oc-
 curred (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The monthly minimum wage for unskilled
 labor is $68 (320 maloti); for a heavy vehicle operator it is $131 (616 maloti). Mini-
 mum wages in lower skilled jobs are insufficient to ensure a decent standard of liv-
 ing for a worker and family. Most wage earners supplement their income through
 subsistence agriculture or remittances from relatives employed in South Africa.
 Many employers pay more than minimum wages in an effort to attract and retain
 motivated employees. However, there also are indications that some employers, es-
 pecially in export sectors, treat the minimum wage as a maximum wage. This situa-
 tion is made possible by the high levels of unemployment and underemployment,
 which provide a large pool of surplus unskilled labor that bids down wage rates and
 threatens job security for workers who make demands for better wages and condi-
 tions of work.
 The Labor Code spells out basic worker rights, including a maximum 45-hour
 workweek, a weekly rest period of at least 24 hours, 12 days of paid leave per year,
 and paid public holidays. However, workers generally are unable to obtain an expe-
 ditious hearing in court on their complaints. There is a large backlog of industrial
 
 
 dispute cases on the docket of the Labor Court, which has only one labor judge who
 is now dealing with cases filed in 1995.
 The Labor Code requires employers to provide adequate light, ventilation, and
 sanitary facilities for employees and to install and maintain machinery in a manner
 designed to minimize the risk of injury. In practice employers generally follow these
 regulations only within the wage economy in urban areas, and the Ministry of Labor
 and Employment enforces the regulations haphazardly. The Labor Code does not ex-
 plicitly protect the right of workers to remove themselves from hazardous situations
 without prejudice to employment. However, Labor Code sections on safety in the
 workplace and dismissal imply that dismissal in such circumstances would be iMle-
 gal.
