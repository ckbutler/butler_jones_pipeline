 MALAYSIA
 Malaysia is a multiethnic society. Malays comprise a bare
 majority of the population, the remainder consisting of a
 substantial Chinese (about 33 percent), large Indian (about 10
 percent), and several smaller minorities. Since independence
 in 1957, Malaysia has had a parliamentary system of government
 based on free elections contested by several parties, almost
 all of which are racially based. The ruling National Front
 (composed of three major and several minor parties and
 dominated by ethnic Malays) has won a two-thirds or better
 majority in the federal Parliament in all seven general
 elections since 1957, but opposition parties are active and
 vocal participants in the political system and occasionally
 hold power at the state level. A strong free market economy,
 abundant natural resources, and a relatively small population
 have helped Malaysia become one of the most prosperous of the
 developing countries.
 Internal security in Malaysia has been seriously threatened
 twice. A major Communist insurrection began in 1948 and peaked
 in the early 1950's; it still smolders in a few border areas.
 In intercommunal rioting following the 1969 national elections,
 several hundred persons reportedly died. In addition, since
 1983 the Government has explicitly classified the country's
 serious drug problem as a threat to national security. The
 remnants of the Communist insurgency, the possibility of
 renewed communal conflict, and widespread drug abuse are cited
 by the Government as justification for laws allowing preventive
 detention of persons suspected of subversive activity or of
 other activities, including drug crimes. Other laws empower
 the Government to restrict the right to free expression and
 association. These laws, though seldom used, were strengthened
 by amendment in December 1987.
 !ntil.the end of 1987, Prime Minister Mahathir's administration
 had been relatively restrained in its use of Malaysia's
 internal security legislation to deal with political offenses.
 By mid-October, the number detained under the Internal Security
 Act (ISA) had been sharply reduced to at most 27, and possibly
 somewhat lower, from about 500 when Mahathir took office in
 1981. However, in late October and early November, in an
 effort it said was necessary to avoid serious racial strife,
 the Government detained 106 persons under the ISA, closed 3
 newspapers, and banned all public assemblies. By early
 January 1988, the Government had freed 65 of these detainees,
 issued 2-year detention orders for 33, and had yet to clarify
 the status of the remaining 8.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings by the Government
 or by any other organization.
 b. Disappearance
 There was no evidence of abduction, secret arrests, or
 clandestine detention attributable to the Government or to
 nongovernmental or opposition forces.

 MALAYSIA
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There was no evidence of torture.' Allegations of cruel,
 inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment are rare.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 The Government can detain suspects without benefit of judicial
 review under three laws: the 1960 Internal Security Act (ISA),
 the Emergency Ordinance of 1969, and the Dangerous Drugs Act
 of 1985.
 The 1960 Internal Security Act (ISA), spawned by the Communist
 insurgency of the 1950's, is aimed at controlling internal
 subversion. The ISA empowers the police on their own
 authority to hold suspects for up to 60 days; further
 detention (in renewable 2-year segments) must be authorized by
 the Minister of Home Affairs. The Minister must inform
 detainees of the charges against them and give them the
 opportunity to protest those charges to an advisory board.
 The advisory board must also review each case at least every 6
 months. However, neither advisory board decisions nor
 recommendations are binding on the Government. In late June,
 the Ministry of Home Affairs told the Bar Council that the
 number of ISA detainees stood at 27. As of mid-October, the
 number may have fallen further to about 20, according
 to an informed human rights source. However, in late October
 and early November, Malaysian authorities, citing the need to
 act to avoid serious racial strife, arrested 106 persons under
 the ISA. Among those detained were opposition and government
 politicians, social critics, environmentalists, religious
 activists, and academics. By early January 1988, the
 Government had released unconditionally 55 of the detainees,
 freed 10 with restrictions, issued 2-year detention orders for
 33, and had yet to clarify the status of the remaining 8. In
 addition, in early May, four persons were detained under the
 ISA for suspected involvement in a series of bombings in
 Sarawak. In early October, three more were arrested under the
 ISA: two for "spreading false information" about Muslims
 converting to Christianity, and one for his connections to the
 pro-Iranian Al-Quds Liberation Movement.
 The Emergency Ordinance of 1969 stemmed from that year's
 communal riots. The state of emergency proclaimed then has
 never been rescinded, although Parliament regained its
 legislative power, suspended as part of the emergency, in
 1971. The Emergency Ordinance gives the Government the power
 to detain anyone "in the interests of the public safety or the
 defense of Malaysia." As under the ISA, detainees must be
 informed of the charges against them, and they can appeal to
 an advisory board. In contrast to the ISA, however, the
 Emergency Ordinance allows the Government to detain suspects
 for a maximum of 2 years, although upon release it can put
 them under "restricted residence" for an additional 2-year
 period. The Government has relied on the Emergency Ordinance
 to detain suspected major narcotics traffickers when it has
 insufficient evidence to prosecute them under drug laws.
 During the 2 years prior to September 1987, the Government
 detained under the Emergency Ordinance about 340 drug
 suspects, an unknown number of whose cases have subsequently
 been considered under the provisions of the Dangerous Drugs
 Act described below.
 
 
 753
 MALAYSIA
 The Dangerous Drugs (special preventive measures) Act of 1985,
 adopted after extensive public hearings by a parliamentary
 select committee, gives the Government a specific law under
 which suspected drug traffickers can be detained. It
 strengthens the Government's hand in that suspects can be held
 for successive 2-year periods. However, certain due process
 safeguards not found in the Emergency Ordinance were
 incorporated in the antidrug law. An "inquiry officer" must
 both receive a copy of the police report to the Minister of
 Home Affairs which recommends detention and also submit his
 views to the Minister. Also, the opinion of the advisory
 board, following either its initial hearing or its periodic
 reviews of each case, is binding on the Minister. Finally,
 the act expires after 5 years unless reaffirmed by Parliament.
 It is believed that about 450 suspects were in detention under
 this statute in September 1987 (as noted above, this figure
 may include some persons who were originally detained under
 the 1969 Emergency Ordinance).
 Malaysia is a party to the International Labor Organization
 (ILO) Convention 105 prohibiting forced or compulsory labor.
 Malaysia has effective legal sanctions against such abuses,
 although the ILO has in the past criticized Malaysia for
 requiring prisoners and ISA detainees to work. Malaysia
 defends the practice as part of its prisoner rehabilitation
 program.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Malaysian judiciary is generally regarded by the public
 and the legal community as committed to the rule of law.
 Although the courtt have rarely challenged legislation, they
 have not hesitated to rule against government prosecutors in
 specific cases, both civil and criminal.
 Ordinary (nonsecurity-related) civil and criminal cases are
 tried under a fair and open judicial system derived from
 .British jurisprudence. Charges must be levied against a
 defendant within 24 hours of arrest, and police must decide
 within 14 days whether to bring the case to court. Defendants
 have the right to counsel, and lawyers are able to represent
 clients without penalty to themselves. Bail is available, and
 strict rules of evidence apply in court. Defendants may
 appeal lower court decisions to the federal courts and, in
 criminal cases, may also appeal for clemency to the King or
 local state rulers, as appropriate.
 Persons detained under security legislation and for certain
 classes of crimes, if their cases are brought to trial, are
 tried under special procedures contained in the Essential
 (security cases) Regulations of 1975. The accused is allowed
 counsel but does not receive a statement of the evidence;
 trial is by a single judge without a jury; witnesses may be
 examined in the absence of the accused. Admissible evidence
 includes hearsay and secondary evidence, testimony of children
 and spouses, self-incriminating statements to police, and
 information from seized records or communications. If the
 accused is found guilty, the judge must impose the maximum
 penalty. For certain internal security crimes, including the
 possession of firearms, the mandatory sentence is death. In
 1987 at least four persons were executed after conviction
 under the ISA for illegal possession of firearms.

 MALAYSIA
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Under the ISA, the police may enter and search without warrant
 the homes of persons suspected of threatening national security
 and confiscate evidence from them.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for free speech, and in practice
 there are very few constraints on freedom of expression in
 conversations or private communications. However, the
 Constitution also provides that these rights may be restricted
 by legislation "in the interests of security... (or) public
 order." Thus, the Sedition Act of 1948, strengthened by
 amendment in 1970, prohibits public comment on constitutionally
 protected but "sensitive" issues such as citizenship rights for
 non-Malays and the special position of Malays in society.
 Since 1970 the Government has brought only a few cases under
 the Sedition Act, and in the most recent instance in 1986, the
 defendant, the-president of the Bar Council, was acquitted.
 Freedom of the press is assured, and a wide range of fact and
 opinion has been available in newspapers published in four
 languages: Bahasa, English, Chinese, and Tamil. However, this
 freedom has been subject to important limitations. The
 Government or the business arms of the leading political
 parties in the ruling coalition own almost all the major
 newspapers, as well as all of the radio and television
 stations. Furthermore, by virtue of the Printing Presses and
 Publications Act of 1984 (which strengthened similar provisions
 in the 1948 Printing Presses Act), all domestic and foreign
 publications must apply annually to the Government for a
 permit. In 1986 the Government under this act banned the
 Asian Wall Street Journal for 3 months, but rescinded its
 order after the Supreme Court ruled that the Government must
 "show cause" for its actions.  in September 1987, the courts
 again intervened by directing the Home Ministry to review its
 decision to refuse a permit for the public interest group
 Aliran to publish a magazine in Bahasa Malaysia (Malay). The
 ministry has not yet announced the results of its review.
 (Aliran, which is often critical of the Government, already
 publishes a magazine primarily in English which includes
 articles in Bahasa.) Despite these favorable court rulings,
 the media exercise considerable self-censorship.
 The detentions under the ISA in the fall and their aftermath
 have further restricted freedom of the press. On October 28,
 the Government, using powers granted it by the 1984 Printing
 Presses and Publications Act, revoked the publication permits
 of three newspapers: the Star (English), the Sin Chew Yit Pao
 (Chinese), and the Watan (Bahasa). Moreover, in December
 Parliament passed amendments to the 1984 Act which further
 tightened government control of the press. Publishing
 "malicious" news, with malice "presumed in default of evidence
 showimg that-the accused took reasonable measures to verify
 the truth of the news-," is.now a punishable offense. The
 Minister of Home Affairs may-now ban any domestic or foreign
 publication on the ;rounds that it contains material "which is
 likely to alarm public opinion.' The amendments also
 explicitly prohibit court -challenges to the Minister's
 decision to-suspend or revoke publication permits. The impact
 of these actions on the climate of press freedom is likely to
 
 
 MALAYSIA
 be substantial for some time to come, although it remains to
 be seen how the Government will actually use the enhanced
 power granted it by the amended legislation.
 Amendments to the Official Secrets Act (OSA) in early 1987
 greatly broadened the definition of an "official secret" to
 include cabinet and cabinet committee documents, state
 executive council documents and those of its committees, and
 documents concerning national security, defense, and
 international relations. Although public protest reduced
 somewhat the scope of the amendments, human rights advocates
 complain that the act still prohibits access to much
 information not linked to national security. The Government
 has prosecuted (successfully) one case under the OSA in each
 of the past 3 years, two against newsmen and one against a
 lawyer.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for the rights of freedom of
 peaceful assembly and association, though again the
 Constitution also permits limitation of those rights by
 legislation in the interest of security and public order.
 Thus the 1967 Police Act requires police permits for large
 public assemblies. In practice, until October 1987, few such
 gatherings, even for specifically political purposes, were
 prohibited. In October the Government banned all public
 assemblies. Furthermore, amendments to the Police Act, passed
 in December 1987, stiffen or establish penalties for
 organizers, attendees, and even onlookers of unauthorized
 assemblies. Other statutes which limit the right of
 association include the controversial Societies Act under
 which the Government can refuse registration to organizations
 which comment unfavorably on political or public issues. The
 threat of deregistration under this act tends to inhibit
 lobbying by public or special interest organizations, but does
 not suppress such activity entirely. Also, under the
 Universities and University Colleges Act, student associations
 must be approved by the Ministry of Education and are
 prohibited from engaging in political activity.
 The Trade Unions Act, 1959, and the Industrial Relations Act,
 1967, govern the rights of workers to engage in trade union
 activity. The latter specifically prohibits any person from
 interfering with, restraining, or coercing a worker in the
 exercise of the right to form or participate in the lawful
 activities of a trade union. Unions may bargain collectively
 with an employer, form federations, and join international
 labor organizations. The law gives the registrar of trade
 unions considerable power over the recognition of unions and
 the approval of their constitutions. In addition, an
 individual union is restricted by law to representing workers
 in a "particular trade, occupation, or industry or within any
 similar trades, occupations, or industries." Union leaders
 claim that the registrar has used this provision and his power
 to determine the definition of a related industry to restrict
 the activities of certain unions. Federations of trade unions
 similarly may cover only a single trade or industry. As a
 result, only a federation for public servants and one for
 teachers have been registered. The Malaysian Trades Union
 Congress (MTUC), the main labor body in the country, is
 registered under the Societies Act. MTUC leaders have in the
 past requested, unsuccessfully, registration as a federation
 under the Trade Unions Act.
 
 
 756
 MALAYSIA
 Labor standards in free trade zones are the same as those in
 the rest of Malaysia, but union leaders and some workers have
 been dissatisified with their inability to obtain recognition
 for a union in the foreign-owned electronic components industry
 based in the free trade zones. (Conditions of employment and
 wages in electronic components manufacturing plants are among
 the best in Malaysia's manufacturing sector.) When the plants
 were first established in the early 1970's, an attempt was made
 by the Electrical Industry Workers' Union (EIWU) to organize
 the workers. The registrar determined that the EIWU could not
 organize workers in electronic components factories because
 they were not part of the electrical product manufacturing
 industry. The MTUC attempted in the early 1980's to organize
 electrQnic components workers, but the high court determined
 in 1985 that the MTUC did not have standing in this matter as
 it does not represent electronics workers and is not a trade
 union. It is widely believed that the Government, as an
 inducement to electronics component manufacturers in the free
 trade zones, has promised such firms varying periods of union-
 free operation. In addition, enterprises granted "pioneer"
 status are protected against union demands for terms of
 employment more favorable than those specified in the
 Employment Ordinance of 1955 during the period of their
 pioneer status (normally 5 years).
 Labor legislation grants Malaysian workers the right to strike,
 but union leaders complain that the 1980 amendments to the
 Trade Union Act of 1959 and the Industrial Relations Act of
 1967 interfere with their right to strike and to bargain
 collectively without fear of coercion. In a complaint to the
 ILO, the MTUC alleged that the 1.980 amendments contain
 prohibitive and oppressive antiunion provisions which erode
 the basic rights of workers, restrict union activities, and
 result.in government and employer interference in the internal
 administration of unions. In 1983 the ILO urged the Malaysian
 Government to amend these laws further to bring them into
 conformity with the ILO Convention on the right to organize
 and to bargain collectively. Many union leaders also believe
 that creation of the industrial court to handle industrial
 disputes weakened their collective bargaining rights. The
 Industrial Relations Act of 1967 requires the parties to
 notify the Ministry of Labor that a dispute exists before any
 industrial action may be taken. The Minister then has the
 power to refer the dispute to the industrial court, which
 effectively becomes compulsory arbitration. Industrial action
 is prohibited while the dispute is before the industrial court
 and no action may be taken in respect of an award made by the
 industrial court. In 1985 the MTUC and the Malaysian Employers
 Federation initiated a joint seminar on Malaysia's labor laws
 in which Ministry of Labor personnel participated. Both the
 MTUC and the MEF have suggested changes in legislation to
 expand the right to organize and bargain collectively. The
 only change so far taken up by the Government is a proposal to
 clarify the status of house unions by amending the Trades Union
 Act of 1959. The MTUC opposes this change.
 As of December 1986, there were 401 individual unions in
 Malaysia with just over 600,000 members (11 percent of total
 employment). Several unions have recently lost members as a
 result of the replacement of union-organized plantation
 workers with unorganized contract labor and of the 1985-86
 recession, which particularly affected the most organized
 sectors of the economy. Unions are not permitted to engage in
 political activity, but individual trade union leaders have
 served in parliament, and individual union members may belong
 
 
 757
 MALAYSIA
 to political parties. Malaysian trade unions are free to
 associate with the appropriate international trade
 Secretariats, and a number of Malaysian labor leaders play
 major roles in international labor affairs. The Secretary
 General of the National Union of Plantation Workers, P.P.
 Narayanan, is President of the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The official religion of Malaysia is Islam, and Malays are
 legally bound in some civil matters, e.g., family relations
 and diet, by Islamic religious laws administered by state
 rather than by federal authorities. An Islamic religious
 establishment is supported by government funds, and it is
 government policy to "infuse Islamic values" into the
 administration of Malaysia. However, the Constitution
 guarantees freedom of religion, and the Government has refused
 to accede to demands for the imposition of Islamic religious
 law beyond the Muslim community. Religious minorities, which
 include large Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, and Christian communities,
 practice their faith with minimal interference by the
 Government. There are persistent allegations, however, that
 some state governments have been slow in approving building
 permits for non-Muslim places of worship. Also, the Government
 has limited the circulation of a popular translation of the
 Bible in Bahasa. Conversion to religions other than Islam is
 permitted but not encouraged; proselytizing of Muslims is
 strongly discouraged.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Persons wishing to travel abroad must obtain passports, which
 have been denied in a few cases on what the Government terms
 security grounds. Travel to Cuba, Israel, North Korea, South
 Africa, and Vietnam is prohibited. Travel to the Soviet Union
 and several Eastern Bloc countries is restricted, although in
 1985 controls on travel to some East European countries were
 reduced. Traditionally tight controls on travel by Malaysian
 Chinese to China also -were relaxed somewhat in 1985. They may
 visit China for medical treatment, to tour or see relatives
 (if over age 55), and for business trips when they can satisfy
 the Government that such commerce will be of "net benefit" to
 Malaysia.
 Malaysia has provided first asylum to more than'200,000
 Vietnamese refugees since 1975.- It has cooperated closely
 with international organizations and resettlement countries in
 facilitating the eventual movement of the refugees to those
 countries. Malaysia itself has resettled over 8,000 Khmer
 Muslim refugees, but has not accepted non-Muslim refugees for
 permanent settlement. At least 40,000 Philippine Muslims have
 settled in Sabah since 1975, although they have not been
 offered citizenship.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Malaysia's parliamentary system is based on the British model.
 The prime minister and cabinet are responsible to Parliament,
 from which they are drawn. Elections must be held at least
 once every 5 years. The opposition concedes that elections to
 date have been free and fair; votes'are cast secretly and
 recorded accurately. Through the United Malays National
 
 
 758
 MALAYSIA
 Organization, Malays dominate the ruling National Front
 coalition of ethnic-based.parties which has controlled
 Parliament-since-independence. Malays fill most important
 cabinet posts. -The Wational Front  parties benefit
 substantially from gerrymandered electoral districts. In
 August 1986, the National Front won 148 of the 177 seats in
 the House of Representatives. Although the opposition
 regularly criticizes the Government within and outside
 .Parliament, it seldom succeeds in influencing policies or
 legislation.
 In late October and early November, in a move it said was
 necessary to-avoid. the outbreak-of racial violence, the
 Government detained 106 people, including 11 Members of
 Parliament under the ISA.  Of the Members of Parliament
 detained, 10 were from the main parliamentary opposition
 party, including-the opposition leader, and one was from the
 leading  government party, iUMNO. In addition to Members of
 Parliament, other politicians from within the government
 coalitidn0-nd in the. opposition were also detained.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental investigation of*Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government'ostrongly resents criticism of its human rights
 record.- In March 1986,-ex-Foreign Minister Rithauddeen told
 Parliament that there was a "conspiracy" by Amnesty
 International to make Malaysia a target for pressure on human
 rights matters. He rejected any such criticism, maintaining
 it was the duty of elL citizens to "counter efforts by
 outsiders to tarnish the country's image." He also struck out
 at local groups he claimed-were "coll-aborating" with Amnesty
 International-ih its attention to Malaysia. Nevertheless, the
 Attorney Genereri did meet with six representatives of
 international, human rights organizations, including Amnesty
 International..
 While there are no-organizatiohs in Malaysia which deal
 specifically with the protection of human rights, a number of
 organizations, including the bar council and various public
 interest groups, devote some time to the subject.. The
 Government tolerates their activities but rarely responds to
 their inquiries-or occasional press statements. The Government
 has not joined any of the international covenants on human
 rights, generally maintaining that such issues are internal
 matters. However, Malaysia has supported U.N. resolutions
 condemning the Government of Afghanistan for human rights
 abuses,- and the Prime Minister in particular has been very
 outspoken in criticism of South Africa for its apartheid
 policy.   ""
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Government implements on an extensive scale programs
 designed to boost the economic position of the ethnic Malay
 majority which remains poorer, on average, than other
 Malaysians despite its political dominance. These government
 programs and policies limit, in varying degrees, non-Malay
 opportunities for higher education, government employment, and
 ownership of new homesteads.
 
 
 759
 MALAYSIA
 There are no restrictions on the political rights of Malaysian
 women. Government policy supports their full and equal
 participation in government, education, and the work force.
 The position of women in society is conditioned by the cultural
 and religious traditions of the country's-major ethnic groups.
 With a general resurgence of Islamic piety among Malays, Malay
 women have in recent years tended toward close conformity with
 Koranic stipulations on women's roles. However, the active
 role which women play in public life was underscored by the
 appointment this year of a woman to head the important
 Ministry of Trade and Industry.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Various government regulations, particularly the Employment
 Act of 1955 ensure that workers enjoy acceptable conditions of
 work. Work hours are not to exceed 8 hours per day or 48
 hours per week, and-the act mandates public holidays, annual
 leave, sick leave, and maternity allowances for workers.
 Factories maintain minimum standards of industrial safety and
 insurance plans. Employers must provide severance pay and
 contribute to the Employees Provident Fund (EPF), which
 provides retirement benefits, and to the Social Security
 Organization (SOCSO), which provides disability and workman's
 compensation benefits. Some 90 percent of workers are covered
 by either the EPF or the Government's own pension plan for
 public servants. There is no minimum wage except in a few
 minor occupations. In addition, many nonmanual employees paid
 over $380 per month are not covered by the Employment Act.
 Plantation work is increasingly being done by contract
 workers, many of whom may be illegal immigrants from
 Indonesia. Working conditions for contract workers are
 significantly below those of direct hire plantation workers,
 many of whom belong to the National Union of Plantation
 Workers. Additionally, many of the immigrant workers,
 particularly the illegal ones, may not have access to
 Malaysia's judicial labor system.
 Employment of children is covered by the Children and Young
 Persons (Employment) Act of 1966, which stipulates that no
 child under age 14 may be engaged in any employment-except
 light work in a family enterprise, in public entertainment,
 work performed by the Government in a school or training
 institution, or employment as an approved apprentice. It is
 illegal for children to work more than 6 hours per day, more
 than 6 days per week, or at night.
