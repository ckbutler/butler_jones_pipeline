 BURUNDI
 Ethnic violence between Tutsi (14 percent of the population) and Hutu (85 per-
 cent) erupted on October 21, when a coup attempt by elements of the Tutsi-domi-
 nated military disrupted the effort, begun by former President Major Pierre Buyoya,
 to move to an open multiparty political system. In the failed coup attempt, soldiers
 killed the first democratically elected President, Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu, who
 had defeated Buyoya in presidential elections on June 1. The assassination of Presi-
 dent Ndadaye initiated a vicious cycle of ethnic killings and led to a massive outflow
 of refugees.
 At year's end, the number of Burundi refugees (mainly Hutu) outside the country
 was estimated at nearly 600,000, and the number of displaced within the country
 was estimated at over 500,000. The refugees faced life-threatening conditions in
 countries of asylum, notably in Rwanda, where the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported extremely high death rates due to disease
 and malnutrition.
 Burundi authorities, religious institutions, and humanitarian assistance organiza-
 tions agree it is too soon to make credible estimates of the numbers killed during
 the ethnic violence. Mortality figures will remain uncertain until enough witnesses
 return to establish the fate of others and until the countryside is sufficiently sta-
 bilized to permit investigation of suspected burial sites.
 Government operations were slowly recovering at year's end. The Prime Minister
 and most of the ministers had resumed work in their offices, and many made as-
 sessment trips and public appearances in the interior. Several ministers, particu-
 larly those who had received specific death threats, returned at night to the guarded
 protection of a secluded hotel.
 In contrast, at the beginning of the year the outlook for political reform had
 looked promising. Following adoption of a new Constitution in 1992, President
 Buyoya took a series of steps to ensure free and fair presidential and parliamentary
 elections. These measures included developing a new Electoral Code and inviting
 more than 600 international and domestic election observers, who subsequently cer-
 tified the validity of the outcomes. In the presidential and legislative campaigns,
 
 
 Buyoya was su pported byhis party, the former sole ruling party, the National Party
 for Unity and Progress ( PRONA and Ndadaye by his party the Front for Democ-
 racy in Burundi (FRODEBU), with smaller parties generaily allying themselves
 with UPRONA or FRODEBU based on their ethnic ties. President Ndadaye was
 sworn into office in an exemplary change of power on July 10; and the National As-
 sembly was sworn in shortly thereafter and held its initial session on July 19. Presi-
 dent Ndadaye appointed 9 Tutsis to his 23-member Cabinet.
 In his 100 days in office, Ndadaye cautiously began discussing reform of the
 18,000 member Tutsi-dominated security forces, consisting of the military (army and
 gendarmerie), the police, and the Surete; to increase Hutu representation in many
 other institutions, including the judiciary and the civil service; and to encourage the
 return of thousands of Hutu refugees. A weak coup attempt on July 3, shortly be fore
 Ndadaye's inauguration, quickly dissolved after failing to gather support among the
 military. However, on October 21, soldiers from the Tutsi-dominated military
 stormed the presidential palace and attempted to seize power. President Ndadaye
 was taken prisoner and brutally slain. The President and Vice President of the Na-
 tional Assembly, the Minister of Territorial Administration, and the head of the
 Center for Documentation (Intelligence) were also killed in the coup attempt, along
 with the wife of the Foreign Minister and a family friend. Some government min-
 isters initially accused the Army Chief of Staff, Lieutenant Colonel Jean Bikomagu,
 of backing the coup attempt, but he denied involvement, as did other senior officers.
 In an October 31 press conference, the Prime Minister gave Bikomagu a qualified
 vote of confidence.
 The U.N. Security Council issued a Presidential statement condemning the coup
 attempt and the murder of President Ndadaye and other officials and stressed the
 importance of bringing those responsible to justice. The Government and the mili-
 tary arrested several accused plotters, but others were still at large at year's end.
 A national commission of inquiry was named but had not yet begun its work. The
 Government requested the establishment of an international commission of inquiry,
 a proposal broadly supported by beth Hutus and Tutsis.
 At year's end, relations between the military and the Government remained tenu-
 ous. The Government remained cautious toward the military, though dialog was im-
 proving slowly. Most units remained in their barracks, but there were still occa-
 sional reports of violence by some military elements.
 Landlocked Burundi is extremely poor and densely populated. Over four-fifths of
 the working population is engaged in subsistence agriculture, working small pri-
 vately owned plots. The small monetary economy is based largely on the exports of
 coffee and tea, with few other cash crops. The October coup attempt and ethnic kill-
 ing that followed caused massive dislocations which severely disrupted both the
 monetary and subsistence economies.
 Despite the progress on political reform made through October, members of both
 Tutsi and Hutu ethnic groups committed serious human rights abuses during and
 following the coup attempt. Elements of the Tutsi-dominated military initiated the
 attempted coup and murdered President Ndadaye and others, unleashing unre-
 strained ethnic violence. Both Tutsi and Hutu engaged in massive revenge killings
 of civilians. Rogue elements of the military continued to operate in some parts of
 the country at year's end. For example, in November civilians, reportedly aided by
 soldiers, killed the governor of Bubanza. Prior to that, some uncontrolled military
 elements had engaged in killingin the northern and central provinces of Gitega,
 Muramvya, Karuzi,Ruyigi and   irundo.
 There were human rights abuses committed prior to the changeover in Govern-
 ment, many relating to the aftermath of the ethnic violence in November 1991. For
 example, there were vigilante-style killings resulting in the deaths of eight persons
 in March. The details of interethnic killings remained unclear but reportedly re-
 sulted from rivalry between FRODEBU and UPRONA followers in the province of
 Bubanza during the heated political campaign. Hutu residents took the law into
 their own hands when local officials refused to pursue suspects who had staged har-
 assment raids on their homes. There were also examples of unfair trials, mainly in-
 volving Hutu defendants, stemming from the 1991 violence. Women continued to ex-
 perience extensive societal and legal discrimination, and, with their children, suf-
 fered many of the casualties in the latest violence.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-The Governments of President
 Buyoya and President Ndadaye did not engage in political or other extrajudicial
 killings. However, the attempted coup against the democratically elected Govern-
 
 
 ment and assassination of President Ndadaye triggered interethnic violence and
 killing on a broad scale throughout the country (see Section 1.g.). By the end of the
 year, the Government and the military had arrested about nine military enlisted
 men and officers implicated in the coup plot of October 21. Several others were be-
 lieved at large in Burundi and abroad. Investigations into the coup attempt by the
 Government and the military were continuing at year's end.
 There were early warning signs of extrajudicial killings. For example, in March
 a political party official reported that, following unexplained nighttime raids on
 Hutu houses, local Hutu residents in Bubanza province killed two unidentified per-
 sons who had allegedly harassed residents. Apparently, the vigilante-style killings
 took place after a local administrator refused to take the persons into custody, tell-
 ing the crowd to turn them over to the gendarmes. Subsequently, local Hutu resi-
 dents killed six additional persons in the southern portion of Bubanza. The reported
 refusal to act by the local administrator contributed to heated rhetoric by both
 UPRONA and FRODEBU. The specifics of these allegedly politically motivated
 killings had not been determined by the time of the October military coup attempt.
 b. Disappearance.-There were hundreds of persons reported missing in the vio-
 lence and dislocations, but the continued instability prevailing at year's end pre-
 cluded any formal tracing or accounting of the missing or dead.
 Significant numbers of Hutus disappeared before, during, and after the November
 1991 violence. Some may have been (as the Government claimed) among the 40,000
 Burundians who fled from the country to Rwanda or Zaire as a result of the vio-
 lence. There were, however, documented cases in which persons disappeared after
 having been seen being detained by, or in the custody of, the security forces and
 in which there was no available record of their detention or release. While the Gov-
 ernment had announced that it intended to establish a commission of inquiry to de-
 termine the causes of the violence and deaths resulting from the events of Novem-
 ber 1991, no commission was formed, and no reports were issued prior to the advent
 of the Ndadaye administration.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 These practices are expressly forbidden under the 1992 Constitution. During the Oc-
 tober violence, civilians of opposing ethnic groups committed the most vi"ious exam-
 ples of cruel and inhuman treatment. Both Hutu and Tutsi civilians, qrmed with
 pangas, machetes, and spears, customarily hacked victims to death and reportedly
 tied up and forced some victims to witness the murders of their own spouses and
 children before killing the bound victims. In some cases, the attackers killed only
 the men, but severely wounded or dismembered women and children with spears
 or machetes. Military personnel were seen beating civilians on the street in
 Bujumbura shortly after the coup attempt.
 Prison conditions were life threatening and characterized by severe overcrowding
 and inadequate hygiene, clothing, medical care, food, and water. Four or even five
 persons were forced to share a poorly ventilated cell 2 meters square. Prisoners had
 to rely on family members to ensure an adequate diet, and officials acknowledged
 that digestive illness was a major problem in the prisons. Women were held sepa-
 rately from men. By mid-October, most of those eligible under President Ndadaye's
 amnesty law had been released.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Regular police and gendarmes with ar-
 rest authority are permitted to make arrests without a warrant but are legally obli-
 gated to submit a written report to a magistrate within 48 hours of the detention.
 The magistrate can order the suspect released or confirm the charges and continued
 detention, initially for 15 days and then subsequently for periods of 30 days as nec-
 essary to prepare the case for trial. The law allows unlimited pretrial detention. The
 Surete is obligated to follow the same laws but is known to have detained some per-
 sons for a number of months without having their cases certified and forwarded to
 the Ministry of Justice as required.
 Daily police operations were severely disrupted during the coup attempt (as were
 most government operations). In normal circumstances, legal procedures are gen-
 erally followed in criminal cases, though time limits prescribed by law are often ex-
 ceeded. Proceedings are constrained by the lack of a well-trained and adequately
 supported judiciary. At the beginning of the year, the Government arrested between
 40 and 60 political activists, principally from the predominately Hutu parties, ap-
 parently without ever charging them. Government officials subsequently said the
 charges ranged from stealing a national flag to being implicated in activities in sup-
 port of the Iutu-insurgency group PAIIPEHUTU (Party for the Liberation of the
 Hutu People). These arrests were considered by political parties to have been politi-
 cally motivated actions to impugn the stature and to weaken FRODEBU in the eyes
 of voters.
 
 
 27
 Political exile is forbidden in the new Constitution, and the Ndadaye Government
 did not use forced exile as a means of political control. Former President Bagaza
 and his wife returned to Burundi from exile on July 28 after 6 years in Uganda and
 Libya. According to Ndadaye administration officials, no negotiations were held or
 conditions set for Bagaza's return.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The legal system, like much of the Government
 administration, was severely disrupted as a result of the coup attempt. When oper-
 ating normally, it is divided into civil and criminal courts, with the Supreme Court
 at the apex. Military courts have jurisdiction over crimes committed by members of
 the military or those involving actions against the military. The new Constitution
 provides for a High Court to try the President, Prime Minister, or the President of
 the National Assembly in the event of high-level crime while in office. It also estab-
 lished the Constitutional Court to review all new laws (including decree-laws) and
 topreside over other constitutional issues.
 Trials in civilian and military courts are technically public, though the public has
 traditionally not had regular access to information about cases (inclu ing court
 dates). The law and the Constitution provide for accused persons (whether tried in
 a civilian or military court) the right to a defense. In practice, only a small percent-
 age of defendants are able to afford legal representation, and consequently most de-
 fendants are not represented by counsel.
 Under the Constitution, the judicial system is independent, but in practice, it is
 dominated by the Tutsi ethnic group. The President has the authority to appoint
 judges as well as the power to pardon or reduce sentences. Most Burundians assume
 the courts still promote the interests of the dominant Tutsi minority. Generally, de-
 fendants are Hutu, while the judges and magistrates are, almost without exception
 Tutsis.
 Other major shortcomings in the legal system were the frequent lack of defense
 counsel for the accused; the lack of adequate resources to allow the system to func-
 tion effectively; the need for better training of judicial and enforcement officials; and
 the need for revisions in the Legal Code to bring it into conformity with the new
 Constitution and international standards. For example, confessions made during
 torture were accepted as evidence in 1992 trials.
 There were two trials involving 133 Hutus arrested in Ngozi province and accused
 of crimes in the November 1991 violence. In one of the trials, the Government pros-
 ecuted 57 persons; the assigned defense counsel (Tutsi) failed to defend even mini-
 mally his Hutu clients, and the court handed down stiff sentences, including 5 life
 sentences, and 22 sentences of at least 15 years.
 Upon President Ndadaye's assumption of office, two former ministers and several
 former government officials from the former Bagaza regime were released from pris-
 on provisionally in July. The Government also released in July, on a "temporary"
 arrangement, former Foreign Minister Cyprien Mbonimpa, who was on trial before
 the Supreme Court. In July the Government also released and dropped charges in
 the case of 50 military enlisted soldiers out of the original 150 military enlisted men
 allegedly implicated in the March 1992 coup attempt.
 President Ndadaye pledged in his inaugural address to submit draft amnesty leg-
 islation, and the National Assembly passed an amnesty law on September 19. The
 law provided amnesty for all crimes committed before July 1, 1993, with the excep-
 tion of arson, cannibalism, murder, poisoning, drug trafficking, and group or armed
 robbery. About 5,000 persons were reportedly affected or obtained release from pris-
 on as a result of the amnesty. With the amnesty law, all political detainees and
 prisoners had been released.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 right to privacy is provided for in the Constitution, and the law requiring search
 warrants was generally respected by the authorities. However, persons suspected of
 antigovernment activities, which in the past has been broadly interpreted b: the
 Government and the courts, have been subject to surveillance by security forces.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Since the assassination of President Ndadaye, there were massive human
 rights violations by all sides. Elements of the Tutsi-dominated military attempted
 the coup and killed the President and several other officials. After that, members
 of both ethnic groups killed, maimed, and burned members of the opposite group.
 For example, over 25 Tutsi civilians were herded into a gas station in Kabimba and
 burned alive. In Ruyigi, several Hutu civilians were arrested for violence and then
 handed over to a Tutsi crowd, which attacked and beat them to death. About 20
 other arrestees were shot by the military. In Gitega province, the military report-
 edly fired on civilians from helicopters. In the ethnic upheaval, attackers burned
 homes and crops, slaughtered livestock, and vandalized schools, churches, and pri-
 vate homes.
 
 
 28
 Belgian physicians with Doctors Without Borders were among the first in the
 field, assisting those caught in the waves of violence. The International Committee
 of the Red Cross (ICRC) reacted urgently to fly in teams of medical personnel, medi-
 cal supplies, and relief items. The ICRC     surveyed hospitals and clinics in
 Bujumbura, Kayanza, Ngozi, and Kirundo to assess medical needs and begin orga-
 nizing field hospital assistance.
 At the end of the year, Burundi remained a society severely polarized along ethnic
 lines. Violence and interethnic killing had begun to subside, but sporadic incidents
 continued and the situation remained unstable.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The new Constitution provides for free opinion
 and expression as Iong as these rights are expressed "in a manner consistent with
 the public law and ord er."
 The current press law, promulgated under the Buyoya government in December
 1992, gives the Government wide latitude in restricting all media. Under the
 Buyoya regime, it was never fully enforced, and papers essentially wrote whatever
 they wanted, including articles critical of the Government. In late December, the
 Minister of Communications used the law to suspend an extremist Tutsi newspaper
 for undermining national unity. Radio and television are government-controlled, and
 some observers believe that control tightened under the FRODEBU Government.
 The December 1992 law, designed to correct restrictions in an earlier law deemed
 unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court, retained restrictions on permissible
 criticism of government policies, the person of the President, and statements that
 could be construed as contrary to national unity or injurious to the national econ-
 omy. The law also provided for government review and possible censorship of all
 media prior to distribution. In practice, private newspapers published without prior
 government review, and no cases of seizure were recorded.
 Newspapers independent of government control demonstrated a willingness to re-
 ort and comment on issues that the government-controlled press had previously
 been hesitant to cover. This trend, begun in 1992, continued until October, as did
 the consequent willingness of the government-controlled Le Renouveau to open its
 pages to issues previously ignored, in particular political matters.
 Newspaper readership remained limited, and the majority of the population relied
 on the government-controlled radio programming in French, Kirundi, and Swahili
 for information. Reporting in both radio and television reflected government policies,
 but some air time was reserved for opposition party activities, both prior to and fol-
 lowing the elections.
 Prior to the elections, the Government promised all political parties equal access
 to the official media and began to produce radio and television debates with partici-
 pation by representatives of the various political parties. At the same time, journal-
 ists and editors for the government-controlled media continued to practice self-cen-
 sorship. This included canceling programs which the Government found unaccept-
 able and altering texts or footage to correspond to the Government's preferences.
 Following the June elections, the Minister of Communication fired the Director-
 General of Radio-Television Nationale du Burundi for failing to adhere sufficiently
 to the Government's editorial preferences. Many observers felt that the control of
 the public media became stricter and less tolerant of diversity of opinion following
 the elections. At the same time, the independent newspapers, of admittedly limited
 influence, remained outspoken and openly critical of the Government, without inter-
 ference.
 Academic freedom has not been tested because the predominantly Tutsi faculty
 was supportive of the previous government, and the new Government had not been
 in power long enough for conflict on academic issues to arise. Schools closed at the
 onset of violence in October and had not reopened by year's end.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-In December 1991, the Gov-
 ernment promulgated a decree-law establishing guidelines for granting permits for
 oublic meetings or parades. During 1993, the newly formed political parties regu-
 larly held well-attended meetings in Bujumbura but reported facing harassment and
 bureaucratic obstacles when they applied for permits for meetings, particularly in
 rural areas.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is no state religion in Burundi. More than 60 per-
 cent of the population is Catholic, and the Catholic church plays an important role
 in the lives of both rural and urban dwellers. A number of Protestant churches have
 significant followings.
 Religious organizations are subject to the same rules and restrictions that apply
 to secular organizations. They must obtain approval from the Government to oper-
 ate in the country, and a Burundi citizen must be designated as the legal represent-
 
 
 ative of each organization. Prior to 1993, there were continuing incidents of tem-
 porary detentions and harassment of Jehovah's Witnesses who refused to comply
 with local and school officials' demands that they recognize secular authority and
 participate in state-sanctioned practices, such as singing the national anthem. In
 1993 Jehovah's Witnesses reported less harassment than in the past, and, by the
 end of the year, the group had received government approval as a religious organi-
 zation.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-During periods of rumored PAL1PEHUTU incursions in the past, the
 Government closed land and water frontiers; generally the Bujumbura airport re-
 mained open in those instances. However, during the first week following the Octo-
 ber 21 coup attempt the airport was closed to traffic. Internal movement was ob-
 structed immediately after the coup attempt by the destruction of bridges and trees
 felled for roadblocks to prevent feared military attacks. By year's end, internal roads
 had been cleared.
 Repatriation of Hutu refugees was a major issue in the FRODEBU election cam-
 paigns since over 200,000 refugees were estimated to be living in Tanzania, Rwanda
 and Zaire. Upon the FRODEBU victory, refugees began returning in record num-
 bers, many without waiting to be processed through the repatriation system, most
 coming with no means of support.
 The new Government's goal was to repatriate each returnee to his or her original
 property and provide a 6-month food ration for each, but the Government found it-
 self unprepared for the volume of work and resources the program demanded. The
 most problematical aspect was land restoration to refugees who had been gone for
 over 20 years from property that had often changed hands several times in good
 faith. The Government's refugee commission authorized settlement of cases with no
 legal references or standards, depending instead on local committees who they said
 "would know to whom the land belongs. Disputes arose immediately, and local com-
 mittees were accused of being simply FRODEBU partisans with biased judgments.
 In late September, the repatriation commission was obliged to table decisions until
 local committees could be checked and guidelines set for dispute settlements.
 As a result of the attempted coup d'etat on October 21, nearly 600,000 Burun-
 dians, including many recent returnees, fled to Tanzania, Rwanda, and Zaire. At
 year's end, approximately 170,000 internally displaced persons, mainly Tutsis, were
 estimated to be sheltered in camps within Burundi. Several hundred thousand
 more, mostly Hutus, were dispersed, hiding in various locations in the countryside.
 Prior to the coup attempt, Burundi hosted approximately 300,000 refugees, mostly
 Rwandans, about 80,000 of whom were assisted by the UNHCR. Many Rwandan
 refugees from a camp in northern Burundi joined their compatriots in and around
 Bujumbura to escape recent violence.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 For the first time in Burundi's history, citizens exercised their right to change the
 national Government by democratic means in free and fair elections in June. Three
 political parties nominated presidential candidates, and 7 parties ran candidates for
 the National Assembly. Following a very heated political campaign which brought
 age-old ethnic biases to the fore between UPRONA and FRODEBU supporters,
 President Melchior Ndadaye, a former banker, was elected and sworn into office. He
 promptly announced the appointment of Sylvie Kinigi, a Tutsi woman, as Prime
 Minister, and a 23-person Cabinet, in which 60 percent of the members were Hutus
 and 40 percent Tutsis. These members represented FRODEBU, UPRONA (opposi-
 tion), Pe pIes' Party, and Assembly of Burundi Peoples' parties, as well as members
 of the military. The new National Assembly was sworn in shortly thereafter and
 held its first extraordinary session on July 19.
 The elected Government remained in office despite the assassination in October
 of President Ndadaye and the President and Vice President of the National Assem-
 bly. The Assembly reconvened and elected a new parliamentary leadership. Most
 ministers reported regularly to their offices though some still returned for safety to
 a guarded hotel at night. The Government began replacing missing local administra-
 tors and began examining the constitutional options for the installation of an in-
 terim President.
 Women are still poorly represented in the political process and in government, in-
 cluding in the legislature and the judiciary. In addition to Prime Minister Kinigi,
 the Minister of Social Action, Human Rights, and Protection of Women, is also a
 woman.

 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Under the Buyoya government, the two independent human rights groups (ITEKA
 and SONERA) acedureaucratic obstacles, such as inordinate delays by Ministry
 of Justice officials in responding to requests for information on specific cases or for
 permission to visit prisons, but they were not actively impeded from carrying out
 their activities. These activities included investigations and reports on individual
 human rights cases and civic education programs. The two organizations undertook
 a joint investigation of the violence of November 1991.
 The outgoing Buyoya government and the new Ndadaye Government welcomed
 contact with international human rights organizations. The African American Insti-
 tute organized an international civilian/military conference in February to discuss
 a broad range of topics concerning the military's role in democracy. The ICRC con-
 tinued to visit prisons and hospitals throughout the year and played a major role
 in assisting the wounded in the violence after Ndadaye's assassination in October.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The new Constitution explicitly provides equal status and protection for all citi-
 zens, without distinction based on sex, origin, ethnicity, religion, or opinion. In prac-
 tice, de facto discrimination against women, Hutus, Batwa or Twa (Pygmies) was
 apparent throughout society and institutions despite government efforts to discour-
 age it.
 Women.-Women hold a secondary place in society and face both legal and soci-
 etal discrimination. For example, the explicitly discriminatory elements of inherit-
 ance laws and those relating to obtaining financial credit remained unchanged. Al-
 though assured of the same pay as men if they held the same job, women were far
 less likely than men to hold mid- or high-level positions in either the public or pri-
 vate sectors. President Ndada e appointed some women to high government posi-
 tions; he brought two women oSicer candidates into military cadet ranks.
 Nevertheless, conditions for women did not undergo appreciable change. In par-
 ticular, the traditional distinction between male and female roles in Burundi re-
 mained institutionalized in rural areas, where women are responsible for hard labor
 in most food-crop production. In rural areas, females also had little opportunity for
 education. Overall, females get only one-third of the schooling of males.
 Violence against women occurs, including wife beating and rape, but there is no
 documentation of its extent. Police do not normally intervene in domestic disputes,
 and the press does not cover incidents of violence against women, including rape.
 There were no known court cases dealing with abuse of women.
 Children.-The Government has not expressed a particular commitment to chil-
 dren's human rights as distinct from those of all other citizens. During the October
 violence, children were victims of the violence along with adults of both ethnic
 groups. At year's end, the number of orphans created by the violence had not been
 determined, and the Government had not yet formulateda response to this problem.
 Indigenous People.-The indigenous Twa (Pygmy) minority, which comprises per-
 haps 1 percent of the population, remained almost completely marginalized, eco-
 nomically, socially, and politically. While the former Buyoya government stated its
 commitment to serve all Burundians, most Twa continued to live in isolation, with-
 out attending school or having access to government services, including health care.
 There were no known efforts by the former Government or other political parties
 to discriminate against Twa in the elections.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Burundi's fundamental problem is the eth-
 nic conflict between majority Hutus, who gained political power only with the elec-
 tion of Ndadaye in June, and minority Tutsis, who have historically held power and
 still control the military and dominate educated society. In practice, de facto ethnic
 discrimination against Hutus-85 percent of the population--colors every facet of so-
 ciety and institutions, including the military and the judicial establishment, despite
 constitutional provisions and some policies introduced under the Buyoya military
 administration to attract Hutus into the professions. These late efforts had not had
 a significant impact, but Hutus, under Buyoya, had made inroads into the civil serv-
 ice, and by 1993 the number of Hutus exceeded the number of Tutsis entering sec-
 ondary school.
 The Ndadaye administration upon assuming office began a more concerted effort
 to put its PRODEBU faithful into the government bureaucracy. Those policy
 changes led quickly to increased tensions between long-term Tutsi professionals (ci-
 vilian and military) and the new FRODEBU Government.
 People with Disabilities.-Burundi's rudimentary economy effectively excludes the
 physically disabled from many types of employment. Some sheltered craft work-
 
 
 shops exist in Bujumbura but the most frequent occupation for the physically dis-
 abled is street and market vending or begging. The Government has not enacted
 legislation or otherwise mandated provision of accessibilty for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Government promulgated a revision of the
 Labor Code in July. Both the Constitution and the revised Labor Code protect the
 rights of workers to form unions. However, only about 15,000 workers in the wage
 economy (about 20 percent) participate in the new system of voluntary checkoffs put
 into place to help finance union activities. Most workers are from the ranks of urban
 civil servants. The military, the gendarmerie, and certain expatriates working in the
 public sector are prohibited from forming or joining unions.
 The national umbrella trade union organization, the Organiation of Free Unions
 of Burundi (CSB), is financially dependent on this same system of voluntary check-
 offs. CSB represented labor in drafting negotiations for the new Labor Code revi-
 sions and has also participated in specific collective bargaining negotiations in co-
 operation with individual labor unions. The CSB includes all labor unions except the
 teachers union and is the only existing labor federation. The Labor Code permits
 the formation of additional unions or union confederations outside the CSB.
 The Labor Code also provides workers the right to strike. The revised Labor Code
 affirms, but does not greatly alter, the right of workers to form unions and to strike.
 Restrictions on the right to strike and lockout are: 1) the action must be taken only
 after exhausting all other peaceful means of resolution, 2) negotiations must con-
 tinue during the action, mediated by a mutually agreeable party or by the Govern-
 ment, and 3) 6 days' notice must be given. Retribution against workers participating
 in a legal strike is prohibited.
 One strike occurred in the first half of October at the National Data Processing
 Center, where workers who chose to leave the organization upon privatization did
 not receiv  e required indemnity payment. At year's end, the strike was still in
 effect, and negotiations still in progres.
 CSB maintains international aftions with the Organization of Central African
 Workers, the Organization of African (Labor) Unions, the International Confed-
 eration of Trade Unions, and the World Confederation of Labor. CSB has also spon-
 sored seminars and training proas with the African-American Labor Center.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The 1993 Labor Code revision
 recognizes the right to collective bargaining which had formerly been acknowledged
 only by ordinance. Since most workers are civil servants, government entities are
 involved in almost every phase of labor negotiations. Public sector wages are set in
 thxed scales in individual work contracts and are not affected by collective bargain-
 ing. In the privat e sorvwae scales also exist but individual contract negotiation
 is possible. In principle, private sector wage scales can also be influenced by collec-
 tive bargaining, though this is infre uent.
 The Labor Code also gives the abor Court jurisdiction over all labor dispute
 cases, including those involving public employees. Labor negotiations are still con-
 ducted largely between unions and employers under the supervision of the tripartite
 National Labor Council, the Government's highest consultative authority on labor
 issues. The Council represents government, labor, and management and is presided
 over and regulated by the Minister of Labor.
 The 1993 Labor C ode revision prohibits employers from firing or otherwise dis-
 criminating against a worker because of union affiliation or activity. A three-step
 process was available to resolve complaints regarding labor practices or policies to-
 ward a union or union member: Direct employer-employee negotiations under the
 auspices of the CSB; an administrative hearing before a government labor inspector;
 and a legal proceeding before the Labor Court.
 There are no expert processing zones, though a decree-law making the entire na-
 tion a freeze Unifor many nontraditional, export-oriented activities was promulgated
 on August 31, 1992. The decree-law requires, inter alia, that wages meet the mini-
 mum in'terprofessional standards fixed by law but allows employers more latitude
 in negotiations with employees. The law alo makes it easier for qualifying enter-
 prises to hire foreign workers.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced and compulsory labor are
 prohibited by law and not practiced. The Committee of Exports of the International
 Labor Organization (ILO) noted the repeal of some derees and orders which were
 inconsistent with the commitment to abolish forced labor but reiterated its concern
 about other decrees or orders requiring obligatory community development and not
 excluding political prisoners from prison labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The current Labor Code states
 that children under the age of 16 are not allowed to be employed by "an enterprise,"

 even as apprentices, though it also states that they may undertake occasional work
 which does not damage their health or schooling. Young children are, in fact, often
 seen doing heavy manual labor, including transporting bricks on their heads, in
 rural areas in daytime during the school year. Children are legally forbidden from
 working at night, though many did so in the informal sector. As a practical matter,
 children are obligated by custom and economic necessity to help support their family
 by participating in activities related to subsistence agriculture in family-based en-
 terprises and the informal sector.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The nationally established formal minimum
 wage for unskilled workers is $0.54 (140 Burundi francs) per day in Bujumbura and
 Gitega and $0.34 (88 Burundi francs) in the rest of the country, with a graduated
 scale for increased skill levels. This amount does not meet the daily needs for a fam-
 ily. Employees working under contract, particularly in urban areas, generally earn
 significantly more than the minimum wage. All employees in the public sector work
 under contract, while the CSB estimates that 70 percent of employees working in
 the formal private sector are covered by a contract.
 The Labor Code revision calls for maternity and health costs to be taken over by
 social security, once it is established, rather than to be borne by employees. Most
 families live outside urban areas and are involved in subsistence agricultural pro-
 duction which allows them to supplement their income with homegrown foodstuffs.
 Many urban households rely on more than one wage earner or supplement earnings
 by articipation in petty commerce.
 The Labor Code imposes a maximum 8-hour workday and 45-hour workweek ex-
 cept in cases when workers are involved in activities related to national security.
 Supplements must be paid for overtime in any case.
 The Labor Code establishes health and safety standards requiring an employer
 to provide a safe workplace and assigns enforcement responsibility to the Ministry
 of Labor. However, enforcement suffers from a shortage of staff and resources.
 Health and safety articles in the Labor Code do not directly address the workers'
 right to remove themselves from a dangerous work situation.
