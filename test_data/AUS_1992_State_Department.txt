 AUSTRALIA
 Australia has a federal system of government and a long history as a multiparty
 parliamentary deocrac. Feder, state, and local polie carry out their functions
 in accordance wit civil law, which respects and safeguards individual human
 rights.
 Australia has a developed economy which includes manufacturing, mining, agri-
 culture, and services proiding most Australians with a high per capita income. A
 wide range of government programs offers assistance for the minority of relatively
 disadvantaged citizens, but fiscal constraints are affecting the amount made avail-
 able. Persons are free to hold private property, pursue economic and personal inter-
 ests, associate with others, and organize trade unions.
 Basic human rights are ensured by law and respected in practice. The Govern-
 ment is firmly committed, both domestically and internationally, to the promotion
 of, and respect for, human rights. In June Parliament enacted legislation that the
 laws of the State of Western Australia to Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands,
 thereby repealing outdated and inhuman laws previously in effect in the two exter-
 nal territories.
 In part as a result of the April 1991 report of the Royal Commission, which inves-
 tigated the deaths of Aboriginals while in custody, the Government instituted many
 new programs aimed at imro        socioeconomic onditions of Aboriginals and
 Torres Strait Islanders (ATSIF(to~e er forming about 1.5 percent of the population)
 and addressing longstanding discrimination against them. (See Section 5.)
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrjudicial  iling.-Killing for political motives by the
 Government or by political organizations does not occur.
 The Royal Commission investigating the deaths of Aboriginals and Torres Strait
 Islanders in custody stated that although the deaths were not caused deliberately,
 police and prison officials showed callous indifference and remarkable insensitivity,
 which contributed significantly to the deaths. The Commission found, inter alia,
 that although ATSI died at approximately the same rate as others in prison, they
 were arrested at a rate 29 times that of whites.
 In a report issued in October the Australian Institute of Criminology stated that
 the number of deaths in custody has not fallen in the period since the Royal Com-
 mission completed its work. The Institute noted that the number of deaths that oc-
 curred in 1990 (53) was approximately the same as in previous years, whereas the
 number of deaths in 1991 (61) was somewhat higher. Deaths of Aboriginals in cus-
 tody (19) amounted to 16.7 percent of the total for the 2 years (114). The Institute
 summarized that "Abrigina] people were overrepresented in the number of deaths,
 reflecting their high level of overrepresentation in the prison and police custody pop-
 ulations.
 b. Disappearance.-Ther have been no instances of political disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Australian law prohibits all these practices, and this prohibition is generally re-
 spected. In April 1991, however, the Royal Commission investigating ATSI deaths
 in custody indicated it had found credible evidence that ATSI had frequently been
 mistreated while in custody and it recommended several steps to reduce the num-
 ber of arrests and improve the treatment of ATSI prisoners to avoid further deaths.
 During 1992 federal and state authorities sought to address the problem of deaths
 and mistreatment of Aboriginals in custody by means of police reform, including
 new detention procedures and training courses in Aboriginal culture, and through
 other programs which are described in Section 5.

 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Australian law prohibits arbitrary arrest
 and imprisonment. This prohibition is respected in practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Australia's well-developed system of federal and
 state courts is fully independent. Both in law and in practice, Australia gives de-
 fendants rights to due process, including a presumption of innocence, a right to
 confront witnesses, and a right of appeal. On the other hand, previous practice in
 federal and state cases has not always required that the Government pay for an in-
 digent defendant's lawyer.
 In March the full bench of the High Court of Australia heard a case in which a
 litigant argued that the right to be provided with counsel at public expense should
 be recognized as a fundamental human right in the common law, consistent with
 Australia's current moral obligations under international law. In December the High
 Court ordered that the accused be retried in the court of original jurisdiction, stat-
 ing that the lack of legal representation had rendered the original trial unfair. The
 High Court did not declare that there is an unconditional right to legal representa-
 tion at public expense but did state that it would be an exceptional case in which
 a person accused of serious charges could be tried fairly without a lawyer.
 In the long run, the High Court's decision may lead to changes in previous prac-
 tice whereby all Australian states except New South Wales and Western Australia
 have obliged people involved in criminal cases to meet a merit test before qualifying
 for legal aid. The purpose of the merit test has been to save the Government from
 "wasting funds on unwinnable cases." It has been the practice for the local Legal
 Aid Commission to evaluate a case on its merits and determine whether it is worth
 pursuing, taking into account the perceived chances of winning the case and the
 gravity of the likely penalty.
 Under these procedures, many, but not all, defendants in serious criminal cases
 have been found to deserve legal counsel. If the case was considered futile, the de-
 fendant was denied counsel at public expense. An unfavorable decision could be ap-
 pealed to a panel of independent lawyers and social workers appointed by the Legal
 Aid Commission.
 Negative economic conditions have been affecting the states' ability to provide
 legal aid. In the state of Victoria, theLegal Aid Commission has not grantedaid in
 criminal cases likely to cost the state government more than $US150,000.
 Defendants appearing before a defense force magistrate are exempt from the
 merit test, and ATSI are likewise exempt. The Government established offices of
 special legal counsel for persons of ATSI descent, who are always entitled to receive
 .rbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Under
 Australian law and in practice, no search may be conducted without a judicially is-
 sued warrant. The Government does not interfere with the privacy of family, home,
 or correspondence. In August however the Independent Commission Against Cor-
 ruption of the State of NewSouth Waies issued a lengthy report on unauthorized
 release of personal data on individuals by state government officials and police offi-
 cers to commercial interests, in return for covert payments. Some observers argued
 that state and federal governments should strengthen legal protection for personal
 data, and a state parliamentary inquiry was expected to examine such questions.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-A democratic political system, an effective judi-
 ciary, and diverse, vigorous, and independent news media combine to protect free-
 dom of speech and press and full academic freedom.
 On August 28, the High Court of Australia invalidated a controversial December
 1991 law which prohibited political advertising on radio and television during na-
 tional and state election campaigns. On the same day the High Court issued an
 order invalidating a section of the Industrial Relations Act which created an offense
 unishable by jail for bringing the Industrial Relations Commission "into disrepute."
 Fn the orresponding written decisions, issued on September 30, the High Court
 cited an impled guarantee iq the Constitution protecting the right to communicate
 political messages freely or to discuss and criticize organs of government. The Court
 therefore dclaredt     the Commonwealth's efforts to stifle this right were uncon-
 stitutional.
 The State of New South Wales prohibits inciting hatred against a person or grup
 on the basis of race color, or nationality, and the law provides for both civil and
 criminal penalties. The State of Western Australia prohiits published, written ex-
 pression along such lines, treating such actions solely as a criminal matter. In late
 1992, the federal Attorney-General, on behalf of the Australian Government, was
 drafting amendments to   e Crime Act of 1914 which, if enacted, would establish
 new prohibitions in federal law directed against inciting hatred.

 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Australia does not have a writ-
 ten bill of rights but is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political
 Rights. The Covenant provides for freedom of assembly and expression, and these
 freedoms are respected m practice.
 c. Freedom of Rel'in.--Australians have complete fieedom of religion. A provi-
 sion in the Constitution precludes the adoption of an official state religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re.
 patriation.-Australia imposes no restrictions on movement within or outside the
 country. The rights of emigration and repatriation are also protected. In late 1992,
 the Australian High Court upheld the Government's right to detain boat people
 pending adjudication of their cases. The Government deports as illegal immigrants
 applicants whose requests are denied. Since 1989, 540 boat people have sought refu-
 gee status. The Australian Government has granted refugee status to 56 and denied
 it to 135, 90 of whom remain in detention pending appeal. Forty people have accept-
 ed voluntary repatriation to Cambodia and China; 5 went to other countries; and
 one obtained residency by marrying an Australian. At year's end, 393 boat people
 remained in detention at various centers around the country.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Australians elect representatives to a two-chamber Federal Parliament as well as
 to numerous state and local bodies through free and open elections. Voting, by se-
 cret ballot, is compulsory in general elections for Australians 18 years of age and
 older- voters who do not at least collect ballots may be fined.
 Indigenous people are able to participate fully in Australia's political process; they
 do so as voters, members of political parties, and candidates for elected office.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitudes Regarding International and Nongovernmental
 Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A wide range of local nongovernmental organizations concerned with human
 rights operates freely, and the Government permits unimpeded access to all inter-
 national groups investigating alleged human rights violations. Australia actively
 promotes human rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The Racial Discrimination Act of 1975 prohibits discrimination on grounds of race,
 color, descent, or national or ethnic origin, and most Australians have equal access
 to government services. In practice, however, ATSI continued to suffer abusive
 treatment and widespread discrimination.
 Because the Aboriginal population is the most disadvantaged group in relation to
 education, housing, health, and employment the federal and state governments pro-
 vide special services which supplement the broad range of programs that are avail-
 able to all Australians. These special services are aimed at improving socioeconomic
 conditions among ATSI. Parliament established the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Is-
 lander Commission to give ATSI more control over many government programs in-
 tended for their benefit and also set up the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation,
 which is coordinating a 10-year program to promote better understanding between
 ATSI and other Australians.
 In an amateur videotape that was shown on Australian television in March, off-
 duty police officers donned makeup and costumes and parodied Aboriginas who had
 hung themselves while in custody. These individuals were disciplined, and the Gov-
 ernment emphasized the repellent nature of their actions.
 In 1992 the Government allotted about $US288 million for programs intended to
 benefit ATSI. The programs address substance abuse; legal assistance; hiring of
 Aboriginals in police and justice-related fields; alternatives to detention of youths
 by police; police reform; self-determination and employment; a comprehensive 3-year
 survey of ATSI persons by the Australian Bureau of Statistics; and annual reports
 on the human rights status of ATSI persons.
 Observers affiliated with Aboriginal groups generally welcomed these plans but
 noted that much of the underlying problem stemmed from deeply rooted attitudes
 and views and expressed doubt that government programs, although valuable in
 themselves, would produce notable results in the short run. These observers also
 questioned whether federal and state police authorities had shown sufficient dili-
 gence and energy in pursuing police reform.
 Analysts and commentators have estimated that domestic violence, mainly
 against females, may have involved as many as one in three families. Government
 officials, while stressing that such estimates were personal appraisals, nevertheless
 agreed that the problem was prevalent and cut across all segments of Australian
 society.

 The National Committee on Violence Against Women sponsors research and con-
 ducts studies, seeking to examine policy issues from a national perspective (e.g., the
 need for special trning for police and the judiciary). In mid-1992, the Government
 began a new community education program directed against domestic violence.
 The Sex Discrimination Act of 1984 prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex,
 marital status, or pregnancy. Separate 1986 legislation on affirmative action obliges
 employers to provide equal emp oyment and equal promotion opportunities for fe-
 male employees.
 In late 1992, the Government was preparing draft amendments to the Sex Dis-
 crimination Act to strengthen it and give the findings of the Human Rights and
 Equal Opportunity Commission legal force if they were registered in federal court
 and not invalidated as a result of subsequent proceedings. In part the projected
 amendments would require equal pay for equal work as a feature o? federal indus-
 trial awards and also of certified workplace agreements dated after enactment.
 Women's rights and welfare are promoted by a number of women's rights groups
 and by the Government's Office of the Status of Women.
 The National Child Protection Council, a Commonwealth-funded body which also
 includes representatives of state governments as well as community members, pro-
 motes and conducts research on the prevention of child abuse and child neglect. The
 Council is examining the feasibility of a national community education program,
 and it actively cooperates with nongovernmental organizations.The Government con-
 tinued its commitment to promote intercultural understanding and to address better
 the needs of ethnic groups through a national multicultural agenda.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Australian law and practice generally provide work-
 ers, including public servants, freedom of association both domestically and inter-
 nationally. In November, however, the International Labor Organization (ILO) noted
 that the Australian Governmenta requirement that unions have at least 10,000
 members to be registered under the federal system could "unduly influence workers'
 free choice of unions." The ILO recommended that the Australian Government
 change the membership requirement to allow small unions access to benefits cur-
 rently not available because they cannot register under the federal system. The Aus-
 tralian Council of Trade Unions, the principal labor organization in Australia, is af-
 filiated with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 Australian workers enjoy the right to strike, which is well established in practice.
 The right to strike is not, however, protected under domestic law, and unions may
 be held liable for damages resulting from labor disputes. Strikes are frequent but
 usually of short duration. In general, industrial disputes are resolved through direct
 employer-union negotiations or under the auspices of the various state and federal
 industrial relations commissions whose mandates include conciliation and arbitra-
 tion.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiely.-Australian workers are grant-
 ed the right, by law and in practice, to organize and bargain collectively, an  to be
 represented in negotiating the prevention and settlement of disputes with employ-
 ers. Workers are also protectedcby law and in practice from antiunion discrimina-
 tion. A pattern of centralized wage negotiations with quasi-judicial arbitration and
 settlement, supplemented by industry-wide or company-by-cornany collective bar-
 gaining, has generally prevailed since the establishment of the  mmonwealth Con-
 ciliation and Arbitration Commission in 1904. The Industrial Relations Act of 1988
 made important technical changes in the basic system, creating a new Industrial
 Relations Commission with expanded scope for performing essentially the same
 tasks as its predecessor.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Although there are no domestic
 laws on forced labor, Australia has ratified and fully respects ILO Convention 105
 concerning forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Although there is no federally
 mandated minimum age for employment, state-imposed compulsory education re-
 quirements, monitored and enforced by state educational authorities, prevent chil-
 dren from joining the work force until they are 15 to 16 years old, except in individ-
 ual cases involving administrative approval for absence from school because of rea-
 sons such as illness, disability, or family hardship. In addition, federal and state
 ministries of labor monitor and enforce a complicated network of legislation (which
 varies from state to state) governing such interrelated factors as minimum school-
 leaving age, minimum age to claim unemployment benefits, and minimum age to
 engage in specified occupations.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Australia has longhad a tradition that work-
 ers should be guaranteed a decent standard of living. Although a formal minimum
 
 
 519
 wage exists, it is not used. Instead, most workers are covered by differing minimum
 wage rates for individual trades and professions which are embodied in a com-
 prehensive system of awards, determined by the various quasi-judicial state and
 federal industrial relations commissions after submissions by union employer, and
 government representatives. In many cases invol"ving individual business enter-
 prises, the commissions approve wape rates previously negotiated and agreed upon
 byemployer and union representatives. Where market conditions warrant, higher
 wages than those provided for in industrial awards ("over-award payments") are
 common. The lowest current federal award of about $US234 per 88-h our week is for
 clothing workers. Combined with other regularly provided benefit and government
 entitlements for low-incme families, this wage provides a decent standard of living.
 For employees of incorporated organizations--a majority of Australian workers--
 a complex b ody of federal and state regulations, as well as decisions of the cor-
 responig in    strial relations commissions, prescribes a 40-hour or shorter work-
 week, paid vacations, sick leave, and other benefits. In a limited number of cases,
 workplace health and safety standards are also prescribed.
 An intergvernmental body called the National Occupational Health and Safety
 Commission (also known as "Workplace Australia) develops advisory standards and
 cdes of practic which can be the boasis for new laws. The Occupational Health and
 Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act of 1991 gives a federal employee the legal
 right to cease work if he or she believes that particular work activities pose an im-
 mediate threat to health or safety. Most states and territories have laws which
 grant similar rights to their employees.
