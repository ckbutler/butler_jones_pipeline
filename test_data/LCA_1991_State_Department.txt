 ST. LUCIA
 St. Lucia is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy and a member
 of the Commonwealth of Nations. For almost a decade, it has
 been led by incumbent Prime Minister John Compton, who was
 reelected in 1987. His United Workers Party currently holds a
 small majority of seats in Parliament. Elections must be held
 by July 1992 but can be called earlier'by the Prime Minister.
 The Royal St. Lucia Police, which is the only security force in
 the country, includes a small Special Service Unit with some
 paramilitary training and a coast guard unit. The police, who
 have traditionally demonstrated a high degree of respect for
 human rights, are controlled by and responsive to elected
 government officials.
 St. Lucia, after experiencing several years of sustained
 economic growth, began to feel the effects of the world
 recession during 1991. Its economy is largely based on the
 export of bananas, which also represent the major source of
 foreign exchange earnings. St. Lucia is gradually diversifying
 into other types of agriculture, tourism, and, more recently,
 into light manufactur-ing and construction. Economic
 performance in all sectors was relatively strong 'uring 1991.
 Human rights continued to be respected during 1991.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other'Extrajudicial Killing.
 There were no confirmed reports of political or other
 extrajudicial killings. According to the regional human rights
 organization Caribbean Rights, in 1991 there was a reduction of
 outright police abuse, but there were occasional instances
 where detainees' rights were not respected. One such case
 which came-to public attention during the year involved the
 1990 incarceration of a first time offender with dangerous
 criminals; the victim was killed by inmates in the Castries
 prison. This case led to a public outcry concerning the old,
 severely overcrowded prison and unsanitary conditions there.
 The regional human rights organization stationed in Barbados,
 Caribbean Rights, expressed its concern over conditions in the
 Castries prison, but St. Lucian Community Development and
 Social Affairs Minister denied that St. Lucia's prison problem
 was unusually bad.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances or politically
 motivated abductions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution specifically prohibits torture, and-no such
 incidents were reported. However, there has been an increase
 of convictions based on confessions in St. Lucia in recent
 years. This reflects the efforts to force confessions in lieu
 of other judicial and investigative mechanisms. There have
 been occasional credible allegations of harsh treatment of
 prisoners by law enforcement officials prior to and during
 incarceration. Although no international or regional human

 ST. LUCIA
 rights organizations filed reports or requests for
 investigations in 1991, a 1990 request by a regional human
 rights organization to survey the prisons in St. Lucia was not
 approved by the government, which claimed it was "not ready"
 (see Section l.a.).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Government adheres to the constitutional provision
 prohibiting arbitrary arrest or imprisonment and requiring a
 court hearing within 72 hours after detention. There were no
 reports of arbitrary arrest or other forms of extralegal
 detention, or of forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution requires public trials before an independent
 and impartial court, and the provision of legal counsel for
 indigents. Both constitutional and statutory requirements for
 fair public trials are followed. Criminal defendants are
 entitled to select their own legal counsel, are presumed
 innocent until proven guilty, and have the right of appeal.
 The regional West Indies Court of Appeal, a circuit court long
 noted for its impartiality, serves as St. Lucia's appeals court.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There were no reports of arbitrary intrusion by the State into
 the private lives of individual citizens. Authorities
 consistently observe constitutional prohibitions against
 arbitrary search, seizure, and entry.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Constitutional provisions for free speech and press are
 respected in practice. The Government neither interferes with
 the operations of the press nor censors the content of the
 three privately owned major newspapers, which cover the
 spectrum of political opinion and are often highly critical of
 the Government. The one local television station, Helen
 Television System, is also privately owned, and covers a wide
 spectrum of views. Radio St. Lucia is government owned and
 operated, but the programming staff has been allowed a large
 measure of autonomy.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of association and of assembly are provided for by the
 Constitution. Permits are usually granted for public meetings
 and demonstrations. Refusal to issue a permit is rare and
 generally stems from the failure of the organizers to request a
 permit in a timely manner, normally defined as a 48-hour notice.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The majority of the population is Roman Catholic. Other
 denominations are free to maintain places of worship, train
 clergy, establish religious schools, and engage in the full
 range of activities normally associated with religious
 organizations.

 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 These rights are provided for in the Constitution and honored
 in practice.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 St. Lucia's parliamentary system provides for genuine choices
 among parties, policies, and officials. Although currently
 there are two main parties, several other political
 organizations also participate in free elections, which are
 held at least every 5 years and by secret ballot. The
 opposition St. Lucia Labor Party plays a significant role in
 the country's political life, and presently holds 7 of 17 seats
 in the House of Assembly.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights..
 There are no local human rights groups in St. Lucia. There are
 no government restrictions which would impede the establishment
 of human rights organizations.
 International human rights organizations filed no reports or
 requests for investigations in 1991.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status.
 Government policy is basically nondiscriminatory in'the areas
 of housing, jobs, education, and advancement opportunities.
 There are no legal restrictions on the role of women or
 minorities.
 Violence directed specifically against women, including
 domestic violence such as wife beating, has recently become
 more of a public policy issue in St. Lucia. Lack of
 statistical data and possible reluctance on the part of some
 victims to report cases or to press 'charges make it difficult
 to gauge its true extent. Police and courts do enforce laws to
 protect women against abuse, although police generally tend to
 be reluctant to intervene in domestic disputes. In 1989 a
 women's rights organization called the "Crisis Center" was
 established to monitor existing abuses. The group held a
 number of public meetings to publicize the plight of battered
 women, and staged a large demonstration to protest the killing
 of a woman who was beaten to death. Extreme cases of this sort
 are not common, but the Government responded by establishing a
 Women's Affairs Office in the Ministry of Community
 Development. That office, together with the Crisis Center
 (whose staff includes female Peace Corps volunteers) developed
 a National Policy Statement on Women which was ratified,
 signed, and adopted by Parliament in March 1991. The Women's
 Office then commenced work on implementation of the policy,
 which includes among its objectives protecting the rights of
 women in domestic violence cases, ensuring no discrimination
 against women according to international conventions, and
 ensuring equal treatment in employment and overall equal status
 with men.

 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution specifies the right of workers to form or
 belong to trade unions under the broader rubric of the right of
 association. Unions are independent of the Government and are
 free to choose their own representatives. Union elections are
 often vigorously contested. All unions are free to publicize
 their views and choose policies to advance their members'
 interests. There is no restriction on forming a national labor
 federation, and several of the major unions in St. Lucia have
 joined together to form an umbrella grouping, called the
 Industrial Solidarity Pact. Unions are free to affiliate with
 international organizations, and some have done so.
 Strikes in both public and private sectors are legal if efforts
 by the Government to resolve disputes fail. Strikes do occur
 from time to time. In 1991 there were disputes among various
 unions representing the Air and Sea Authority over collective
 bargaining agreements. The Windward Islands Packaging Company,
 which manufactures banana cartons for export, locked out
 production workers after they staged a work slowndown in
 February. A temporary settlement was reached in negotiations
 which included the Ministry of Labor and the Employers'
 Federation, and a final collective bargaining agreement was
 signed in October. When an American garment factory, "Belle
 Fashions," the largest employer in St. Lucia, gave notice in
 August that it might close due to financial difficulties, the
 union representing its workers called on the Government to
 intervene. With the intervention of the Prime Minister the
 company agreed to stay open for the time being, and a number of
 employees were rehired.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Unions have the legal right to engage in collective bargaining
 and fully exercise that right. The majority of wage and salary
 earners belong to unions. During 1%89 the Government
 negotiated a 6-year wage agreement with 6 unions representing
 public servants, resulting in unusually harmonious
 government-labor relations. In the private sector, some
 companies offer packages of benefits with terms of employment
 better than, or comparable to, what a union can offer. This is
 especially true in export processing or industrial free zones
 (EPZ's). Antiunion discrimination by employers against union
 members is prohibited by law, and there are effective
 mechanisms for resolving complaints. Union organizing and
 collective bargaining are neither legally nor administratively
 discouraged in the EPZ's.
 Although labor law is applicable in the EPZ's, in practice many
 firms do not welcome union efforts to organize in the EPZ's.
 Some of these firms are un.der foreign management and employ
 young, female, labor forces with relatively low wages.
 Occasionally a persistent union is successful in winning a poll
 in an EPZ, in which case labor law applies to collective
 bargaining agreements in that company.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is illegal and does not exist.

 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum legal working age is 14 years, as stipulated by the
 Women and Young Persons Act. The law is enforced effectively
 by Labor Ministry officials.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 St. Lucia has legislated minimum wage rates set by the Wages
 Regulations (Clerks) Orders, effective since February 1985.
 The wage rates are divided by employment category (e.g. clerks,
 switchboard operators, cashiers, janitors, and messengers.)
 The minimum wage rates are not sufficient to provide a decent
 standard of living for a worker and family, but almost all
 categories of workers are paid much more than this legislative
 minimum, which is used only as a guide.
 There is no legislated maximum workweek, although common
 practice is 40 hours in 5 days. Occupational health and safety
 reguletions are relatively well developed. The Labor Ministry
 periodically inspects health and safety conditions at places of
 employment under the Employees Occupational Safety and Health
 Act of 1985.. The Act is enforced through threat of closure of
 the business if violations are discovered and not corrected.
