 VENEZUELA
 Venezuela is a republic with an active multiparty democratic
 system, a free press, strong unions, and a longstanding
 commitment to democracy. For more than 30 years, power has
 passed peacefully between the two major political parties
 through open elections. In 1988 a third political party
 emerged as a significant factor.
 The Venezuelan security apparatus has civilian and military
 elements, both of which are held accountable to popularly
 elected authorities. Although the military services focus on
 conventional war, they are occasionally called upon to
 maintain domestic order; for example, the President on several
 occasions in 1990 called on the military to assist in fighting
 street and property crime.
 Venezuela's mixed economy is dominated by the public sector.
 The state-owned petroleum industry currently accounts for some
 18 percent of the gross domestic product, more than any other
 industry. The Government is in the process of a major
 economic restructuring to reduce its dependence on oil exports
 and to enable domestic business to compete more effectively in
 the international market. To reduce the scope of public
 sector intervention in the economy, authorities have unified
 the exchange rate, freed interest rates, and reduced price
 controls and subsidies. The adjustment program has been and
 remains painful.
 In general, Venezuelans enjoy a wide range of freedoms and
 individual rights. The principal human rights concerns in
 1990 included: deplorable prison conditions; instances of
 arbitrary detention, abuse of detainees, and extrajudicial
 killings by the police and military; and corruption and
 inefficiency in the judicial and law enforcement systems.
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Authorities do not engage in or condone unlawful or arbitrary
 killing for political motives, and there were no reports of
 such killings. There have, however, been instances of
 extrajudicial killings in which police shot and killed
 criminal suspects, security forces killed civilians, and
 arrested persons died while in police custody. Charges are
 rarely brought against the perpetrators of such killings. If
 perpetrators are prosecuted, any sentences issued are usually
 light. In two instances in 1990, detainees in the custody of
 local "prefects," districts with the power of preliminary
 detention, were found hanged by blue jeans. According to
 witnesses, one of the detainees was wearing shorts when picked
 up by law enforcement officials. In both cases, family
 members who spoke with the detainees shortly before their
 deaths denied the likelihood of suicide. In February, a high
 school student was killed by a police officer during Carnival
 celebrations. Police reports claim the student failed to halt
 as commanded; a companion denied they.were ordered to stop.
 No sentences have yet been issued in the most publicized case
 of extrajudicial killing, the 1988 shooting deaths of 14
 persons by Venezuelan security forces in the town of El
 Amparo, near the Colombian border. In August the Supreme
 Court confirmed a decision by the highest military court to
 
 
 801
 VENEZUELA
 uphold arrest warrants against 19 security force members
 accused in the incident. Fourteen have been incarcerated.
 That same month, a coalition of human rights organizations
 requested consideration by the Inter-American Human Rights
 Commission of a government order that they claimed foreclosed
 full consideration of the alleged mishandling of the El Amparo
 case by a military judge. The judge was accused by attorneys
 of two survivors of the El Amparo shooting and several
 reputable human rights groups of attempting to manipulate
 evidence and of failing to carry out a complete
 investigation. They also claim the judge should have removed
 himself from the case due to a conflict of interest, since he
 is in the direct chain of command for the security officials
 involved .in the incident. The order, not publicly announced
 but discovered by the groups' attorneys, prohibited an
 investigation of charges against the judge.
 Charges of extrajudicial killings by security forces during
 the riots of February-March 1989 also remained under
 consideration during 1990 in both the military and civilian
 courts. Of approximately 300 cases involving charges of
 extrajudicial killings, abuse of authority, indiscriminate
 shooting, and'similar violations, only 1 has been adjudicated:
 a police officer was found guilty of homicide and sentenced to
 1 year's imprisonment. The Committee of Family Members of
 Victims of the Riots (COFAVIC, formed in 1989 to support riot
 victims' family members, is following 32 cases. No sentences
 had been issued in these cases by year's end.
 b. Disappearance
 There continue to be reports of perspns disappearing without
 explanation. Some of these persons have later been found in
 police custody. Three disappearances were confirmed by the
 Public Prosecutor's office in February; one of th victims was
 later traced to a mass grave. In each of these cases,
 security officials are presumed by human right sources to be
 involved. The Public Prosecutor's office has not yet reached
 a decision regarding responsibility. Sixteen persons
 disappeared during the 1989 riots; investigations of these
 cases remained incomplete as of the end of 1990. However,
 witnesses suspect that law enforcement authorities were
 involved. Also, opposition politicians accused .the Judicial
 Technical Police (PTJ) of involvement in the clandestine
 disappearances and burial of victims in a common grave near
 Maracaibo. The Maracaibo allegations were followed by
 judicial action on a longstanding suit by COFAVIC to exhume
 the bodies of 1989 riot victims buried in a mass grave in
 Caracas. During a judicial review of the Caracas burial site,
 other cadavers were found buried on top of those of the riot
 victims; human rights groups charge that these were also
 victims of disappearance and killing by police forces.
 Neither investigation was complete by the end of 1990.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by law, but physical abuse of detainees
 is prevalent, and includes some cases of electric shock,
 beatings, and rape.
 In February six persons sought refuge in the Public
 Prosecutor's office, alleging torture during incarceration on
 bank robbery charges, of which they were cleared, and claiming
 that they had been further threatened by investigative police
 
 
 802
 VENEZUELA
 officers after reporting the torture. A scandal erupted in
 June when female prisoners, who are not permitted conjugal
 visits, were found to be pregnant. The prisoners, supported
 by the Public Prosecutor's office, accused the guards of
 rape. In September a blind female street vendor accused
 guards at a predetention facility of raping her after holding
 her incommunicado for 3 days. She identified the voice of an
 alleged assailant at a judicial proceeding, but a judge
 investigating the case found insufficient evidence to'prove
 that a rape occurred. Throughout the year, newspapers
 published credible reports of electric shocks, burnings, and
 beatings during detention and incarceration. There were no
 known instances in 1990 of officials being punished for such
 abuses, although in September arrest warrants were issued for
 16 PTJ officers accused of torture.
 Prison conditions are abominable and are condemned by human
 rights groups and government officials. The Justice Minister
 said in June, "...in the prisons, we violate human rights, as
 we have for half a century." The annual report of the Public
 Prosecutor's office concluded that "almost all prison
 establishments in the country are in an intolerable situation
 of physical deterioration which harms the human and
 constitutional rights of the prison population." The Public
 Prosecutor's human rights division director, accompanied by
 other government officials, toured several prisons in March
 and found prisoners in cells contaminated by excrement. The
 prisoners, according to the investigators, received spoiled
 food and unpotable water. Overcrowding promotes serious
 health and safety problems in prisons. The Presidential
 Commission for the Reform of the State (COPRE) reported that
 the national prison system's capacity was exceeded by 30
 percent. The most overcrowded facility, a predetention
 institution near Caracas often pressed into use as a prison,
 has more than three times the number of prisoners it was built
 to hold. Discipline within prisons is widely considered to be
 inadequate, and violence by guards against the prisoners, and
 among the prisoners themselves; is said to be common. Both
 the Public Prosecutor's office and COPRE noted excessive
 violence within the prisons. COPRE reported an average of
 three prisoner deaths each week, most by stabbings with
 homemade knives. There were no known instances in 1990 of
 prison personnel being punished for such abuses.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 While the right to judicial determination of the legality of
 detention is provided by law, arrested persons or persons
 under preventive detention legally can be held up to 8 days
 without a formal detention order, during which time they may
 be held incommunicado. Arbitrary arrests and arrests with
 improper warrants are common, and the time limits for holding
 persons are frequently exceeded. Even if a person is detained
 under a proper order, the time of detention pending trial
 often exceeds the amount of time the person would have been
 required to serve had he or she been found guilty. During the
 March investigation of prison conditions by a government team
 led by the Public Prosecutor's office, it was discovered that
 prison officials charged detainees for transportation to
 judicial proceedings at which the accused would be formally
 charged. Detainees who lacked the money to pay the
 unauthorized charges were unable to get to their judicial
 hearings.
 
 
 803
 VENEZUELA
 Bail is permitted only for relatively minor crimes..
 Venezuela's bail laws have been under review by the Congress,
 and the Government hopes to increase the applicability of bail
 provisions, a step that would contribute to relieving
 overcrowded prisons.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Although the right to a fair trial is provided by law and some
 procedural safeguards exist, the burden of proof is on the
 accused to prove his or her innocence, and, owing to
 corruption and inefficiency, lengthy pretrial detention is the
 norm. The law provides public defenders for those unable to
 afford competent defense; however, the number of public
 defenders in the country is insufficient to meet this
 obligation. According to the Judicial Council's figures, some
 150 public defense attorneys have an average of 170 active
 cases each. Because of the unequal distribution of cases,
 however, some defenders handle as many as 250 cases. In some
 cases, defendants who remain outside the country pending
 assignment of a court date (to avoid extended pretrial
 detention without bail) may not select their own attorneys;
 the court appoints an attorney in these cases.
 According to the Ministry of Justice, fewer than 25 percent of
 all prisoners have been convicted. There is evidence that the
 backlog may have declined modestly in 1990, aided by the
 appointment of special judges. Judicial authorities attribute
 the backlog to an insufficient number of qualified judges,
 automatic review of all lower court decisions by higher courts
 unable to limit their dockets, and failure to enforce
 procedural deadlines at each stage of the legal process.
 Delays of 2 or 3 years in normal cases are not infrequent.
 The judicial process is almost exclusively a written one,
 requiring costly and time-consuming production of voluminous
 reports by judges, attorneys, and witnesses at every stage.
 The Justice Ministry built special courtrooms in each prison
 to facilitate rapid trials and obviate the need for
 transferring detainees from cells to court facilities, but the
 Venezuelan Judges' Association refused to use the new rooms,
 saying judicial proceedings were "too solemn" to take place in
 a penal institution.
 Some Venezuelan leaders and legal experts also blame delays
 and other irregularities on corruption and the use of personal
 influence. The civilian judiciary is legally independent, but
 connections to the two major political parties are important
 in the judicial selection process. The Chief of the Judicial
 Council announced in May a campaign to increase judicial
 awareness of the need for quick sentencing. The five-member
 Judicial Council is responsible for the nomination, training,
 and discipline of judges. One member is selected by Congress,
 one by the President, and three by the Supreme Court.
 Civilians charged with armed subversion are tried by military
 courts as insurgents. There is neither a statute of
 limitations nor a requirement of speedy trial for cases in
 military courts, although persons convicted under the military
 justice system have the same right to appeal to the Supreme
 Court as those prosecuted under the civilian system. Military
 judges are appointed by the Supreme Court. Besides the lack
 of deadlines in the military system, the system's secrecy and
 tendency to close ranks make it unlikely that defendants
 undergo an impartial or timely prosecution and can result in
 offenders being shielded from responsibility for human rights
 
 
 804
 VENEZUELA
 abuses. For example, although the case of 19 security agents
 implicated in the October 1988 El Amparo incident has been
 sent back and forth between the military court system and the
 Supreme Court for more than 2 years, no verdict had been
 issued as of the end of 1990. Attempts by human rights groups
 and attorneys for the two survivors of the incident to shift
 the proceedings to the civilian courts have so far been
 unsuccessful.
 The Public Prosecutor charged in March that trials of security
 officials accused of extrajudicial killings in connection with
 the 1989 riots were improperly referred to the military court
 system. Approximately 300 cases arose from the actions of
 security forces during the riots, with some 60 of those
 referred to the civilian court system and the remainder
 considered in military courts. Only one case had been decided
 by the end of the year; the police officer involved was found
 guilty of homicide and was sentenced to I year in prison.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution and law provide safeguards against arbitrary
 interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence.
 While these safeguards are largely honored in practice, there
 is evidence that some wiretapping takes place. Although there
 are laws prohibiting wiretapping, there are no penalties
 provided for in these laws. A bill to grant further
 protection of the right to private communication was under
 consideration by Congress in 1990.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of the press and free
 speech. These liberties, along with academic freedom, are
 almost universally honored. Venezuela has a free and lively
 press, which frequently criticizes the Government and
 denounces instances of government interference in the media.
 The media followed vigorously and with no apparent restraint
 the development of various government corruption cases,
 including continuing investigations into the misuse of public
 funds by the previous presidential administration, which was
 headed by the party still in power.
 Venezuela has 4 nationwide television networks, 2 of which are
 government owned, 3 regional television stations, 168 radio
 stations, and numerous newspapers and magazines, with 9
 dailies in Caracas alone. The Government is a significant
 source of advertising revenue for the media, but there appear
 to be no recent instances in which government advertising was
 channeled for political ends.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly ard Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association is normally
 respected in Venezuela. Public meetings, including those of
 all political parties, are held without interference. Permits
 are required for public marches but are not denied for
 political reasons. Professional and academic associations
 operate without interference. Most have ties to political
 parties.
 
 
 VENEZUELA
 C. Freedom of Religion
 The population is predominantly Roman Catholic, although other
 religious groups enjoy freedom of worship and proselytize
 actively. Foreign missionaries, both Catholic and Protestant,
 are active throughout the country. A law proposed in 1990
 would prohibit the activities of foreign missionaries among
 indigenous Venezuelan groups; it remained under consideration
 by a special Senate committee at year's end.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens end legal residents generally have freedom to travel
 within the country and to go abroad and return. Travel in the
 Amazon military zone-those parts of the Amazonas federal
 territory in southern Venezuela near the Brazilian border that
 lie beyond Puerto Auacucho and its surrounding developed areas
 and are accessible only by airplane or boat--is an exception
 and requires a special permit for security reasons.
 Venezuelans may emigrate if their tax obligations have been
 met. Citizenship can be renounced. Recovery of nationality
 requires a residence period of 2 years for Venezuelan-born
 repatriates. The Constitution provides for the revocation of
 citizenship of naturalized citizens on specific, limited legal
 grounds.
 Venezuela traditionally has been a haven for refugees, exiles,
 and displaced persons from many European, Caribbean, and Latin
 American countries. Refugees are given normal residence
 status and may be expelled only for criminal activities.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Government is freely elected by secret ballot. Venezuela
 is a multiparty democracy, with mandatory suffrage for all
 those 18 years of age or older, and the political process is
 open to all. Elections for the President, Congress, and state
 legislative assemblies are held every 5 years. Over two dozen
 parties participated in the 1988 national presidential
 elections. Eleven parties are represented in the House of
 Deputies and three parties are represented in the Senate.
 Governors and mayors were elected for the first time in
 Venezuelan history in 1989, and voters also were able to
 choose individual candidates by name, rather than selecting
 only among party slates. Both state and federal
 representatives are expected to be elected by name in the
 elections of 1992 and 1993, respectively, with the vote count
 procedure to be determined by Congress in the interim.
 Political views are freely expressed, and persons from the
 entire political spectrum contend for positions ranging from
 municipal council seats to the Presidency. Minor parties won
 18 percent of the seats in the national legislature in 1988;
 some of these parties are outgrowths of former guerrilla
 organizations. The two largest parties are centrist: the
 Social Democratic (Democratic Action, AD) and the Social
 Christian (COPEI) parties. The Movement Toward Socialism
 (MAS) party, founded by disenchanted members of the Venezuelan
 Communist Party, increased its share of the total vote to 10
 percent in the congressional elections of 1988 and won a
 governorship and several mayoral positions in local elections
 of 1989. Even some of the smaller parties provide mechanisms
 by which minority elements within their membership are
 
 
 806
 VENEZUELA
 guaranteed a voice in administrative and policymaking
 decisions to preclude their disenfranchisement. Women and
 minorities participate fully in government and politics, if in
 smaller percentages than their proportionate representation in
 society. There are no de jure impediments to their free
 participation. Traditional tendencies of masculine pride
 produce some de facto impediments, with women and minorities
 being promoted into higher level positions at a slower rate
 than men.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Two regional groups--the Latin American Foundation for Human
 Rights and Social Development, and the Federation of Families
 of Disappeared Persons--have offices in Caracas. These human
 rights organizations-are able to operate free of government
 restriction. A considerable number of local human rights
 groups are also active and vigorously criticize perceived
 government inadequacies in redressing grievances. Some of the
 groups complain of police harassment, including the disruption
 of legitimate protests, breaking into the homes of activists,
 and surveillance. Two human rights activists were detained
 overnight in April during a protest regarding inaction on
 cases arising from the 1989 riots; the media reported that the
 detentions resulted from the holding of an illegal
 demonstration on the grounds of the presidential palace.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 sex.
 The Government recognizes that violence against women,
 including domestic violence such as wife beating, is a
 problem. Due to inadequate statistical data, the true extent
 of such abuse is impossible to gauge. Victims frequently are
 reluctant to report cases or to press charges. In an effort
 to educate women about their rights, the Government
 distributes pamphlets, especially in poor neighborhoods, to
 alert residents to the illegal nature of domestic violence and
 to their legal remedies. While authorities are sensitive to
 the problem, the ineffective Venezuelan justice system offers
 little prospect of effective redress or prevention.
 The Constitution also prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 ethnicity, but there are periodic, credible charges from
 groups representing indigenous populations that the military
 and security forces torture and mistreat indigenous people in
 remote areas of the country. In March representatives of the
 Venezuelan National Indigenous Council reported that National
 Guard officers forced 140 Indians in the Amazonas Federal
 Territory to jump in a river, sleep outside during a rain
 storm, and burn their homes. The Council also reported that
 the Guard stole outboard motors and other belongings. A
 congressional committee investigating the incident concluded
 that the National Guard showed an attitude which "violated the
 most elemental constitutional principles." In May and June, a
 member of the Venezuelan legislature's lower chamber, Carlos
 Azpurua, accused Brazilian miners of invading Venezuela's
 southern territory, contaminating rivers with mercury in the
 process of gold mining, and practicing "genocide" against the
 
 
 VENEZUELA
 indigenous population of the area. Other critics have
 repeated these charges.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 On November 27 a new labor law was enacted, but no
 authoritative text was publicly available by year's end. The
 following description is based on the old law.
 Both constitutional and labor law recognize and encourage the
 right of unions to exist. There are no restrictions on this
 right in practice in either the private sector or the public
 sector (except for the armed forces). The Government's
 positive attitude toward unions reflects the prevailing
 political climate. Unions play a major role in the economy.
 One major union confederation, the Venezuelan Confederation of
 Workers (CTV), and three small ones, as well as a number of
 independent unions, operate freely in Venezuela. About 25
 percent of the national labor force is unionized.
 There are no restrictions on affiliation with international
 labor organizations. The CTV is an active participant in the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, and one of
 the small confederations belongs to the World Confederation of
 Labor (WCL). The WCL's regional organization, the Latin
 American Workers Central, has its headquarters near Caracas,
 and in late 1989 a congress of the WCL was held in Caracas.
 The CTV's top leadership includes members of several political
 parties. The majority are affiliated with the country's
 largest party, AD, and both reciprocally influence each
 other. The CTV, however, has repeatedly demonstrated its
 independence from both the Government, in which AD holds the
 Presidency and a plurality of the seats in the congress, and
 the parties. The clearest example of this independence is the
 CTV's frequent criticism of the Government's economic policies.
 The right of private sector employees and blue-collar public
 workers to strike is recognized legally and upheld in
 practice. White-collar government employees are specifically
 excluded from the protection of the basic labor law, but they
 nevertheless form unions and strike. In recent years
 Venezuelan workers seldom have resorted to strikes, but a
 decline in living standards has increased the willingness of
 workers to resort to them. During 1990 most work stoppages
 occurred among government employees. Port and court workers
 struck briefly because of the Government's alleged failure to
 live up to past promises and went back to work when additional
 funding was found. Some teachers walked out during contract
 negotiations and again afterward to protest the results, but
 finally accepted the contract.
 b.   The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The labor law specifically states that workers will be free
 from all "interferences, prohibitions, subordinations, and
 coercions" in the exercise of their rights to organize unions
 and elect officials. The same legislation states that it is
 the duty of unions to represent their members in negotiations
 for a collective contract, and it also protects employees who
 engage in union activities from reprisals by employers.
 Venezuelan law encourages collective bargaining, which is
 
 
 VENEZUELA
 widely practiced. Before the new labor was passed, only
 blue-collar government employees had the legal rights to
 strike and bargain collectively. White-collar civil servants
 did not have these legal rights but they organized, engaged in
 work stoppages, and threatened to strike, and their
 representatives, including the top negotiaters of the
 Venezuelan Workers Confederation, intervened with ministers in
 mediation efforts. At the end of 1989, 38 percent of public
 and private sector employees were covered by collective
 contracts. Worker rights are not restricted in free trade
 zones either in law or practice. Labor law is enforced by
 Ministry of Labor inspectors and by tripartite
 (labor-management-government) commissions which hear
 complaints regarding dismissals.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no forced or compulsory labor in Venezuela;
 unremunerated labor is prohibited by law. At its 1990 session
 the International Labor Organization's (ILO) Committee of
 Experts reviewed provisions of Venezuela's Penal Code which,
 because of its broad definition of vagrancy, was found not to
 be in conformity with ILO Convention 29 on forced labor. The
 Government was requested to take the necessary measures to
 revise the Penal Code.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Venezuelan law prohibits the employment of children under age
 14, a workday of more than 6 hours for 14- and 15-year-olds,
 and night work or employment at hazardous tasks for those
 under age 18. This law is generally enforced effectively by
 the Ministry of Labor in the formal sector of the economy, but
 much less so in the informal sector, which is growing. It
 appears that more children are working as street vendors, but
 the number is not large in absolute terms.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The nationwide legislated minimum wage for new personnel in
 September 1990 was about $82 monthly, plus mandatory fringe
 benefits that vary with the workers' individual circumstances
 but in general would increase wages by about one-third. It is
 estimated that 40 percent of employed Venezuelans work in the
 informal sector. Although there is no reliable information on
 current wage levels in the informal economy, few full-time
 workers would receive less than the legal minimum wage since
 inflation has reduced its value so much that most would not
 work for less. Because of across-the-board wage increases
 given to the urban private sector in March 1989, and January
 1990, the effective minimum wage for anyone hired before the
 earlier date is about $123 monthly plus benefits. The
 agricultural minimum wage is lower, approximately $51
 monthly. While wages increased significantly in 1990,
 inflation, especially in basic items such as food and
 transportation, offset these gains. The best available
 statistics for the first half of 1990 show unemployment at
 almost 11 percent. The media, academics, and politicians
 frequently state that a large'and growing number of
 Venezuelans--figures in the range of 20-40 percent are
 commonly used--do not receive sufficient income to obtain a
 balanced diet.
 By law, the workweek for blue-collar workers may not exceed 48
 hours plus 2 hours' daily overtime or a maximum of 200 hours
 
 
 809
 VENEZUELA
 overtime per year. The maximum legal workweek for
 white-collar workers is 44 hours. Some unions, such as the
 petroleum workers, have negotiated a 40-hour week. Employees
 must be given a rest period of at least a half-hour after 5
 hours of work. The law is generally observed, with the
 exception of restrictions on overtime. Paid holidays and
 weekly rest days are also provided by law.
 A health and safety law was passed in 1986, but its
 enforcement awaits implementing regulations. Delays in
 implementation are largely due to concern over the fact that
 the law provides penal sanctions against management when
 violations of health and safety occur, and ambiguity in the
 law over what constitutes a violation. Opinions concerning
 the potential effectiveness of this law vary. Some
 businessmen regard the proposed penal sanctions for cases of
 negligence resulting in injury as too harsh, and some labor
 leaders believe that efforts to improve working conditions are
 proceeding too slowly. The Ministry of Labor intends to open
 an Office of Occupational Health and Safety based on the 1986
 law, but had not done so as of year's end.
