 CHILE
 Chile is ruled by a military government which took power in a
 1973 coup. Prior to that time, except for brief periods,
 Chile had elected civilian governments since independence in
 1810, and respect for political and human rights generally
 prevailed. The current Government includes both military and
 civilian officials and operates under the Constitution adopted
 by plebiscite in 1980. The military junta exercises the
 legislative function, and a separate judicial branch carries
 out judicial duties, but primary authority resides with the
 Commanding General of the Army and President, Augusto
 Pinochet. Under the 1980 Constitution, President Pinochet's
 term of office expires in 1989. In late 1988 or early 1989, a
 plebiscite is to be held on a presidential candidate to be
 selected by the commanders-in-chief of the four armed
 services. There are no constitutional restrictions on
 President Pinochet being that candidate. If approved by a
 simple majority in the plebiscite, that candidate would serve
 until 1997. If a majority voted "no," the Constitution calls
 for open and direct presidential elections to be held within
 one year, simultaneously with congressional elections
 scheduled for 1990.
 Civil liberties are provided for in the 1980 Constitution, but
 the Government maintains significant discretionary authority
 to limit them by use of one or more of the five states of
 exception also provided for in the Constitution or its
 transitory articles. On September 7, immediately following an
 assassination attempt against President Pinochet, the
 Government added a third state of exception, the state of
 siege, to the two already in effect. The state of siege and
 its related restrictions were allowed to expire on January 6,
 1987. Concurrently, the Government lifted the late-night
 curfew in effect for most of the last 13 years.
 Many fundamental political freedoms in Chile during 1986 were
 severely restricted. Rights of private property, freedom of
 religion, and minority rights are respected, but freedom of
 association and assembly, freedom from arbitrary arrest and
 exile, and freedom of speech and of the press are limited.
 Human rights conditions are strongly affected by a number of
 factors: the prolonged maintenance of states of exception, the
 lack of major, significant progress toward a return to
 democracy, and terrorist violence such as the unsuccessful
 attack against President Pinochet and the subsequent murders
 of four government opponents associated with the far left.
 Laws establishing a voter registration system and an electoral
 court to supervise the 1989 plebiscite and the 1990
 congressional elections were enacted, and the Government
 publicly promised the promulgation of the law legalizing
 political parties in the first part of 1987. However,
 progress in creating the juridical framework necessary for a
 transition to democratic rule was not fully matched by steps
 to develop a correspondingly free political atmosphere,
 conducive to a successful transition to full democracy.
 Reliable and documented reports of torture and mistreatment of
 those detained by Chilean security forces continue to be
 received by human rights organizations. In addition, members
 of the security and military forces are widely believed to be
 responsible for the many kidnapings, beatings, torture, and,
 in a few cases, murders, carried out against human rights,
 Catholic Church and opposition figures, for which no suspects
 have been identified or apprehended. One army officer is
 
 
 426
 CHILE
 currently under detention for the July burning of a young man
 and woman, an incident which caused the death of the young
 man.
 Extremist groups of the left and right have murdered military
 personnel, police officers and civilians. In addition,
 left-wing groups have bombed buildings and other installations
 identified with the Chilean Government or the United States.
 In August Chilean authorities discovered the largest cache of
 clandestine weapons ever found at one time in Latin America.
 U.S. Government experts who examined the weapons concluded
 that they had most probably been supplied by Cuba, and that
 they were intended for use by the Chilean Communist Party and
 its military wing, the Manuel Rodriquez Patriotic Front
 (FPMR), possibly against a future democratically elected
 government. The FPMR acknowledged having hidden the weapons.
 During 1986 the Government continued to cooperate with the
 Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission (UNHRC). It provided a lengthy statement
 responding to the Special Rapporteur's February report, as
 well as to a resolution adopted in March by the UNHRC. The
 Government increased its cooperation with the International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) by permitting ICRC doctors
 to visit persons held by the National Information Center
 (CNI), the Chilean secret police. In January 1987, The ICRC
 reached a similar agreement with the Investigations Police.
 The Government also established a Commission on Human Rights
 to act in an advisory role to the Ministry of Interior. This
 Commission was charged by President Pinochet in his 1987 New
 Year's speech with reviewing the cases of all exiles on a
 government-maintained list, with an eye toward allowing a
 substantial reduction from the 3,500 now prevented from
 returning to Chile. Of this roughly 3,500, 227 were deemed to
 be immediately able to return to Chile. During 1986 the
 Government had reduced this list slightly, and did not employ
 the administrative power of internal banishment (relegacion)
 used extensively in previous years against government
 opponents.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The number of people killed or injured in acts of violence
 with apparent political motives continued at a high level.
 According to the Vicariate of Solidarity, the human rights
 organization of the Catholic Church, 72 persons died and 409
 were wounded in acts of political violence during 1986. The
 deaths and injuries resulted from both deliberate and random
 actions by security and military forces and by left- and
 right-wing terrorists. The Vicariate said half the deaths
 were caused by government forces. There were at least nine
 deaths caused by right-wing extremists during the year. There
 are persistent allegations that members of the security and
 military forces are tied to right-wing extremists responsible
 for at least some deaths. Left-wing terrorists appear
 responsible for the killing of 15 persons. Of those, 10 were
 security and military force members. According to press
 accounts, 17 persons killed during the year were members of
 terrorist organizations.
 
 
 427
 CHILE
 Some specific instances compiled from official figures, human
 rights organizations, and the press: In January a young woman
 was shot and killed by individuals reported to be from the
 Investigations Police during an incident in which the
 authorities detained several other. In February a policeman
 was killed and 15 others wounded in a bomb attack, probably by
 leftist terrorists, against a police bus. In April a
 storekeeper who had been active in a conservative political
 party was assassinated by left-wing terrorists. In the same
 month, a terrorist ambush resulted in the death of a police
 officer and one of the terrorists. Two persons died when an
 explosion destroyed the house in which they were reportedly
 making bombs. In May a young student in Santiago was shot and
 killed during a confrontation between students and a military
 patrol during a blockade of the entire central part of the
 city by the armed forces. In June a terrorist bomb attack
 against the Santiago metro system left one person dead and
 seven injured.
 In early July, a general strike called by the Civic Assembly,
 an opposition organization, was accompanied by a number of
 violent incidents which resulted in 8 deaths and injuries to
 over 50 persons. Seven of the deaths were caused by gunshot
 wounds, five reportedly fired by military patrols and two by
 unidentified people firing from passing vehicles, a tactic
 frequently attributed to right-wing terrorists. The eighth
 death was that of Rodrigo Rojas de Negri, a 19 year old U.S.
 resident of Chilean origin. According to the attorney for the
 family, Rojas was carrying Molotov cocktails in company with
 other youths who intended to set fire to a street barricade to
 block traffic on a major Santiago thoroughfare. Eyewitnesses
 said the group was stopped by a military patrol and that Rojas
 and Carmen Quintana were deliberately beaten and set on fire
 by members of the patrol. The youths were left in a deserted
 area but made their way to a hospital after several hours.
 Rojas died 4 days later; Quintana is recuperating from her
 severe burns in Canada. A military court is presently
 investigating the case, and the army lieutenant who commanded
 the patrol is under arrest, charged with using unnecessary
 violence resulting in death. Other members of the 25-man
 patrol have not been charged with any violations of the law.
 Some witnesses and attorneys involved in the case have claimed
 harassment on the part of the Government. One witness, who
 has admitted carrying a Molotov cocktail on the day of the
 incident, was arrested in August and released on bail in
 January.
 Left-wing terrorists attempted to assassinate President
 Pinochet on September 7 in an ambush which resulted in the
 deaths of 5 of the President's bodyguards and the wounding of
 10 others. This act led to the proclamation of a state of
 siege in Chile. A number of people have been detained in
 connection with the attempt.
 Within 48 hours of the attack on President Pinochet, four
 persons who had ties with either the Communist Party or other
 extreme left groups, were killed by unidentified gunmen. An
 extreme right-wing group calling itself the September 11
 Command claimed responsibility for these murders, stating that
 they were in retaliation for those killed in the assassination
 attempt. A judicial investigation was initiated. No suspects
 have been identified.
 In November two men were killed in a clash with police after
 robbing a bank in a small town near Santiago; a police officer
 
 
 428
 CHILE
 was also killed in the gunfight. Police claim that one of the
 individuals was a top leader of the terrorist Movement of the
 Revolutionary Left (MIR).
 In December one person was killed in a shootout following the
 explosion of a dynamite charge thrown at CNI headquarters. A
 pregnant woman and her unborn child died in December of wounds
 received in an attack on a public bus.
 During 1986 the two major left-wing terrorist organizations in
 Chile, the Communist Party's FPMR and the MIR, significantly
 stepped up their efforts to promote a violent overthrow of the
 Government. There is considerable evidence of Soviet, Cuban,
 Nicaraguan, Libyan, and East European training and other
 support for these two groups. Several large weapons caches
 were discovered in August, containing over 3,000 automatic
 rifles, more than 100 rocket-propelled grenades, some 100
 light anti-tank weapons, millions of rounds of ammunition, and
 tons of explosives.
 U.S. Government experts determined that the arms cache was
 most likely provided to the FPMR by Cuba. Other sources have
 indicated that Cuban officials have acknowledged their role in
 private conversations. Weapons similar to those found in the
 arms caches were used in the September attempt on President
 Pinochet's life. FPMR spokesmen have announced they will
 continue efforts to kill the President.
 It is believed the bulk of these weapons may have been meant
 for use against a future democratic government in Chile, as
 well as against the present Government. FPMR spokesmen have
 said publicly that they will not necessarily lay down their
 weapons once an elected government is in place. The smuggling
 of huge amounts of war materiel into Chile by the Communist
 Party influenced the moderate opposition's decision to refuse
 to participate with the Communists in demonstrations in
 September.
 As noted, right-wing terrorist groups caused a number of
 deaths and injuries in 1986. Three such groups are the
 Chilean Anti-Communist Action (ACHA), the September 11
 Command, and a nebulous movement called the Armaggedon
 Rightist Group. There are allegations that members of the
 security and military forces may be involved in some of these
 terrorist organizations.
 A law enacted in late December absolves members of the
 Investigations Police who use their weapons to repulse
 violence or overcome any resistance to authority. Human
 rights organizations find the wording of this law extremely
 vague, and fear it could be used to justify unnecessary
 violence against those attempting peacefully to express their
 opposition to the Government.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no substantiated reports of disappearances during
 1986. A number of reports were filed by family members
 concerning persons who disappeared after being picked up by
 unidentified persons, but all were later accounted for as
 detained by security forces.
 
 
 CHILE
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture and police brutality continued to be serious
 problems. There were no reported deaths in 1986 as a result
 of mistreatment while in custody of the authorities, compared
 with four such cases in 1985. However, there were 109
 individual cases of torture reported by the Vicariate of
 Solidarity. This compares with a total of 84 cases in 1985
 and 84 in 1984. These are cases in which the victims have
 filed formal complaints.
 The Constitution prohibits "use of illegal pressure" and
 'guarantees to all persons the right to life and to the
 physical and psychological integrity of the individual."
 Government officials deny that the use of torture is
 authorized and note that members of the uniformed services are
 being investigated by the civilian and military judicial
 systems for their possible involvement in cases of alleged
 mistreatment. The Supreme Court instructed all courts in
 January to give special attention to cases in which charges of
 torture or illegal detention might be involved. A number of
 cases of mistreatment reportedly continue under investigation
 by the courts.
 Most reports of torture state that the victims were subjected
 to beatings, electric shocks, or threats, particularly during
 the first days of detention. In September a victim was
 examined by a police doctor who found marks indicating the
 prisoner had been tortured during detention by the CNI.
 Government officials claim that all registered complaints of
 abuse or torture by the authorities are investigated, and that
 officials involved are brought to justice. The Government
 cites as an example a case in January in which three
 detectives were given suspended 3-year sentences for the
 death of a young man they had detained in 1985. The
 Government is appealing, seeking a stronger sentence. Human
 rights groups assert, however, that many complaints are not
 actively investigated. Secret court proceedings often make it
 impossible either to verify which cases involving torture
 charges may be under active investigation or the stage of such
 investigations.
 The Government agreed to permit visits by ICRC doctors to
 persons held in CNI and Investigations Police detention
 centers. Most instances of torture are alleged to occur while
 persons are-detained by the CNI.
 There also continued to be reports of people being kidnaped or
 detained for short periods by unknown individuals. Often
 these people have been physically abused while being held.
 There were 662 reports of threats against individuals in 1986,
 as compared to a total of 564 in 1985, 402 in 1984, and 212 in
 1983. These include violent kidnapings, personal
 confrontations in the streets, unauthorized, often violent
 searches of homes or offices by persons who refuse to identify
 themselves, and telephone threats. As in the past years, most
 victims have been students, professional people, political
 activists, journalists, trade unionists, social workers and
 their relatives, and employees. Most kidnapings appear to be
 attempts to intimidate those involved in human rights
 organizations, labor unions, church-based community
 organizations, or political activities. There have been no
 known arrests or prosecutions in any of these cases.
 
 
 430
 CHILE
 Reports of incidents of deliberate and random police brutality
 continued to be heard, particularly from persons detained
 during protest demonstrations or on other political grounds.
 Human rights activists have noted, however, that the actions
 of the police attempting to control crowds improved in 1986,
 with considerably less violence being used to disperse
 unauthorized demonstrations. In contrast, there was a marked
 increase during the year in the use of army personnel in crowd
 control, beginning in March, when a series of demonstrations
 began under the sponsorship of the political opposition.
 Young troops wearing battle dress and black face paint became
 a symbol for government reaction to protest activities. Some
 of the deaths resulting from demonstrations were reportedly
 caused by these troops. This practice was not in evidence in
 the latter half of the year.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arbitrary arrests and detentions showed a marked increase in
 1986. Before the state of siege was invoked in September, the
 Government had conducted massive sweeps, or police roundups,
 in the poorer areas in and around large urban centers. These
 sweeps involved brief detentions of thousands of persons,
 although only eight persons were eventually charged with
 violations of law. In these sweeps, army troops were used to
 surround and seal off the area and to conduct house-to-house
 searches. Such sweeps were also carried out under the state
 of siege following the Pinochet assassination attempt, but
 army troops were not used in the house-to-house searches,
 which were conducted by the police.
 The Constitution provides that search warrants be issued by
 either a civilian or military court for specific locations.
 Challenges by human rights groups in June to the legality of
 massive searches of private homes were rejected by the Supreme
 Court, which held that a single order by a military judge to
 search a given area was sufficient to permit searches of all
 the houses in that area. According to witnesses, search
 warrants were not shown during the sweeps.
 These operations were justified by the Government as a
 response to complaints by residents in these areas over a
 drastic increase in common crime. According to residents,
 robberies, rapes, assaults, drug abuse, and other crimes are
 commonplace. There have also been complaints of an increase
 in the use of weapons by criminals. While these complaints
 are well-founded, few criminals were actually apprehended
 during the sweeps. Those detained were generally released
 within a matter of days for lack of evidence.
 Aside from sweep operations, the Government also briefly
 detained 7,019 people in 1986. This compares to 5,314 in 1985
 and 5,261 in 1984, and includes both individual and group
 arrests. Most of those detained in large demonstrations were
 generally released once their identity was established, but
 during 1986 there was a noticeable increase in the number of
 people detained for longer periods of time. Of the 7,019
 people detained in 1986, 555 were eventually charged before
 the courts. Of these, 36 were charged for terrorist
 activities.
 Transitory Article 24 of the Constitution--under which the
 Government may order detention for 5 days without affording
 detainees the right to a judicial hearing, or for as much as
 20 days in cases where terrorist acts were involved--was in
 
 
 431
 CHILE
 effect throughout 1986. Prisoners were often held
 incommunicado during the initial period of investigation.
 Once formal charges are issued and cases brought before the
 court system, defendants are allowed a lawyer of their own
 choosing; lawyers affiliated with human rights organizations
 are made readily available by those groups without charge.
 Many of those detained under this article are never charged
 and are released after several days of detention.
 While the state of siege was in effect, the Ministry of
 Interior could order detention without charges. Under these
 powers, 46 people were detained in Santiago for varying
 periods of time. All have since been released. Unlike
 previous states of siege, there were no massive arrests
 without charges nor the establishment of special facilities to
 hold those detained.
 The Government also used the various security laws to detain
 people for prolonged periods of time while their reported
 roles in protest activities were investigated. It detained
 the leaders of the opposition Civic Assembly group for over 40
 days following the July 2-3 general strike. Similarly, two
 employees of the Vicariate of Solidarity and three doctors
 from a private clinic were detained for over 60 days for
 investigation of their role in treating and aiding a reported
 terrorist. Two doctors, one a Vicariate employee rearrested
 in December, remain under detention in this case, charged with
 violation of the antiterrorist law. Under Chilean law a judge
 investigating a violation of the law has the obligation to
 order the detention of anyone the evidence shows might have
 been involved in the violation. Human rights groups claim
 some of these detentions appeared to have been designed more
 to intimidate various opposition political groups or human
 rights organizations than to maintain law and order.
 Persons officially charged with or convicted of violations of
 internal security laws continue to be imprisoned with common
 criminals. Attacks by common criminals against these
 prisoners have generated demands for separate detention
 facilities for those held on security grounds. They have
 rights to visitation and communication with their families,
 friends, legal counsel, and representatives of the ICRC.
 These rights are subject to the limitations of Transitory
 Article 24 of the Constitution, which allows for restriction
 of visitation rights in the first days of detention, before
 prisoners are remanded to the court system. The ICRC,
 however, now has access to most of those detained, as set out
 in its agreements with the CNI and Investigations Police.
 Some opposition figures were detained during the year on
 charges of insulting or libeling the President, the Supreme
 Court, and/or the military institutions. These charges were
 generally brought before the civilian courts under various
 laws, and defendants were jailed for varying periods of time
 while the charges were investigated. A libel suit by
 opposition political leaders against President Pinochet was
 rejected by an appeals court on the grounds that the
 President's words were "an act of administration," and as such
 could not be covered by an ordinary tribunal. This decision
 has been appealed to the Supreme Court.
 Those detained on charges of libel and other nonviolent acts
 were usually released on bail after a few days or weeks in
 prison. Often the bail set for their release was minimal,
 
 
 432
 CHILE
 reinforcing the perception that their detention was
 politically motivated.
 The Government during 1986 slightly reduced the number of
 Chileans prohibited from returning to Chile. The official
 list of exiles at the end of 1986 contained 3,507 names,
 marginally down from 3,848 at the end of 1985. However, in
 January the Government committed itself to a rapid review of
 all exiles on the list with a view to allowing most of them
 back into the country; 227 were allowed to return
 immediately. Human rights organizations state, however, that
 there is another list of Chileans banned from returning
 because they took out citizenship in other countries during
 their prolonged exile.
 In 1986 no additional Chileans were exiled. There were a few
 instances of prisoners convicted of violations of the security
 laws being permitted to leave the country in lieu of serving
 their sentences; persons taking shelter in foreign embassies
 following threats were allowed to leave Chile.
 With a single exception, the Government did not use the
 administrative powers available to it under either the state
 of siege or Transitory Article 24 to send people into internal
 banishment. This was a positive change from previous
 practice; in 1985, 168 persons suffered this administrative
 punishment. One person was sentenced in June to 400 days in
 internal banishment after being found guilty of distributing
 pamphlets near a military base.
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited in Chile, and there
 have been no complaints on this issue since the mid-1970s.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial remains limited by Transitory
 Article 24 and, while it was in effect, the state of siege.
 While first-instance jurisdiction for the prosecution of
 proscribed political activities remains with the regular
 civilian courts, broader interpretation of the various
 security laws has allowed the military courts to handle more
 of these cases. As in most civil law systems, trial is not by
 jury, reliance is on the written record rather than oral
 testimony, and the judge directs the investigation, finally
 deciding innocence or guilt. The investigation phase is
 considered secret, with limited access to evidence or
 testimony developed by the judge. Secrecy of the
 investigation makes it extremely difficult to learn whether or
 not justice is being done. There is a well developed
 multi-stage appeal process leading ultimately to the Supreme
 Court.
 While there have been few charges that opposition figures have
 been convicted as a result of unfair trials, there were
 increased charges in 1986 that judges failed to investigate
 vigorously charges of government abuses of human rights.
 There were also charges that those few judges who attempted to
 carry out their responsibilities in an independent manner were
 open to censure by other judges. An example in August was one
 judge, investigating the 1976 disappearance of 10 persons, who
 ordered the detention of 40 people for investigation of their
 possible involvement; he was suspended for 2 months on half
 pay by the Supreme Court for failing to obey the decision of
 an appeals court that the defendants were covered by a 1978
 
 
 433
 CHILE
 amnesty law. The Supreme Court further ordered the release of
 all those detained in the case.
 Weapons violations, often the basis of charges against
 terrorists, are tried before a military court. Appeals may be
 made to a military court of two civilian judges and three
 professional military judges, and, in the last resort, to the
 Supreme Court. Human rights groups have complained that
 military courts have assumed a greater role in trying cases
 previously decided in the civilian court system.
 In general, there were few indications in 1986 that the
 judicial system, although nominally independent, was prepared
 to take a vigorous stance in the investigation of charges of
 past or current human rights abuses by government security
 forces. The decision by a civilian judge to charge with
 simple misdemeanor the officer commanding the military patrol
 involved in the burning of two young people on July 2 caused a
 furor in the Chilean legal community. A later decision by the
 five-man military court to upgrade the charge to a more
 serious crime was, in turn, greeted favorably by human rights
 organizations.
 There continue to be reports of the failure of the security
 forces to cooperate with judges investigating human rights
 violations. In September, after the assassination attempt
 against the President, the CNI refused to comply with various
 court orders to allow some detainees to see their families or
 to allow them to appear before the courts. Despite these
 refusals, the courts took no actions against the CNI. In
 October the Court of Appeals in Santiago ruled that the state
 of siege did not permit the incommunicado detention of
 persons, although other legislation does allow it. In
 another instance, the Court of Appeals in Valdivia ordered a
 military judge to initiate a charge of contempt against the
 CNI for failing to comply with court orders to bring before
 the court 18 people who had been detained. The Court further
 denounced the CNI for providing contradictory information, and
 for using delaying tactics to avoid obeying court orders.
 According to human rights groups, this case is unique in that
 the court took action to attempt to force the CNI to comply
 with court orders, whereas in most instances the courts simply
 fail to follow up when their requests are denied or ignored by
 the security forces.
 In recognition of the seriousness of this problem, President
 Pinochet sent a letter in October to the Supreme Court in
 which he indicated that the CNI was once again being ordered
 to comply with court orders to deliver detainees to the
 courts, and to provide them with protection when ordered by
 the courts. The President further ordered the Ministries of
 Interior and Defense to instruct the security forces under
 their control to obey the requests and orders of the courts.
 In December, however, a Santiago appeals court complained that
 the CNI refused to make a detainee available to the court, and
 further refused to allow a civilian judge to interview the
 detainee personally.
 The Government maintains that there are no political prisoners
 in Chile, and that all those so labeled by human rights groups
 are persons who have been charged and/or convicted of common
 crimes such as murder, robbery, bombing, and possession of
 arms. Vicariate of Solidarity records indicate that there
 were 418 persons in prison at the end of 1986 whom the
 Vicariate labeled political prisoners. This figure did not
 
 
 434
 CHILE
 distinguish between those charged for violent actions and
 others who have not committed acts of violence. Of the 418,
 355 were jailed awaiting trial on various charges of violating
 state security and arms control laws, and 63 were serving
 sentences after being found guilty of such crimes. The crimes
 involved in these cases included robbery with violence,
 murder, use of explosives, belonging to terrorist groups,
 kidnapings, illegal possession of arms and ammunition,
 sabotage, falsification of documents, and assaults against
 security forces or public installations. In some of these
 cases individuals were held under suspicion of violating state
 security laws although they were not charged with specific
 acts of violence.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Searches of the home and interception of private
 communications are permitted by the Constitution, provided
 that search warrants are issued by either a civilian or
 military court for specific locations.  The 1984 antiterrorist
 law provided legal authority for surveillance of those
 promoting political views contrary to the Constitution, for
 interception, opening or recording of private communications
 and documents, and for surveillance of individuals suspected
 of terrorist crimes. In 1986 a Supreme Court decision allowed
 mass searches of homes based on a single warrant issued by a
 military judge. There were also numerous reports of security
 forces carrying out searches of offices and homes without
 complying with legal requirements. A significant number of
 these searches were carried out in the early hours of the
 morning, often with force and violence. At the beginning of
 the state of siege in September,. the general level of popular
 fear was increased by the failure of security forces to
 identify themselves or to show search warrants, particularly
 after the violent deaths of four people who were taken from
 their homes during the first 48 hours of the state of siege.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees these freedom. There are no
 constitutional provisions for official censorship although new
 periodicals must have government approval to begin
 operations.
 Nevertheless, the Government exercises considerable control
 over the media. Since 1973 the Government has formally and
 informally advised the press, radio, and television of norms
 for covering domestic developments, and self-censorship is
 practiced by the media. Several major media enterprises are
 seriously in debt to government financial institutions, a
 situation which provides the Government with further influence
 over news and editorial content.
 The National Directorate of Social Communication (DINACOS)
 frequently makes suggestions and requests to the media in
 areas ranging from editorial matter to personnel recruitment.
 Television in Chile is the medium most tightly controlled by
 the Government, which itself directly operates one network.
 The other television stations, operated by the University of
 Chile, Catholic University of Chile and the Catholic
 University of Valparaiso, receive guidance from DINACOS.
 Program planning also is influenced by self-censorship by the
 
 
 435
 CHILE
 stations. Opposition leaders state that they are unable to
 present their views on television. The daily press, operating
 under DINACOS guidance, provides coverage of some statements
 and activities of the political opposition. Opposition
 magazines, while often quite outspoken in their coverage and
 commentaries, face the threat of harassment, legal and
 otherwise. Radio is subject to the same pressures.
 During the first 6 months of 1986, media restrictions were
 relatively relaxed and there were several positive
 developments.took place. In March the Government issued a
 decree removing restrictions on media reporting of the
 activities of political parties. Restrictions remained,
 however, on the coverage of events described by Chilean law as
 "terrorist acts," "activities promoting violence (or a)
 totalitarian concept of society," or of acts described by law
 as inciting or provoking demonstrations that might alter
 public order. Also proscribed are criticisms of the President
 and the armed forces. In June the Government issued a decree
 authorizing a new daily newspaper associated with the
 democratic opposition to begin publication in March 1987. One
 negative develoment was the arrest in March of the foreign
 editor of Analisis, Fernando Paulson, on charges of slandering
 the armed forces.
 The situation changed sharply at midyear with the calling of a
 national strike. From July 2 to 7, four Santiago radio
 stations were restricted to broadcasting only advertisements,
 official information and music. On July 3, the Interior
 Ministry filed two legal charges against the leftist
 opposition newsweeklies Analisis and Cauce. Several Analisis
 staff members were charged with "calumny against the
 President" and "incitement to violence." Later, editor Juan
 Pablo Cardenas was detained for a month, charged with defaming
 the President. On September 1, the Government confiscated an
 issue of the magazine, at the same time suspending its
 publication for 3 weeks. Analisis was one of the six
 opposition publications and two international wire services
 suspended under the state of siege. Jose Carrasco,
 international affairs editor of Analisis and a member of the
 MIR, was subsequently kidnaped and murdered by suspected
 right-wing extremists. Since then, several journalists of the
 magazine reportedly received death threats.
 Warrants were issued against some journalists following the
 declaration of the state of siege and a few fled the country.
 Reported telephone death threats were received by APSI
 reporter Jorge Andres Richards and radio reporter Carlos Tobar
 Leyton. Cauce editor Gonzalo Figueroa was jailed for alleged
 offenses against the Chilean armed forces, but was later freed
 on bail by a military tribunal.
 State of siege media regulations ended on January 6, 1987.
 While freedom of speech is normally respected for private
 conversation in Chile, human rights groups assert that the
 Government conducts extensive monitoring of mail and
 telephonic communications.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Restrictions on peaceful assembly and association were
 tightened in early 1986 by the issuance of a military edict
 prohibiting political meetings in public or private places in
 Santiago without prior permission from the chief of the
 
 
 436
 CHILE
 military zone. Meetings in privately owned buildings such as
 theaters had previously been permitted, as when organizations
 met in March to form the Civic Assembly. The states of
 exception in force have for 13 years severely restricted those
 seeking to redress grievances against the Government by means
 of peaceful demonstrations or public meetings. Leaders of
 opposition groups were arrested for holding, instigating, or
 organizing unauthorized demonstrations. The states of
 exception generally have not interfered with other activities,
 including elections, of most labor unions and professional
 associations.
 Permission to hold public rallies must be sought from the
 authorities at least 5 days in advance and may be obtained
 only by those organizations or groups which have legal
 status. Political parties and some national trade union
 organizations are not now authorized under the law, and are
 unable to obtain status. Those who organize or call for
 unauthorized demonstrations are subject to arrest and
 prosecution, as in the case of the leaders of the Civic
 Assembly in July. These leaders were detained for varying
 periods of time, some up to 43 days, and then released
 provisionally pending the results of a judicial investigation.
 The Government authorized no public rallies or demonstrations
 by the political opposition in 1986 in metropolitan Santiago,
 which has 38 percent of the nation's population. The granting
 of permission to hold meetings in enclosed buildings has
 varied, with some meetings being approved and others not. The
 Government refused to permit the Chilean Human Rights
 Commission to hold a meeting marking International Human
 Rights Day on December 10 in a rented theater; the meeting was
 held in the Commission's own small offices, thereby limiting
 participation.
 Legally recognized unions do not need permission to hold union
 meetings or conferences, and collective bargaining, strikes,
 and internal union elections are carried out freely and
 openly. Under the state of siege, unions needed prior
 approval for meetings, and permission varied from locality to
 locality; the vast majority had no difficulty obtaining
 permits. Unions have faced other legal difficulties,
 however. The Government took legal action against the January
 national conference of the Confederation of Copper Workers for
 electing leaders who did not meet the legal requirements for
 holding union office. The courts ordered union offices and
 assets placed in escrow, and prohibited the elected officials
 from carrying out any union duties until questions over their
 eligibility were clarified. Following 9 months of stalemate,
 the union officials resigned. Several other unions had their
 offices searched during the annual labor day celebration.
 There were also continued reports of individual labor leaders
 being dismissed from their jobs under circumstances suggesting
 the firings were due to their criticism of management or of
 the Government.
 Labor leaders, including those with close ties to the
 Government, continued to voice complaints concerning the
 decree-laws known as the "Labor Plan." They say the law
 places severe restrictions on collective bargaining and the
 right to strike and on the development of national union
 confederations. Strikes are prohibited in designated
 strategic enterprises, primarily the public utilities, the
 largest government copper mine, and the petroleum industry.
 
 
 CHILE
 In 1986 the Government substantially reduced the number of
 enterprises designated strategic.
 The Government enacted legislation to reestablish the labor
 court system, but the lack of necessary infrastructure has
 delayed these courts from actually beginning their work.
 Industrial relations analysts and trade union leaders, while
 welcoming the legislation, have been critical that it did not
 reinstate the same number of courts as had previously existed,
 and because the courts will be given jurisdiction over subject
 areas which had not previously been covered.
 Labor unions maintain relations with international labor
 bodies in their fields. Chilean worker delegates
 participating in conferences of the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) have had their credentials challenged in
 the past, but in 1986 the Government sought to avoid this
 challenge by seeking to consult with representative trade
 unions in Chile. In 1986 a number of complaints were filed in
 the ILO against the Government concerning violations relating
 to freedom of association, employment, and freedom of
 expression.
 Organized labor continued to press for a full investigation of
 the 1982 murder of labor leader Tucapel Jimenez. In August,
 the Supreme Court rejected an appeal for a reversal of the
 investigating judge's decision to declare the case closed.
 Family members and trade union leaders have since requested
 that another judge be assigned to investigate the murder.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution guarantees absolute freedom of religion.
 Although Chile is predominantly Roman Catholic, there are no
 restrictions on religious practices and no official
 discrimination against any religious group. A number of
 Protestant denominations and other groups are active and
 report full freedom and tolerance, as does the Jewish
 community. Religious belief and adherence appear to have no
 effect on acceptability for government positions in Chile.
 Despite this, there were at least 17 bombings against the
 Mormon Church, with left-wing terrorist groups claiming
 responsibility. In addition, there were a number of attacks
 against the property and officials of the Catholic Church.
 Shots fired at the Bishop of Osorno and at the vehicle of the
 Bishop of Temuco; there were threats against the Bishop of
 Concepcion. Lay workers for the Catholic Church are also
 often the victims of intimidation and threats, particularly
 those working in the poorer neighborhoods. In another
 incident, three French Catholic priests were expelled from
 Chile shortly after the state of siege was imposed; the
 Government accused them of "meddling" in domestic Chilean
 affairs. Other clergymen were briefly detained and two
 American priests had their residence permits limited to
 renewable short-term stays.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Chileans have full constitutional freedom to move within and
 to enter and leave their country. Exceptions are exiles who
 are prohibited from returning to Chile; as noted, the
 Government in early 1987 announced an initiative to reduce
 this number. As many as I million Chileans live abroad,
 
 
 438
 CHILE
 principally for economic reasons. Most current emigrants seem
 to be motivated by economic rather than political factors, and
 no impediments have been placed on their return.
 International organizations dealing with migrants believe the
 volume of skilled and unskilled workers returning to Chile now
 roughly equals the number leaving. The UNHCR and other
 organizations assisted in the repatriation of 393 individuals.
 President Pinochet in September said there was need for a
 census of all former exiles because of their possible
 involvement in the attempt on his life. The remark caused
 widespread concern within the human rights community over the
 safety of repatriates. The UNHCR expressed concern at the
 President's remarks. No specific actions have been taken by
 the Government to undertake a census of the former exiles.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government.
 Under the Constitution, a plebiscite is to be held before
 March 1989 to accept or reject a candidate for president to be
 chosen by the four commanders-in-chief of the armed services
 and police. If approved, the candidate will serve until 1997;
 if rejected, there will be open presidential elections one
 year later. Congressional elections are scheduled no later
 than early 1990. Once a congress takes office in 1990, the
 military junta will be abolished. Until then, the junta
 exercises legislative authority, subject to presidential
 approval.
 The Government is pledged to carry out the provisions of the
 Constitution. In 1986 it established the national electoral
 registry to have voter lists ready for the 1989 plebiscite and
 the congressional elections in 1990. The Government also
 promised to approve a law by March 1987 which will allow
 political parties to reorganize and legally conduct their
 activities. Until now, the democratic political parties have
 operated openly but without a legal basis for doing so, and
 without benefit of'such rights as freedom of assembly. They
 and their leaders, therefore, are vulnerable to potential
 prosecution or other government harassment.
 The compilation of new voter registration rolls is likely to
 be time consuming due to the largely manual procedure that has
 been selected and it is therefore improbable that they will be
 ready before 1988. The opposition has complained that this
 virtually forecloses any possibility of modifying the
 Constitution until mid-1988, when it can be done only by
 national plebiscite at the request of President Pinochet.
 This would reduce the possibility of replacing the
 presidential plebiscite with an open presidential election, a
 reform advocated even by some groups now supporting the
 Government. While reestablishment of voter registries
 constitutes progress in creating the legal framework necessary
 for a transition to democratic rule, this progress was not
 matched by steps to develop a correspondingly free political
 atmosphere conducive to a successful transition to full
 democracy, such as open access to the media and freedom of
 assembly.
 The political opposition rejects significant elements of the
 1980 Constitution, including its provisions relating to
 presidential and congressional elections, the powers of the
 presidency and the military, and restrictions on civil
 liberties, among others. Democratic opposition parties want
 
 
 439
 CHILE
 the Constitution revised or replaced in a process of
 negotiations with the armed forces. The Communist Party, one
 faction of the Socialist Party, and the MIR seek the complete
 overthrow of the Government and the establishment of a
 Marxist-Leninist regime.
 Eleven democratic opposition groups organized in a loose
 coalition signed a "National Accord for the Transition to Full
 Democracy" in 1985. The document called for an orderly
 transition to democratic rule through the immediate
 restoration of political rights, free elections for president
 and congress, and a means to amend the Constitution. The
 Government rejected the National Accord and refused to meet
 with its representatives. In October 1986, however, three
 Junta members publicly noted their willingness to begin
 conversations with the opposition. The Government, in
 discussions offered as distinct from those conducted by the
 Junta members, also offered to discuss the prospective
 political parties law with those parties meeting certain
 criteria. Most National Accord parties declined to
 participate in these discussions because of their limited
 focus. In November several meetings between junta members and
 spokesmen for the opposition took place.
 During the first half of 1986, some of the parties in the
 National Accord promoted strikes and demonstrations to
 convince the armed forces of the need to negotiate a return to
 democratic rule. Simultaneously, leftist extremists mounted
 an intensified campaign of bombings, killings, slum riots, and
 other terrorist tactics designed to polarize Chile into two
 armed camps and destroy any possibility for a peaceful
 democratic transition. The Government reacted to the
 violence, and to peaceful demonstrations as well, with
 repression.
 Due to the restrictions on civil liberties, overt organizing
 by the political opposition was largely confined to the
 university campuses and professional associations. Elections
 for student federation leaders, labor and professional
 association officials, and faculty deans in some universities
 were mostly won by the opposition. Demonstrations by students
 and strikes by professionals were frequent during 1986, and
 confrontations often broke out with security forces.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government cooperated with the UNHCR's Special Rapporteur
 and provided a detailed reply to the Special Rapporteur's
 March report on the human rights situation in Chile. While
 critical of the methods used in gathering information and of
 what it felt was inadequate attention to information it had
 supplied, the Government has nevertheless said that it will
 continue to cooperate with the Special Rapporteur and approved
 a second visit by him to take place in early 1987.
 The Government refused to cooperate with the Inter-American
 Human Rights Commission, and denied it permission to enter
 Chile. In September a government spokesman stated that the
 Government has made numerous attempts to establish a climate
 of cooperation, but charged that the Commission's reports on
 Chile are unbalanced and distorted. A statement by the
 Commission on the September state of siege was rejected by the
 Government; it said the Commission failed to mention that the
 
 
 440
 CHILE
 state of siege was precipitated by the assassination attempt
 against President Pinochet, the discoveries of large arms
 caches, and other terrorist activity.
 The Government has broadened its cooperation with the ICRC.
 On January 2, 1987, the Investigations Police of Chile and the
 ICRC reached an agreement granting the ICRC access to
 prisoners held by that branch of the Chilean security forces.
 The agreement limits interviews to persons detained for more
 than 24 hours, "with the sole object of determining their
 state of health." The agreement follows an earlier 1986
 understanding permitting ICRC access to prisoners detained by
 the CNI in its detention centers.
 Visits and investigations by private international human
 rights groups continued to be allowed by the Government.
 There was, however, a change in the Government's policy
 regarding access to prisoners for several months; for example,
 the leaders of the Civic Assembly who were held during most of
 July and August were not allowed visits without written
 government authorization which was usually granted. This
 policy, however, was not strictly enforced.
 Amnesty International visited Chile during 1986 and issued a
 report in September covering alleged illegal practices of the
 security forces. The Government charged the report lacked
 objectivity, and asserted that members of the security forces
 found guilty of abuses are punished, according to the law.
 tIn June the Government established a Human Rights Commission
 to serve as an advisory body to the Ministry of Interior. The
 six-man Commission is to review terrorist actions which result
 in deaths or injuries, torture cases, and arbitrary
 detentions. It is authorized to propose social and economic
 remedies to the victims of terrorism, torture, and arbitrary
 detentions, and to propose measures to prevent the recurrence
 of such abuses. While the Ministry of Interior is responsible
 for providing administrative and technical assistance, members
 of the Commission maintain that their work is completely
 independent of the Government. The Commission visited the
 site of an ongoing sweep by security forces in July, and
 reported that it had received no complaints from the residents
 affected, though residents may have been wary of speaking in
 the presence of security forces. The Commission was also
 charged by the Government with recommending a substantial
 reduction in the exile list within the first 90 days of 1987.
 Nongovernmental human rights organizations note that
 government investigations of human rights complaints rarely
 lead to fixing responsibility for violations. They also note
 that very few members of the security forces have been
 punished, despite the large number of documented abuses
 brought to light.
 The Catholic Church continues to take the lead in defending
 human rights. It supplies legal counsel to those accused of
 politically related crimes and to victims of human rights
 abuses. Its Vicariate of Solidarity monitors the human rights
 situation throughout Chile, has issued factual monthly reports
 on human rights violations, and has protected and defended
 significant numbers of people over the years.
 The Church's activities cause high tension between the
 Government and the Church hierarchy. Public attempts to
 vilify the Vicariate of Solidarity and individual members of
 
 
 441
 CHILE
 its staff, particularly relating its human rights work to
 Communist efforts to destabilize the Government, appear to be
 condoned by the Government.
 The Vicariate was the target of a major investigation during
 the year. The investigation expanded into what appeared to be
 a broader probe of all Vicariate activities. The Executive
 secretary of the Vicariate sought police protection after
 receiving a series of death threats, and a policeman assigned
 to guard his home was shot and seriously wounded in September
 4 by two unidentified youths. In addition, two Vicariate
 lawyers representing the families of the two youths burned in
 July also received threats. These actions appear to be the
 work of right-wing terrorists such as the ACHA and
 Armageddon. Human rights groups assert that government
 security forces, or persons associated with these forces, may
 be responsible for at least some of these assaults or for
 providing varying degrees of protection to these right-wing
 terrorists.
 The Chilean Commission for Human Rights, a private
 organization directed by opposition political figures, also
 continued to publicize abuses and speak out against them. The
 Commission is affiliated with international human rights
 groups, has hosted visits by these groups to Chile, and has
 received international recognition. The Commission promotes
 major changes in the nature of the Government. Officials of
 the Commission, members of their families, and their
 employees, were targets of threats and other forms of
 intimidation during the year. They are particularly concerned
 by the statement made by President Pinochet that those
 involved in human rights and similar work should be expelled
 from the country or jailed.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Minority groups do not suffer from any specific legal
 discrimination. The only significant minority group, the
 Mapuche Indians in southern Chile, remains separated from the
 rest of the society due to historical, cultural, educational,
 and geographic factors rather than official policy.
 Legal distinctions between the sexes still exist. The legal
 retirement age for women is 5 years lower than that for men.
 Married women may not conduct major commercial transactions
 unless a separation of goods contract is established at the
 time of the marriage, or through a subsequent special one-time
 authorization. Married women may not take children out of the
 country without the permission of the father. Inheritance
 laws provide strong protection for wives and favor female over
 male heirs. Women now enjoy greater access to education and
 employment than in the past, although their average salaries
 for similar work are lower than for men, In 1983 women made
 up 48.8 percent of the primary school enrollment, 50.5 percent
 of secondary school pupils and 40 percent of university
 students. Women have served in such important government
 positions as mayors, agency heads and ministers, although none
 is currently in the cabinet. Women enjoy good access to
 entry-level and mid-level professional jobs but do not hold a
 proportional number of upper-level positions.
 
 
 442
 CHILE
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Child labor is regulated by law. Young people between the
 ages of 14 and 15 may be employed only with the permission of
 their parents or guardians and if they have completed their
 schooling, and then only in restricted types of labor. Those
 between the ages of 15 and 18 can be employed in a larger
 variety of labor, and at expanded hours, but only with their
 parents' or guardians' permission. Economic factors have
 forced many children to seek part-time and full-time
 employment in areas of the economy which are generally
 difficult to regulate.
 Minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational safety and
 health are regulated by law. The law permits the hiring of
 apprentices, but has been revised so that a "less than
 minimum" wage may not be paid. The laws covering child labor
 are not abused, but supervision over the compliance of these
 laws is difficult. Regulations covering the hours of work are
 widely publicized, and the need to pay overtime is generally
 accepted. Compliance is difficult to enforce, but no industry
 stands out as an obvious violator of these employment
 standards. There are complaints that occupational health and
 safety laws are not adequately enforced.
