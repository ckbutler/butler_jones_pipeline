 FIJI
 Fiji's multiracial society is comprised of a large
 indigenous Melanesian population, immigrant Indians
 who now make up one half of the population, and a small
 group of Europeans, Chinese, and other Pacific Islanders.
 Fiji has a multiparty parliamentary system inherited
 from the British colonial period, with safeguards to
 protect the traditional communal social systems, including
 landholding rights, of the indigenous Fijians. Fiji
 has an excellent human rights record, strong democratic
 institutions, and supports cultural diversity in its
 heterogenous population.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by law and custom in Fiji.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punish-
 ment
 Cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punish-
 ment is illegal and not practiced or condoned. There
 are no summary executions in Fiji. Treatment of prison-
 ers is fair and humane. Public defenders are available.
 The Fiji Red Cross has access to detainees.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 There are no political prisoners in Fiji. Habeas
 corpus exists and is honored in practice.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A right to a fair public trial is guaranteed by
 law, and is honored in practice. Defendants are entitled
 to counsel, and counsels have free access to defendants.
 Consultations between counsels and defendants may be
 held in private. There is no harrassment of defense
 counsel by the government.
 Defendants are made fully aware of the charges
 brought against them, and they and their lawyers can
 inform themselves of the evidence on which charges are
 based.
 Fiji's courts are independent of executive or mili-
 tary control. There are no special courts to deal with
 security or political offenses. Civilians are not tried
 by military courts. There have been no executions of
 any kind. An ombudsman's office investigates complaints
 against the government.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 There is respect for the sanctity of the home and

 warrants are required as a matter of law. Illegal entries
 of the home are not condoned.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 The Fiji economy is divided between a subsistence
 agriculture econony, characteristic of the outlying
 islands, and a modern market economy centered on the
 two main islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. Fiji's
 development plans call for increased attention to rural
 development problems and the commitment of resources
 to improve housing, nutrition, health services and edu-
 cation in rural areas. By enhancing the rural areas,
 Fiji hopes to slow the growth of urban areas where most
 of the economic activity and hence, prosperity, has been
 focussed. Fiji seeks this redistribution through a
 system of regional planning and incentives, and not
 by penalizing private industry - there is still a strong
 commitment to capitalist enterprises and to the attrac-
 tion of foreign investment.
 The right to private property is respected.
 The government supports housing programs to
 make available adequate shelter for all at reasonable
 cost. Health care has been expanded to cover as many
 of the outlying islands as possible, and at reasonable
 cost. The government is seeking to provide free edu-
 cation for grades 1-6; almost 90% of secondary school
 age children are enrolled. Corruption is not a factor
 in regard to human needs in Fiji.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These rights are guaranteed and observed in practice.
 Although there is only one radio station, it is under the
 administration of an independent broadcasting commission
 and provides balanced coverage of the news in three
 languages. The press is free and private, and there
 is no censorship or control of the press by government.
 All religions are freely practiced. There are no impe-
 diments to assembly or to freedom of association.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Fijians are free to travel within the country and
 abroad. Passport fees are not excessive.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Fiji's political structure is designed to accommo-
 date the special interests of the ethnic Fijians and
 of the immigrant Indian community. Election to the
 House is on the basis of communal and national rolls.
 House elections are free and democratic, and a multitude
 or parties contest the seats. The Senate is appointed
 by the Fiji Council of Chiefs, the Prime Minister and
 Leader of the Opposition.
 Women have an equal standing and play a significant
 role in social, economic and political arenas. Discrim-
 ination by sex is unlawful.
 Fiji has an active trade union movement, recognized
 by government, with rights to organize, strike, bargain
 collectively and lobby.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 We are unaware of any such allegations against the
 Fiji government, or of any requests for investigations.
