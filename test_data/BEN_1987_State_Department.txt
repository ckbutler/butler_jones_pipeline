 BENIN
 Following its independence from France in 1960, Benin
 experienced a prolonged period of political experimentation
 and instability, punctuated by frequent coups d'etat. In 1972
 the army staged a decisive coup that brought to power the
 present Government, headed by President Mathieu Kerekou. In
 1974 the Government, influenced by leftists, declared Benin to
 be a Marxist-Leninist state under the direction of a single
 political party, the Party of the People's Revolution of Benin.
 Although Benin's Government has some of the institutional
 trappings of other Marxist states, Benin's Marxism has had a
 rather superficial effect on Beninese society. Farming and
 commerce, the two most important sectors of the economy, have
 remained firmly in private hands. The party itself is directed
 by a small leadership group in whicn the influence of the
 military remains important. The party controls the selection
 of candidates for the. National Assembly and local government
 bodies. o The military hold 5 out of 14 cabinet positions.
 Early efforts at radical political and social transformation
 in the mid-1970's encountered widespread resistance and
 resulted in significant erosions of political and personal
 liberties. An unsuccessful coup attemptin 1977 was followed
 by a period of intense suspicion of foreigners and domestic
 critics. In recent years, however, the authorities have
 exhibited g.ieater tolerance of divergent social and political
 views.
 Benin is ranked as one of the, world's 35opoorest countries;
 its underdeveloped economy is largely supported by subsistence
 agricultpre 80 percent of .the population lives in rural
 areas), ;regional. trade, and a low level- of offshor  oil
 production.  Ecooiic activity has been hampered by the
 Government's efforts to. institute centralized controls. In
 198A.mounting balance of payments problems -and .rising debt
 service costs led the Government to enter into negotiations
 with the International Monetary Fund to reduce the number of
 state,enterRrises and to encourage: foreign private investment.
 The iuman. rights situation remained unchanged in 1987. There
 were few i ncidents that might have caused the Government to
 use.repressive.measures. As in 1985 and 1986, there was some
 student -unrest; n.1987 a-small number of students were
 arrested for demonstrating agains.  the late payment of
 scholarships.   .
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I. Respe6t for theIntegrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.  Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were -no reports of. disappearance. or-secret arxests.
 c.  Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degcading
 Treatment or-Punishment   -            .
 In its-1987 report, Amnesty InternationalI noted that in 1986
 it had xeceiyed reports of torture -and other ill-treatment of
 political prisoners, including beatings, whippings, and
 
 
 BENIN
 "barrel torture" (the victim is rolled around inside a barrel
 containing broken glass and stones).
 Prison conditions in Benin are very poor. Sanitation
 facilities are deficient, and prisoner food is inadequate
 unless supplemented by food from friends or relatives.
 Physical punishment reportedly occurs.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Benin's legal system provides for the review ot detentions by
 a court of law in all but a few sensitive political cases.
 The Constitution states that no citizen may be arrested
 without an order of arrest by an established judicial body.
 In practice, however, persons have been detained, some for
 extended periods, without charge and without recourse to legal
 assistance or judicial hearing. For example, the American
 Association for the Advancement of Science has reported that a
 Beninese physician, Afolabi Biaou, was arrested in November
 1984 and has been detained without charge since that time.
 Biaou was previously involved with the "Support Committee for
 Former Political Prisoners" in Benin and was allegedly arrested
 en route to the presidential palace where he had been summoned
 for a meeting.
 Most political arrests have occurred during periods of
 political tension. Lengths of incarceration before trial are
 at the discretion of the authorities. Although arrests are
 not publicized, no special attempt is made to keep them
 secret. According to Amnesty International, political
 detainees and prisoners have been interrogated by the National
 Commission of Inquiry on State Security, headed by a senior
 military officer, apparently to determine the extent of the
 detainee's ties to opposition groups. The Commission
 reportedly has had the power to recommend to the President the
 continued detention or release of suspects.
 Prior to his departure in October 1986 to meet with Western
 European leaders, President Kerekou ordered the release of
 about 50 prisoners held since 1985 for having participated in
 strikes. Amnesty International stated in its 1987 report that
 there were at least 88 political prisoners being held without
 trial in Benin at the end of 1986. Apparently most 6f those
 detainees were either suspected of involvement in the student
 unrest of 1985 or were accused of supporting the banned
 Dahomey Communist Party.
 Student unrest continued in 1987, mainly over the late payment
 of scholarships. The Government arrested a small number of
 student leaders but released them by the end of 1987.
 There were no reports alleging the use of forced labor, which
 is prohibited under Beninese law.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Benin's judicial system is allowed to function independently
 in all but sensitive -political cases. In such instances,
 detainees may or may not be permitted legal counsel or granted
 a public hearing. There is no time limit with 'respect to
 charging a defendant or bringing the accused to trial. In
 recent years, the Government has used only the established
 civilian "revolutionary court" system. These courts are
 organized on provincial and national levels, and there are
 
 
 15
 BENIN
 plans for courts at the district level once sufficient judges
 have been trained, The highest court of appeal is the Central
 People's, Court.            -
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Although Benin's Constitution provides for the inviolability
 of the h6me and requires a warrant from a judge before the
 police can enter a residence, there have been occasional
 unconfirmed reports of forced entries in sensitive political
 cases. Other reports indicate that the security police monitor
 telephones and the mail of suspected persons. There are no
 other known types of interference with the home or family.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Iiberties, Including;
 'a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 With few exceptions, the local press, radio, and television
 are all government owned and operated. Among the exceptions
 are-La Croix, a weekly paper published by the Catholic church,
 and Echo,-a monhly'journal,6f opinion circulated throughout
 West Africa, which-,treat political issues with circumspection.
 The official media carry only-those stories that are approved
 by or serve the interests-of the party and the-State.
 Opposition to government. policies and-open criticism of the
 Government are not tolerated. Acadergic freedom on nonpolitical
 issues, however, is permitted, and there is normally no
 censorship of, foreign books and artistic works. Foreign
 periodicals are widely available on newsstands. Foreign radio
 broadcasts are readily available to much of the population
 throught hortwave'radio.- No attempt is made to interfere with
 radio reception. -Although the public expression of political
 opinion by Beninese'is t-ightly':ontrolled, the general
 atmosphere in Benin is not one of fear and repression. Many
 Beninese are willing to discuss politics freely in private or
 in small groups.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 All meetings of a political nature must be sponsored by the
 single political party. Although organized public opposition
 t6 -the Gover-nment itself 1s not permitted, there- are numerous
 examples of-groups which have organized to protest specific
 government policies or actions. In recent years, the
 Government has welcomed th-e formation of a wide variety of
 private social, service, and professional organizations
 (includinT Lions and Rotary.clubs), many of which maintain
 active international affiliations. There is no known
 persecution of. professional groups.,
 Labor unions are organs of the party and unified under a
 general labor organi-zation, -the Union Nationale des Syndicats
 des Travailleurs du Benin-(UNSTB).- Although controlled by the
 Government, individual local unions negotiate with individual
 employers on labDr matteri and represent workers' grievances
 to -e'mloyers and to the Government. The Government often
 plays the role of arbiter.
 Although the right, to strike is mot explicitly denied or
 protected, it is- clear, thatrlabor strikes are not sanctioned.
 The Constitution of 1977 states that "union activities are
 guaranteed toworkers" butA"must be used for the elevation of
 the conscience of the proletarian class and for the
 
 
 BENIN
 augmentation and continued development of production." When
 labor actions and arrests occasionally occur in Benin, they
 usually involve students or professionals and take the form of
 brief work stoppages to protest such things as late
 scholarship or salary payments.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Christianity, Islam, and traditional religions all coexist in
 Benin, and adherence to a particular faith does not confer any
 special status or benefit. There are no restrictions on
 religious ceremonies or teachings, and religious conversion is
 freely permitted.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Domestic movement is not restricted. International movement
 is controlled in that a passport and exit permission must be
 obtained for travel to other than West African countries;
 obtaining these documents, however, is not difficult.
 Economic rather than governmental constraints usually preclude
 travel outside the region. There are no restrictions placed
 on residence within Benin, except for recently released
 prisoners who may be subject to travel restrictions.
 Emigration is common in Benin. Many Beninese move to
 neighboring countries to earn a livelihood without
 jeopardizing their citizenship. Beninese living abroad are
 encouraged by the Government to return home to help develop
 their country, but only a small number have done so.
 By far the largest group of displaced persons in Benin are
 Chadians who have fled the fighting in their country. There
 are, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees, about 3,500 displaced Chadians in Benin. Many of
 these are now permanently settled in Benin, although they are
 free to return to Chad if they wish.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The current one-party political system provides no mechanism
 whereby citizens are free to change their government.
 Leadership is exercised by President Kerekou and a small group
 of senior party officials, many of whom hold positions in the
 Government. The electoral process allows for citizen
 participation in the nomination of candidates for the National
 Revolutionary Assembly, in theory the principal decisionmaking
 body of the Government. Party membership is neither a
 requisite for participation in this process nor for high
 office or civil service employment. The final selection of
 candidates for the single national slate, however, is made by
 the party leadership. No opposition parties or slates are
 permitted. The Assembly itself rarely takes issue with
 policies formulated by the party leadership.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government considers any outside attempt to investigate
 human rights practices in Benin to be interference in its
 internal affairs. In February 1986, the Government deposited
 instruments of ratification for the African Charter on Human
 and People's Rights.

 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Historically, Beninese women have played a major role in the
 commercial sector as well as in small-scale family farming.
 Women have not-had the same educational opportunities as men.
 Most boys now-attend primary school, but only about one out of
 every two'girls is in the primary grades. Nevertheless, the
 Government'officially encourages new opportunities for women
 and, ,whild there are no women in ministerial positions, a
 number of women figure prominently in executive level positions
 in the presidency.-and in the various ministries. There are
 two women on the Central Committee of the party. The ruling
 party'has awomenls organization--the Organisation des Femmes
 Revolitionnaires du Benin (OFRB). As do-other specialized
 party organizations, the OFRB serves to transmit party policy
 to its members. It also-provides a channel for women's views
 to be made known to-the party leadership.
 CONDITIONS OFLABOR
 The Governmetinthas given vigorous support to policies designed
 to improve the conditions of average workers in both the
 industrialiand agricultural sectors. It has, for example,
 committed itself to the gradual extension of free or low-cost
 medical care and social services; legislated minimum wage
 levels--(appgorimately $50 per month) and occupational safety
 conditiond; and established procedures and mechanisms for the
 protection of worker.-rights, including legislation prohibiting
 child labor;. :The.Beninese Labor Code -establishes a 40-hour
 workweek and-implicitly defines a Tminimum-age" by authorizing
 participation in the social security system beginning at age
 14.' The eivi-l service'administration will not hire persons
 under 18. In many-instances, however",the Government's
 ability to enforce these policies and regulations is limited
 by a shortage of.ndministrative and financial resources and by
 the need ,for the entire family to farm subsistence plots of
 land.  i   -    4    -
