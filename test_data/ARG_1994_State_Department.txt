 ARGENTINA
 Argentina is a federal constitutional democracy with an executive branch headed
 by an elected president, a bicameral legilature, and a separate judiciary. The Presi-
 dent, Carlos  a    enem, was elected in 1989, under an electoral colle e system,
 for a single 6-year term. In August a Constituent Assembly of popularly elected del-
 egates revised the Constitution, changing the presidential term to 4 years, abolish-
 ing the electoral college system, and permitting one successive term in office.
 The President is the commander in chief, and a civilian Defense Minister oversees
 the armed forces. The Government abolished military conscription in September,
 partly as a result of the public backlash generated by the beating death of a young
 army recruit earlier in the year. The Federal Police, which report to the Intrior
 Minister, the Border Police and Coast Guard which report to the Defense Minister
 and the provincial police share responsibility for law and order. The police continued
 to be responsible for human rights abuses.
 Arentina has a mixed a, industrial, and service economy that contin-
 ued its dramatic turnaroundt after decades of mismanagement and decline. An eco-
 nomic reform structural adjustment program, begun in 1989, led to 3 years of high
 erowth, sharply reduced in a ion, and spurred comPetitiveness. An extensive privat-
 zation program has been largely completed at the federal level and is now under
 way in the provinces. However, while employment grew rapily during the first
 earts of the program, national unemplogyment rse to a rora high of 12.2 Percent
 in 194, and te cost eo living rose sharply. The high cost of livingas mo  severely
 affected those with fixed incomes, although the entire countiy benefited from the
 end of hyperinflation.
 The newly revised Constitution incorporates nine international human rights con-
 ventions and als provides for a wide range of freedoms and rights which the Gov-
 ernment generally protected. There continue to be instances of extrajudicial killings
 duin                                           the...s
 and physical mistreatment of detainees by the police and military. However, the
 central and provincial governments tried and convicted a number of police officials
 for such abuses. The judicial system is subject to inordinate delays, resulting in
 lengthy pretrial detention. The Government-sponsored National Commission on the
 Right to Identity has worked closely with human rights groups to locate children
 of parents who disapeared during the military dictatorship and reunite them with
 their biological families.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no credible reports of po-
 litically motivated killings by government forces.
 However, police and military personnel were responsible for a number of
 extrajudicial killings. The most publicized case of an extrajudicial killing was the
 beating death of a young army recruit, Omar Carrasco, whose body was found on
 April 6 in the province of Neuquen. At the end of the year, three soldiers were being
 held pending trial for murder. Two other soldiers were awaiting trial (but not in
 prison) for covering up the crime. Because of a slipshod investigation at the time
 of Carrasco's disappearance (nearly 1 month passed before his bdy was found), the
 federal Attorney General ordered the case reopened in Au$ust to determine whether
 senior military officers had engaged in a coverup of the original investigation.
 Police officers committed several other extrajudicial killings. In July a police in-
 spector allegedly killed a 15-year-old, Miguel Rodri uez, for having stolen a ball
 from his son. The inspector was held for trial on murer charges. Cordoba Governor
 Eduardo Angeloz fired the province's Police Chief, Deputy Chief and Director for
 Internal Security after a serious altercation between police and residents in the
 town of San Jorge. In another instance, a court in the province of Buenos Aires con-
 victed two police officers convicted and sentenced them to life in prison for having
 brutalized 57-year-old Ramon Buchon until he died of a heart attack. The case of
 Diego Rodriguez Laguens, who police allegedly beat to death while in their custody
 in San Pedro in February, continued under investigation at year's end.
 Provincial and federal authorities made a greater effort to arrest and try the of-
 fenders in 1994 than they did in previous years. A federal judge sentenced four po-
 licemen to life imprisonment for the kidnaping and murder of three businessmen,
 Eduardo Oxenford, Benjamin Neuman, and Osvaldo Sivak in 1978, 1982, and 1985,
 respectively. A court sentenced three policemen, accused of killing three teenagers
 in 1987 in a Buenos Aires suburb, to 11 years in prison but released them pending
 appeal. In the town of Wilde, Buenos Aires province, a court tried and convicted
 seven policemen for killing four people in a shootout. A court in San Nicholas, Bue-
 
 
 311
 nos Aires province, sentenced two policemen to life in prison for killing a 57-year-
 old carpenter in 1983.
 b. Dtappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances
 in 1994. Uurrent cases stem from unresolved disappearances in previous years, es-
 pecially the 1976-83 military rule.
 A La Plata court began the trial of 7 of 11 Buenos Aires provincial police officers
 implicated in the disappearance of a La Plata youth, Andres-Nunez. Three witnesses
 testified they heard him being beaten in a nearby room at the time of his captivity
 3 years ago. In April the authorities detained six additional police officers and con-
 tinued to seek four others, who are fugitives. The case of Pablo Guardati, whom
 Mendoza police reportedly abducted in 1992, remains unresolved. The authorities
 released three of the four police officers charged in this case in late 1993, and freed
 the fourth in March, all for lack of sufficient evidence.
 The Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, the National Commission on the Right
 to Identity, and the Interior Ministry's Secretariat for Human Rights are continuing
 the search for children of couples who disappeared during the militaryegime.
 Using modern genetic testing techniques to prove genetic relationships where blood
 samples are available, they have located 55 children out of 218 pending cases since
 the restoration of democratic government in 1983. They have reunited 30 of these
 children with their biological families and allowed 13 to remain with their adoptive
 parents who were determined to have adopted the children legally. An additional
 case moved slowly toward resolution in 1994, which will bring the total number of
 children reunited with their families to 31.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture, and the Criminal Code provides penalties for tor-
 ture which are similar to those for homicide, from 8 to 15 years in prison. Neverthe-
 less plice maltreatment of detainees and lack of accountability remain problems.
 In February Juan Carbajal entered a Buenos Aires provincial police station seeking
 information and became involved in an argument with several officers. Police beat
 him and then detained him in a local hospital, telling his wife he was being held
 because he was mentally deranged. Doctors in the hospital, however, said he was
 normal and that his bruises were deliberately inflicted. The provincial Director of
 Security opened an investigation; Carbajal was released after 2 weeks in the hos-
 pital, and two police officers were arrested.
 In August a judge convicted four policemen in Entre Rios Province for physically
 abusing a suspe.owever, he imposed a 2 -year suspended sentence tote imple-
 mented only if they did not pass a written examination on constitutional rights and
 guarantees.
 In October the Menem administration recommended the promotion of two navy
 commanders, Antonio Perniss and Juan Carlos Rolon, to captain. During their con-
 irLmation hearings, they admitted to having tortured detainees during the 1976-83
 period of military rule.,A storm of controversy arose, and a Senate committee, domi-
 nated by the President's own Justicialist Party, rejected the nominations.
 d.Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Penal Code places limits on the ar-
 rest and investigatory power of the police and the judiciary, but the provincial police
 often ignored these restrictions, as indicated in the cases cited above. Human rights
 groups find it difficult to document such incidents, because victims are reluctant to
 file complaints.
 Police will detain young persons (teenagers and young adults are most vulnerable
 to this practice) sometimes overnight, sometimes for an entire weekend, without for-
 mal charges. They do not always provide such detainees the opportunity to call their
 family or an attorney and release them only upon a complaint from relatives or
 legal counsel. Human rights groups were also concerned about a proposed
 antiterrorism bill which would extend the number of hours the police can hold a
 person without a formal charge from 6 to 12 hours in a police station and from 48
 to 72 hours in judicial headquarters.
 Prison conditions are poor in a number of overcrowded jails where the facilities
 are old and dilapidated. In Buenos Aires province no new prisons have been built
 for 25 years. A circuit judge in Quilmes (Buenos Aires province) denounced lamen-
 table treatment of prisoners who are crowded four or five into a cell no larger than
 three meters square. A study in late 1993 indicated that 60 percent of those incar-
 cerated nationwide are awaiting trial; some have been detained for 2 years or more.
 Human rights groups say this problem remains a serious one and that prisons are
 virtual powder kegs of discontent. A large-scale prison riot occurred in Buenos Aires
 Province in August 1994.
 The law provides for the right to bail, and it is utilized in practice. Nonetheless,
 law allows pretrial detention and the slow pace of criminal trials results in lengthy
 pretrial detention periods. Many untried prisoners are serving more time in prison
 
 
 312
 than they would have served if they had been convicted and had received the maxi-
 mum sentence for the crime for which they were arrested. In recognition of this
 problem, the Senate passed a measure in October which would set a maximum 2-
 year limit on unsentenced prisoners and, after 2 years grant them 2 days of credit
 toward their sentences for every 1 day of the served befbre sentencing.
 The Interior Ministry conducted courses for public officials designed to heighten
 awareness about human rights issues, and the Justice Ministry attempted to edu-
 cate the public about the legal rights of detainees. The Government created the posi-
 tion of Ombudsman to oversee the observance of individual rights in the prisen sys-
 tem. To improve police practices, the Interior Ministry's Secretariat for Human
 Rights signed an agreement in 1994 with the United National Center for Human
 Rights to provide training for federal and provincial law enforcement officials.
 The law does not permit involuntary exile, and it is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria/.-Thejudicial system is nominally independent and
 impartial, but its processes are inefficient, complicated, and allegedly subject to po-
 litical influence. The judicial system is hampered by inordinate delays, procedural
 , chan           of jud  and widely reported allegations of corruption.
 7d~  s            y  e ange  Aop                                nugesu  ge
 are public, an   defendts have the right to legal counsel A panel of judges
 decides guilt or inn~cene.In 1992, some federal and provincial courts began decid-
 ing cases using oral trials i lieu of the practice of written submissions. Although
 such trials are less time-consuming, lawyers and judges are still struggling to adjust
 to the new procedures, and substantial elements of the old system remain. For ex-
 ample, before the oral p art of a trial begins, judges receive written documentation
 regarding the case which, according to prominentlegal experts, can bias a judge be-
 fore oral testimony is heard.
 Reform of the judiciary is a high priority for the Government. The new Constitu-
 tion provides for changes in the selection of  dges and oversight of the legal system.
 f. Arbitray Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Corresnce.-The
 Constitution prohibits the Government from interfering in the private lives of its
 citizens, and the Government rarely does so.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for the right to pub-
 lish ideas without prior censorship. The media fuliy exercise this ri  steinat-
 ing the full spectrum of political, social, cultural, and economic opinion in the coun-
 try.
 The number of reports of attacks or threats against journalists decreased in 1994.
 A newspaper editor in Jujuy Province received an anonymous threat, and the wife
 of a reporter for the Argentine news agency in Buenos Aires was mugged and
 threatened. A correspondent for a La Pampa province paper also received death
 threats. In Mendoza, intelligence operatives of the provincial police are alleged to
 have illegally entered a hotel room and intimidated three visiting Chilean journal-
 ists in October. National and provincial government authorities condemned the inci-
 dent and launched an investigation. There was little progress in the apprehension
 and unishment of those responsible for these and prior attacks.
 b. reedom of Penceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution and laws pro-
 vide for the right of groups and political parties to assemble and demonstrate. Many
 rups from all srsof society exercised this right with little or no government
 iterfernce.
 The Government generally respected academic freedom.
 c. Freedom o Re. N ion.Freedm of worship is a constitutional right. The new
 Constitution dropped its previous requirement that the President be a Reman
 Catholic. In practice, all religious denominations are able to exercise their faith free-
 d. Freedom of Moement Within the Countr, Forei n Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Documented travel and emigration remained unrestricted in 1994.
 Seon 3. Resect for Political Rights: The R ight of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Since its return to democratic government in 1983, Argentina has held free and
 fair elections to choose federal, provincial, and municipal office holders. Un
 adult suffrage is obligatory in n   inal elections. Political parties of varying
 ideologies operate freely and openly. The Constitution provides thatiall adult citi-
 zens shall enjoy full participation in the political process. In 1994 a Constituent As-
 sembly, freely chosen by the electorate, revised and ratified changes to the Constitu-
 tion of 1853 that permit the President to run for a second term  h anges reduce
 the President's term from 6 to 4 years. The new Constitution also provides for popu-
 lar elections of the mayor of the Federal Capital District of Buenos Aires (previously
 
 
 313
 appointed by the President), and mandates Senate confirmation of Supreme Court
 justices by a two-thirds vote.
 The Constitution stipulates that the internal regulations of political parties and
 party nominations for elections be subject to affirmative action requirements to as-
 sure that women are represented in elective office. A 1993 decree required that a
 minimum of 30 percent of all candidates on political party lists be women. Voters
 elected 20 new female members to the Chamber of Deputies in the October 1993
 elections; 1 female deputy was reelected, and 7 served the balance of terms to which
 they were elected in 1991. In 1994 women occupied 13 percent of the seats in the
 Chamber of Deputies and 4 percent of the Senate. There were few ranking women
 officials in the executive branch; they are, however, assuming positions of greater
 authority in provincial and local governments.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local human rights groups continue to be active, particularly in cases of judicial
 and police abuse of authority. The Ministry of Interior's Secretariat for ouman
 Rights works with the federal and state governments to promote greater respect for
 basic human rights among local authorities. There are no restrictions on visits or
 activities by international humanitarian groups or organizations.
 The Ministry of Interior created in 1994 an Institute Against Discrimination, Xen-
 ophobia, and Racism, located in Bariloche. Institute personnel will, among other
 things, have free access to files on persons or groups involved in crimes committed
 during the Second World War.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Sex, Race, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution and federal law guarantee equality for all citizens. The 1988
 Antidiscrimination Law establishes a series of penalties from 1 month to 3 years'
 imprisonment for anyone who arbitrarily restricts, obstructs, or restrains a person
 based on "race, religion, nationaity, ideology, political opinion, sex, economic posi-
 tion, social class, or physical characteristics? here is no evidene of any systematic
 effort by government or private groups to abridge these rights.
 Women.-Prvisions_ in the new Constitutionhave greatly enhanced women's par-
 ticipation in politics. However, women encounter economic discrimination and sex-
 ual harassment, a situation which has become more serious with the entry of large
 numbers of women into the workplace in the last 10 years. According to a govern-
 ment report, women occupy a disproportionately large number of lower paying jobs.
 Within each job category, women are concentrated in the lower ranks and receive
 the lowest salaries. Oflten they receive less pay for equal work done by men even
 though this is explicitly prohibited by law. Female labor leaders pressured their
 male counterparts for affirmative action program within the trade union movement
 to counteract this discrimination. Women also make up a disproportionately large
 share of the informal sector, which effectively denies them work-related economic
 and social benefits enjoyed by those in the formal sector.
 The National Women's Council and the Presidential Women's Advisory Cabinet,
 created in 1992 and 1999 'respectiyely; are currently working on a 3-year govern-
 ment action planto prmote equal opportunity and greater participation by women
 in society. In November 1993, President Menem signed a decree against sexual har-
 assment in the Federal Government.
 Violence against women is a national problem;, insensitivity among police and
 judges sometimes discourages women from reporting assaults, especally in domestic
 violence cases. In response, the National Women's Council has been working with
 law enforcement authorities to include in their police training curriculum material
 on handling cases of violence against women.
 Children.-The new Constitution    iorates the U.N. Convention on the Rights
 of the Child. The Ministry of Interior's  uman Rights Secretariat works with Unit-
 ed Nations Children's Fund and other international agencies to promote children's
 rights and well-being. After detecting several cases of trafficking in babies, the pro-
 vincial authorities in Cordoba and Buenos Aires began programs to improve reg-
 istration and identification of newborn infants. The Chamlber of Deputies approved
 a new adoption law which will greatly restrict adoption of children by those not resi-
 dent in Argentina. It offers more protection to the children and the biological par-
 ents.
 Historically, Argentina has had numerous programs to provide public education,
 health protection, and recreational services for all children, regardless of class or
 economic status. It recognizes there are problems of child abuse and prostitution,
 and that those affected tend to be younger than previously. The Government's Na-
 
 
 314
 tional Council of the Child and the Family works with federal and local agencies
 to improve child protection programs. Sixteen out of 24 provinces, as well as the
 Federal Government have adopted child protection laws, the most recent being the
 province of Buenos Aires which approved new legislation in 1994.
 Indigenous People.-The revised Constitution provides the right of minorities to
 be represented in Government and incorporates international agreements intended
 to promote their economic, social, and cultural rights. Estimates of the size of the
 indigenous population vary from 60,000 to 150,000, but the National Statistical In-
 stitute put the figure at low 100,000 as of 1992. Most live in the northern and
 northwestern provinces and in the far south. Their standard of living is considerably
 below the average, and they have hger rates of illiteracy,  romc diseases, and
 unemployment. Indigenous pea     ana grouPs sre sometimes involved in disputes
 over tribal lands which tend to be prolonged due to the inefficient court system.
 Religious Minorities.-Two major events heightened the Jewish community's con-
 cerns about anti-Semitism in Argentina: The terrorist bombing of the Argentine
 Jewish Mutual Association and the arrest and extradition proceedin  ainst ex-
 Nazi official Erich Priebke. Senior government officials, including the President, ex-
 pressed solidarity with the Jewish community after the bombing and stated their
 commitment to find the perpetrators. Even before the bombing, anti-Semitic inci-
 dents (threats, assaults, graffiti) increased during the first 6 months of 1994. The
 Government actively investigates these crimes.
 People With Disabilities.-Congress approved a law aimed at eliminating physical
 barriers to handicapped persons in 1994. The law regulates standards regarding ac-
 cess to public buildings parks, plazas, stairs and ramps, and pedestrian areas. How-
 ever, few buildings and public areas in Buenos Aires or other cities currently offer
 easy access to persons with disabilities. Federal law also prohibits discrimination
 against people with disabilities in employment.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-With the exception of military personnel, all workers
 are free to form unions. Estimates regarding union membership vary widely. Most
 union leaders believe it to be about 40 percent of the work force; government figures
 indicate union membership at 30 percent.
 Unions have the right to strike and the law protects members who participate in
 strikes. In 1994 major strikes occurred without government interference against the
 privatized Greater Buenos Aires Electric Power Utility and the aluminum smelting
 plant in the southern province of Chubut. However, in response to a call for a gen-
 eral strike by trade union opponents of the Government's economic policies, the Gov-
 ernment declared the strike illegal on the grounds that the constitutional right to
 strike is intended to protect work ers' economic interests but not to be used as apo-
 litical weapon. However, the Government did nothing to interfere with the 1-day
 work stoppage.
 Argentine unions are members of international labor associations and secretariats
 and participate actively in their programs.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law prohibits antiunion
 practices and the Government enforces it. Argentine labor, the private sector, and
 the Government reaffirmed these rights in a framework agreement signed in July
 aimed at reforming labor-management relations in the context of economic restruc-
 turing and increasing global competitiveness. The trend towards bargaining on a
 company level, in contrast to negotiating at the national level, on a sectoral basis
 continues, but the adjustment is not an easy one for either side. For this reason,
 the agreement proposes to create a national mediation service to promote more ef-
 fective collective bargaining.
 The Committee of Experts (COE) on the Application of Conventions and Rec-
 ommendations of the International Labor Organization (ILO) took note of a Teach-
 ers' Union complaint regarding restrictions on collective bargaining in certain speci-
 fied sectors and asked the Government to inform the ILO of measures it may take
 or has taken to encourage voluntary negotiations without impediments. Workers
 may not be fired for participating in legal union activities. Those who prove they
 have been discriminated against have the right to be reinstated.
 There are no officially designated export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced labor,
 and there were no reports that it was practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law prohibits employment of
 children under 14 years of age, except within the family. Minors aged 14 to 18 may
 work in a limited number of job categories, but not more than 6 hours a day or 35
 hours a week. Notwithstanding these regulations, a Ministry of Labor report esti-
 mated that 200,000 children between 10 and 14 years of age are employed, pri-
 
 
 315
 maily as street vendors or household workers. Federal and provincial labor authori-
 ties were not well equipped to cope with this situation due to budgetary and person-
 nel limitations.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The national monthly minimum wage is $200
 but is insufficient to sustain an average family of four.
 Federal labor law mandates acceptable working conditions in the areas of health,
 safety, and hours. The maximum workday is 8 hours and workweek 48 hours. The
 framework agreement aims at producing legislation to modernize the accident com-
 pensation process and occupational health and safety norms. In responding to a
 complaint from the Congress of Argentine Workers that work-related illnesses were
 not overed under the existing workers ompensation system, the ILO's COE urged
 the Government to outline the measures it plans to take to fulfill its obligations
 under ILO Convention 42 on worker compensation (occupational diseases) which Ar-
 gentina ratified in 1950.
 Occupational health and safety standards are well developed, but federal and pro-
 vincial governments lack sufficient resources to fully enforce them. In spite of union
 vigilance, the most egregious cases of inhumane working conditions generally in-
 volve illegal immigrants who have little opportunity or knowledge to seek legal re-
 dress. In October and November, authorities in Buenos Aires uncovered several
 "sweatshops" employing illegal immigrants working under deplorable conditions for
 minimal pay. The Government closed one sweatshop immediately; the closure of the
 others awaited a court decision.
 Workers have the right to remove themselves from dangerous or unhealthful work
 situations, after having gone through a claim procedure, without jeopardy to contin-
 ued employment. Nevertheless, workers who leave the workplace before it has been
 proven unsafe run the risk of being fired; in such cases, the worker has the right
 to judicial appeal, but this process can be very lengthy.
