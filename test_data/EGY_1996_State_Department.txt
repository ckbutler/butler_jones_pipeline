 EGYPT
 According to its Constitution, Egypt is a social democracy in which Islam is the
 state religion. However, the National Democratic Party nDP), has governed since
 its establishment in 1978, has used its entrenched position to dominate national pol-
 itics, and maintains a wide majorit in the  pularly elected People's Assembly and
 the partially elected Shura (Consultative) Council. The President, Hosni Mubarak,
 was reelected unopposed to a third 6-year term by the People's Assembly in 1993.
 The President appoints the Cabinet, which is responsible to him. The judiciary is
 independent
 There are several security services in the Ministry of Interior, two of which are
 primarily involved in combating terrorism: Th  ae Security Investigations Sector
 (581S), which conducts investigations and interrogates detainees; and the Central
 Security Force (CSF), which enforces curfews and bans on public demonstrations,
 
 
 1243
 and conducts paramilitary operations against terrorists. The use of violence by secu-
 rity forces in the campaign against terrorists appeared more limited this year than
 in previous years. The security forces committed numerous serious human rights
 abuses.
 Egypt continued to move from a command economy to a free market system. Man-
 ufacturing is still dominated by the public sector. The Government began accelerat-
 ing its privatization program during the year. Agriculture remains the largest em-
 ployer in the economy and is almost entirely in private hands. Transfers and remit-
 tances from approximately 2 million Egyptians working abroad are the largest
 source of foreign currency earnings. In 1995 tourism surpassed petroleum as the
 second largest hard currency earner and preliminary data for 1996 suggest a contin-
 ued strong rebound of the tourism sector. In the past 5 years, the Government has
 enacted significant economic reforms, which have reduced the budget deficit, sta-
 bilized the exchange rate, reduced inflation and interest rates significantly, and
 built up substantial reserves. The success of the reform efforts has resulted in an
 increase in annual economic growth rates to 4.8 percent for fiscal year 1995-96 and
 5.1 percent estimated for fiscal year 1996-97.
 The Government continued to commit numerous serious abuses, although its
 human rights record improved somewhat over the past year. The Emergency Law,
 which has been in effect since 1981, continues to restrict many basic rights. The rul-
 ing NDP dominates the political scene to such an extent that citizens do not have
 a meaningful ability to change their government. The security forces and terrorist
 groups remained locked in a cycle of violence. In fighting the terrorists, the security
 forces continue to mistreat and torture prisoners, arbitrarily arrest and detain per-
 sons, hold detainees in prolonged pretrial detention, and occasionally engage in
 mass arrests. Aside from the antiterrorist campaign, local police abused common
 criminal suspects. However, security forces committed fewer abuses than in the pre-
 vious year. The Government took disciplinary action against police officers accused
 of abusing detainees, but did not pursue most cases or seek adequate punishments.
 Prison conditions are poor.
 _The use of miitary ourts to try civilians continues to infringe on a defendant's
 right to a fair trial before an independent judiciary. The Government again tried
 members of the Muslim Brotherhood in military courts on charges of illegal plitical
 activities, continuing to expand the jurisdiction of the military courts beyond terror-
 ism-related offenses. The Government used the emergency law to infringe on citi-
 zens' privacy rights. Although citizens generally express themselves freely, the Gov-
 ernment continues to place significant limitations on freedom of the press. Some of
 the harsher penalties of the 1995 press law were suspended; however, state prosecu-
 tors brought libel charges, some under the old law, against several journalists for
 criticizing corruption and abuse of authority among government officials and their
 families.The Government restricts freedom of assembly and association, and does
 not legally recognize local human rights groups, but which are allowed to operate
 openly. The Government places limits on the freedom of reli~on.
 Women and Christians face discrimination based on tradition and some aspects
 of the law. Terrorist violence against Christians was a problem. Violence against
 women is a problem. Worker rights are not adequately protected. A new child labor
 law increases protections for children, but child labor remains widespread despite
 the government's efforts to eradicate it. Abuse by employers continues, and stricter
 government enforcement of the law is necessary. In a significant breakthrough, the
 Government issued a decree banning the practice of female genital mutilation
 (FGM), developed a program to address the problem, and increased efforts to edu-
 cate the public as to its dangers.
 Terrorists committed numerous serious abuses. Terrorist groups seeking to over-
 throw the Government and establish an Islamic state continued their attacks on po-
 lice, Coptic Christians, and tourists. In April terrorists killed a group of 18 Greek
 tourists in Cairo; 13 Greeks and 2 Egyptians were wounded. Terrorists  ups were
 responsible for the majority of the 132 civilian and police deaths, and ommitted
 bank and jewelry store robberies to get funds. They also attacked police, a train,
 and riverboats, mostly in upper (southern) Egypt.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings by government officials; however, extrajudicial killings may have occured in
 certain antiterrorist operations.
 There were no total figures for deaths in custody from government or human
 rights sources by year's end. Human rights groups were investigating eight deaths
 
 
 1244
 in police custody, six of which they believed were due to medical negligence, one to
 suicide, and one as a result of a beating or being tortured to death. They are also
 investigating 13 prison deaths related to medical negligence (see Section 1.c.).
 In antiterrorist operations, the security forces killed 34 suspected terrorists; there
 were no reports of excessive use of lethal force. At least one civilian bystander was
 reported killed inadvertently by security forces. No suspects died while attempting
 to escape arrest. There were no reports of killings of relatives of suspected extrem-
 ists in apparent vendettas.
 The case against a policeman charged with torture and use of excessive force in
 the 1994 death of a detainee remained pending (see Section 1.c.).
 In January state prosecutors ruled in the case of the 1994 death in custody of
 Amre Mohamed Safwat that there was no felony case. The prosecutors, however, or-
 dered a repriinand for the head of the Ain Shams Calm police station and the direc-
 tor of the hospital involved for violating the rules of admission to the hospital. An
 appal by the family is currently under investigation by the Technical (Human
 Rights) Office of the Ministry of Justice. There were no new developments in the
 case of Mohammed Abdel Hamid Hassan, who reportedly died in police custody in
 1994.
 Terrorist groups were responsible for the majority of the deaths in civil unrest.
 They killed 132 persons, compared with 200 in 1995. This total included 48 police
 and security officers as well as 84 civilians. Terrorist attacks directed specifically
 against Coptic Christians continued, killing at least 22, including a group of 8 in
 Assiyut in February. They also attacked churches and other properties owned by
 Christians. In April four gunmen belonging to the extremist Islamic group Al-
 Gamma'a A]-Islamiyya attacked a group of Greek tourists at the entrance to the Eu-
 ropa Hotel near the pyramids. The terrorists killed 18 of the visitors, and wounded
 13 other tourists and2Egyptians before escaping. Terrorists also attacked a pas-
 senger train in Minya in January and were involved in a number of bank and Jew-
 elry store robberies, mostly in upper Egypt. While the Europa Hotel attack brought
 the largest casualty count from a single incident in Egypt's modem history, the total
 number of deaths from extremist violence was sharply down in 1996 after increasing
 steadily during the previous 4 years.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 Of the 11 individuals that local human rights groups claimed had disappeared in
 1994 and the 1 cited in 1995, 8 have since en located in detention facilities, but
 4 remain missing. The Government has not responded to queries from human rights
 monitors regarding the outstanding cases.
 There were no concrete developments in the case ofMansur Kikhya, a former Lib-
 yan Foreign Minister and a prominent exiled dissident, who disappeared in Cairo
 in 1993.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits the infliction of "physical or moral harm" upon persons
 who have been arrested or detained. However, abuse and torture of detainees by po-
 lice, security personnel, and prison guards is common.
 Under the Penal Code, torture of a defendant or orders to torture ame felonies
 punishable by temporary hard labor or 3 to 10 years imprisonment. If the defendant
 dies, the crime is one of intentional murder punishable by a life sentence at hard
 labor. The crime of arrest without due cause through threat of death or physical tor-
 ture is punishable by temporari hard labor. The use of cruelty against people by
 relying oen ne     n is puminhable by imprisonment of no more than 1 year or
 a fine of no more that $65.00.
 Despite these legal safeguards, there were numerous credible reports of mistreat-
 ment and torture by security forces, although fewer than in previous years. Reports
 of mistreatment and torture at police stations remain frequent.
 In a June interview, the Ministr of Interior stated that human rights was taught
 as a subject at the National Police Academy, and that police officers responsibe for
 human rights infractions must be brought to trial and punished or administratively
 reprimanded in accordance with the law. While he Government has investigated
 torture complaints in criminal cases and punished some offending officers, the pun-
 ishments are not in line with the seriousness of the offense. However, government
 officials have stated that administrative punishments can be severe enough to pre-
 vent further career advancement, and that some police officers have opted to ace
 criminal charges instead. The Government has said that it will not disclose further
 details of individual cases of police abuse for fear of harming the morale of law en-
 forcement officers involved in counterterrorist operations.
 Reports of torture on the part of the SSIS dropped during the year. However, tor-
 ture  as reortedly ta en place in police stations; SSIS offices, including its head-
 quarters in Cairo; and at Central Security Force camps. Torture victims usually are
 
 
 1245
 taken to a SSIS office where they are handcuffed, blindfolded, and questioned about
 their associations, religious beliefs, and political views. Torture is used to extract
 information, coerce the victims to end their antigovernment activities, and deter oth-
 ers from such activities. While the law requires security authorities to keep written
 records of detained citizens, human ri hts groups re rt that such records often are
 not available, not found, or the police deny any Knowledge of the detainee when they
 inquire about specific cases, effectively blocking the investigation of torture com-
 plaints.
 Egyptian human rights groups and victims report a number of torture methods.
 Detainees are frequently stripped to their underwear, hung by their wrists with
 their feet touching the floor or forced to stand for prolonged periods; doused with
 hot and cold water, beaten; forced to stand outdoors in cold weather, and subjected
 to electric shocks. Some victims, including female detainees, report that they have
 been threatened with rape.
 In late 1994, public prosecutors charged a policeman with torture, unlawful deten-
 tion, illegal entry, and excessive use of force in the case of Fateh AI-Bab Abdel
 Moneim who died inpolice custody in 1994. At year's end, the case remained pend-
 ing before the south Cairo Criminal Court.
 In early 1995, the Public Prosecutor's office began an investigation into the case
 of Gamal EI-Shazly, who allegedly had been tortured in December 1994, in a police
 station in Manshayit Nasser, a poor district of Cairo. The case remains under mves-
 tigation.
 Prison conditions remain poor. Despite the completion of five new pisons in 1995,
 human rights groups report that overcrowding and unhealthy conditions continue.
 The use of torture and other mistreatment, lack of medical care, the banning of vis-
 its, and substandard living conditions are reportedly common. Prisoners have
 claimed that their cells are poorly ventilated, their food is inadequate in quantity
 and nutritional value, and medical services are often unavailable. Health conditions
 in the High Security Prison (-he Scorpion") at Tora reportedly include widespread
 tuberculosis among the inmates. At the same prison, in June, 40 inmates were or-
 dered to strip and were flogged, after 3 contraband items were found during ah in-
 spection of the prison. Human rights groups are investigating 13 prison deaths re-
 lated to medical negligence.
 Prisoners at two high security prisons, the New Valley Prison and Torah Prison,
 reported receiving physical and psychological abuse known as a "reception party"
 upon their arrival at prison. Under the supervision of a prison official and doctor,
 guards reportedly beat new arrivals for 30 minutes with fists and heavy plastic
 sticks. The inmates are then forced to crawl to their cells on their hands and knees.
 The Ministry of Interior stated that the ban on prison visits by relatives and law-
 yers at a number of prisons, including Fayyom and the High Security Prison, has
 been lifted. Human rights groups report, however, that visits have been refused at
 several prisons. At others, restrictions have been placed on visits to political or ex-
 tremist prisoners, limiting the number of visits allowed each prisoner, and the total
 number of visitors allowed in the prison at any one time. Human rights monitors
 are allowed to visit prisoners, but often face considerable bureaucratic obstacles be-
 fore obtaining the proper paperwork.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-As part of the Government's antiterrorist
 campaign, security forces conducted mass arrests and detained hundreds of individ-
 uals without charge after specific terrorist incidents. Under the provisions of the
 Emergency Law, which has been in effect since 1981, the police may obtain an ar-
 rest warrant from the Ministry of Interior upon showing that an individual poses
 a danger to security and public order. This procedure nullifies the constitutional re-
 quirement of obtaining a warrant from a judge or prosecutor upon showing that an
 individual has likely committed a specific crime.
 The Emergency Law allows authorities to detain an individual without charge.
 After 30 days, a detainee has the right to demand a court hearing to challenge the
 legality of the detention order, and may resubmit his motion for a hearing at 1-
 month intervals thereafter. There is no maximum limit to the length of detention
 if the judge continues to uphold the legality of the detention order, or if the detainee
 fails to exercise his right to a hearing.
 In addition to the Emergency Law, the Penal Code also gives the State wide de-
 tention powers. Under the code, prosecutors must bring charges within 24 hours or
 release the suspect. However, they may detain a suspect for a maximum of 6
 months, pending investigation. Arrests under the Penal Code occur openly and with
 warrants issued by a district prosecutor or judge. There is a system of bail. The
 Penal Code contains several provisions to combat extremist violence. These provi-
 sions broadly define terrorism to include the acts of "spreading panic" and "obstruct-
 ing the work of authorities."
 
 
 1246
 'Hiuman rights groups reported that hundreds, and according to one report, thou-
 sands, of people detained under the Emergency Law have been incarcerated for up
 to several years without charge. The courts have ordered the release of a number
 of these detainees, but prison officials have reportedly ignored the orders. Fre-
 quently, the Ministry of Interior reissues detention orders, sending detainees back
 to prison.
 in March the Government lifted a 2-year dusk-to-dawn curfew on Mallawi and
 several surrounding villages in Minya province.
 During the year, security forces and police arrested at least 120 members of the
 Muslim Brotherhood (an Islamist opposition organization) as well as 200 members
 of a new group, the Qutbiyoun, described as an offshoot of the Brotherhood. The
 charges rangedfrom inciting the masses against the Government, to distributing il-
 legal leaflets and membership in an illegal organization. An undetermined number
 of Musm Brothers were brought to trial during the year (see Section I.e.).
 Neither the Government nor human rights groups were able to provide firm fig-
 ures for the total prison population. One human rights group cited a government
 figure of 12,000 regtered and serving sentences, but provided a rough estimate of
 32,000 for the total prison population, including those being held pending sentenc-
 ing. However, in a June interview in the weekly magazine Al-Wasat, Interior Min-
 ister Hasan Al-Alfy asserted that the number of political detainees was considerably
 less than 10,000. The Minister also noted that 1,600 repentant convicted terrorists
 had been released during the previous few months.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The judiciary is independent. The Constitution
 provides for the independence and immunity of judges, and forbids interference by
 other authorities in the exercise of their judicial functions. The President appoints
 all judges upon recommendation of the   i her Judicial Council, a constitutional
 body compsed of senior judges, and chairedby the President of the Court of Cassa-
 tion. The Council regulates judicial promotions and transfers. In the last few years,
 the Government has added lectures on human rights and other social issues to its
 training courses for prosecutors and judges.
 There are three levels of regular criminal courts: Primary courts; appeals courts;
 and the Court of Cassation, the final stage of criminal appeal. The judicial system
 is based on the Napoleonic tradition; hence there are no juries. Misdemeanors, that
 are punishable by imprisonment, are heard at the first level by one judge; at the
 second level by three judges. Felonies, that are punishable by imprisonment or exe-
 cution, are heard in criminal court by three judges. Contestitions of rulings are
 heard by the Court of Cassation. A lawyer will be appointed at the court's expense
 if the defendant does not have one. The appointment of lawyers is based on a roster
 chosen by the Bar Association; however, expenses are incurred by the State. Any
 denial of this right is cause for contestation of the ruling. However, detainees in cer-
 tain high-security prisons alleged that they were denied access to counsel, or that
 such access was delayed until trial, thus denying counsel the time to prepare an
 adequate defense.
 Defense lawyers generally agree that the regular judiciary respects the rights of
 the accused and exercises its independence. In the past, criminal court judges have
 dismissed cases where confessions were obtained by coercion. However, while the ju-
 diciary generally is credited with conducting fair trials, under the Emergency Law,
 cases involving terrorism and national security may be tried in military or state se-
 curity courts, in which the accused do not receive all the constitutional protections
 of the judicial system. The majority of terrorist cases were again referred to Su-
 preme State Security Emergency courts this year. High-profile cases involving Mus-
 lim Brotherhood members and a large number of terrorists went to military courts.
 In the past, human rights groups and defense lawyers have claimed that the Gov-
 ernment intimidated lawyers representing terrorist suspects by detaining and ques-
 tioning them on the activities of their clients. There were no such reports during
 theyear.
 The use of military and state security tribunals under the Emergency Law has
 deprived hundreds of civilian defendants of their constitutional right to be tried by
 an ordinary judge. In 1992, with extremist violence on the rise, the Government
 began trying cases of persons accused of terrorism and membership in terrorist
 groups before military tribunals. In 1993 the Supreme Constitutional Court ruled
 that the President may invoke the Emergency Law to refer any crime to a military
 court.
 From January to December, the Government referred approximately 66 civilian
 defendants to the military courts in five separate cases.
 During the year security forces detained 13 members of the Muslim Brotherhood
 on suspicion of engaging in illegal political activities. The Government referred the
 
 
 1247
 
 Muslim Brotherhood detainees to trial in a military court on charges of membership
 in an illegal organization, maintaining links to terrorists, and planning to overthrow
 the Government. In an August decision, the court acquitted five. The remainder
 were found guilty of the charges-seven were sentenced to from 7 months' to 3
 years' imprisonment, and 1 to a suspended 1 year prison term (for health reasons).
 In January 24 defendants accused of involvement in terrorist plots were brought
 to trial before a military court. The court acquitted six, sentenced six others to
 death, and sentenced the remainder to prison terms ranging from 3 to 15 years.
 In November a hi her military court in Assiyut handed down verdicts on 10 de-
 fendants accused of infiltratingEgypt and attempting to smuggle and sell weapons
 to terrorists. The court acquitted 3 defendants, sentenced 4 to life imprisonment at
 hard labor, and the remaining 3 to prison terms ranging from 10 to 15 years.
 Two trials of 19 defendants from the Islamic Group opened in December at a su-
 preme military court in Cairo. The first trial involved 3 defendants accused of at-
 tempting to assassinate the Military Prosecutor in 1993. In the second trial, 19 de-
 fendants, including the 3 defendants in the first trial as well as 16 others, are ac-
 cused of killing a policeman, assaulting persons at two movie theaters in Helwan,
 and wounding 16 persons, including 8 tourists, during an attack on a tourist bus
 in Cairo in 1994.
 In response to an appeal, the Supreme Court, as it did in 1993, found that the
 President may invoke the emergency law to refer any crime to a military court.
 The Government defends the use of military courts as necessary in terrorism
 cases, maintaining that trials in the civilian courts are protracted, and that civilian
 judges and their families are vulnerable to terrorist threats. Some civilian judges
 have confirmed that they fear trying high-visibility terrorism cases because of pos-
 sible reprisals. The Government claims that civilian defendants receive fair trials
 in the military courts and enjoy the same rights as defendants in civilian courts.
 However, the military courts do not guarantee civilian defendants due process be-
 fore an independent tribunal. While military judges are lawyers, they are also mili-
 tary officers appointed by the Minister of Defense and subject to military discipline.
 They are not as independent as civilian judges in applying the civilian Penal Code.
 There is no appellate process for verdicts by military courts; instead, verdicts are
 subject to review by other military judges and confirmed by the President, who in
 practice usually delegates the review function to a senior military officer. Defense
 attorneys have complained that they have not been given sufficient time to prepare
 defenses and that judges tend to rush cases with many defendants.
 The state security courts share jurisdiction with military courts over crimes affect-
 ing national security. The President appoints judges to these courts from the civilian
 judiciary upon the recommendation o the    mister of Justice and, if he chooses to
 appoint military judges, the Minister of Defense. Sentences are subject to confirma-
 tion by the President but cannot be appealed. The President may alter or annul the
 decision of a state security court, including a decision to release a defendant. In
 1996 state security courts tried at least 9 cases involving over 175 defendants
 charged with terrorist acts.
 There are no reliable statistics on the number of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Under
 the Constitution homes, correspondence, telephone calls, and other means of com-
 munication "shaht have their own sanctity, and their secrecy shall be guaranteed."
 Police must obtain warrants before undertaking searches and wiretaps. Courts have
 dismissed cases in which warrants were issued without sufficient cause. Police offi-
 cials who conduct searches without proper warrants are subject to criminal pen-
 alties, although these are seldom imposed.
 However, the Emergency Law has abridged the constitutional provisions regard-
 ing the right to privacy. The law empowers the Government to place wiretaps, inter-
 cept mail, and search persons or places without warrants. Security agencies fre-
 quently place political activists, suspected subversives, journalists foreigners, and
 writers under surveillance, screen their correspondence (especially international
 mail), search them and their homes, and confiscate personal property.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, however, the Government continues to place limitations on these
 rights. Citizens openly speak their views on a wide range of political and social is-
 sues, including vigorous criticism of the Government.
 The Government owns stock in the three largest daily newspapers and the Presi-
 dent appoints their editors in chief and chairmen of the board. However, although
 he    aprs enerally follow the Government line, they frequently criticize govern-
 en      oies. The Government also enjoys a monopoly on the printing and distribu-
 
 
 1248
 tion of newspapers including the opposition parties' papers. The Government has
 been known to use its monopolistic control of newsprint to limit output of opposition
 publications.
 Opposition political parties publish their own papers but receive a subsidy from
 the Government and, in some cases, subsidies from foreig interests as well. Most
 are weeklies, with the exception of the centrist daily Al Wafd, the daily AI-Abr
 and A1-Shaab, the semiweekly of the Islamist-oriented Socialist Labor Party. All
 have small circulations. Opposition newspapers frequently publish criticism of the
 Government, inspiring rejoinders from the government-owned press. They also give
 greater prominence to human rights abuses than the state-run newspapers. All
 party newspapers are required by law to reflect the platform of their party.
 The Penal Code, Law 93 of 1995, the Press Authority Law, and the Publications
 Law govern press issues. The laws stipulate substantial fines for criticism of the
 President, members of the Government, and foreign heads of state. The Constitution
 restricts ownership of newspapers to public or private legal entities, corporate bod-
 ies, and political parties. However, there are numerous restrictions on legal entities
 that wish to estabish their own newspapers. Papers published outside Egypt can be
 distributed with government permission.
 Libel laws provide protection against malicious rumor-mongering and unsubstan-
 tiated reporting. Jail terms may be imposed. Financial penalties increased substan-
 tially under Law 93 of 1995, although the judicial process remains long and costly,
 creating a bar to realistic legal recourse for those wrongly defamed. In recent years,
 -opposition party newspapers have, within limits, published articles critical of the
 President and foreign heads of state without being charged or harassed. Most cases
 involving the press are brought by the Government, usually involving rumors or
 charges of corruption against members of the families of government officials. On
 several occasions in 1996, the Government detained and interrogated editors and
 journalists for publishing allegations of official misconduct and corruption.
 In June 1995, an amendment to Law 93 was passed, stiffening penalties for and
 broadening the definition of criminal libel. Following a series of protests by the
 press syndicate, and a direct appeal to President Mubarak, he set aside this amend-
 ment in June. However, the Government continues to prosecute journalists under
 the law in effect at the time charges were filed. The process of determining whether
 the applicable sections of the law have been set aside is time-consuming and
 exprensive. Approximately 42 journalists are in various stages of prosecution under
 Law 93.
 In July a court sentenced Magdy Ahmad Hussein, editor of the Islamic fundamen-
 talist newspaper Al-Shaab, to a 1-year suspended sentence for libeling the son of
 Intei-or Minister Hassan Alfi. He was also ordered to pay a fine of 15,000 Egyptian
 pourids.
 Various ministries are legally authorized to ban or confiscate books and other
 works of art, upon obtaining a court order. The Islamic Research Institute at Al-
 Azhar University has legal authority to censor, but not to confiscate, all publications
 dealing with the Koran and Islamic scriptural texts. In recent years the Institute
 has passed judgment on the suitability of nonreligious books and artistic produc-
 tions.
 In January 1995, an administrative court ruled that the sole authority to prohibit
 publication or distribution of books and other works of art resides with the Ministry
 of Culture. This decision voided a 1994 advisory opinion by a judiciary council that
 had expanded Al-Azhar's censorship authority to include visual and audio artistic
 works. The same year, President Mubarak stated that the Government would not
 allow confiscation of books from the market without a court order, a position sup-
 ported by the then-Grand Mufti, who is now the Grand Sheik of Al-Azhar.
 There were no court ordered confiscations during the year. However, two books
 were seized by police in June without a court order, after officials at Al-Azhar ruled
 that they should be banned for violating religious laws and norms. In August the
 police also seized five books on Shi'a Islam from Cairo bookstores, without a court
 order.
 The Ministry of Interior regularly confiscates leaflets and other works by Muslim
 fundamentalists. It also has the authority to stop specific issues of foreign published
 newspapers from enteringthe country on the grounds of protecting public order. The
 Ministry of Defense may ban works about sensitive security issues.
 The Council of Ministers may order the banning of works that it deems offensive
 to public morals, detrimental to religion, or likely to cause a breach of the peace.
 Plays and films must pass Ministry of Culture censorship tests as scripts and as
 final productions. Many plays and Ifns, highly critical of the Government and its
 policies, are not censored. The Ministry of Culture also censors foreign films for
 viewing in theaters, but it is more lenient when the same films are released in video
 
 
 1249
 cassette format. Government censors ensure that foreign films made in Egypt por-
 tray the country in a favorable light. Censors review scripts before filming, are
 present during filming, and have the right to review the film before it is sent out
 of Egypt.
 Two films are currently in the courts. 'The Emignt was banned this year after
 a long court case, but the decision is under appeal. A group of Islamic lawyers had
 brought the case in 1994, arguingthat it violated Islamic tenets in its portrayal of
 the life of the Prophet Joseph. Despite the court case, the film has represented
 Egypt in several international festivals. The second case is against the film "Birds
 of Darkness," the plaintiffs charging that it is insulting to lawyers. The case is still
 penling.
 The inistry of Information owns and operates all domestic television produc-
 tions. In the past, it has censored serious artistic works that criticized the Govern-
 ment or dealt with social problems from a nongovernmental perspective. The Min-
 istry also censored nine articles of the English language weekly, The Middle East
 Times, during the year. Two of the articles had contained allegations of human
 rights violations. According to the editor, in October an issue of the newspaper al-
 Dustuur was confiscated because of previously published criticism of the Israeli Gov-
 ernment.
 Moderate Muslims and secularist writers continue to find themselves under at-
 tack by Islamic extremists.
 In August the Court of Cassation, Egypt's highest court of appeal, supported a
 1995 lower court ruling against Cairo University professor Nasr Abu Zeid. In 1993
 Islamic fundamentalist lawyers had asked the courts to rule that Abu Zeid was an
 apostate because of his controversial interpretation of Koranic teachings. The peti-
 tioners argued that as an apostate, Abu Zeid should not be allowed to remain mar-
 ried to a Muslim woman in a Muslim country. After a lower court threw out this
 suit, an appellate court in June 1995 gave the plaintiffs standing to pursue their
 suit. Jurists and secular intellectuals criticized the court's decision as an infringe-
 ment on the principle of privacy and freedom of expression.
 The Government had joined Abu Zeid in his appeal, and the People's Assembly
 passed two laws during the year designed to derail other such lawsuits. The Hisba
 Law, ratified by the Assembly in late January, limits cases by third parties "on be-
 half of societ. The Assembly also approved in May amendments to an article of
 the Law for Cil and Commercial Procedures requiring the direct personal involve-
 ment of the plaintiff prior to the filing of suits.
 In its decision, the Court of Cassation, which rules on legal technicalities rather
 than the case itself, noted that the Hisba Law and Law 81 were issued after final
 arguments were made by the plaintiffs and the defense, and that the case and the
 lower court ruling were legally valid. Abu Zeid's defense team has filed for a recon-
 sideration by the Court of Cassation, citing major mistakes in the decision against
 Abu Zeid, including the Court's ignoring of the Hisba Law and Law 81. In Septem-
 ber a lower court judge stayed the execution of the decision against Abu Zeid pend-
 ing the outcome of the reconsideration by the Court of Cassation. Meanwhile, Abu
 Zeid and his wife are residing together abroad. In December a Giza court of appeal
 upheld their stay.
 In another Hisba case, a Cairo criminal court ruled against and fined two lawyers
 who brought a case against the actress Youssra and a magazine for printing an al-
 legedly indecent picture of her on the cover.
 The Government does not directly restrict academic freedom at universities. How-
 ever, some university professors claim that the Government tightened its control
 over universities in 1994 when a law was passed authorizing university presidents
 to appoint the deans of the various faculties. Under the previous law, faculty deans
 were elected by their peers. The Government has justified the measure as a means
 to combat Islamist influence on campus.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government continues to
 maintain substantial restrictions on freedom of assembly. Under a 1923 law, citi-
 zens must obtain approval from the Ministry of Interior before holding public meet-
 ings, rallies, and protest marches. Permits are generally granted for rallies held in-
 doors or on university campuses.
 The Government continues to maintain substantial restrictions on freedom of as-
 sociation. Under Law 32 of 1964, the Ministry of Social Affairs has extensive author-
 ity over associations and private foundations, including the right to license and dis-
 solve them, confiscate their properties, appoint members to their boards, and inter-
 cede in other administrative matters. Licenses may be revoked if such organizations
 engage in political or religious activities. The law authorizes the Ministry to "merge
 two or more associations to achieve a similar function," a provision that may be
 used to merge an undesirable organization out of existence.

 Since 1985 the Government has refused under Law 32 to license the Egyptian Or-
 ganization for Human Rights (EOHR) and the Arab Organization for Human Rights
 (AOHR) on grounds that they are political organizations. Nevertheless both con-
 tinue to operate openly (see Section 4). Amnesty International, which haa a petition
 pending for legal status for its local office, closed its local office this year for internal
 reasons.
 Under 1993 legislation on professional syndicates, an association must elect its
 governing board by at least 50 percent of its general membership. Failing a quorum,
 a second election must be held in which at least 33 percent of the membership votes
 for the board. If such a quorum is impossible, the judiciary may appoint a caretaker
 board until new elections can be set. The law was adopted to prevent well-organized
 minorities, specifically Islamists, from capturing or retaining the leadership of pro-
 fessional syndicates. Members of these syndicates have reported that Islamists have
 used such irregular electoral techniques as physically blocking polling places, and
 limiting or changing the location of polling sites.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of belief and the
 practice of religious rites. However, the Government places clear restrictions on this
 right. Most Egyptians are Muslim, but at least 10 per cent of the population, 5.7
 million poplebeiong to the Coptic Orthodox Church, the largest Christian minority
 in the Middle East. There are other small Christian denominations, as well as a
 Jewish community numbering fewer than 50 individuals.
 For the most part, members of the non-Muslim minority worship without harass-
 ment and maintain links with coreligionists abroad. Under the Constitution, how-
 ever, Islam is the official state religio n and primary source of legislation. Accord-
 ingly, religious practices that conflict with Islamic law are prohibited. While tech-
 nically proselytizing is not a crime, Christians have been arrested on charges of ridi-
 culing or insulting heavenly religions and/or inciting secular strife. At least one
 Christian was detained in 1996 on charges of ridicubing or insulting heavenly reli-
 gions and/or inciting secular strife.
 There are no restrictions on non-Muslims converting to Islam. However, Muslims
 face legal problems if they convert to another faith. Authorities have charged a few
 converts to Christianity under provisions of the Penal Code that prohibit the use
 of religion to "ignite strife, degrade any of the heavenly religions or harm national
 unity or social peace." In other cases, authorities have charged such persons with
 violating laws against falsifying documents, since Muslim converts to Christianity
 sometimes attempt to change their names and religious affiliation on their identi-
 fication cards and other official documentation to reflect their conversion. These
 laws were upheld in a 1980 court decision. There were no confirmed reports of indi-
 viduals detained during the year under these laws.
 There were credible reports that state security officers in Cairo detained, interr-
 gated, and, in at least two cases, physically abused several Christians and converts
 to Christianity, in an effort to obtain information about the identities and activities
 of other converts.
 An 1856 Ottoman Decree still in force requires non-Muslims to obtain what is
 now a presidential decree to build or repair a place of worship. Coptic Christians
 maintain that they frequently have been unable to obtain such authorization, that
 such permits have been delayed, or that they have been blocked by the security
 forces from using the authorizations that have been issued. Other restrictions of the
 1856 Decree were odified in 1934 into a ist of 10 provisions that the poice and
 other authorities should investigate prior to issuance of a presidential decree. A
 local human rights organization brought a legal case during the year requesting the
 abolition of the Ottoman Decree against Copts, including abolition of the 10 provi-
 sions. The case remains before the court.
 As a result of these restrictions, some communities use private buildings and
 apartments for religious services. Between 1992 and 1995, the situation improved
 somewhat as the Government has increased the number of building permits issued
 to Christian communities to an average of more than 20 per year, compared to the
 average of 5 permits issued annually in the 1980's. Durnng the year, the Govern-
 ment issued 10 permits for the construction of new churches and 8 for repairs and
 reconstruction. While Christian and Muslim reformers urge the abolition of the
 Ottoman Decree, Islamists who oppose the spread of Christianity in Egypt defend
 the building restrictions.
 In 1994 the Alexandria government closed two buildings near the city that had
 been used by Coptic Evangelical Christians since 1990 or churc  activities. The
 Government claims that the church lacked a building permit. Lawyers for the
 church point out that the closures violated previous court rulings upholding the
 right to conduct religious services in private buildings without prior government ap-
 proval. They also pointed out that the closed buildings were located in an area
 
 
 1251
 where unlicensed buildings are common. At year's end, the case remained with an
 administrative court in Alexandria.
 The Government continued its efforts to extend legal controls to all mosques,
 which by law must be licensed. The Government appoints and pays the salaries of
 the imams officiating in mosques, and proposes themes for and monitors sermons.
 Of the country's approximately 70,000 mosques, slightly less than half remain unli-
 censed and operate outside the control of government authorities. In an effort to
 combat Islamic extremists, the Government announced that it intended to bring the
 remaining 30,000 unauthorized mosques under its control during the next 5 years.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens and foreigners are free to travel within Egypt except in certain
 military areas. The Government during the year removed the reuirement for most
 foreigners to register within 7 days of their arrival in Egypt. ales who have not
 completed compulsory military service may not travel abroad or emigrate, although
 this restriction can be deferred or bypassed. Unmarried women must have permis-
 sion from their fathers to obtain passports and travel; married women of any age
 require the same permission from their husbands. Citizens who leave the country
 have the right to return.
 In recent years, the Government has denied permission to a small number of
 Christian converts from Islam to travel abroad. In October 1994, security officials
 arrested Ibrahim Sharaf Al Din, an Egyptian convert, at Cairo Airport as he at-
 tempted to enter Egypt from Kenya, where he had been granted asylum and resided
 with his family since the early 1980's. Sharaf Al Din was imprisoned for 8 months
 while prosecutors investigated the circumstances of his conversion. He was released
 without charge in June 1995. However, according to a local human rights group, in
 order to leave Egypt he is required to file a lawsuit in order to obtain a court order
 that indicates that he is not banned from leaving the country.
 The Constitution forbids the deportation of citizens and aliens granted political
 asylum. Egypt grants first asylum for humanitarian reasons or in the event of inter-
 nal turmoil in neighboring countries. Asylum seekers generally are screened by rep-
 resntatives of the United Nations High Commisioer or Refugees (UNHCR), whose
 recommendations regarding settlement are forwarded to the Ministries of Interior
 and Foreign Affairs tor fial determination. Refugees accepted by the Government
 are permitted to live and work, but cannot acquire Egyptian citizenship, with rare
 exceptions. During the year, the Government accepted over 6,000 refugees, including
 3,000 Somalis and 1,400 Sudanese, for temporary resettlement.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) dominates the 454-seat People's As-
 sembly, the hura Council, local governments, the mass media, labor, the large pub-
 lic sector, and the licensing of new political parties, newspapers, and private organi-
 zations to such an extent that, as a practical matter, citizens do not have a mean-
 ingful ability to change their government.
 In 1993 PrsidentHosn Mubarak was eleted unopposed to a third 6-year term
 by the People's Assembly. In October of that year, his reelection was approved by
 96 percent of the voters in a national referendum. Under the Constitution, the eler-
 trate is not presented with a choice among competing presidential candidates. Two
 opposition parties urged the public to boycott the referendum, and two other parties
 urged the public to vote against the President. The other opposition parties en-
 dorsed the President's candidacy.
 Over 100 losing candidates in the fall 1995 legislative elections filed complaints
 in the administrative courts, alleging ballot-rigging and other irregularities. The
 courts agreed with most of these claims, but while the courts have the authority
 to rule on whether irregularities took place, they may not remove an elected Mem-
 ber of the Assembly, a right that the Assembly claims solely for itself, under the
 concept of parliamentary sovereignty. To date the Assembly has not called for any
 new by-elections to cover these cases.                            _ d
 The Assembly debates government proposals, and members exercise their author-
 ity to call cabinet ministers to explain policy. The executive initiates almost all leg-
 isation. Nevertheless, the Assembly maintains the authority to challenge or re-
 strain the executive in the areas of economic and social policy, but it may not modify
 the budget except with the Government's approval. The Assembly exercises limited
 influence in the areas of security and foreign policy, and there is little oversight of
 the Interior Ministry's use of Emergency Law powers. Many executive branch initia-
 tives and policies are carried out by regulation through ministerial decree without
 legislative oversight. The military budget is prepared by the executive and not de-
 bated publicly. Roll-call votes in the Assembly arerare. Votes are generally reported
 
 
 1252
 in aggregate terms of yeas and nays, and thus constituents have no independent
 method of checking a member's voting record.
 There are 15 recognized opposition parties. The law empowers the Government
 to bring felony charges against those who form a party without a license. New par-
 ties must be approved by the Parties Committee, a semi-official body including a
 substantial majority of members from the ruling NDP and some members from
 among the independents and opposition parties. Decisions of the Parties Committee
 may be appealed to the civil courts. The arties Committee rejected the applications
 of at least four new parties this year, those applications and several from-last year
 are before the courts for review.
 According to the law, which prohibits political parties based on religion, the Mus-
 lim Brotherhood is an illegal political organization. Muslim Brothers are publicly
 known and openly speak their views, but have come under increasing pressure from
 the Government (see Sections 1.d. and I.e.). Some have served in the Assembly as
 independents or as members of other recognized parties.
 Women and minorities are underrepresented in government and politics. The Con-
 stitution reserves 10 Assembly seats for presidential appointees, which the Presi-
 dent traditionally has used to assure representation for women and Coptic Chris-
 tians. Five women and no Copts were elected in 1995; of the 10 presidential appoint-
 ments, 6 were Copts and 4 were women. The ruling NDP nominated no Coptic can-
 didates in the 1995 parliamentary election. Three women and two Coptic Christians
 are in the Cabinet.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government refuses to license local human rights groups as private entities
 under Law 32 of 1964 (see section 2.b.). Since 1986 the Government has refused to
 license the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) on grounds that it is
 a political organization and duplicates the activities of an existing, although mori-
 bund, human rights group (see Section 2.b.). The EOHR has appealed the denial in
 the courts, and continues to conduct activities openly, pending a final judicial deter-
 mination of its status.
 The Arab Organization for Human Rights, EOHR's parent organization, has a
 long-standing request for registration as a foreign organization with the Ministry of
 Foreign Affairs. The issue remains pending.
 A request by Amnesty International foriegal status for its local chapter had been
 pending with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for 6 years, until the office was closed
 or internal reasons. In the meantime it was allowed to conduct limited activities.
 Despite their nonrecognition, the EOHR and other groups sometimes enjoy the co-
 operation of government officials. The Government allows EOHR field workers to
 visit prisons, to call on some government officials, and to receive funding from for-
 eign human rights organizations. Representatives from EOHR met this year with
 Speaker of the Assembly Fathy Sorour. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs acilitated
 entry into the country or Africans in a training seminar held by EOHR, and the
 Supreme Constitutional Court cosponsored a seminar on human rights.
 There were no reports during the year that the Government banned meetings of
 human rights groups, although the Government has on occasion made the holding
 of such meetings difficult.
 Some human rights organizations have found requests for conference space turned
 down for "security reasons" or reservations later canceled for "maintenance rea-
 sons."
 Other human rights organizations, such as the Center for Human Rights Legal
 Aid, are registered with the Government as corporations under commercial or civil
 law, thus avoiding the obstacles posed by law (see Section 2.b.) In 1995 the Ministry
 of Justice issued a nonbinding advisory ruling stating that such organizations prop-
 erly should be considered nongovernmental organizations as defined by Law 32 and
 registered accordingly, or face punitive action. However, the Government did not
 close down any group during the year.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equality of the sexes and equal treatment of non-
 Muslims, but aspects of the law and many traditional practices discriminate against
 women and Christians.
 Women.-Family violence against women occurs and is reflected in press accounts
 of specific incidents. According to recent statistics, one out of every three women
 who have ever been married has been beaten at least once during marriage. Among
 those who have been beaten, less than half have ever sought help. In general neigh-
 
 
 1253
 bors and extended family members intervene to limit incidents of domestic violence.
 Abuse within the family is rarely discussed publicly, owing to the value attached
 to privacy in this traditional society. Several nongovernmental organizations have
 begun offering counseling, legal aid, and other services to women Who are victims
 of domestic violence. 'Honor killings" are not prevalent, but when they do occur, the
 punishment is generally lighter that in other cases of murder.
 The law provides for equality of the sexes, but aspects of the law and many tradi-
 tional practices discriminate against women. By law unmarried women under 21
 must have permission from their fathers to obtain passports and travel; married
 women of any age require the same permission from their husbands (see Section
 2.d.). Only males can confer citizenship. In rare cases this means that children born
 to Egyptian mothers and stateless fathers are themselves stateless.
 Laws affecting marriage and personal status generally correspond to an individ-
 ual's religion, which is Islam for most Egyptians. A 1979 liberalization of the Family
 Status Law strengthening a Muslim woman's rights to divorce and child custody
 was repealed in 1985 after it was found unconstitutional for conflicting with Islamic
 law. A new marriage contract for Muslim women was proposed in 1995, to replace
 the current one drafted in 1931. It stipulates premarital negotiations on a wide vari-
 ety of issues, including the woman's right to work, study and travel abroad, and di-
 vorce settlements. Government approval is still pending.
 Under Islamic law non-Muslim males must convert to Islam to marry Muslim
 women, but non-Musfim women need not convert to marry Muslim men. Muslim fe-
 male heirs receive half the amount of a male heir's inheritance, while Christian wid-
 ows of Muslims have no inheritance rights. A sole female heir receives half her par-
 ents' estate; the balance goes to designated male relatives. A sole male heir inherits
 all his parents' property. Male Muslim heirs face strong social pressure to provide
 for all family members who need assistance. However, this does not always occur.
 Women have employment opportunities in government, medicine, law, academia,
 the arts, and, to a lesser degree, in business. According to government figures,
 women constitute 17 percent of private business owners, and occupy 25 percent of
 the managerial positions in the four major national banks. There are 123 women
 officers in the Egyptian diplomatic service, including 6 ambassadors and 7 consuls
 general. There are 3 women state counselors in the administrative court system.
 However, there are no women state prosecutors or judges in the civil court system.
 Although there is no legal basis to prohibit female judges, a woman under consider-
 ation for promotion to magistrate was denied the promotion on the basis of gender
 in 1993 and is suing the Government. Social pressure against women pursuing a
 career is strong, and some womens' advocates say that a resurgent Islamic fun-
 damentalist trend limits further gains. Women's rights advocates also pint to other
 discriminatory traditional or cultural attitudes and practices such as female genital
 mutilation (FGM) and the traditional male relatives role in enforcing chastity and
 appropriate sexual conduct.
 There are a growing number of active women's rights groups working in diverse
 areas including reforming the Personal Status Code, educating women on their legal
 rights combating FGM, and rewriting the marriage contract.
 Chiidreun.-The Government remains committed to the protection of children's
 welfare within the limits of its budgetary resources. Many of the resources for chil-
 dren's welfare are provided by international donors, especially in the field of child
 immunization. Child labor is widespread, despite the Government's commitment to
 eradicate it (see Section 6.d.).
 The Government provides public education, which is compulsory until the age of
 15. In education the Government treats boys and girls equally at all levels of edu-
 cation, although only 74 percent of girls attend school. Literacy rates reflect this dis-
 parity: Female literacy is 34 percent, while male literacy is 63 percent.
 The Government enacted a new Child Law in March. The law provides for more
 privileges, protection, and care for children in general. Six of the laws's 144 articles
 set advantageous rules for working children (see Section 6.d.). Other prvisions in-
 clude: Employers to set up or contract with a child care center if they employ more
 than 100 women; the right of rehabilitation for disabled children; defendants be-
 tween the ages of 16 and 18 may not be sentenced to capital punishment, hard labor
 for life, or temporary hard labor; and defendants under the age of 15 may not be
 placed in preventive custody although the prosecution may order that they e lodged
 in an "observation house" and be summoned upon request.
 In July following the death by hemorrhage of an i1-year-old glrl, the Minister of
 Health and Population issued a decree caling for an end to the practice of FGM
 and prohibiting its performance by nonmedical and medical practioners. FGM is
 wide condemned by international health experts as damaging to both physical and
 psychological health. Statistics on the prevalence of FGM vary, but Government and
 
 
 1254
 private sources agree it is common. A recent study places the percentage of Egyp-
 tian women who have undergone FGM at 97 percent. The act is generally performed
 on girls between the ages of 7 and 10, probably with equal prevalence among Mus-
 lims and Coptic Christians. The Government broadcasts television programs con-
 demning the practice, and a number of NGO's work actively to educate the public
 of the health hazards attached to the practice. A discussion of FGM and its dangers
 is being added to the curriculum at medical schools and in training courses given
 to traditional birth attendants. The new Sheik of Al-Azhar, the senior Muslim lead-
 er in the country, has stated that FGM is not required by Islamic tenets. However
 despite strn government efforts to eradicate it, it is unlikely that the practice will
 disappear quickly due  t raditional and family pressures.
 People With Disabilities.-Thero are approximately 5.7 million disabled persons,
 of whom 1.5 million are severely disabled. The Government makes serious efforts
 to address their rights: It works closely with United Nations agencies and other
 international aid donors to design job-training programs for the disabled. The Gov-
 ernment also seeks to increase the public's awareness of the capabilities of the dis-
 abled by using television programming, the print media, and educational material
 in public schools.
 By law, all businesses must designate 5 percent of their jobs for the disabled, who
 are exempt from normal literacy requirements. Although there is no legislation
 mandating access to public accommodations and transportation, the disabled may
 ride government-owned mass transit buses without charge, are given priority in ob-
 taining telephones, and receive reductions on customs duties for private vehicles.
 Religious Minorities.-The Constitution provides that all citizens are equal before
 the law and prohibits discrimination baseddon relgion. For the most part these con-
 stitutional protections are upheld by the Government. However, discrimination
 against Christians still exist.__                                       .
 The approximately 5.7 million Coptic Christians are the objects of occasional vio-
 lent assaults by Muslim extremists. During the year, extremists were responsible
 for kiling at least 22 Copts, most in the Minya and Assiuyutgovernorates in uppe
 Egypt, where about 30 to 40 percent of the inhabitants are C   lstian. Acts of vio-
 lence also were reported against churches and Copt-owned businesses; some carried
 out by extremists, but others committed by ordinary citizens. Rumors of church re-
 pairs or building without permits occasionally reslted in anti-Christian rioting by
 citizens. In one incident in the delta village of Kafr Demyan, local newspapers re-
 ported that the rioters were incited by Muslim preachers who utilized mosque loud-
 speakers to call for retaliation against the perceived violations.
 Some Christians have complained     the Government is lax in protecting Coptic
 lives and property. Security forces arrest extremists who perpetrate violence against
 Copts, but some members of the Coptic community do not believe that the Govern-
 ment is vigorous in its efforts to prevent attacks and does little to correct nonviolent
 forms of discrimination, including its own.
 There were reports of forced conversions of Coptic children to Islam, but even
 human rights groups frnd it extremely difcult to determine the actual degree of
 oripulsion used, as most cases involve a Coptic girl converting to Islam to ma
 a Muslim boy. According to the Government, thegirl in such cases must meet with
 her family, with her priest, and with thhe  ad of her church before she is allowed
 to convert. However, there are credible reports of government harassment of Chris-
 tian families attempting to regain custody of their daughters, and of the failure of
 the authorities to uphold the lawha ththat a marriage of a girl under 16 is
 prohibited and between the ages of 16 and 21 is illegal without the approval and
 presence of her guardian.
 Government discriminatory practices include: Suspected statistical underrepresen-
 tation of the size of the Christian population; anti-Christian discrimination in edu-
 cation; failure to admit Christians into schoolrists o  r teto become Arabic
 teachers since the curriculum involves study of the Koran; the production of some
 Islamic television programs with anti-Christian themes; job discrimination in the
 public sectort-the polie, the armed forces, and other government agencies; reported
 discrimination against Christians in staff appointments at universities; and their
 underrepresentation in government. There are no Coptic governors and no Copts in
 the upper ranks of the military, police, or diplomatic service.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers may join trade unions but are not required
 to do so. A union local, or workers' committee, may be formed if 50 employees ex-
 press a desire to organize. Most union members, about 25 per cent of the labor force,
 are emloyed by state-owned enterprises. The law stipulates that "high administra-
 tive" officials in government and the public sector may not join unions.
 
 
 1255
 There are 23 industrial unions, all required to belong to the Egyptian Trade
 Union Federation (ETUF), the sole legally recognized labor federation. The Inter-
 national Labor Organization's Committee of Experts repeatedly has emphasized
 that a law requiring all trade unions to belong to a single federation infringes on
 the freedom of association. The Government has shown no sign that it intends to
 accept the establishment of more than one federation. The ETUF leadership asserts
 that it actively promotes worker interests and that there is no need for another fed-
 eration. ETUF officials have close relations with the NDP, and some are members
 of the People's Assembly or the Shura Council. They speak vigorously on behalf of
 worker concerns, but public confrontations between ETUF and the Government are
 rare. Disputes are more often resolved by consensus behind closed doors.
 The labor laws do not adequately provide statutory authorization for the rights
 to strike and to engage in collective bargaining. Even though the right to strike is
 not guaranteed, strikes occur. The Government considers strikes a form of public
 disturbance and hence illegal.
 Only a few strikes took place in either the public or private sector during the
 year, mainly over wage and dismissal questions. No violence was reported in any
 of the strikes.
 Some unions within ETUF are affiliated with international trade union organiza-
 tions. Others are in the process of becoming affiliated.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Under the law, unions may
 negotiate work contracts with public sector enterprises if the latter agree to such
 negotiations, but unions otherwise lack collective bargaining power in the state sec-
 tor. Under current circumstances, collective bargaining does not exist in any mean-
 ingful sense because the Government sets wages, benefits, and job classifications by
 law. Larger firms in the private sector generally adhere to such government-man-
 dated standards.
 Labor law and practice are the same in the export processing zones (EPZ's) as in
 the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The criminal code authorizes sen-
 tences of hard labor for some crimes.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Under the new Child Law (see
 Section 5), the minimum age for employment is 14 in non-agricultural work. Provin-
 cial governors, with the approval of the Minister of Agriculture, can authorize sea-
 sonal work for children between the ages of 12 to 14 years, provided that duties are
 not hazardous and do not interfere with schooling. Preemployment training for chil-
 dren under the age of 12 is prohibited. It is prohibited for children to work for more
 than 6 hours a day, including 1 or more breaks totaling at least 1 hour. Children
 are not to work overtime, during their weekly day off, between 8 pm and 7 am, or
 more than 4 hours continuously. Education is compulsory until the age of 15.
 Ministry of Health figures for 1995 indicate that 2 million children between the
 ages of 6 and 15 are employed. A 1989 study estimated that perhaps 720,000 chil-
 dren work on farms. However, children also work as apprentices in repair and craft
 shops, in heavier industries such as brickmaking and textiles, and as workers in
 leather and carpet-making factories. While local trade unions report that the Min-
 istry of Labor adequately enforces the labor laws in state-owned enterprises, en-
 forcement in the private sector, especially in family-owned enterprises, is lax. Many
 of these children are abused and overworked by their employers and it is unlikely
 that the restrictions in the new Child Law will improve their condition without
 much stricter enforcement on the part of the Government.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-For government and public sector employees,
 the minimum wage is approximately $25 (84 Egyptian pounds) a month for a 6-day,
 42-hour workweek. Base pay is supplemented by a complex system of fringe benefits
 and bonuses that may double or triple a workers take-home pay. It is doubtful that
 the average family could survive on a worker's base pay at the minimum wage rate.
 The minimum wage is also legally binding on the private sector, and larger private
 companies generally observe it and pay bonuses as well. Smaller firms do not al-
 ways pay the minimum wage or bonuses.
 The Ministry of Labor sets worker health and safety standards, which also apply
 in the export processing zones, but enforcement and inspection are uneven. The law
 prohibits employers from maintaining hazardous working conditions, and provides
 legal recourse for employees who are asked to work in such conditions if they refuse.
