 SRI LANKA
 Sri Lanka, an island republic situated off the southern tip of
 India, has suffered from deep communal divisions which have
 adversely affected human rights and which in 1984 flared again
 into incidents of extreme violence. Since independence in
 1948, Sri Lanka has had a democratic system of government
 featuring universal adult suffrage, the rule of law, and an
 independent judiciary. The present Constitution, which came
 into force in 1978, guarantees the fundamental rights of all
 citizens and permits citizens who believe those rights have
 been violated to petition the Supreme Court for redress.
 In 1977, the United National Party (UNP) headed by J. R.
 Jayewardene won an overwhelming victory and Jayewardene became
 Prime Minister. Under the new Constitution, featuring an
 executive president independent of Parliament, Jayewardene
 became President and in 1982 was elected to a six-year term.
 In 1982 a Controversial referendum was approved extending
 until 1989 the term of the Parliament elected in 1977.
 The people are an ethnic and religious mixture: 74 percent
 are Sinhalese, mostly Buddhists; 18 percent are Tamils,
 predominantly Hindu; 7 percent are Muslims of varying ethnic
 origin; and the remaining 1 percent are the descendants of
 European colonists, Malays, and others. Two thirds of the
 Tamils are Sri Lankan Tamils whose presence on the island
 dates back many centuries. The rest are so-called Indian
 Tamils, whose forebears were brought from India in the 19th
 century to work on the country's tea plantations. Many Indian
 Tamils are classified as 'stateless.-
 Some Sri Lankan Tamils are pressing for the creation of a
 separate Tamil state, "Tamil Eelam." Most Sinhalese, Muslins,
 and Indian Tamils oppose this objective of dividing the
 country. Representatives elected by Sri Lankan Tamils in
 Tamil-majority areas call for an independent state, but also
 have negotiated with the Government over proposals which would
 permit Tamils in those areas to have miore control over their
 local affairs. Although the larger part of all Sri Lankan
 Tamils live outside Tamil-majority areas, some of these also
 support the separatist goal.
 Since the mid-1970's young Tamil militants have engaged in
 acts of terrorism. They claim that peaceful political means
 nave failed to achieve autonomy or to satisfy other Tamil
 demands concerning language, education, employment, and fair
 treatment under tne law and by security forces. Loosely
 organized into several groups, some of which pursue intense
 rivalries with one another, the terrorists are generally
 referred to as "Tamil Tigers." The Government claims that
 these groups receive substantial financial assistance from
 expatriate Tamils and that many terrorists have received
 paramilitary training and arms abroad, particularly in India's
 state of Tamil Nadu.
 In 1984 the conflict between the 'Tigers" and the security
 forces in the North and East escalated significantly. The
 Government responded to attacks against security forces in the
 North, which had resulted in considerable damage and loss of
 lite. It established a "surveillance zone" around the
 northern coastline to prevent the alleged flow of arms and
 terrorists from India.

 SRI LANKA
 The great majority of Sri Lanka's security forces is
 Sinhalese. About 5.5 percent of policemen and 10 percent of
 police officers are Tamils, including some in senior
 positions. The representation of Tamils in the armed forces
 is smaller. All military training is in the Sinhala or
 English languages.
 The 1979 Prevention of Terrorism Act gives the Government
 special powers, including the right to make arrests without
 warrants and to extend detention, which the Government asserts
 it needs to expedite investigation of terrorist incidents.
 Critics, such as the International Commission of Jurists,
 regard the Act as a threat to human rights. In 1982 the Act
 became a formal, permanent part of the law. In 1983,
 following local elections and parliamentary by-elections, the
 Government declared a state of emergency to deal with
 anticipated violence such as that which had occurred after
 previous elections. Parliament overwhelmingly approved and
 has almost unanimously renewed the state of emergency every
 month since then. In September 1984, the Government relaxed
 certain provisions of the emergency regulations in
 Sinhalese-majority areas to permit campaigning in two
 parliamentary by-elections in October.
 Persistent terrorism by Tamil separatists has provided the
 Government with its rationale for continuing the state of
 emergency. In one period alone of separatist violence in
 1984, August 16 to September 16, there were, according to
 government figures, 86 incidents of terrorism directed at
 government- and privately-owned vehicles, banks, and
 factories, government offices, police stations, and security
 forces, resulting in the deaths of nine soldiers and
 civilians. Some Tamils described these attacks as retaliation
 for illegal police and military attacks on innocent members of
 te Tamil community. The Government acknowledged that on at
 least one occasion in 1984 security forces acted against
 civilians in response to terrorist attacks.
 The Government also took steps to ease the communal tensions
 which flared in 1983. In January it called the All-Party
 Conference (APC) to discuss the communal problem and invited
 all political parties, including the Tamil United Liberation
 Front (TULF), and representatives of every religious and
 ethnic community. The Sri Lanka Freedom Party, the most
 significant Sinhalese-based opposition party, attended early
 sessions of the APC reluctantly, then withdrew.
 In September, the President enunciated what he described as
 "points of consensus" reached by the Conference. At the APC's
 December 14 meeting he announced the Government would embody
 these ideas in legislative proposals. Although the proposals
 as presented fell short of the demands of some Tamils for
 regional autonomy and devolution of government powers to
 Tamil-majority areas, Tamil leaders continued to participate
 in the APC. But by year's end, the TULF had rejected the
 proposals and the President withdrew them. TULF discussions
 with the Government appeared to have ceased. It was unclear
 whether talks would resume in 1985.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The death toll from "Tamil Tiger* terrorist attacks increased
 substantially in 1984. They are believed to have killed 63
 policemen of whom 11 were Tamils, 29 military personnel, and 4.
 government officials. The Government says that 281 civilians,
 including 179 Tamils, were Killed by Tamil terrorists in 1984.
 In 1984 security forces at times retaliated indiscriminately
 against the civilian population in the North and East in
 reaction to terrorist attacks on the armed forces. Most
 victims of such attacks were Tamils, but some Sinhalese and
 Muslims also were killed. On March 28, at least 7 civilians
 were killed and as many as 24 injured at Chunnakam on the
 Jaffna Peninsula. The victims, the Government asserts, were
 caught in crossfire when Air Force personnel and terrorists
 clashed. Citizens of Jaffna, however, charge that the Air
 Force men were not attacked but fired at random on unarmed
 civilians in retaliation for the terrorist killings of two of
 their fellow airmen earlier. Following a clash between Navy
 personnel and terrorists near Velvettiturai on August 4,
 soldiers reportedly attacked the town and, according to the
 local citizens' committee, burned 130 houses, 40 shops, 4
 cars, and a number of fishing boats. The Government stated
 that the fishing boats were damaged but denies the other
 charges. The Government also acknowledged that on August 11
 at Mannar, following the killing by a land mine of 6 security
 personnel, security forces burned up to 100 shops, mostly
 owned by Muslims. It has agreed to pay compensation. Foreign
 journalists witnessed troops setting fire to buildings in
 Achchuvely in Jaffna district on August 25, following the
 detonation of a land mine by terrorists. There are credible
 reports that police were responsible for burning the Hartley
 College Library in Point Pedro. The Government has not
 acknowledged police responsibility but reportedly agreed to
 rebuild the library.
 On December 4, a landmine explosion destroyed an Army vehicle
 in Mannar district, killing 1 soldier and injuring 6 others.
 According to credible reports, other soldiers then went on a
 rampage of retaliation, attacking two buses and a nearby post
 office as well as individual bystanders for several miles
 along the road. The reports state that more than 100 people,
 mostly Tamils but also including Muslims and Sinhalese, were
 killed.
 The Government has maintained that some loss of life and
 property damage is the inevitable consequence of efforts to
 combat terrorism. The Government also holds that the
 terrorists purposely seek to provoke firing by security forces
 in crowded public areas to increase popular resentment against
 those forces. The Government has been reluctant to discipline
 the members of the security forces allegedly responsible for
 illegal acts during the July 1983 communal violence and
 since. The Government has "discharged with ignominy" 149 Army
 and Navy personnel who were involved in the killing of several
 civilians and the burning of over 100 homes and shops in
 Trincomalee and the killing of 51 civilians in Jaffna in July
 1983. Tne Government says it has investigated all complaints
 
 
 1388
 SRI LANKA
 of alleged Army involvement in the July 1983 disturbances but
 that the evidence was inadequate to sustain indictments,
 noting however that the Army, acting under its own
 disciplinary rules, has so far dismissed 65 of its personnel.
 Critics charge that there is ample evidence to bring charges
 against some police and military personnel, and that the
 Government's failure to prosecute shows that the security
 forces nay attack Tamils with impunity. Although no action
 has been taken against security force personnel alleged to
 have retaliated against civilians in 1984, investigations
 reportedly remain under way.
 In May, it was reported that a Tamil youth being held for
 questioning died in custody. There were at least eight other
 known instances in 1984 when ordinary criminals (as
 distinguished from those suspected or convicted under the
 Prevention of Terrorism Act) died in police custody. In the
 past, a magisterial inquiry sometimes has resulted in
 investigations of police conduct, but no police official is
 known to have been convicted.
 In June the Government altered controversial emergency
 regulations which had allowed disposition without post mortem
 or inquests of the bodies of persons killed by security
 forces. In cases where a person has died in events involving
 the security forces, someone of the rank of high court judge
 now will conduct an inquest and report his findings to the
 Attorney General who will determine if an indictable offense
 has been committed. If such a determination is made the
 ordinary law will take its course. There have been no
 indications that the new procedures have been used.
 b. Disappearance
 There are unconfirmed but credible allegations of
 disappearances of Tamils in the Jaffna area, with some Tamils
 claiming that their family members were taken away by security
 forces and neither seen nor heard from again. Other Tamils
 who disappeared were later found to have been killed by Tamil
 separatists in "lamp post" executions. Notes often are found
 on the bodies of such victims charging that they were
 informants of the Government. There also have been many
 Tamils, especially young men claiming to fear both the
 security forces and the terrorists, who have fled abroad to
 India, Southeast Asia, and the West.
 The wife of a Sri Lankan Freedom Party organizer, a Sinhalese,
 charged that her husband was assaulted and arrested by armed
 policemen on July 27, 1983. She began habeas corpus
 proceedings and on September 1, 1983, the Court of Appeal
 ordered police to produce the husband. The police denied that
 he was taken into custody. The Court then directed the Chief
 Magistrate of Colombo to inquire into the wife's allegations.
 Hearings in this case were concluded on June 28; the Chief
 Magistrate's report of his findings was sent to the Court of
 Appeal but has not been made public.
 On May 10, a U.S. citizen contract employee for a project
 financed by the U.S. Agency for International Development and
 his wife were kidnapped in Jaffna by the Eelam People's
 Revolutionary Liberation Front, a Tamil separatist group,
 which in ransom notes charged that the couple were CIA agents
 and demanded 2 million dollars and the release of 20
 detainees. Although these conditions were not met, the two
 
 
 1389
 SRI LANKA
 were released unharmed on May 15.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution guarantees that 'no person shall be subjected
 to torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment." Nonetheless, there have been persistent reports
 of torture or ill-treatment by military and police of persons
 detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. In its report
 Torture in the Eighties, Amnesty International noted that
 torture has been a longstanding concern in Sri Lanka under
 both the present and previous administrations, and Freedom
 House also has noted allegations of torture there. Most of
 those allegedly subjected to such treatment have been young
 Tamil males in the North and East who are suspected of ties
 with the "Tigers.* Incidents do occur elsewhere, however.
 Two nen suspected of kidnapping and murdering a schoolboy
 could not appear before a magistrate in April because they had
 been hospitalized following injuries received in "an incident'
 while in police custody. Both had broken left arms.
 Prison conditions in Sri Lanka are not good; many prisons are
 old and overcrowded. One renand prison, designed for 600
 inmates, reportedly contains 6,000. The Government has
 announced plans to build new prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution stipulates that no person 'shall be arrested
 except according to procedure established by law" and that an
 arrested person must be informed of the reason for his
 arrest. Within 24 hours an arrested person is brought before
 a magistrate who may authorize bail or, for serious crimes,
 continued detention. A suspect may be detained up to three
 months without bail, or longer if a court so rules. In one
 case in 1984 the Supreme Court ruled that the fundamental
 rights of a murder suspect were violated when he was arrested
 and held incommunicado for five days before being presented
 before a magistrate. There have been allegations that police
 and security forces, unable to find suspects, have arrested
 and held family members on false charges.
 There are exceptions to normal rules for persons detained
 during a state of emergency or under the Prevention of
 Terrorism Act. Any person arrested under the Act must be
 produced before a magistrate within three days unless the
 Minister of National Security orders the suspect to be
 detained for a period of three months. Such an order may be
 renewed for a period of up to 18 months. The terms of
 detention are set out in this order; detainees do not have the
 same rights as other prisoners regarding visits by family,
 access to lawyers, food, and other conditions of
 incarceration. Suspects detained for violating emergency
 regulations may be held for 90 days before being produced
 before a magistrate.
 In 1984 the Prevention of Terrorism Act was used extensively
 to detain large numbers of Tamil youths in the North and
 East. According to the Government, 432 persons were arrested
 under the Act in 1984. At year's end 326 of those still were
 being detained, along with 46 who were arrested before 1984.
 In August the Army requested parents in two towns on the north
 coast, where there had been clashes between the security
 
 
 1390
 SRI LANKA
 forces and terrorists, to bring their 18 to 25-year-old sons
 to a community center for identification and registration.
 Over 530 youths then were taken to an Army camp in the far
 South, in the Sinhalese-majority area, for questioning. Late
 in the year 30 remained in custody. Critics of the government
 action charged that these youths were neither a threat to
 national security nor suspected of having committed offenses.
 Knowledgeable sources reported that the youths taken to the
 South in this and similar instances have been given adequate
 food and shelter and subsequently returned to their home areas
 unless found to have been involved with illegal separatist
 activities.
 The Constitution empowers the Court of Appeal to issue writs
 of habeas corpus. Relatives took advantage of this provision
 to gain access to detainees several times in 1984. Persons
 held under the Prevention of Terrorism Act may be permitted to
 see lawyers of their choice. The Government, however,
 sometimes is slow to grant access and in some cases has
 imposed strict conditions on such visits. Bail is available
 for most persons arrested, but it cannot be granted to persons
 held under the Act.
 According to government figures, 6,780 people were arrested
 for looting, arson, and mischief during the July 1983
 disturbances, including 500 detained for curfew violations.
 To date about 3,000 have been released because of insufficient
 evidence, about 2,300 suspected or charged with less serious
 crimes have been released on bail, and about 1,500 still are
 under detention while their cases are being investigated by
 police. As of July 1, 1984, the Attorney General's Department
 had filed 37 com~plaints charging offense against the person,
 164 charging offenses against property, and 103 charging minor
 offenses. A number of cases have gone to trial and there have
 been some acquittals.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Sri Lankan law derives from the British common law tradition.
 The Constitution guarantees the independence of the judiciary,
 and lawyers and judges are held in high esteem. An accused
 person is entitled by the Constitution to--and under normal
 circumstances receives--a fair trial in open court, is
 represented by counsel of his choice, and is apprised of the
 charges and the evidence against him. Although trial by jury
 is the custom, juries are not provided in trials under the
 Prevention of Terrorism Act on the grounds that jury members
 could be intimidated.
 The Chief Justice and all judges of the Supreme Court, Court
 of Appeal, and High Court are appointed by the President. The
 Chief Justice and two Supreme Court judges comprise a Judicial
 Service Commission which appoints, transfers, and dismisses
 all lower court judges and magistrates. Prior to February
 1984, it also appointed all senior attorneys. In February,
 however, Parliament passed the Eighth Amendment to the
 Constitution giving the President power to appoint senior
 attorneys, which many lawyers regard as a threat to the
 independence of the judiciary.
 At the President's urging, Parliament appointed a Select
 Committee to investigate the Chief Justice, who was accused of
 actions inconsistent with nis position when he made public
 statements about government policies and actions. Fifty-seven
 
 
 1391
 SRI LANKA
 members of Parliament then presented a resolution calling for
 the President to remove the Chief Justice. Another Select
 Committee was appointed in September to inquire and report
 into the allegations contained in the resolution. Because
 submissions on the Chief Justice's behalf took longer than
 expected, the Select Committee could not report before the
 Chief Justice reached age 65 and retired.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government respects individual privacy and the sanctity of
 the family and the home, and the judiciary has a good record
 ot upholding rights to privacy in those cases which reach the
 High Court or the Supreme Court. However, critics of the
 Prevention of Terrorism Act and of the actions of government
 forces in Tamil-majority areas claim that police and military
 personnel often enter the homes of Tamils without cause. In
 ordinary circumstances, search and arrest warrants are
 required in order to enter private premises. Under the Act,
 however, police officers above a certain rank and less senior
 officers authorized by them in writing may, without a warrant,
 enter and search any premises and seize "any document or
 thing" when there is a presumption or evidence of support for,
 or involvement with, unlawful activity.
 Monitoring of telephones is not known to be a common practice,
 despite allegations by some critics of the Government that it
 taps their telephone lines.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees "freedom of speech and expression
 including publication," but it also permits these guarantees
 to be restricted "as may be prescribed by law in the interests
 of national security." Sri Lankans are not detained,
 arrested, or prosecuted for expressing views critical of the
 Government. In practice, reporting on a number of topics was
 censored under emergency regulations or the Prevention of
 Terrorism Act during much of 1984.
 Censorship of articles relating to terrorist activities,
 security operations, postsecondary education, and communal
 matters was imposed in November 1983. When an announcement
 that an Israel Interests Section had been established in Sri
 Lanka produced anti-Israel and anti-government demonstrations,
 the Government acted under the Prevention of Terrorism Act on
 June 11 to impose blanket censorship on all matters pertaining
 to terrorist violence, security operations, training of the
 security forces, armed robberies, protests against the Israel
 Interests Section, and any matter which would affect national
 harmony or public order. This censorship covered both Sri
 Lankan media and reports by foreign correspondents in Sri
 Lanka. It was relaxed after 23 days, but censorship under
 emergency regulations still applied to terrorist activities,
 security operations, and matters prejudicial to harmony and
 public order. Following violence at Colombo University in
 June, censors prohibited news accounts about student unrest,
 police actions, and some other activities at schools and
 universities. On October 8, the Government imposed censorship
 on reports of the All-Party Conference, requiring the media to
 publish only the official report of conference proceedings.
 
 
 1392
 SRI LANKA
 At the request of four opposition parties the Government
 lifted restrictions on the publication of speeches and
 distribution of leaflets during two parliamentary
 by-elections. On October 12, the Government removed all
 censorship except on the All-Party Conference's proceedings,
 but required editors to apply *self-censorship" on reports of
 terrorist activities and security operations.
 One publication, however, has been subject to special
 censorship. The Saturday Review, an English-language weekly
 puolished in Jaffna which has advocated the creation of a
 separate Tamil state, was ordered closed on July 1, 1983. It
 was permitted to resume publication in February 1984, but all
 items intended for publication, including sports reports, must
 De submitted to the government censor in Jaffna. In May, the
 Saturday Review challenged the censor in the Supreme Court to
 prove that he did not discriminate against that newspaper.
 The Court found that the censor had lawfully restricted the
 fundamental rights of the newspapers' owners because these
 restrictions were made during a state of emergency and because
 toe Saturday Review is produced in Jaffna where there is
 .considerable public disorder and threats to national
 security.'
 The Government controls the largest circulation newspaper
 group and owns the nation's radio and television services.
 There are many independent newspapers and magazines, including
 the organs of opposition political parties. Although
 independent publications complain of attempts to control
 criticism, differing views appear regularly in both government
 and independent publications.
 Official actions on several occasions in 1984 impinged upon
 press freedom. In 1984 the Government began proceedings
 against an independent newspaper chain for publishing articles
 in January and February 1983 speculating about the possibility
 of an adjustment in exchange rates, on the grounds that
 editors did not obtain prior approval from the Finance
 Ministry and thereby violated the Press Council Law. The case
 will be tried in January 1985. The use of pseudonyms is an
 estaolished tradition in Sri Lankan journalism. In June, the
 Cabinet approved a proposal to ban their use on the grounds
 that aoolishing pseudonyms would prevent "irresponsible"
 statements from appearing in the press. Critics regard the
 proposed ban as a violation of freedom of speech. Although
 the Attorney General ruled that the proposed ban violated
 fundamental rights, the Government announced that it intends
 to go ahead, but it has not yet taken any action. The
 Government continues to prevent distribution of leaflets by
 proscribed political parties and pro-separatism organizations
 by arresting those caught distributing them.
 Academic freedom is respected but political and communal
 violence led to disruptions of the education process in 1984.
 The Government closed several universities at various times
 after violence broke out on campuses.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of assembly and
 association and the right to form and join trade unions. Sri
 Lanka has an abundance of private associations devoted to the
 promotion of business, professional, educational, religious,
 cnaritable, and humanitarian causes. These organizations are
 
 
 1393
 SRI LANKA
 free to maintain ties with international bodies.
 During a state of emergency no group is allowed to hold
 processions or street demonstrations and police are empowered
 to move any stationary group of five or more persons from a
 public place. However, public meetings may be held. A permit
 is required if a loudspeaker is used. The Government relaxed
 emergency regulations to permit all political parties, except
 those proscribed, to hold processions on May Day. In a rare
 incident, on September 9 police using batons and tear gas
 broke up a meeting organized by the opposition Sri Lanka
 Freedom Party (SLFP). The SLFP had received police permission
 to hold the meeting, but it was withdrawn on the eve of the
 meeting, allegedly because the ruling United National Party
 was to hold a meeting in the same town--it did not, in
 fact--and police feared a breach of the peace. A government
 spokesman later claimed that permission could not be given for
 the SLFP meeting because ownership of the land where it was to
 be held is in dispute and granting permission would have
 amounted to recognizing ownership.
 In October, Parliament approved the Government's proposal to
 require six hours prior notice for a procession or march, even
 when no state of emergency is in effect. Opposition members
 of Parliament argued that this change threatens the democratic
 process. Rallies and processions of which the police have not
 been notified may be dispersed only after issuance of a
 warrdnt.
 Sri Lankan workers are permitted to organize, bargain
 collectively, lobby, and strike. In April, for example,
 60U,000 plantation workers went on strike for 10 days for
 better wages and benefits. Public sector employees who come
 under the essential Public Services Act of 1979, however, are
 not permitted to strike. There are more than 1,400 trade
 unions, mostly small, covering approximately one-third of the
 labor force. Workers in the free trade zone northeast of
 Colombo are not permitted to form unions but participate in
 company "associations,* and some workers have gone on strike.
 Most of the largest worker organizations are affiliated with
 political parties, frequently operate as arms of those
 parties, and play a significant role in the political
 process. The largest, the Ceylon Workers Congress, represents
 primarily Indian Tamil estate workers (many of whom are
 *stateless'). Its president is a Tamil and a member of the
 Cauinet. The next largest union is the Jathika Sevaka
 Sangamaya, affiliated with the ruling United National Party.
 A number of unions maintain ties with the International Trade
 Secretariats and are affiliated with the democratically
 oriented International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 Other unions are affiliated with the Communist-dominated World
 Federation of Trade Unions. Sri Lanka is a member of the
 International Labor Organization.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although the Constitution establishes Buddhism as the official
 religion and requires the Government 'to protect and foster*
 Buddhism, it also guarantees the right of all Hindus, Muslims,
 and Christians to practice their religions freely. Most
 members of the majority Sinhalese ethnic group are Buddhists,
 while most Tamils are Hindu (there are Christians from both
 
 
 1394
 SRI LANKA
 groups). However, religious differences generally are not a
 basis for discrimination. Sri Lankans of every faith are free
 to maintain links with coreligionists in other countries and
 to undertake religious travel.
 Two Caminet ministers are assigned the additional portfolios
 of Minister of Muslim Affairs and Minister of Hindu Affairs to
 deal witn issues involving those minority religions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution guarantees every citizen 'freedom of movement
 and of choosing his residence within Sri Lanka' and 'freedom
 to return to Sri Lanka.' These guarantees are honored.
 The present Government removed exit visa requirements imposed
 by its predecessor and now permits virtually unimpeded
 emigration and travel. Sri Lankans of every ethnic group,
 both male and female, have taken advantage of this policy to
 seek better-paying jobs abroad. It is believed that there are
 over 100,000 Sri Lankans working in the Middle East alone.
 Some Tamils, predominantly young men, have traveled abroad and
 sought refugee status or political asylum on the grounds that
 they are members of a persecuted minority. Under the
 Constitution, they are free to return at any time. However,
 one Tamil youth who attempted unsuccessfully to obtain asylum
 in Switzerland and was deported to Sri Lanka was arrested upon
 his return in November 1983. In April 1984, he was discharged
 by a magistrate who found that the Government had no case.
 The Government is reluctant to permit refugees or displaced
 persons from other countries to stay in Sri Lanka while
 seeking permanent residence elsewhere and generally denies
 such persons entry.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Sri Lanka is an open, working, multiparty democracy. Citizens
 elect their president, members of parliament, and local
 government officials by universal adult suffrage. All laws,
 including acts extending the state of emergency, must be
 approved by the Parliament. Voter turnout generally is over
 80 percent. The present Government won 51 percent of the
 popular vote in 1977, 53 in the presidential election of
 October 1982, and 54.5 in the referendum of December 1982
 which extended Parliament's term to 1989.
 Sri Lanka's parties represent many different political views.
 All parties that meet certain requirements may appear on the
 ballot. Generally, opposition parties function freely and
 have their own newspapers, and their activities are covered by
 the national news media. On July 30, 1983, the Government
 proscribed three political parties under emergency regulations
 because it believed these parties fomented or sought to take
 advantage of the July 1983 communal violence. The ban on one
 party was lifted in October 1983 and on another in September
 1984. The Marxist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) still is
 proscribed, but one of its members has begun legal proceedings
 challenging the proscription.
 Tne Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), which historically has
 
 
 1395
 SRI LANKA
 alternated with the ruling UNP in forming governments, is
 currently in disarray largely because the civic rights of its
 leader, former Prime Minister Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike, were
 suspended in 1980 for seven years on the grounds that she had
 exceeded her powers during her tenure as Prime Minister,
 1970-77. In January radical members of the SLFP, including
 Mrs. Bandaranaike's daughter and son-in-law, broke away and
 formed the Sri Lanka Mahajana (Peoples) Party. In the two
 uy-elections in October this new party lost decisively. The
 last few years have witnessed a decline in electoral support
 for parties of the extreme left, although the JVP retains a
 small following among students and other youths. The
 political wing of the Ceylon Workers Congress represents most
 Indian Tamils. Its leader is a member of the Cabinet. The
 Tamil United Liberation Front's (TULF) constituency is
 primarily among Sri Lankan Tamils in the North and East. One
 of the TULF's avowed objectives is partition of the island and
 the creation of a separate Tamil State in the northern and
 eastern districts where Sri Lankan Tamils either form the
 majority or represent substantial minorities.
 The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution, passed in August
 1983, requires all members of Parliament to take an oath
 disavowing separatism. The 15 TULF members refused to take
 tne oath and were deemed to have relinquished their seats,
 which represent Tamil-majority areas. By-elections to fill
 their seats have been postponed under the state of emergency
 on the grounds that campaigns in those troubled areas will
 lead to breaches of the peace. The TULF also is opposed to
 holding these by-elections in current circumstances.
 By-elections to fill the seats in Sinhalese-majority areas of
 two members who died were held in October after the Government
 rushed a bill through Parliament to enable parties founded
 since 1981 to register and thus participate in elections. The
 act also gives wide powers to the election commissioner to
 decide, in the event of disturbances at a polling station,
 whether to count the ballots from that station or to call for
 a fresh poll.
 The 1978 Constitution provides for proportional
 representation. The system will not come into use until the
 next general election, not required until 1989. Politicians
 of all parties, however, are having doubts about this system,
 and a parliamentary committee was appointed in July 1983 to
 review the 1978 Constitution and all voting laws. It has not
 yet reported its findings.
 Section 4 Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is sensitive to investigations of its human
 rights practices, but generally does not interfere with such
 investigations, of which there have been several in the past
 two years. The Government regards reports issued by such
 organizations as Amnesty International and the International
 Commission of Jurists (ICJ) as biased.
 In a report published in March, following a mission to Sri
 Lanka, an ICJ representative noted that communal animosities
 have led to a steadily deteriorating situation and recommended
 steps that the Government could take to lessen tension,
 including independent judicial inquiries into the July 1983
 
 
 1396
 SRI LANKA
 violence and the killing of 53 Tamil prisoners in Welikade
 Prison, stricter control over application of the Prevention of
 Terrorism Act, and efforts to meet the legitimate expectations
 of the Tamil community. He concluded that certain police
 powers under the Prevention of Terrorism Act and the Sixth
 Amendment to the Constitution are serious violations of the
 rule of law and Sri Lanka's obligations under the
 International Covenant On Civil and Political Rights.
 Amnesty International issued a special report in June 1984
 covering tne period July 1983 to April 1984. Noting that it
 continued to receive reports of human rights violations in Sri
 LanKa, Amnesty International expressed particular concern
 about the use of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, allegations
 of arbitrary arrest and detention and of torture and death of
 detainees, and about evidence and reports that security forces
 have shot or killed innocent Tamils in the North.
 In September 1983, the U.N. Subcommission on Prevention of
 Discrimination and Protection of Minorities passed a
 resolution requesting the U.N. Human Rights Commission to ask
 the Secretary General to seek information from the Government
 of Sri Lanka and other sources on communal violence and to
 submit a report to the U.N. Economic and Social Council. The
 U.N. Human Rights Commission decided in February 1984, after
 hearing a presentation by the Sri Lankan Government, that
 further consideration of the situation was 'not necessary* as
 suitable steps were being taken to seek communal peace and
 harmony. At its meeting in September 1984, the Subcommission
 expressed the hope that the Government would present
 information on its progress.
 Several semiofficial and non-governmental local organizations
 monitor human rights in Sri Lanka. Their reports and
 statements usually do not elicit responses from the
 Government. Leaders claim that they are subjected to
 occasional official harassment but they have been permitted to
 continue to function.
 Freedom House rates Sri Lanka 'partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Sri Lanka is a developing and primarily agrarian nation. It
 depends heavily on plantation crops (tea, rubber, and
 coconuts) for export earnings and employment. Rice is the
 major food crop. When the United National Party came to power
 in 1977 it initated a new program to accelerate economic
 growth based on easing government controls and shifting
 government spending from consumer subsidies to capital
 investment. Foreign aid has been crucial to Sri Lanka's
 ambitious capital development plans. The liberalization
 policy has had considerable success in stimulating growth,
 which has averaged about six percent annually. Per capita
 gross national product in 1982 was 324.3 dollars.
 Many sectors of the economy remain in need of development.
 Entrepreneurs and farmers have benefited from the Government's
 policies but others on fixed incomes, urban unskilled
 laborers, and tenant farmers have suffered from high rates of
 inflation. In 1983, inflation was over 28 percent; in 1984 it
 was expected to be around 15 percent.
 Over 15U,000 Sri Lankans work abroad. Although their
 
 
 1397
 SRI LANKA
 departure has created shortages of trained personnel, the
 foreign exchange they remit plays a large role in improving
 the balance of payments.
 The population is 15,925,000 and is increasing at the rate of
 1.8 percent. Life expectancy at birth is 69 years and the
 infant mortality rate is 30.5 per 1,000 live births.
 Health care is free for all Sri Lankans although the number of
 facilities and doctors has not kept pace with population
 growtn. The best medical facilities are found in and around
 Colombo. Hospitals suffer from shortages of medicine and
 trained staff and malfunctioning equipment; many facilities
 are old. Communicable diseases pose a major health problem.
 Cholera and diarrheal diseases occur frequently because
 potable water supplies and sanitation facilities are
 inadequate. Only 20 percent of the population has access to
 safe water (1976 figure). Malaria has become a serious
 problem in recent years due to the opening of new settlement
 areas and complacency on the part of officials who thought
 malaria had been eradicated.
 Sri Lanka has an excellent education system, free to citizens
 from primary school through university. The literacy rate is
 87 percent. The best schools are located in Colombo and other
 principal towns. There is a shortage of university places:
 about 5,000 freshmen every lear are drawn from a pool of
 roughly 22,000 qualified candidates.
 In 1956 the Government began education reforms that
 deemphasized the teaching of English and stressed vernacular
 education. As a result, many Sri Lankans now lack the English
 language skills necessary to qualify for some government and
 private sector jobs, oth at home and abroad. English has
 been important as a 'link language" between Sri Lanka's ethnic
 groups, so tnat the decline of English has been one factor in
 the continuing tensions between Sinhalese and Tamils. In
 February 1983, President Jayewardene announced that the
 Government would place more emphasis on the teaching of
 English, and it has taken steps toward that end.
 Citizens have the right to acquire, hold, and dispose of
 property, but each individual may own only 1 house and no more
 than 50 acres. The Government permits non-citizen residents,
 except Indian Tamils, to own property.
 Women have equal rights under the law, including equal
 property and inheritance rights. The various ethnic and
 religious groups have their own 'personal' laws, which place
 some limitations on women. Some Tamil families believe their
 women members should not be seen working in public. Some
 Muslim women are discouraged from seeking higher education or
 employment. One important result of the plantation workers'
 strike in 1984 was obtaining equal wages for men and women in
 that sector. The Labor Ministry reportedly is considering
 equalizing wages in all organized sectors of the economy.
 Women fill important posts in the civil service, the
 professions, and business, but the majority are found in
 manual and semiskilled jobs. Women vote in large numbers, but
 otnerwise play a more limited role than men in the political
 process. There presently are eight women members of
 Parliament, and Sri Lankans are proud of the fact that they
 had the world's first woman Prime Minister, Mrs. Sirimavo
 
 
 1398
 SRI LANKA
 Bandaranaike. In 1983 the President created a Ministry of
 Women's Affairs and Teaching Hospitals and gave the Minister,
 a woman, cabinet rank.
 Only one group, those Indian Tamils who are stateless, are not
 integrated fully into the life of the country. In 1964 India
 and Sri Lanka signed an agreement intended to resolve the
 citizenship status of some 1 million stateless Indian Tamils
 over a period of 15 years, later extended to 17. Under this
 agreement India would grant citizenship and repatriate to
 south India 600,000 Indian Tamils and any children born to
 them after 1964. Sri Lanka would grant citizenship to 375,000
 and their offspring born after 1964. By October 31, 1981,
 when the two countries were to have settled this issue, India
 had taken more than 300,000 persons as repatriates. Sri Lanka
 had granted citizenship to over 185,000 plus over 62,000
 post-1964 offspring. Over 207,000 Indian Tamils in Sri Lanka
 before 1964, plus nearly 45,000 offspring, were granted Indian
 citizenship but still awaited repatriation. In the wake of
 the July 1983 anti-Tamil violence, some in this latter group
 are being processed for repatriation or have migrated to India.
 Witn the lapse of the 1964 agreement India declined to
 consider any more applications for citizenship. The
 Government of Sri Lanka believes that the 1964 pact remains in
 force until the citizenship cases and permanent residence of
 all Indian Tamils covered by the pact have been settled. The
 All-Party Conference has agreed that the Government should
 grant Sri Lankan citizenship to stateless Indian Tamils who
 did not apply for Indian citizenship and were not granted Sri
 Lankan citizenship under the 1964 agreement.
