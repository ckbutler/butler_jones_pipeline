 JAMAICA
 Jamaica is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and a
 constitutional parliamentary democracy. A Governor General,
 appointed by the Crown on the advice of the Prime Minister,
 represents the Queen as Head of State, while the elected Prime
 Minister, the leader of the majority party in Parliament, is
 the country's.chief executive. The Parliament is comprised of
 an elected House of Representatives and a Senate appointed by
 the Governor General.
 Two major political parties have alternated in power since the
 first elections under universal suffrage in 1944. The maximum
 term of a Parliament is 5 years, and the Constitution requires
 that a general election be held no more than 3 months after
 the dissolution of Parliament. In the last general election,
 held in February 1989, Michael Manley's People's National
 Party (PNP) won 45 of the 60 seats in the House of
 Representatives. The opposition Jamaica Labor Party (JLP),
 which formed the government from 1980 to 1989, holds the
 remaining 15 seats. In local government elections held in
 March 1990, the PNP retained control of all but one of
 Jamaica's parish councils.
 The security forces are responsible to the Ministry of
 National Security and consist of the Jamaica Constabulary
 Force (JCF-Police), the Jamaica Special Constabulary Force
 (JSCF-an auxiliary police force), and the Jamaica Defense
 Force (JDF). Since 1974 the JDF has been authorized to
 conduct joint operations with the JCF to maintain peace and
 order under the Suppression of Crime Act.
 Jamaica has a mixed economy emphasizing the private sector and
 based on tourism, bauxite and alumina production, light
 manufacturing, and agriculture. The Manley Government is
 pursuing policies which promote private investment, both
 domestic and foreign, in order to stimulate economic growth
 and modernization.
 The excessive use of lethal force by police officers is
 Jamaica's most persistent human rights probl m. Conditions in
 Jamaican prisons remain appalling, with serious overcrowding,
 poor sanitary conditions, and inadequate diei    norm. Other
 concerns include electoral violence and fraud, fai ure properly
 to institutionalize accountability for police abuses, and an
 overburdened judiciary. However, the courts did successfully,
 prosecute several lawsuits against police officers for assault
 and other human rights violations.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAY RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 While officially sanctioned murder of political opponents does
 not occur in Jamaica, unjustified use of lethal force and
 fatal abuse of detainees by police are serious problems.
 According to police statistics, officers killed 89 persons and
 wounded 59 in shooting incidents through the end of August
 1990, while 9 police officers were killed and 23 wounded in
 the line of duty during the same period. The disparity in the
 ratio of persons killed by police to those wounded gives
 
 
 678
 JAMAICA
 credence to charges by human rights groups that some officers
 are engaging in summary executions of suspects.
 In May there was a serious riot at the St. Catherine district
 prison during which three inmates on death row were killed.
 While prison officals initially claimed the three had died
 from an adverse reaction to the tear gas used to suppress the
 riot, credible reports indicate the inmates were beaten to
 death by warders. Government investigations into the incident
 were not complete at year's end. In July three warders were
 convicted of manslaughter for the fatal beating of a prisoner
 in 1988.
 In February Prime Minister Manley publicly expressed concern
 over the number of police killings. Both local and
 international human rights groups have criticized the fact
 that the JCF itself is responsible for investigating police
 abuses. Over the past 2 years, National Security Minister
 K.D. Knight has repeatedly announced plans to establish an
 independent body to review complaints against members of the
 force, but as of year's end no action had been taken to
 implement such a program. Police are infrequently punished
 for extrajudicial killing. In many cases, investigations
 undertaken immediately following a fatal shootitig drag on for
 years.
 Both major parties, as well as the Communist Workers Party of
 Jamaica, have some supporters who occasionally resort to
 violence to prevent supporters of rival parties from engaging
 in legitimate political activities. Such violence was more
 prevalent during elections. As a step toward reducing
 politically related violence, the two major parties on August
 26, 1988, signed a "Political Code of Conduct." An ombudsman
 was appointed to monitor compliance with the agreement and to
 report violations. As a result of these efforts, the
 electoral campaign of 1988-89 was relatively peaceful, as were
 the 1990 local government elections.
 The lynching of persons accused of the theft of goods,
 livestock or crops, .housebreaking, or rape occurs frequently
 in Jamaica, but prosecution of the vigilantes who do the
 lynching remains rare. The lynchings are usually the result
 of spontaneous mob action, which makes prosecution extremely
 difficult.
 b. Disappearance
 There was no evidence of abduction, hostage-taking, or
 disappearances perpetrated by the security forces. Using the
 power granted under the Suppression of Crime Act to take
 persons into custody without an arrest warrant, however, the
 JCF during 1990 occasionally held incommunicado for varying
 periods persons suspected of criminal activities. In nearly
 all these cases, the detainee was released once relatives or
 associates protested. The Jamaica Council for Human Rights
 estimates that some 40 to 50 persons were held incommunicado
 for some period during 1990.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture and other abuse of prisoners and detainees is
 prohibited by law. Nonetheless, suspected criminals are often
 beaten and even killed by police while being held in local
 stations and prisons (see Section l.a.). In 1990 there were
 
 
 679
 JAMAICA
 numerous credible complaints of police brutality, including
 reports of beatings, some fatal, by guards and security
 personnel of inmates held in prisons. A number of policemen
 were convicted and punished.
 To help improve the human rights performance of the police,
 the Government arranged for the police to receive training in
 police investigative techniques and also initiated a law
 enforcement accreditation program. The Minister of National
 Security also sought to improve police perfotmance by
 introducing a graduate entry program. Under this plan, 12
 university graduates would be brought directly into
 specialized management positions in the force. As of year's
 end, there were no applicants for the new program. Finally,
 to attract better qualified people into: the force, the
 Government in 1990 implemented an accelerated promotion
 program for outstanding policemen.
 As in past years, some persons brought suit successfully
 against the police for unlawful actions, and the Government
 was required to pay damages. According to police statistics,
 182 complaints were filed against police between January and
 August 1990, of which more than half alleged assault by JCF
 officers. Only some 20 percent of complaints made against JCF
 officers were found to be without merit. More than $500,000
 was paid out in damages following successful lawsuits against
 police during that period, a figure more than twice that paid
 out during the first 8 months of 1989.
 Violence in prisons is commonplace, with both prisoners and
 guards subject to assault. Three inmates were killed during a
 disturbance in May at the St. Catherine district prison (see
 Section l.a.). At this prison, where 200 death row inmates
 are housed in a facility built for 60, a work slowdown by
 guards in February temporarily resulted in prisoners being
 locked in their cells throughout the day. In general,
 conditions in prisons, particularly the penitentiaries and
 maximum security facilities, remain abysmal. Sanitary
 conditions are appalling, food inadequate at best, and
 recreational facilities almost nonexistent. At St.
 Catherine's, up to six men are held in each 5- by 8-foot cell.
 More than 700 persons were killed in violent incidents during
 1990. Commercial guard forces, which are in effect private
 security forces, have proliferated in recent years due to the
 high crime rate and continue to be the subject of complaints,
 especially concerning the use of excessive force. According
 to JCF statistics, 16 persons were killed by private security
 guards or homeowners as of the end of August. There are
 currently more than 200 private security firms in Jamaica, and
 many often hire unsuitable applicants and provide inadequate
 training.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under the controversial Suppression of Crime Act, which has
 been regularly extended at 6-month intervals since its
 adoption in 1974, security forces do not need a-warrant to
 detain persons "reasonably" suspected of having committed a
 crime. Although the Act was conceived as an extraordinary
 measure, security forces came to rely on it extensively. The
 Government rescinded the Act in 7 of Jamaica's 14 parishes in
 1989, promising to remove it from the remainder as soon as
 possible. In February 1990, the Act was revoked in three more
 parishes and in May was ended throughout the country. In the
 
 
 JAMAICA
 wake of serious criminal gang warfare in the capital in July,
 it was reimposed for a 30-day period in Kingston and two
 neighboring parishes on August 2. The Act was extended for
 another 30 days in early September. As of mid-September,
 security forces acting under provisions of the Act had imposed
 curfews in parts of Kingston on three separate occasions.
 Prior to the reimposition of the Act, security forces in late
 July engaged in widespread, warrantless, cordon-and-search
 operations in troubled areas of Kingston. 'Hundreds of persons
 were detained, most for brief periods of time. Although the
 Government defended the security forces' actions as lawful and
 necessary to end gang warfare, human rights activists and
 prominent jurists publicly questioned the legal justification
 for the operations. The opposition Jamaica Labor Party (JLP)
 charged the actions were directed primarily against
 JLP-dominated areas and filed several class action suits on
 behalf of those held during the sweeps. The cases had not
 been decided as of year's end.
 Detention of suspects without a warrant occurs regularly,
 particularly in poor neighborhoods. In areas where the Act
 has been lifted, police reportedly are relying on blank,
 presigned warrants to meet the new- legal requirements. By
 law, police must record detentions and are responsible for
 ensuring that detainees appear before a member of the
 judiciary within 24 hours of detention. However, most
 detainees are held for from 3 to 5 days, and, according to the
 Jamaica Council for Human Rights (JCHR), many detainees are
 held for-several weeks without being brought before a judicial
 officer. The JCHR states that 90 percent of its caseload
 involves assisting people attempting to locate and gain the
 release of detained family members. The JCHR reports that
 supervisory police officers have been more cooperative in
 recent years in providing information about detained persons.
 For suspects charged with a crime, there is a functioning bail
 system. Bail is set by the local police supervisor in minor
 cases. A judicial officer sets bail for those charged with
 more serious crimes. Persons unable to post bail while
 waiting for a judicial hearing are often detained for long
 periods. Family members and other interested persons are
 permitted access to the accused.
 There are no political prisoners in Jamaica.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Persons who have been charged with criminal offenses have
 access to legal representation, and legal counsel is provided
 to indigents in criminal cases. The Court of Appeal and the
 Parliament may refer cases to the Judicial Committee of the
 Privy Council in the United Kingdom. A special Gun Court,
 established in 1974, considers all cases involving the illegal
 use or possession of firearms and ammunition. Public
 attendance is restricted, and less stringent rules of evidence
 are used. In capital cases, hearings before the Gun Court
 serve as preliminaries to jury trials under the jurisdiction
 of the Supreme Court.
 The judicial system, although independent, is overburdened and
 operates with inadequate resources. Budgetary shortfalls have
 resulted in a steady attrition of trained personnel, causing
 further delays. Some cases take years to come to trial, and
 others have had to be dismissed because case files could not
 
 
 JAMAICA
 be located. Prisoners have been held for more than 4 years
 awaiting trial or decisions on their appeals.
 According to the JCHR, one of the weakest areas of the system
 of justice is the inability of the police to provide witnesses
 with proper protection. Intimidation, even murder, of
 witnesses is a chronic problem hampering criminal
 prosecutions, and jurors are sometimes threatened by
 associates of criminal defendants. The parliamentary
 ombudsman has reported instances in which threats and
 intimidation are directed against witnesses and jurors in
 criminal cases where the accused is a pplicerqan. Some
 convictions have been obtained for such attempts to subvert
 the judicial system. The Government in 1989 announced the
 development of a protective custody program for threatened
 witnesses and during 1990 provided additional funding for a
 witness protection program. Nevertheless, the problem of
 witness intimidation remained serious.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary intrusion by the State
 into the private life of the individual. Under the
 Suppression of Crime Act, however, search warrants are not
 required to enter homes or businesses believed to be occupied
 by persons "reasonably" suspected by the police of having
 committed a crime, and this authority is sometimes abused.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press are provided for in the
 Constitution and are observed in practice within the broad
 limits of libel laws and the State Secrets Act. In 1990,
 however, there were several incidents in which reporters
 covering the July gang warfare in Kingston were harassed and
 even detained briefly by security forces.
 Jamaica's largest privately owned newspaper, the Daily
 Gleaner, has been critical of Jamaican governments through the
 years. A second national daily, the Record, appeared in 1988
 and has followed a similar editorial policy. Several smaller
 newspapers and magazines are also published, and foreign
 publications are widely available. The government-owned
 Jamaica Broadcasting Company (JBC) operates two radio stations
 and the island's only television channel.
 The Government's Broadcast Commission has the right to
 regulate programming during emergencies. There are now more
 than 15,000 satellite antennas on the island, permitting many
 Jamaicans to watch foreign television broadcasts without any
 government restriction.
 There is no censorship or interference in academic
 institutions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 association. Large numbers and varieties of professional,
 business, service, social, and cultural associations function
 freely. Public rallies are staged by all political parties.
 Such events require a police permit, which is normally
 
 
 682
 JAMAICA
 granted. The PNP and JLP held rallies and meetings throughout
 the island during the 1990 local election campaign.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is provided for by the Constitution and is
 well established in Jamaica. More than 80 percent of the
 population belongs to various Christian denominations, and
 religious groups of all kinds operate freely. Evangelical
 Christian movements have gained a significant following, and
 foreign evangelists visit regularly.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution provides Jamaican citizens freedom of
 movement and immunity from expulsion from the country. There
 are no restrictions on foreign travel or emigration.
 Citizenship is not revoked for political reasons.
 Those who apply for refugee status are handled on a
 case-by-case basis. Jamaica is a party to the 1951 U.N.
 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the status of
 refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Jamaicans have, and freely exercise, the right to change their
 government. All citizens age 18 and over have the right to
 vote, and voting is by secret ballot. The Constitution
 requires that, except under defined emergency circumstances,
 an election be held not later than 5 years after the first
 sitting of the preceding Parliament, but the Prime Minister
 may call national elections at any time within that period.
 The 1990 local council elections were.relatively peaceful.
 However, voting in several urban constituencies was marred by
 intimidation and the theft of ballot boxes by partisan
 political gangs. Militant supporters of both parties were
 involved. The extent of fraud in several urban constituencies
 during these elections led some observers, including leading
 figures in both parties, to call for wide-ranging reforms to
 electoral procedures.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no restrictions on human rights organizations in
 Jamaica. The JCHR, the country's only human rights
 organization, has vigorously protested abuses by the police
 and has called for corrective reforms, but their work was
 hampered throughout 1990 by a lack of adequate resources.
 Americas Watch representatives visited Jamaica in 1990 to
 investigate prison conditions and met with government
 officials and human rights activists. They later issued a
 report which was highly critical of Jamaican prison conditions
 (see Section l.c.).
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Jamaican women are accorded full equality under the
 Constitution, and the 1975 Employment Act requires equal pay
 
 
 683
 JAMAICA
 for equal work. In practice, because of, cultural and social
 traditions, women often still suffer economic discrimination,
 which is frequently evidenced in hiring practices. Violence
 against women occurs with some frequency in Jamaica, although
 useful statistical data are not available. The Government's
 Bureau of Women's Affairs within the Ministry of Labor,
 Welfare and Sports and several nongovernmental organizations
 help victims cope with the effects of domestic violence.
 According to officials at a crisis center, police are
 frequently unwilling to assist battered women in taking legal
 steps against their assailants. Furthermore, Jamaican law
 does not differentiate between domestic violence and general
 assault cases. Women are often reluctant, therefore, to bring
 charges under the General Offenses Against the Person Act,
 under which the only sanction available is the incarceration
 of the offender.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Article 23 of the Constitution specifically provides for the*
 right to form-or join a trade union, and other articles
 obligate the Government to protect the person and property of
 trade unionists. In Jamaica, labor unions, like professional
 groups and private associations, function freely. The Labor
 Relations and Industrial Disputes Act (LRIDA) codifies worker
 tights.
 Unions draft their own constitutions and rules, elect
 officers, determine objectives, affiliate with national or
 international groups, and select delegates to conferences.
 Some Jamaican union organizations are affiliated with the
 Caribbean Congress of Labor and the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions. The third largest trade
 union federation is affiliated with the Communist-controlled
 World Federation of Trade Unions, and the World Confederation
 of Labor has attracted one Jamaican adherent.
 Jamaican law neither authorizes nor prohibits the right to
 strike, but unions and workers do go on strike. Striking
 workers can interrupt work without criminal liability but
 cannot be assured of keeping their jobs. In 1990 there were
 several work slowdowns and a number of strikes of short
 duration. The LRIDA and other laws state that certain
 categories of essential service workers (mostly government
 employed) do not have the right to strike. The 1990 report of
 the Committee of Experts (COE) of the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) cited the laws' broad definition of
 essential services in which strikes are prohibited as
 restricting the right to strike provided by the ILO's
 Convention 87 on freedom of association which Jamaica has
 ratified.
 About 25 percent of the work force belongs to unions, and
 union influence is felt in all important economic sectors.
 The two largest union federations, the Bustamante Industrial
 Trade Union and the National Workers Union, have
 organizational and leadership ties to the two major political
 parties, the JLP and the PNP, respectively. Both unions
 maintain their independence and sometimes take positions
 different from those of their respective parties. The third
 largest Jamaican union federation, the University and Allied
 Workers Union, is affiliated with the Workers Party of
 
 
 684
 JAMAICA
 Jamaica, whose leadership maintains direct control over the
 union.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The Constitution provides for the right to organize and belong
 to labor unions, and LRIDA provisions include guidelines for
 labor, management, and government on issues such as organizing
 work sites, negotiating agreements, and conflict resolution.
 The Government rarely interferes with union organization
 efforts, and judicial and police authorities effectively
 enforce the LRIDA and other labor regulations.
 Labor, management, and the Government remain firmly committed
 by law and in practice to collective bargaining in contract
 negotiations and conflict resolution. Collective bargaining
 is widely used, even in some unorganized firms. When labor
 and management fail to reach an agreement, cases may be
 referred to the Ministry of Labor for arbitration or
 mediation. An independent Industrial Disputes Tribunal (IDT)
 forms the first appeal level above the Ministry. Any cases
 not resolved by the IDT pass to the civil courts. This system
 has proved effective. However, unions and some employers
 continue to believe that the collective bargaining process is
 undermined by a 1986 LRIDA amendment which permits the
 Minister of Labor unilaterally to refer cases involving the
 national interest to the IDT. Employees may not.be fired
 solely because they are union officers. On the other hand,
 union affiliation may not be a prerequisite for employment.
 Domestic labor laws apply to Jamaican export free trade
 zones. Ministry of Labor officers cite a need for more
 compliance verification, especially in the free zones, but
 believe that most employers obey legal requirements. While
 domestic manufacturing companies are predominantly unionized,
 only 2 of the 18 factories in the Kingston Free Zone have
 union representation. The two firms with unions were
 organized before they began operations in the Free Zone.
 Resistance by employers (all foreign), difficulty in
 organizing female employees (who represent a majority of the
 work force in the free zones), and inconsistent organizing
 efforts are the reasons generally cited for the lack of
 additional unionization in the free zones. The Government is
 aware of the strong employer opposition to unions in the free
 zones; it neither discourages nor encourages unionization.
 A 1990 U.S. Department of Labor study of Jamaica's free trade
 zones noted that export firms are more likely to challenge
 union organizing efforts given the Government's policy of
 promoting exports. The study also noted restrictions on union
 organizers' access to the zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution does not specifically address the matter of
 forced or compulsory labor. However, Jamaica is a party to
 both ILO conventions which prohibit compulsory labor, and
 there have been no allegations that this practice exists in
 Jamaica.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Juvenile Act provides that children under the age of 12
 years shall not be employed except by parents or guardians,
 and that such employment may be only in domestic,
 
 
 JAMAICA
 agricultural, or horticultural work. Children under 12 years
 of age may not be employed at night or at industrial sites,
 but enforcement is erratic, and children under 12 can be seen
 peddling goods or services on city streets. There is no
 evidence-of widespread illegal employment of children in other
 sectors of the economy. The Educational Act stipulates that
 all children aged 6 to 11 must attend elementary school.
 Industrial safety, police, and truant officers are charged
 with enforcement.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The minimum wage law provides for a 42-hour standard workweek
 and overtime pay. In accordance with International Monetary
 Fund guidelines, government wage policy aims to keep maximum
 annual wage and fringe benefit increases to 12.5 percent or
 less to help contain inflation. Most wage settlements have
 followed this guideline, but exceptions have been made for
 workers with a history of inadequate pay. Union opposition to
 the guidelines increased following government decisions-to
 deregulate the retail price of petroleum products and foreign
 exchange. Unions have viewed the guidelines as imposing an
 unfair burden-on workers because annual inflation exceeds 12.5
 percent, and they believe inflation will worsen due to the
 expected price increases brought about by the deregulation.
 The minimum wage was increased to approximately $80 per month
 in 1990. Higher minimum wages apply to skilled workers,
 depending on their specialty. Most salaried workers are paid
 more than the legal minimum wage. For a worker with a family
 of five or fewer, the minimum wage represents a bare
 subsistence level, adequate in rural areas but not in urban
 locations.
 The LRIDA establishes some basic conditions of work, and the
 Factory Act stipulates that all factories be registered and
 approved by the Labor Ministry before they can begin
 operating. The Ministry's Industrial Safety Division is
 required to make annual inspections of all factories, but
 budget constraints reduce the number of inspections actually
 made. If a private sector work site does not meet the
 definition of a "factory,' the Ministry does not have the
 authority to inspect it. The Ministry maintains records on
 industrial accident victims. Victims of industrial accidents
 are compensated under the National Insurance Scheme. The
 Ministries of Labor, Finance, the Public Service, and National
 Security are charged with enforcing labor laws and regulations.
