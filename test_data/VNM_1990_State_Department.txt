 VIETNAM
 Vietnam Is an-authoritarian state ruled by the Vietnamese
 Codanunist- Party (VCP) thkough a. 12-member Politburo and a-
 Comuitist-,Party Central Cormittee of 11 members selected by a
 party c6ngtessheldievery 5 years. The 1980 Constitution
 declares-theSoiilalist Republic of Vietnam (SRV) to be a
 proletArian dictat6rship. Government policies, carried out
 under the Council of Ministers, reflect guidelines-if'not-
 specific directives-laid down by the VCP Politburo. During
 1990, the VCP felt increasingly threatened by'the changes in
 the Soviet Union, the collapse of Communist parties in Eastern
 Euk6pe,',domebtic aiscontent, and antigovernment activities by
 overseas Vietnamese entering the country. Continuing economic
 isolation by the West in response to the unresolved conflict
 in Cambodia, coup]ed ith decreasing assistance from the
 Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, also contributed to the VCP's
 sense of iineaie. These pressures exacerbated historically-
 ,derived~cultural and political differences between southern
 Vietnamese and a predominantly northern political leadership..
 The security apparatus consists of civil and military elements
 under the control of the Government and the VCP. Police and
 nonmilitary law enforcement officers are subject to the
 directives of the VCP as well as to those of the Interior
 Minister, who himself is a member of the Politburo. The
 military security apparatus operates under a similar system of
 dual party and governmental control. Police and other
 security personnel contihue to be responsible for numerous
 human rights abuses, including severe physical mistreatment of
 those running afoul of such authorities, whether undergoing
 interrogation or while confined in the penal system.
 Years of doctrinaire socialism and isolation have left Vietnam
 one of'the world's poorest countries. Recent efforts to
 liberalize foreign trade and investment, eliminate subsidies,
 decontrol'prices, decentra'ize economic decisionmaking, and
 implement other refbrms have to date only marginally
 alleviated depressed economic conditions. Vietnamese now may
 open businesses and obtain long-term leases on private: --
 property. 'Complicated bureaucratic-procedures have affected
 the economy unevenly: some aspects of-the economy are highly
 regulated while other areas remain largely untouched.
 Responding to internal and perceived external pressures, the
 Government intensified an ongoing campaign against dissent in
 199G. At least several hundred-and perhaps as many as
 several thousand-dissidents and suspected opponents were
 detained between April and September, mostly in the south.
 Targets of the crackdown included intellectuals, clergy,
 Journalists, and some foreigners. Police surveillance and
 controls were increased, particularly against visitors from
 abroad, and press controls were tightened.
 Arbitrary detentions and widespread torture and mistreatment
 of detainees continued, as did severe restrictions on freedom
 of speech, press, assembly, association, and movement, worker
 rights, and the right of citizens to change their government.
 In addition, the Government continued its program of resettling
 hundreds of thousands of people--some forcibly-- into "New
 Economic Zones" (NEZ's) for developmental objectives and as a
 means of' social control and to repress "undesirable" elements
 of the population, including families of political prisoners,
 officials of the former South Vietnam govetnment and military,
 ethnic Chinese, and the unemployed.

 VIETNAM
 Positive developments included new legislation that would
 nominally restrict pretrial detention and enhance the role of
 defense counsels, and increased freedom to travel internally
 and abroad. Eight former military officers incarcerated since
 1975 were released or amnestied; according to government
 sources, about 120 of those originally incarcerated in 1975
 remain in reeducation centers. The total number of persons in
 arbitrary detention is estimated to be at least 2,000.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Statistics on the number of deaths of political prisoners are
 not available. Prisoners reportedly have died from exhaustion,
 physical abuse, malnutrition, lack of medical care, and other
 effects of conditions in prisons and reeducation camps, which
 remained severe. In prior years there were credible reports
 of hundreds of deaths in NEZ's as a result of harsh conditions.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of political abductions by government
 security organizations or by antigovernment forces, but the
 whereabouts of many persons associated with the former South
 Vietnamese government remained unknown (see Section l.d.).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Although both the 1980 Constitution (Article 69) and the 1989
 Criminal Procedure Code (Article 5) prohibit physical abuse,
 there continue to be credible, consistent reports from
 refugees concerning police brutality against suspects
 undergoing investigation, as well as the severity of
 conditions for those confined in reeducation camps and
 prisons. An Amnesty International (AI) report, "Vietnam
 Renovation (doi moi), the Law and Human Rights in the 1980's,"
 dated February 1990, stated that torture or ill-treatment is
 still a feature of police investigations and a means of
 punishment in. prisons and reeducation centers, despite legal
 safeguards. According to Vietnamese press reports and
 interviews with refugees, there is a pattern of severe
 physical abuse of persons suspected of committing common
 crimes, and police have sometimes tortured persons so severely
 that they have confessed to common (nonpolitical) crimes that
 they never committed. Some have died in custody. Persons
 incarcerated in reeducation camps have reported brutal
 beatings and being shackled in small dark cells for long
 periods of time with grossly inadequate food. Authorities
 reportedly have attempted to produce conformity among the
 detainees through confinement, hard labor with inadequate
 rations, self-criticism, and indoctrination. In addition,
 refugees have reported that detainees receive poor or no
 medical care and severe, often capricious punishment for minor
 infractions of camp rules.
 Interviews of refugees during 1990 suggest that the Government
 is making some effort to end torture and other cruel or
 inhuman practices, and there were some reports of police
 officers being arrested and convicted for such offenses. Such
 practices nonetheless remain widespread.
 
 
 1065
 
 VIETNAM
 Refugees have recounted instances in which official
 condemnation of human rights abuses has led police, fearful of
 being punished for perpetrating abuses, to commit additional
 abuses designed to cover their misdeeds. In one such
 instance, a woman confessed to a common criminal offense after
 being beaten by police. Later, when another person was found
 to be guilty pf the crime to which she had confessed, the
 pQlice.fearing retribution, reportedly beat her again to
 extract a phony confession to'a nonexistent minor crime and
 detained her for an additional short period, after which she
 was released.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Amendments and additions to the Criminal Procedure Code in
 1989 and 1990 strengthened procedural legal safeguards against
 arbitrary arrest and detention. The revised code prohibits
 protracted detention without trial by spelling out the time
 limits of detention which can be ordered by various
 authorities under various circumstances. In unspecified
 "urgent situations," certain local and .civil military
 authorities may order temporary detention for a 3-day period,
 which can be extended for an additional 3 days. Each period
 of detention must be approved by the People's Organ of Control
 (POC) at the same level. The POC, which -is independent of
 both the Ministry of Interior and People's Courts, has
 branches on every level of government down to precinct level.
 According to the Constitution, its function is to monitor
 government bodies to ensure their observance of the law. It
 also provides prosecutors to people's courts.' Once the POC
 receives the results of an investigation, it has 30 days in
 which to decide whether to prosecute, order further
 investigation, or dismiss the case.
 The law provides for longer periods of detention for people
 suspected of "serious" crimes who the authorities, with the
 approval of the POC, believe may not appear for trial, may try
 to obstruct the investigation, or may commit additional
 crimes. Limitations on such detention are clearly specified,
 conforming generally to the time required to complete the
 investigative and trial procedures. The law stipulates a
 maximum of 4 months to prepare for trial. A 4-month extension
 may be approved by a prosecutor at .the provincial or higher
 level, Additional extensions require approval of the Chief
 Prosecutor heading the Supreme People's Control Commission in
 Hanoi.
 Public security officials are required to obtain warrants to
 arrest a person for alleged serious crimes, including
 political offenses. Warrants must contain a summary of the
 offense and must be read to the accused. There is no
 effective judicial review of the legality of detentions.
 Provision.for bail exists only for foreigners. Exile is not
 used as a means of public control, although the Government has
 resettled hundreds of thousands of people--some forcibly--to
 NEZ's (see Section l.f.).
 Despite these procedural safeguards, credible reports indicate
 that officials continue to hold suspects for indefinite
 periods of time without formal charges. Arbitrary arrest and
 detention continue under old administrative provisions which
 clearly conflict with the new legislation. People detained
 for political crimes generally fall into one of two primary
 categories: those associated with the former government of
 
 
 1066
 VIETNAM
 South Vietnam or those who have been accused of antigovernment
 activities.
 From April to September the Government embarked on a security
 crackdown against suspected opponents of the regime. In
 August the Government issued Party Directive No. 135 which
 called for the arrest of "organizations (sic) or individuals
 who incite opposition to the Government and advocate political
 pluralism." At least several hundred--and possibly as many as
 several thousand--people were detained in the crackdown, which
 was concentrated in the south. Special emphasis was placed on
 controlling the activities of foreigners and their contacts
 with Vietnamese. An undetermined number of foreigners were
 arrested or deported for associating with Vietnamese deemed
 politically untrustworthy or for using international
 organizations to "spy" on Vietnam.
 Targets of this campaign reportedly included intellectuals,
 clergy, journalists, and student leaders. Among those
 identified by AI as being arrested or placed under house
 arrest for nonviolent political activity in 1990 were Nguyen
 Ho and Ta Ba Tang, former leaders of the "Club of Resistance
 Fighters" (an informal association of southern Vietnamese who
 had often criticized the northern leadership); Catholic
 priests Chan Tin and Nguyen Ngoc Lan; Dr. Nguyen Dan Que; and
 Do Trung Hieu, Doan Thanh Liem, Do Ngoc Long, and Nguyen Van
 Tan, associates of an American businessman detained for 2
 months for investigation of alleged "spying" activities.
 Eight more former South Vietnamese government officials were
 released or given amnesty from mid-1989 to the end of 1990,
 leaving at least 119 detained in reeducation centers without
 charge or trial since 1975. The AI report stated that the
 whereabouts of approximately 400 people associated with the
 former South Vietnamese government remain unknown, suggesting
 that the actual number of such detainees may be substantially
 higher than the official figure of about 120.
 In addition to the cases described above, the SRV continues to
 hold a number of detainees who were arrested for antigovernment
 activities subsequent to the 1975 Communist victory in the
 south. The AI report indicated that "recent information"
 (probably late 1989) received from former prisoners suggests
 that reeducation camps still hold several thousand prisoners,
 many of whom are being held for political offenses without
 charge or trial. (The Government draws a distinction between
 reeducation centers for those associated with the former
 regime in the south, and reeducation camps for those detained
 after consolidation of VCP power throughout the country.) ,
 There are no reliable statistics available on the total number
 of people in arbitrary detention, but taking into account
 various estimates by human rights groups, refugees, and
 government statements, at least 2,000 is a plausible
 estimate. Some estimates range as high as several thousand
 prisoners in each of several camps.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Vietnamese court system consists of local people's courts,
 military tribunals, and the Supreme Court, which can review
 cases from either of the lower courts. The National Assembly
 or Council of State may decide to establish special tribunals,
 which may be superior to the Supreme Court, if either choose
 to do so. In addition, local mass organizations are empowered
 by the Constitution to deal with minor breaches of law or
 
 
 1037
 VIETNAM
 disputes. Although, technically, judges in all regular courts
 are elected, candidates for election as judges are selected by
 the party organization. Article 131 of the Constitution
 provides for the "independence" of judges and jurors.
 However, at all levels, both are elected under a system that
 is closely supbrvised and controlled by the VCP, thereby
 vitiating their nominal independence. Reportedly the
 selection process has placed emphasis on knowledge of
 socialism and political reliability. Currently, Vietnam's
 penal code consists of the Criminal Code and a Criminal
 Procedures Code, which was. amended in 1990. Vietnam also has
 a long-established body of family law, but it still lacks
 civil law codes,
 The 1989 Criminal Procedures Code includes the presumption of
 innocence, while the 1990 amendments and supplements enhance,
 at least nominally, the role of defense counsels. For
 example, the law now. states that defense counsels have the
 right to be involved in the process from the opening of the
 proceedings, be given access to the file upon completion of
 the investigation', prepare a defense, represent the accused in
 court, and appeal decisions to the judge.
 To date, there is little evidence that legislative
 improvements have been implemented in practice. Vietnamese
 Justice Ministry officials have been quoted in the press as
 saying that the shortage of lawyers alone (among other
 problbms) precludes most defendants from receiving legal help
 while they'are being investigated and tried. Public defenders
 are provided at state expense, but reports by both refugees
 and Al indicate they tend to be poorly qualified. It cannot
 be confirmed to what extent, if any, provisions in newer
 legislation that provide for access to a defense attorney and
 an appeals process are being implemented in practice.
 Current legislation also provides for an appeals process, but
 in practice it appears to mean little. In addition, Al has
 reported that the duties, and powers of the Supreme People's
 Court and so-called specialized courts effectively vitiate the
 right of appeal by stipulating in the law that either court
 cam "render preliminary and final judgment in particularly
 serious and complicated cases2
 Reeducation sentences are frequently imposed as an
 administrative procedure without benefit of due process, and
 are not subject to judicial review. Little information is
 available concerninT political trials in 1990 or the legtal
 status of those detained in the crackdown. One report claimed
 that 11 people were convicted of spreading "propaganda against
 the revolution through religious activities" ir August and
 sentenced to prison terms of up to 10 years. Vietnamese radio
 reported in October that 38 people were convicted of treason
 for membership in political organizations which sought to'
 "undermine and overthrow" the Government; they received' prison
 terms ranging from 3 to 15 years to life.
 Detailed information contained in the Al report on over 50
 people tried and convicted in 1987 and 1988 for political
 offenses paints a general picture of a virtual lack of due
 process in political trials. In '1987 two Evangelical pastors
 who had been held in detention since 1983 were convicted,
 after a 1-day trial, of assisting illegal departures and
 receiving money from abroad. They received  B-year sentences.
 Twenty-three Catholics, including Fathbr Dominic Tran Dinh
 Thu, were convicted of "propaganda against the Socialist
 
 
 1068
 VIETNAM
 system, sabotage, disturbance of public security, and
 terrorism" after a 4-day trial. Security forces claimed to
 have found "many reactionary documents, illegal stored grain,
 and a pistol." Father Tranh Dinh Thu denied the charges and
 said the documents were prayer books and letters from abroad.
 He and a monk were sentenced to life; the others received jail
 terms of up to 20 years. In 1988, 5 writers and a postal
 worker were convicted of "counterrevolutionary propaganda with
 intent to overthrow the Government" for publishing
 antigovernment material. At their trial, according to AI, the
 prosecutor read out the charges, the accused were asked to
 comment, and the judge then immediately read out sentences,
 taking no account of the defendants' statements.
 It is impossible to estimate with any certainty the number of
 political prisoners. Based on credible reports, and including
 those detained without trial as well as those tried and
 sentenced for political offenses, there may be as many as
 several thousand and perhaps more.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In 1990 the Government continued to operate a nationwide
 system of surveillance and control through household
 registration and party-appointed block wardens who use
 informants to keep track of individual'activities. It works
 imperfectly in southern Vietnam, partly because of a shortage
 of trusted party workers. Beginning in April, the Government
 increased surveillance of.and controls on critics and
 suspected opponents.
 There were reports during 1990 of official and unofficial
 security wardens conducting searches of homes, sometimes with
 warrants issued by the authorities. There continued to be
 reports that Ministry of Interior officials inspected and
 sometimes confiscated mail and packages sent to Vietnam,
 particularly items sent to politically suspect persons. Some
 of the outgoing mail also was subject to inspection and
 censorship. Some foreign publications--even some from the
 Soviet Union--were prohibited; nevertheless, they were widely
 available on the black market.
 People are encouraged to belong to one or more mass
 organizations. There are mass organizations for villages and
 city districts, for school or work (trade union), for youth,
 and women. These mass organizations disseminate party
 propaganda and policy guidelines, support party-sanctioned
 activities, and have an active watchdog role. Members'
 attendance at meetings is advisable to prevent either being
 singled out for criticism or to protect family members from
 criticism. Membership in the VCP is essential for advancement
 in the state sector.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution has provisions for freedom of speech and
 press, but in practice such freedoms are severely limited. A
 new press law, which took effect in late 1989, tightened state
 control of the press and prohibited private press ownership.
 The Government owns and operates broadcast media and does not
 permit the airing of opposing views, although it has broadcast
 reports of open debate during National Assembly meetings.
 
 
 1069
 VIETNAM
 Party organs and the Ministry of Culture, Information, Sports,
 and Tourism control all newspapers, bdoks, and other
 publications, as well as all cultural exhibitions. During
 1990 the party continued to tolerate (and at times invite)
 criticismconcerning the performance of the party or
 individual officials deemed to be corrupt or incompetent.
 However, criticism of the legitimacy of the VCP or its
 preeminent role is not tolerated. Short of clearly proscribed
 writing (e~g., advocacy of a multiparty system), the limits of
 criticism are sometimes not clear. Tough criticism of
 economic performance may be permitted, as was illustrated in
 1990 by some very critical investigative reporting on the
 corruption and government impotence involved in the collapse
 of a lLrge number of-Vietnamese credit unions. The Government
 generally does not use prior censorship to control the media,
 but national security legislation is sufficiently broad to act
 as an incentive for the media to-exercise effective
 self-censorship. Reports indicate that some editors have been
 removed from their jobs for straying too far from party policy.
 A system of informants also chills free speech. As part of
 the security crackdown in April and May, the Government
 reportedly shut down 14 local newspapers and magazines, and
 strengthened Party control over the press. The crackdown also
 effectively curtailed contacts between foreigners and
 Vietnamese who, in the previous several years, had been
 willing to express critical views in the presence of others.
 *b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right of assembly is restricted in law and practice.
 Persons wishing to gather in a group are required to apply for
 a permit which is issued or denied by local authorities, often
 arbitrarily. According to refugees, in some localities
 citizens must obtain permission for gatherings of over three
 persons. In March the Government forcibly suppressed
 demonstrations in Ho Chi Minh City protesting the- collapse of
 many credit unions-. Police- reportedly beat demonstrators and
 made numerous arrests.
 Nongovernmental organizations are permitted but they may meet
 only for approved and narrowly defined objectives. Opposition
 political parties or organizations -are not permitted.
 Statements by government officials indicated that the
 crackdown on dissent extended to peaceful assembly. In June
 the Government warned against breaking regulations governing
 the establishment and activities of grass roots organizations,
 and stated that it would crush any such activity intended tQ
 challenge the Party's leading role.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Buddhism is the dominant religion. According to some estimates
 nearly three-fourths of the population of 65 million is
 Buddhist. The Government has claimed, however, that only 6
 million Vietnamese are practicing Buddhists. Up to another 6
 million reportedly are Catholic, and a much smaller number are
 Protestant. Adherence to a religion is not permitted for party
 members. But Vietnamese are permitted to attend religious
 services, and visitors to Vietnam report that attendance at
 religious services seemed to grow during 1989 and 1990. The
 general tightening of security in 1990 appears not to have
 affected this trend. Reports indicate that'even some
 government officials, who prior to 1989 feared losing their
 
 
 1070
 
 VIETNAM
 jobs if it was known that they attended.religious services,
 show no such inhibitions now.
 Freedom of worship is provided for in the Constitution, along
 with the proviso that no one may use religion to violate state
 laws and policies. The Government, concerned that religious
 groups could engage in subversion and political opposition,
 has consistently attempted to divide and control religious
 groups, in part by establishing government-controlled
 policymaking bodies such as the Catholic Patriotic Association.
 The Government has attempted to prevent the growth of religious
 groups by inhibiting the publication of religious materials
 and the training of new clergy through rigid screening of all
 applicants. Currently, the focus of government efforts to
 control religious activity appears to be in preventing the
 clergy from expressing dissatisfaction with Vietnam's
 political system. The Government exercised the right to
 approve the content of sermons and speeches by senior monks,
 but reports indicate that approval was generally granted as
 long as it was not construed as criticism of the Government or
 party. The New Testament is available in Vietnam, and several
 American nongovernmental organizations were allowed to import
 small numbers of Bibles during 1989 and 1990.
 Since achieving nationwide power in 1975, the Government has
 regularly detained and arrested religious figures of all
 faiths on political grounds and restricted their activities.
 Charges of "criticizing the Socialist system," "fomenting
 unrest," and "possessing and disseminating counterrevolutionary
 propaganda" are commonly levied against Buddhist monks and
 nuns as well as Catholics and Protestants.
 Seminaries and other places of religious instruction continue
 to operate but are subject to strict controls on admissions as
 well as hiring and training clergy. The Government permits
 some travel abroad for religious reasons. Foreign religious
 leaders in 1990 could travel to Vietnam, but the SRV tightened
 control of travel for foreigners generally within the
 country. The Government continued to pr6hibit proselytizing
 and restricts the movement of some clerics.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 During 1990 the Government continued the trend of recent years
 in allowing freer movement within the country for most
 citizens. Vietnamese are required to obtain permission to
 change their residence, but most observers concur that this
 has been less difficult during 1989 and 1990. The Government
 continued its campaign against illegal checkpoints, noting
 that they exist to extort money from travelers and that they
 inhibit movement and impair economic renovation. The
 Government tightened travel restrictions on foreigners,
 however, mostly by requiring that foreigners traveling in
 Vietnam do so in supervised groups rather than individually.
 In early 1988, the Government announced that it would
 authorize private travel abroad for education, tourism,
 medical treatment, and visits to close relatives. Such travel
 is restricted to 3 months, except in the case of travel for
 education or medical treatment. Violators of this limitation
 faced being barred from further travel for 3 to 5 years.
 The Government continued its program of relocating hundreds of
 thousands of people--some forcibly--into sparsely populated
 NEZ's. According to government statistics, over 900,000
 
 
 1071
 
 VIETNAM
 laborers plus 2 million dependents.were resettled in over
 1,000 NEZ's in the period from 1981 through 1989. The
 Government's objective of resettling some 97,000 more families
 in 1990 was not achieved due to insufficient resources, weak
 incentives, and poor planning. Refugee and other reports
 claim that the Government uses NEZ's as a means of social
 control, and singles out regime opponents, the unemployed, and
 ethnic Chinese-for participation. People who escape from
 NEZ's are subject to restrictions on residency and employment.
 The Government continued to permit emigration for family
 reunification as well as the emigration of Amerasian
 Vietnamese and their close family members. In January the
 first "departures of former reeducation camp detainees and
 their families began pursuant to a U.S.-SRV agreement in July
 1989 to permit such emigration. By year's end, approximately
 11,000 former reeducation camp inmates and their families had
 departed. Total departures of Vietnamese under the Orderly
 Departure Program (ODP) more than doubled from 1988 to a 1990
 figure of .43,000.
 Vietnamese who emigrate are generally free to return to
 Vietnam. In mid-1987, prompted in part by the need to earn
 foreign exchange, Vietnam relaxed its restrictions on the
 issuance of tourist visas for-Vietnamese who had fled the
 country clandestinely. Only those who allegedly committed
 "serious crimes".are not allowed to visit. During.1990 the
 SRV continued issuing tourist visas to significant numbers of
 overseas Vietnamese whether they had emigrated legally or had
 been granted permanent resettlement after illegal departures
 from Vietnam. By and large, this policy has apparently
 survived both the SRV's security crackdown during 1990 and its
 expressed concern that some overseas Vietnamese are members of
 groups dedicated to the overthrow of Vietnam's Communist
 Government.
 In December 198, Vietnam signed a memorandum of understanding
 with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees CUNHCR)
 to increase acceptance of voluntary repatriates-, provided
 there was financial assistance. This agreement included a
 commitment by Vietnam to waive prosecution and punitive
 measures for persons who departed the country illegally and
 who return under the UNHCR voluntary repatriation program.
 Vietnam also agreed to permit the UNHCR to monitor the
 returnees by follow-up visits.
 In June 1989, Vietnam joined 56 countries in the adoption of
 the Comprehensive Plan of Action (CPA) at the International
 Conference on Indochinese Refugees in, Geneva. Under the CPA,
 Vietnam agreed to encourage volunteers to return from
 first-asylum camps in the region. By the end of 1990, nearly
 6,000 asylum seekers, most of them from Hong Kong, had
 returned voluntarily to Vietnam. The UNHCR's monitoring
 program has entailed visits to some 20 to 30 percent of the
 returnees (its highest monitoring ratio in the world) and
 visits to local authorities. The visits have shown no
 instances of returnees being abused or harassed.
 Investigation of three alleged instances of abuse revealed
 that the allegations were fraudulent.
 The rate of clandestine departures fell in 1990. During 1989
 78,191 Vietnamese arrived in first-asylum camps in Southeast
 Asia and Hong Kong. As of September 1990, the figure was
 39,057. In 1990 the Government continued to arrest and try
 people .for organizing illegal departures-under "crimes against
 
 
 1072
 VIETNAM
 the State" statutes. Penalties range as high as 20 years in
 prison. While seeking to discourage and inhibit clandestine
 departures, the Government continued efforts to encourage
 people who desired to depart Vietnam to apply for orderly
 departure.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens are not free to change their government. All
 authority and political power is vested in the VCP. Political
 opposition is not tolerated, nor are there any other political
 parties. The Politburo of the Central Committee of the VCP is
 the supreme decisionmaking body in the nation. The
 Politburo's powerful Secretariat oversees day-to-day
 implementation of its directives. Debate and criticism is
 limited to certain aspects of individual, state, or party
 performance determined by the party itself. No challenge to
 the legitimacy of the one-party state is permitted, and it is
 off-limits as a topic for debate. Citizens elect members of
 the National Assembly, ostensibly the chief legislative body,
 but it is subordinate to the party in practice. Although all
 candidates are approved by the party, they are not required to
 be party members themselves, and multiple candidates contest
 some seats. By law, women and minority groups participate in
 politics but in practice, particularly in the case of women,
 are seriously underrepresented.
 During 1990 the VCP appeared to grow increasingly alarmed over
 the disintegration of party rule in Eastern Europe and the
 Soviet Union. The leadership clearly worried about the
 ramifications for its control of a populace long disillusioned
 with the VCP's rule. As a result, the party is attempting to
 implement a complex strategy that has four principal
 components. The first is insistence that Vietnam remain a
 single-party state; advocacy of any alternative to VCP rule is
 strictly forbidden. Second, the party has continued its
 strong commitment to economic "renovation." Third, the VCP is
 undertaking (within the limits of a one-party state) some
 "political renovation," or measures designed to make one-party
 rule less onerous. Last is a crackdown on certain elements,
 such as Vietnamese citizens who might challenge the legitimacy
 of Vietnam's political system, foreigners, and overseas
 Vietnamese.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights.
 Vietnam does not permit private human rights organizations to
 form or operate in Vietnam. Moreover, it prohibits private
 citizens from contacting international human rights
 organizations. However, since 1989,- the Vietnamese Red Cross
 has been permitted expanded cooperation with the American Red
 Cross in assisting persons seeking missing relatives,
 including those in reeducation centers.
 While continuing to fall far short of international standards
 in human rights practices, the Government carries on some
 dialog with human rights organizations. Some visits by human
 rights organizations are permitted, but the Government limits
 their access to the penal system and its inmates. In
 September the SRV agreed to permit the International Committee
 of the Red Cross to visit prisons on a recurring basis, and
 such visits reportedly took place since then.

 AI's report on Vietnam recounted a May 1989 visit to Vietnam
 during which its representatives were permitted to visit only
 one reeducation camp and -to meet a politicar prisoner held
 there in detention without triil. The Government rejected
 AI's requests to visit other prisons and reeducation camps
 where Al believed other prisoners of concern to it are being
 held.
 Earlier visitors had reported that they were shown only model
 camps. Former detainees have described extensive preparations
 to beautify camps prior to visits, temporary removal of most
 detainees during visits, and careful briefing of the remaining
 detainees by VCP cadres on what to tell the delegation members.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Many citizens face discrimination in employment, education,
 and social services or are subject to forced relocation in
 NEZ's, based on family background or political views. Family
 members of former South Vietnamese government and military
 officials and people affiliated with anti-Communist
 associations or religious sects have been systematically
 discriminated against.
 People released from reeducation camps face considerable
 discrimination in education, housing, and employment,
 according to refugees. They do not regain their citizenship
 rights until 1 year after leaving the camps, if then. While
 their children generally are not allowed to enter the
 university, they still face discrimination within the
 university system.
 Gradual assimilation and cooption appear to be the
 Government's long-term strategy for most minorities. The
 Government has. created special schools in the Hanoi area for
 the education and indoctrination of minorities to be the "eyes
 and ears of the party" among their own people. Highland
 minorities in central Vietnam are subject to repression if
 suspected of ties with resistance groups. Officially
 programmed resettlement of ethnic Vietnamese into the
 highlands is designed in part to increase government control
 over minority groups. Minorities in the south, such as the
 Chinese and Indians, have been encouraged to leave the
 country. Since the adoption of economic reforms, however, the
 Government has valued the entrepreneurial skills of the
 Chinese population and has allowed a limited renaissance of
 private enterprise in Cho-Ion, where most of Ho Chi Minh City's
 Chinese population lives. It has also permitted the reopening
 of private Chinese-language schools.
 Priority in social services is given to families of party
 members'and families of soldiers who fought for North
 Vietnam.   Academic standards are reportedly lower for
 children of party officials. Arbitrarily high standards are
 set to keep the children of suspect background out of a
 university. Study abroad is also restricted to politically-
 acceptable persons.
 In general, women do not appear to face discrimination in
 employment. Problems faced by women in competing with men for
 higher positions are generally a function of attitudes deeply
 ingrained in traditional Vietnamese society. Such problems
 persist in spite of government efforts to mold popular
 attitudes to conform with the Constitution, legislation, and
 
 
 1074
 
 VIETNAM
 regulations mandating equal treatment before the law in
 virtually all respects. Article 63 of the 1980 Constitution
 provides that women and men should receive equal pay for equal
 work, and a large body of legislation and regulations is
 devoted to the protection of women's rights in marriage as
 well as in the workplace. Government statistics indicate that
 approximately 50 percent of the primary school students are
 girls and that women represent about 39 percent of university
 students. The Government claims that women hold 46 percent of
 the senior posts in government and about 22 percent of the
 National Assembly membership. The top leadership, however, is
 predominantly male, as can be seen, for example, in the
 all-male Politburo.
 There are no statistics available on the frequency of violence
 against women within the home. In 1987 Premier Do Muoi issued
 a decree banning spouse beating.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Vietnamese workers are not free to form or join unions of
 their own choosing. All workers automatically become members
 of the union in their workplace, and dues are deducted from
 their pay. These groups are organized by the Government and
 belong to the government-controlled Federation of Vietnamese
 Workers, which is affiliated with the Communist-controlled
 World Federation of Trade Unions. Strikes are considered
 unpatriotic and officially forbidden; none are known to have
 taken place in 1990. Vietnam is not a member of the
 International Labor Organization.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Vietnamese workers do not have the right to organize unions of
 their own choosing or to bargain collectively. No law
 protects against antiunion discrimination by employers against
 union members and organizers; in the context of mandatory
 union membership the concept is meaningless. Although new
 legislation governing labor unions promulgated in July stops
 well short of providing the right to strike and other tools of
 Western-style collective bargaining, it is nevertheless
 designed to enhance labor's bargaining power vis-a-vis company
 management and to give labor stronger representation in the
 Government. The Chairman of the Vietnam Federation of Trade
 Unions is empowered by the new law to attend conferences of
 the Council of Ministers and raise issues on behalf of labor
 that cannot be resolved at lower levels.
 Despite plans for export processing zones, none are
 operational as yet.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Compulsory labor is permitted by the Constitution, which
 states in Article 58 that "people fit for work must work as
 provided by law." Refugees report that every Vietnamese is
 required by law to contribute 15 days of work per year to the
 state or to pay a fee. In addition, unemployed persons,
 especially unemployed young people, are compelled to work in
 exchange for small wages and food. A number of government
 projects have used forced labor provided by reeducation camp
 prisoners.

 d. Minimum Age-of Employment of Children
 According. to existing regulations inherited from the former
 French colonial administration,* the minimum age for workers in
 Vietnam is 17. Refugees report that children under age 15 are
 exempt from compulsory labor requirements. There is no
 reliable information concerning the enforcement of these
 regulations, nor are any statistics available on the number of
 child workers in Vietnam.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.
 The Government inherited from the former French colonial
 admin'istration a system of regulations pertaining to working
 conditions, including a minimum wage, a maximum workweek of 8
 hours per day, 6 days per week, and safety standards.
 However, except for some safety standards and workers covered
 by a Ho Chi Minh City labor statute, these regulations have
 not been updated since at least 1975, nor are existing
 standards enforced universally.
 Such safety standards as exist are developed jointly by the
 Ministry of Labor and worker organizations at individual
 workplaces. Enforcement of the standards has been uneven at
 best. The new labor union legislation promulgated in July
 1990 stipulates that if the union sees a life-threatening
 situation in the workplace, it can request that management
 correct the problem immediately and that a cessation of work,
 if necessary, be authorized. It further stipulates that the
 union has the right to participate in investigations of
 industrial accidents and to request that the Government or a
 court fix the responsibility for an accident.
 There is no minimum wage in effect. Wages are set locally by
 management. They are generally low and inadequate to provide
 the vast majority of workers and their families a decent
 living. Moreover, workers frequently are paid late, sometimes
 by as much as several months- According to reports from
 refugees, nearly all workers experience delayed paydays in
 their workplace. Observers agree that doctors, nurses, and
 teachers are most often the victims of delayed paydays.
 Possibly as a result, many are reportedly leaving these
 professions, and there is currently an acute shortage of
 teachers.
