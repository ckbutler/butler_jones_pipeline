 SWITZERLAND
 Switzerland, a country with long and respected democratic
 traditions and institutions, has built over the years an
 admirable record with regard to human rights.
 The Swiss Constitution fully guarantees all basic freedoms, and-
 Swiss social institutions provide citizens with the necessities
 of life.
 The federal structure provided for by the Constitution gives the
 individual cantons a considerable degree of autonomy. In spite
 of its linguistic and religious diversity, Switzerland has been
 able to mold for itself a system of consensus which provides the
 opportunity for all its citizens to express their opinions and
 yet work closely together toward common objectives. Popular
 initiatives and referendums afford an effective instrument to
 the individual, as well as the group, to push for significant
 changes in policies through direct action.
 Although under the Swiss federal system cantons are directly
 involved in many human rights matters, this involvement is
 controlled and limited by federal legislative and constitutional
 guarantees. All those who feel that their rights have been
 violated at the cantonal level can appeal for redress to the
 Federal courts. As a complement to its own exemplary human
 rights record, Switzerland has traditionally provided facilities
 to many international organizations concerned with humanitarian
 affairs as well as extended support to refugees from around the
 world.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 No such occurrences have taken place in Switzerland.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no reports of abduction, secret arrests, or
 clandestine detention.
 C. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution provides freedom from all of the above, and
 there have been no allegations of any violations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Swiss criminal law does not provide, as does common law, for
 habeas corpus. However, freedom from arbitrary arrest,
 detention, or exile is guaranteed by law. A detained person may
 not be held longer than 24 hours without a warrant of arrest
 issued by the judge conducting the preliminary investigation.
 Once the warrant is issued, the individual may be detained as
 long as necessary until the investigation is completed.
 However, the length of investigative detention is always
 reviewed by higher judicial authority and, traditionally,
 investigations are conducted within a very brief period. A
 suspect must immediately be shown the warrant under which he or
 
 (1101)
 
 
 1102
 she is being held, and he or she has a right to contact legal
 counsel as soon as an arrest warrant is issued. Bail, or
 release on personal recognizance, is traditionally granted,
 unless the examining magistrate believes the individual is a
 danger to society or will not appear for trial.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Public trials are guaranteed by the Swiss Constitution. Minor
 cases are tried by a single judge; difficult cases, by a panel
 of judges; and murder or other serious crimes, by a public
 jury. According to longstanding tradition in Switzerland, even
 the most serious cases are usually brought to trial within
 several weeks or, at the most, a few months. However, in 1983
 the European tribunal ruled against Switzerland in a case
 involving the trial of a lawyer accused of unlawful activities,
 holding that the trial had taken an inordinate length of time.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There have been no allegations of violations in this area by
 Swiss authorities.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There are no restrictions on freedoms of speech and press in
 Switzerland, except in cases involving groups or associations
 considered a potential threat to the confederation. However,
 there are no groups or associations so-designated at the present
 time.
 A peripheral issue in this area involves the linguistic
 minorities of Switzerland, specifically the Italian and Romansch
 linguistic groups. Occasionally, these groups have expressed
 fear that the limited resources made available to them by the
 Government endanger the continued, intellectual vitality of
 these languages and amount to a deprivation of freedom of
 speech. The Government is fully aware of these concerns and has
 taken steps to meet them. Switzerland has four official
 national languages.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Switzerland places no restrictions on peaceful assembly and
 association, but local permits from police authorities must be
 obtained before holding such meetings. These permits are
 rarely, if ever, refused except in cases where the authorities
 have reason to believe that the meeting will lead to violence.
 Occasionally, even when permits have been granted,
 demonstrations, mostly involving youth, have become violent and
 there have been complaints of police overreaction. In the rare
 instances when this has happened, public opinion and the media
 have reacted strongly to abuses of authority and asked that
 steps be taken to avoid repetition of similar incidents.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Switzerland enjoys religious freedom. One area, however, which
 over the years has caused difficulties is the issue of universal
 
 
 1103
 military service by Swiss men. Swiss law provides no exemption
 for conscientious objectors, who are nearly always convicted for
 their refusal to serve. Efforts have been made, particularly in
 1982-83, to modify the Swiss Constitution in order to provide
 alternative service for those who wish to claim exemption for
 reasons of conscience. These efforts, so far unsuccessful,
 continue.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Swiss citizens have complete freedom of movement within
 Switzerland and can emigrate in accordance with Swiss law
 without any difficulty. Switzerland has traditionally been a
 haven for refugees from many countries. Currently, there are
 about 32,000 refugees in Switzerland, the vast majority from
 Eastern Europe, Africa, and Asia. Since 1982, the traditional
 welcome to refugees has been somewhat tempered by concern over
 growing unemployment, some of which was blamed on the influx of
 these refugees. Overall, however, the Swiss people remain
 prepared to provide shelter and assistance to refugees, as
 reflected in the Federal and cantonal governments' actions.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Switzerland is a highly developed, constitutional democracy.
 Federal legislative power is vested in a bicameral legislature
 elected by universal suffrage every four years. Swiss women,
 who in the past have been deprived of the right to vote, can now
 do so in all Federal elections in 24 of the 26 cantons. Labor
 unions enjoy full freedom to organize, to strike, and to
 influence political decisions. Nevertheless, Swiss labor
 relations over the years have been characterized by "industrial
 peace," and strikes and other labor unrest are practically
 unknown in Switzerland.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Switzerland cooperates closely in all areas of human rights with
 international and non-governmental groups. There have been no
 requests during recent years for outside investigations of the
 human rights situation in Switzerland, with the exception of the
 case described in le. which has been resolved.
 Amnesty International expressed its concern over the situation
 of conscientious objectors to military service, while Freedom
 House called Switzerland "free.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Swiss per capita gross national product is $17,114.80, the
 highest in the industrialized world. Health services are
 available and good. Infant mortality rate is being reduced
 continuously and now stands at 7.60 per 1,000. Life expectancy
 at birth is 75.07 years. Unemployment, which until 1982 was
 practically nonexistent, reached a high of 0.9 percent in
 November 1982 becoming a cause of serious concern. In addition,
 if workers on short-workweeks were to be included as a component
 of the unemployment rate, the figure would rise to nearly three
 
 
 1104
 percent. The Government, however, has taken steps to promote
 employment. Education is of high quality and free through
 university level, although access to the universities is limited
 by finite resources and is closely controlled through rigorous
 entrance examinations. The primary school enrollment ratio is
 about 90 percent (1980), while the adult literacy rate is 99
 percent.
 The right of ownership is fully provided for and protected by
 the law for Swiss nationals. On the other hand, real estate
 acquisition by foreigners is strictly controlled and in recent
 years has become the object of considerable concern because of
 its expansion.
 Swiss population growth ran at 0.2 percent in 1982. The average
 age of the Swiss population as a result has been increasing;
 nearly 15 percent of the population is over 65. As much as 18
 percent of the total population of Switzerland is made up of
 foreign workers and their families. Steps have been taken in
 recent years to limit the number of foreign workers coming into
 Switzerland or obtaining residence permits. The Swiss
 Government and cantonal authorities have also started to look
 into the need to integrate foreign workers and their families
 into Swiss social services programs, but in times of economic
 difficulties and unemployment some Swiss resent the provision of
 additional facilities to foreign workers.
 The women's role in the Swiss political and business worlds
 remains limited, although they have been more involved than in
 the past. In the 1983 Federal elections, 25 women were elected
 to the Swiss Parliament. This represents 10 percent of the
 composition-of that body, compared to 51 percent of the
 population. However, two of the three largest vote-getters in
 the elections were women. Generally, Swiss women are still paid
 less for equal work and remain underrepresented in senior
 positions in industry, banking, and government.
