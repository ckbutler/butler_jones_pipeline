 LIBYA*
 The Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya is a dictatorship ruled by
 Major    General   (formerly   Colonel)  Mu'ammar      AI-Qadhafi,   aided   by
 extragovernmental Revolutionary Committees operating at his behest. The govern-
 ing principles of the society are expressed in Qadhafi a "Green Book" rather than
 in a constitution. He has created a political system borrowing from pan-Islamic and
 pan-Arab sources and purporting to establish a 'third way" superior to both capital-
 ism and communism. in the past, he has used assassination and intimidation as
 ways to control his enemies abroad; at home he continues to use a variety of sum-
 mary judicial proceedings to suppress any popular resistance. Ethnic minorities,
 such as Berbers are tightly controlled, and the Government continues its campaign
 against banned Islamic groups.
 Libya maintains an extensive security apparatus, consisting of several elite mili-
 tary units, including Qadhafi's personal bodyguards. The local Revolutionary Coin-

 mittees and People's Committees also have security functions, designed to monitor
 as well as protect the populace. The result is multilayered, pervasive surveillance
 and control of individual activities.
 Limited privatization continued in 1993, with government decrees legalizing pri-
 vate wholesale trade and the sale of some parastatal assets. State domination of the
 economy is assured, however, by complete government control of Libya's rich oil re-
 sources, the principal source of foreign exchange. Libya has used part of its oil in-
 come to finance internal development (new schools, hospitals, roads), but much has
 been wasted.
 There continued to be little change in the human rights situation in 1993, and
 most rights remain tightly restricted. There are no effective rights to freedom of
 speech, including expression of views opposing those of the Government, to peaceful
 association or assembly, to formation of trade unions, or to strike. Citizens do not
 have the right to change their government. Personal rights, such as the right to be
 considered innocent unless proven guilty, to a public and speedy trial, to legal coun-
 sel, to be secure in one's home or person, or to hold property, are also strictly lim-
 ited.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Opposition sources claim approxi-
 mately 300 military personnel were killed in a failed "coup attempt" in mid-October.
 A large number of offenses, including political offenses and 'economic crimes," are
 unishableIby death under Libyan law. For example, Law No. 71 of 1972 provides
 for the death penalty for anyone involved with any group activity based on any ide-
 ology opposed to the principles of the revolution. Despite his longstanding stated in-
 tntions, General Qadhafi has not acted to abolish the death penalty for this offense.
 To the contrary, in the September 1991 Consolidation of Liberty Law No. 20, Article
 4 stipulates that the death penalty may be imposed on "those whose lives constitute
 a threat or cause depravity to society."
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearance in 1993 (but see Sec-
 tion 1.c.).
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although Libya is a party to the United Nations Convention against Torture and
 Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, prisoners are re-
 portedly tortured during interrogations or for discipline. There were no confirmed
 reports of torture in 1993; it is impossible to say to what extent torture was used
 in 1993 because of the tight controls maintained by the Government concerning
 such information. Foreign workers, particularly from sub-Saharan Africa, have been
 the target of periodic detentions and alleged torture. Many prisoners are held in-
 communicado, which makes confirmation of torture difficult.
 Methods of torture reportedly include: chaining to a wall for hours, clubbing, elec-
 tric shock, corkscrews in the back, lemon juice in open wounds, breaking fingers and
 allowing the joints to heal without medical care, suffocation using plastic bags, dep-
 rivation of food and water, and beatings on the soles of the feet. Libyan law calls
 for fines against any official using excessive force, but there are no known cases of
 prosecution for torture or abuse.
 In April General Qadhafi publicly called for a stricter application of Koranic law,
 or Shar'ia. He criticized the leniency of judicial punishments, recommending legsla-
 tion to mandate amputation for thievery and public whipping for adulterers. There
 was no evidence that these recommendations were enacted into law.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Under Libyan law, detainees may be held
 incommunicado for unlimited periods. Many political prisoners are held in unofficial
 detention centers, controlled by members of the Revolutionary Committees, where
 prolonged periods of incommunicado detention are common. Many allegedly are held
 without charge or trial, apparently as an example to other would-be opponents of
 the regime. There continued to be reliable reports that between 400 and 500 politi-
 cal detainees were still being held, most of whom were arrested after a limited am-
 nesty was proclaimed in 1988. Some opponents of the regime claim the Government
 repeatedly detains thousands more for periods too brief (3 to 4 months) to permit
 confirmation by outside observers. While undergoing interrogation, sometimes for
 periods of several months, prisoners are given no access to legal representation. For-
 eigners have also been subject to arbitrary arrest and torture. There have been cred-
 ible reports that some foreign workers in Libya have been forced into military train-
 ing and military service on behalf of Libya or coerced into subversive activities
 against their own countries.
 
 
 1246
 Exile is not a form of punishment practiced in Libya- to the contrary, General Qa-
 dhafi seeks to pressure Libyans working or studying abroad to return to Libya. The
 regime does, however, arbitrarily expel noncitizens (see Section 6.e.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria/.-Most civilians are tried in regular courts, but their
 cases may be referred to less formal "people's courts" or to military or revolutionary
 courts, depending on the arbitrary decision of the security forces. Security forces
 have the power to judge persons guilty without trial, particularly "traitors to the
 people." Some trials are held in private or in the absence of the accused.
 An 1981 law prohibits the private practice of law and makes all attorne s employ-
 ees of the Secretariat of Justice. Libya claims it "guarantees prisoners all necessary
 means of defense and safeguards of justice adequate to the principles contained in
 the Universal Declaration of Human Rights" and provides for legal assistance "as
 soon as possible with respect to the exigencies of interrogation."  is claim notwith-
 standing, there continue to    credible reports that these rights are denied.
 Alleged political offenses have at times been tried before ad hoc revolutionary
 courts rather than by civilian courts, with opprtunities to engage defense counsel
 severely restricted. A number of these trials have been held in secret. Despite the
 regime s announcement of their abolition in 1988, "extraordinary" courts are still in
 operation and have been publicly discussed in the case of Islamists. Of the 400 to
 500 political prisoners believed to be held in Libyan prisons, most were never for-
 mally charged or tried.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government does not respect the right to privacy. The legal requirement that judi-
 cial warrants be obtained before entering a private home is often disregarded. Local
 and international telephone calls are routinely monitored. The security agencies and
 the Revolutionary Committees oversee an extensive informer network. Libyan exiles
 report that mere family ties to suspected regime opponents can result in harassment
 or even persecution and detention by the authorities. Property may be seized and
 burned ifit belongs to "enemies of the people" or those who "cooperate" with foreign
 powers.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The authorities tolerate some difference of opin-
 ion in People's Committee meetings and at the General People's Congress but in
 general severely limit freedom of speech. This is especially true with regard to criti-
 cism of General Qadhafi or his regime. Infrequent media criticism of regime mem-
 bers or policies is interpreted as orchestrated attempts to test public reactions or
 as efforts to weaken the popular support of General Qadhafi's potential challengers
 within the Government.
 Political speech is repressed through legislation banning all political activities not
 sanctioned by the Government, including the nonviolent expression of conscien-
 tiously held beliefs. The legislation that makes the dissemination of "hostile infor-
 mation" a crime is so all-encompassing that almost any form of expression mav, be
 deemed illegal. Fear of being informed upon by elements of the Revolutionary Com-
 mittees and an underlying climate of mistrust at all levels of society further inhibit
 freedom of speech.
 Libyan media are owned and controlled by the State. There is a state-run daily
 newspaper, with a circulation of 40,000. The Revolutionary Committees publish sev-
 eral smaller newspapers. JANA, the official news agency, is the designated conduit
 for official views. Publishing opinions contrary to government policy is not per-
 mitted. Newsweek, Time, the International Herald Tribu:e, and Express Jeune
 Afrique are available but are routinely censored. There are strict controls on foreign
 publications at the Tripoli airport. Foreign broadcasts can be received.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Public assembly is repressed
 unless it is government controlled and supportive of regime pasitions. The right of
 association is limited and granted only to institutions affiliated with the regime. Ac-
 cording to Law No. 71 of 1972, party activities constituting "treason" are punishable
 by death. Offending activities include "any grouping, organization, or formation, of
 whatever kind or number, which is based on a political concept opposed in its aims
 to the principles of the Revolution." Organizations such as independent trade unions
 and professional associations are viewed as unnecessary, since General Qadhafi has
 vowed not to "accept intermediaries between the revolution and its working forces."
 In spite of these restrictions, worsening economic conditions and growing dis-
 satisfaction with government performance prompted several informal protest meet-
 ings.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Libya is overwhelmingly Muslim. In an apparent effort
 to eliminate all alternative power bases, the regime has banned the once-powerfil
 Sanusiyya Islamic religious sect. In its place, General Qadhafi established the Is-
 
 
 1247
 lamic Call Society (ICS), which became the outlet for state-sanctioned religion as
 well as a tool for exporting the Libyan revolution abroad. In 1992 the Government
 announced the disbandment of the ICS; however, recent public statements by the
 ICS suggest it remains active. Islamic groups at variance with the state-sanctioned
 version are banned.
 Members of some minority religions (e.g., Christianity) are allowed to conduct
 services. Services in Christian churches are attended by the foreign community.
 There is a resident Catholic bishop operating two churches with a small number of
 priests. Nuns reportedly are permitted to wear religious habits.
 General Qadhafi's domestic campaign against banned Islamic groups continued in
 1993, with frequent arrests of suspected members and sympathizers and public
 denouncements of the groups. There was one unverified report that General Qadhafi
 forced orthodox Muslims at one mosque to shave (as a form of public humiliation)
 after Friday services. Those who refused were allegedly arrested. A majority of the
 political detainees in Libya are reported to be associated with banned Islamic
 groups.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-With the exception of security areas, movement is not usually restricted
 for Libyan citizens. Traditionally, exit permits have been required for travel abroad,
 and currency controls have also served to restrict travel. Women must have their
 husband's permission for them or their children to travel abroad.
 In 1991 Libya and Egypt agreed to allow the unrestricted travel of their nationals
 across their mutual border, and thousands of Libyans reportedly go back and forth
 regularly. This travel, as well as travel from Libya to Tunisia, increased in 1993
 as Libyans began to feel the full impact of the international air embargo. However,
 the Libyan Government tightened border controls in October, apparenty as a form
 of political retaliation against neighboring states for their enforcement o U.N. sanc-
 tions against Libya.
 The Revolutionary Committees maintain surveillance of some Libyans while they
 are abroad. Libyan nationals' right of return is theoretically fully protected, even for
 opponents of General Qadhafi. However, this "right" may be more nearly an obliga-
 tion; the regime often calls on students, many of whom receive a government sub-
 sidy, and others working abroad to return on little or no notice and without regard
 to the impact on their studies or work. Libyans who study abroad are interrogated
 on their return home. A number of Libyans, including most exiled opposition lead-
 ers, refuse to return.
 Opposition activists claim Libyan agents in Cairo abducted, and possibly mur-
 dered, former Libyan Foreign Minister and prominent opposition figure Mansur
 Kikhya in December. Qadhafi also called publicly for the murder of regime oppo-
 nents.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The people of Libya have no right to change their government. Major government
 decisions are controlled by General Qadhafi, a few key associates, or by committees
 acting in his name. He appoints military officers and official functionaries down to
 junior levels. Power flows through a small circle of trusted associates. Corruption
 and favoritism (partially based on tribal origin) are major problems, adversely af-
 fecting the efficiency of government.
 Political parties and tribal or local groupings are prohibited. Participation in elec-
 tions is mandatory, and all candidates are approvedd by the Revolutionary Commit-
 tees. Candidates may not be "merchants, contractors, tribal advocates, election bro-
 kers, officials of the forner (pre-1969) government, or people who have been at-
 tacked by the power of the revolution."
 Popular participation in government is theoretically provided by the grassroots
 People's Committees, which send representatives annually to the national General
 People's Congress (GPC). In practice, the GPC is a rubberstamp assembly, approv-
 ing all recommendations made by General Qadhafi.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 No independent human rights organizations are permitted to function. The Liby-
 an Arab Human Rights Committee, a government organization, was created in May
 1989. However, there are no reports of any activities by the Committee.
 Libyan officials last met with Amnesty International (AI) representatives during
 a June 1988 visit. Since then the Government has repeatedly refused to reply sub-
 stantively to Al's appeals on behalf of political detainees in Libya. The Government
 did not respond to requests for visits by Al in 1993.
 
 
 1248
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Women's rights are restricted both by law and by the conservative Is-
 lamic attitudes of Libya's society. There were credible reports in 1993 of women
 being harassed or briefly detained for their manner of dress or for approaching a
 man in public without a male escort.
 General Qadhafi has led efforts to improve the status of women and expand their
 access to educational and employment opportunities. With some exceptions, women
 currently receive basic military training and are subject to the military draft.
 No information is available on the extent to which violence against women is a
 problem in Libya.
 Children.-The Government provides subsidized medical care and education, im-
 proving the welfare of children over the past 25 years. Declining revenues and gen-
 eral economic mismanagement, however, is leading to cutbacks, particularly in med-
 ical services.
 Female circumcision, which has been condemned by international health experts
 as damaging to physical and mental health, is reportedly still practiced among trib-
 al groups in remote areas of the south.
 National/Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-Arab-speaking Muslims of mixed Arab and
 Berber ancestry make up 97 percent of Libya a population. The principal non-Arab
 minorities are Berbers and blacks. There are frequent allegations of discrimination
 based on tribal status, particularly against Berbers in the interior and Tuaregs in
 the south. In past years, General Qadhafi sought unsuccessfully to assure that Ber-
 hers married only non-Berbers, presumably in an effort to erode their tribal identity.
 In 1991 and 1992, the Government expelled thousands of black African workers
 from Libya under circumstances that appeared discriminatory (see Section 6.e.).
 Other threatened expulsions, primarily directed at Tuaregs, appear intended to
 exert political and economic pressure on their nations of origin (see Section 6.e.).
 People with Disabilities. -No information is available on the Government's efforts
 to assist people with disabilities or to indicate whether it has enacted legislation or
 otherwise mandated provision of accessibility for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers do not have the right to form or join unions
 of their own choosing. The official trade union organization, the National Trade
 Unions' Federation, which was created in 1972, is under government control and ad-
 ministered through the People's Committee system. Every Libyan worker is re-
 quired to join a trade union, but foreign workers are not allowed to join.
 Although unions are assured the right to "safeguard their interests," there is no
 right to strike, and no strikes by Libyan workers have been reported for years. In
 a June 1992 speech, General Qadhafi stated that workers have the right to strike
 but added that strikes do not occur in Libya because the workers are in control and
 "can change authority" any time they wish. Despite this statement, no law author-
 izes workers to strike.
 With government financing, the official trade union organization plays an activist
 role in the International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions and the Organization
 of African Trade Union Unity and exploits international trade union contacts to en-
 gage in propaganda efforts on behalf of the Government. In November the Arab
 ahreb Trade Union Federation (USTMA) suspended the membership of Libya's
 trade union organization. The suspension followed reports that General Qadhafi had
 replaced all trade union leaders, in some cases appointing loyal followers without
 trade union credentials.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Although the Labor Code pro-
 vides for cellective agreements, with the stipulation that the validity of these agree-
 ments must be subject to government approval, there is no collective bargaining in
 Libya.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The comments from the 1992 re-
 port of the International Labor Organization's (ILO) Committee of Experts that
 persons expressing certain political views or views ideologically opposed to the es-
 tablished political, social, or economic system may be punished with penalties of im-
 prisonment... involving.. . an obligation to perform labor" remain unchallenged.
 The same report noted that public employees in Libya can be imprisoned and sen-
 tenced to compulsory labor . . . as a punishment or breaches of labor discipline
 or for participation in strikes even in services whose interruption would not endazn-
 g er the life, personal safety, or health of the whole or part of the population." The
 Government as repeatedly told the ILO's Conference Committee on the Application
 of Conventions and Recommendations that there have been changes in legislation
 
 
 1249
 
 that abolish these provisions, but no corroborating evidence has been submitted to
 the ILO.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 of children is 18. Education is compulsory to age 15.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Wor.-Libya maintains a work force of around
 1,120,000 workers (plus an additional 1.2 million foreign workers) in a population
 of 4.4 million. There is a legally mandated minimum wage, which is adequate to
 afford a worker and family a decent standard of living. The legal maximum work-
 week is 48 hours. Libyan labor law defines the rights and duties of workers, includ-
 ing matters of compensation, pension rights, minimum rest periods, and working
 hours. A corps of labor inspectors, based in the seven municipalities of the country,
 are assigned to inspect places of work for compliance with legal standards, including
 occupational health and safety standards. Certain industries, such as the petroleum
 sector, try to maintain standards originally set by foreign companies.
 The a bor law does not accord equality of treatment to the foreign workers in
 Libya, who do much of the blue-collar and technical work. Foreign workers may stay
 in the country only for the duration of the contracts under which they are employed.
 Foreign workers are subject to arbitrary pressures, such as changes in work rules
 and contracts, with little option but to accept or to depart the country, often without
 full compensation for work already performed. Conditions of employment are subject
 to negotiation between the worker and the employer. Foreign workers who are not
 under contract enjoy no protection.
 In the spring of 1990, the Government began expelling thousands of black African
 workers, claiming they were in Libya illegally. Chadians, Nigerians, Nigeriens,
 Malians, and Ghanaians were rounded up at their homes or work sites, detained
 for varying lengths of time, and returned destitute to their countries, usually with
 no warning to their governments. Press reports in several of these countries have
 carried unsubstantiated accounts of arbitrary detention and mistreatment of these
 workers by Libyan authorities prior to their expulsion, as well as of the disappear-
 ance of at least 16 workers and the killing, probably extrajudicially, of 1 Mah~an la-
 borer. There were continued reports of expulsions in 1992, and many workers are
 reported to be detained under difficult conditions. General Qadhafi reportedly
 threatened neighboring states in 1993 with mass expulsions of their nationals from
 Libya to exert economic and political pressure on those states. In November he
 called for the expulsion of most of the 25,000 Tai workers in Libya. This was p
 parently in retaliation for the Thai Government's action to remove approximately
 200 Thai workers from the Tarhunah chemical weapons project. To date, the Libyan
 Government has taken no action against the Thai workers.
