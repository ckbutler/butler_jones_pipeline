 HAITI
 Haiti is ruled by President-for-Life Jean-Claude Duvalier, who
 succeeded to the presidency upon the death of his father in
 1971. In June 1985 the National Assembly adopted Haiti's
 first political parties law and passed 31 constitutional
 amendments. The amendments created a prime ministership but
 also augmented the president's powers, reaffirming the
 ultimate authority exercised by the President-for-Life.
 Legislative elections were advanced from February 1990 to
 1987. The unicameral Assembly is normally elected to 6-year
 terms, but, like all government institutions, is dominated by
 the President. Most opposition politicians have rejected the
 political parties law but two parties, one independent and one
 progovernment, have begun the registration process in order to
 contest the 1987 elections. Elections under the Duvaliers
 historically have not been free, although the 1983 municipal
 and 1984 assembly elections were actively contested and less
 impeded than prior elections.
 The police are a part of the Armed Forces of Haiti under the
 Ministry of Interior and Defense. The national militia,
 called the Volunteers for National Security (or VSN by its
 French acronym), report directly to the President. Neither
 the Armed Forces nor the VSN plays a significant role in the
 governmental decisionmaking processes.
 Haiti remains the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere.
 Nearly 80 percent of the rural population and more than half
 the urban population live below the absolute poverty level.
 The Government receives economic assistance from international
 donors to help address problems resulting from overpopulation
 and an agriculture devastated by soil erosion. Despite an
 expanding assembly industry, Haiti's economic problems remain
 acute.
 Continuing a trend which began in late 1984, the independent
 media have criticized the Government and commented on
 contentious political issues with unprecedented vigor. In
 addition, on April 19, a presidential amnesty freed 37
 political and state security prisoners. The Government
 claimed that the April amnesty cleared the jails of political
 prisoners, but the amnesty left the whereabouts of several
 persons unaccounted for.
 Two Haitians allegedly distributing political pamphlets were
 killed by security forces on April 22. In July the police
 arrested six persons for circulating an unregistered newspaper
 and expelled three Belgian priests, including the director of
 the church's Radio Soleil for news reporting which the
 Government contends exceeded the station's charter. In
 December the radio station itself was closed by the
 authorities for 3 weeks. In November, security forces fired
 on student demonstrators in the town of Gonaives, killing 4
 and wounding 14 and thereby setting off widespread protests in
 other cities. On December 17 the Government announced the
 arrest of some officials for the shootings. Also in December,
 the Government detained for 4 weeks a leading opposition
 figure and former minister, Hubert Deronceray, allegedly for
 possession of subversive documents.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 During the night of April 22, two Haitians were shot and
 killed by government security forces, according to the
 Government, while they attempted to flee after being caught
 distributing political pamphlets near Port au Prince City Hall
 and exchanging shots with the police. Nongovernment sources
 reported that both men were killed at a military prison in the
 presence of a government minister. No pamphlets or other
 evidence were presented to support the government's version of
 events. The Government stated that it sincerely regretted the
 .killings and that they did not represent a new repressive
 policy or strategy. On November 28, 4 students were killed
 and 14 people were wounded as the result of military actions
 to quell demonstrations in the town of Gonaives.  Two of the
 killings were apparently unprovoked, and a commission of
 inquiry was formed to investigate the shootings. Two
 officials were subsequently arrested for shooting the students.
 Questions continued to be raised throughout 1985 about the
 killing of Father Albert DeSmett, a member of the same order
 as the priests expelled in July, which occurred several days
 before the expulsions. Church officials at the time reported
 that available evidence indicated DeSmett was killed during a
 robbery in his room, presumably by the same intruder who had
 burgled DeSmett's room the previous week. The Government's
 autopsy and police investigation reports, which might help
 clarify the matter, have not been made public.
 b. Disappearance
 Following the April 1985 amnesty, the Government was asked
 about 15 unaccounted-for persons, all but 2 of whom had
 reportedly been detained before 1985. Of these two, one was
 subsequently released, while the second remains unaccounted
 for. (A previously unknown detainee was also released.) The
 Government has stated its intention to investigate the reports
 of these persons' detention and to attempt to determine their
 whereabouts.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 A number of political prisoners were reportedly seriously
 beaten during 1985 while being interrogated. One of those
 released in the April amnesty, Antoine Leroy, bears scars from
 the beatings. He was rearrested in October on suspicion of
 being involved in a conspiracy to overthrow the Government.
 Other political prisoners released in April described cases of
 beatings they had witnessed or had heard about from fellow
 inmates. Abuse of nonpolitical prisoners is less frequent but
 does occur, usually in the smaller towns by unsupervised
 police or militia. In mid-December the director of a
 Protestant school in Gonaives, Fritz Bernard, died while in
 the Gonaives jail, allegedly from a severe beating.
 Prison conditions are generally primitive in Haiti, but
 prisoners are normally permitted to receive visitors, food,
 and medical treatment. However, particularly in the early
 
 
 573
 HAITI
 stages of an arrest or when they are taken to the Casernes
 Dessalines military prison, prisoners are often kept in
 degrading circumstances, such as stripped to their underwear
 in crowded and unsanitary conditions. The cells in the
 Casernes have no windows, no lights, and only buckets for
 toilets. Visitors usually are not allowed into the Casernes,
 and food is not always provided. An American citizen,
 implicated in an October coup plot, was denied visitors at the
 Casernes for 2 weeks following his arrest.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Haitian law requires the arresting authority to present to the
 accused a warrant specifying the alleged violation of law. If
 an arrest is made without a warrant, a judicial ruling :on the
 validity of the detention must be obtained within 48 hours.
 This procedure is not always observed, although there are
 indications that the Government is increasingly attentive to
 observing legal procedures. Generally, those persons
 confirmed as having been detained for political reasons in
 1985 were released within 48 hours or held longer only after
 the Government obtained the necessary judgment. However, the
 Government failed to respect this procedure in the cases of
 two American citizens and Hubert Deronceray, all of whom were
 facing political charges. In 1985, detainees were normally
 allowed contact with family members; previously, detainees had
 often been held incommunicado.
 On April 29, a presidential amnesty freed 37 political and
 state security prisoners including the,19 persons detained in
 November 1984 and members of the Heraux Group, who had been
 tried and convicted of a 1983 bombing in Port au Prince. At
 that time the Government stated that it no longer held any
 political prisoners. However, the amnesty left several
 persons unaccounted for, and there were several detentions
 reported in late 1985 in connection with an exile plot to
 overthrow the Government, as already mentioned. As 1985
 closed, the number of persons detained in Haiti without charge
 is unknown, but the figure for political detainees, judging
 from the list of unaccounted-for persons, could range up to 20.
 Haitian law requires a suspect to be charged at least 2 weeks
 prior to the trial. This does not always happen in practice.
 The law permits legal counsel for defendants, but a client is
 sometimes not allowed to meet with his lawyer until
 immediately before the trial. There is no system of bail,
 though "provisional liberty" can be obtained in some cases.
 Juries and tribunals are both used to hear cases, render
 judgments, and impose sentences. Defendants have the right to
 appeal a conviction within 3 days of the decision.
 During 1985, the Government twice resorted to the expulsion of
 persons deemed to pose a political or security threat to the
 regime. Three Belgian priests were expelled in July because
 of alleged political activities. Former Minister of Interior
 and Defense Roger Lafontant, although not legally expelled,
 was compelled to leave Haiti on October 4. Two persons freed
 under the April amnesty are known to have heeded government
 warnings to leave Haiti for an extended period.
 A 1984 amendment to the labor code revised the provisions on
 forced and compulsory labor to bring them into compliance with
 the relevant convention of the International Labor
 Organization (ILO).
 
 
 574
 HAITI
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary is independent of the executive only in theory.
 The culmination in 1985 of legal proceedings stemming from a
 1984 shooting death illustrates the degree of political
 interference in some cases. The incident involved a bodyguard
 to the then-Minister of Interior and Defense who was shot to
 death by a nightclub owner in what appeared to be
 self-defense. The issue erupted into a test of political
 strength between government factions. The owner was released
 and rearrested in a series of judicial reversals after two
 senior Ministry of Justice officials became involved in the
 case. The Supreme Court finally acquitted the owner in March
 after it had been instructed by the President to see that
 justice was done. The decision was hailed in some legal
 circles as a victory for Haitian justice, but in fact the case
 illustrated the limitations on the judiciary's independence.
 In early April, the National Security Court was convened for
 the first time to retry the Heraux Group, five suspects in a
 1983 Port au Prince bombing which killed several persons. The
 defense had appealed their earlier convictions by the ordinary
 courts, arguing that the case was political and therefore
 properly in the domain of the National Security Court. The
 defense prevailed and the second trial (like the first in
 1984) was conducted in conformity with normal judicial
 procedures. The trial was open, and lawyers for the accused
 mounted a vigorous defense. The original convictions were
 sustained,-but the life sentences were reduced to 9 years,
 which local legal observers regarded as more appropriate to
 the crime. All five Heraux Group convicts were later freed in
 the April 29 presidential amnesty.
 After a 52 percent budget increase in fiscal year 1985, the
 Ministry of Justice received a further 32 percent rise in
 fiscal year 1986. In September, Justice Minister Theodore
 Achille introduced legislation designed to reduce the backlog
 of cases plaguing the courts. The changes include lengthening
 the annual court calendar, extending the hours for daily court
 sessions, and imposing penalties on judges who do not complete
 caseloads and lawyers who do not vigorously defend clients.
 In the past, political prisoners in Haiti were seldom brought
 to trial. The 1985 retrial of the Heraux Group before the
 National Security Court followed an appeal of earlier
 convictions. The failure to bring other political prisoners
 to trial in 1985 appeared to result either from the brevity of
 their detention (the journalists in June) or from their
 release under the presidential amnesty before their cases were
 ready for trial. In nonpolitical cases, it is not uncommon
 for the accused to wait at least 6 months before the case
 comes to trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There is no systematic interference with the right of privacy
 or the sanctity of the home. However, when searches and the
 monitoring of homes do occut, it is generally without a
 warrant. No one is known to have been subjected to house
 arrest in 1985.
 The Volunteers for National Security (VSN) is a national
 militia. It performs security functions and serves as an
 
 
 575
 HAITI
 informer system, reporting to the President on the political
 opposition and threats to the regime. This group is
 responsible for a number of abuses and is known to act
 arbitrarily, often in areas nominally falling under police
 jurisdiction.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Constitution guarantees each citizen the "right
 to express his thoughts in all matters and by every means at
 his disposal," government actions and legislation sharply
 curtail this right. The 1980 press code requires that all
 publications be submitted 72 hours in advance for governmental
 review, that all journalists be accredited by the Ministry of
 Information, and that no material critical of the Duvalier
 family be published. The first of these requirements is often
 unenforced, but the media are aware that their freedom to
 operate depends on the sufferance of the Government. This
 induces an awkward attempt to gauge the current depth of
 government patience and the degree of self-censorship
 necessary to avert a government crackdown.
 On balance, 1985 witnessed some improvements as well as
 setbacks in the ability of the media to perform an important
 role in Haiti's political development. Just as previous
 periods of relaxed press controls have coincided with
 government attempts to project itself as a liberalizing
 institution, expanded media activity has accompanied President
 Duvalier's repeatedly expressed intention to democratize
 Haiti. The Government's steps towards implementing its reform
 program provided the media with many opportunities to play a
 wider role in political events.
 Encouraged by President Duvalier's January 2 speech promising
 major reforms, the independent media became increasingly bold
 in reporting, analyzing and debating contentious political
 issues. The three established news magazines (Le Petit Samedi
 Soir, Information, Inferno, and Le Courrier, a new entrant)
 featured articles by and about the major opposition leaders
 and their critical views of government policy. These
 publications are able to attract advertising by major
 businesses without government interference. New subjects
 receiving independent comment in 1985 included the political
 parties law, presidency-for-life, policy differences between
 the International Monetary Fund and the Government, and
 achievements of Haitian emigres. Some press accounts
 contradicted government claims of a massive turnout in the
 July referendum and detailed local voting irregularities.
 In August, a government official lost his job after he
 criticized the referendum in Le Courrier. Although the
 Government apparently reacted against one of its own officials
 criticizing its policies, rather than against the article per
 se, the incident received extensive comment in press circles.
 There are four Haitian dailies: one is the official
 government paper, and the others, while privately owned, are
 basically progovernment. The daily press is still
 considerably less adventurous than the Magazines, but it too
 is expanding the scope of its coverage to include
 controversial events which sometimes cast the Government in an
 unfavorable light (for. example, official corruption). The
 
 
 576
 HAITI
 progovernment Le Matin welcomed the annual commemoration in
 July of the founding of the VSN with paeans to its service to
 the Government and country; the next day it ran a blistering
 editorial condemning the random shooting sprees many VSN had
 engaged in following the formal celebrations. Le Matin
 criticized the Government for having allowed the rampages to
 occur and followed up the next day with reports of casualties
 and pictures of some of the wounded. In 1984, opposition
 figures were almost never mentioned by name; this year, some
 of the opposition communiques appeared in the dailies, and
 Gregoire Eugene's treatise, "The Haitian Miracle is Possible,"
 received balanced reviews.
 The church-owned radio stations, Radio Soleil (Catholic) and
 Radio Lumiere (Protestant), are important outlets for
 independent information. The Government expelled Radio
 Soleil's director in July. The Government also embargoed
 utility services to the station, forcing it to rely on an
 expensive generator for nearly a month. In December the
 Government closed Radio Soleil for 3 weeks reportedly for
 ignoring repeated government warnings to refrain from
 "sensationalist" broadcasting. In light of this disturbing
 action, Protestant station Radio Lumiere suspended its own
 news programming in an apparent effort to steer clear of the
 controversy and to protect its own broadcasting license. The
 government-run Radio Nationale and Television Nationale
 reflect only government views. A privately owned cable
 television company servicing Port au Prince (Telehaiti)
 generally broadcasts uncontroversial news, although in its
 coverage of the referendum, Telehaiti quoted a New York Times
 dispatch citing widespread voting irregularities.
 The arrest of six persons on July 20 at the offices of Inferno
 in connection with the banned journal, Conviction, was another
 reminder of the constraints on journalism. The Government
 regards Conviction as illegal because it is not properly
 registered and is the organ of a political party, Sylvio
 Claude's Haitian Christian Democratic Party, which is also
 considered illegal.
 There are generally no restraints on the sale or distribution
 of Haitian publications, but foreign publications are reviewed
 by the Government upon arrival and those deemed offensive are
 confiscated. Dailies depend heavily on Agence France Presse
 for international and even local news; articles with Haitian
 themes often are tailored to fit local sensitivities.
 Publications openly hostile to the Government, such as those
 of U.S.-based exile groups, are barred from the country.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although the Constitution grants Haitians the right to
 assemble peaceably and to form unions, political parties, and
 cooperatives, all formal associations and public assemblies of
 more than 20 persons must have government authorization.
 Professional, cultural, religious, trade, and smaller
 nonpolitical groups, however, generally operate unhindered and
 associations are usually free to affiliate with overseas
 groups.
 In 1985, there were two attempts, one successful and the other
 not, to organize independent mass rallies in Port au Prince.
 Nearly 80,000 youths marched in February under the auspices of
 the Catholic Church, ostensibly to commemorate International
 
 
 577
 HAITI
 Youth Year. Because of persisting church-state tensions,
 however, some government officials viewed the march as a
 provocation. The Government proscribed a second attempted
 youth march, proposed in June for the purpose of protesting
 Haiti's economic and political systems. Widely believed to
 have been instigated by leading oppositionist figure Hubert
 DeRonceray, this march was banned on the grounds that it would
 have unconstitutionally opposed the presidency-for-life and
 been a threat to public order. On November 28 street
 demonstrations in the town of Gonaives were marked by violence
 as police fired on demonstrators. At least 4 persons were
 killed and 14 wounded in this disturbance. On December 17 the
 Government announced that persons implicated by the Commission
 of Inquiry in these deaths had been detained for further
 judicial proceedings.
 In September, DeRonceray and five associates were detained for
 several hours; the Government accused them of attempting to
 stage a provincial rally without the permit required by law
 for any public assembly of more than 20 persons. The
 Government also claimed that DeRonceray was acting outside the
 limits of the political parties law. For similar reasons
 DeRonceray and three others were prevented from visiting the
 Jacmel area on September 29. On the evening of December 4
 Hubert Deronceray was arrested by police officials allegedly
 for possession of subversive documents found in a search of
 his home and office. He was released a month later without
 ever being formally charged or brought before a judge.
 The Government amended the labor code in 1984 to facilitate
 the formation of unions by employees, to protect the rights of
 Haitian workers abroad, and to prohibit forced labor. Haitian
 workers have the legal right to strike. The labor code allows
 Haitian labor unions to engage in collective bargaining. In
 practice union demands have usually been subject to
 compulsorary arbitration under the Ministry of Social Affairs.
 Haiti's nascent trade union movement continued to grow in size
 and stature in 1985. In his May Day address, President
 Duvalier reaffirmed the legality of the Federation of Union
 Workers (founded in 1984) and stressed the "potential of these
 unions" to improve living conditions for the workinq class.
 Also in May, the 300-member Central Sugar Cane Union of Les
 Cayes became the tenth union to join the Federation, raising
 the total membership to 2,800. This gave the Federation its
 first affiliate outside the Port au Prince area and extended
 representation to workers who have historically labored under
 very poor conditions.
 The president of the Federation, Joseph Senat, has worked hard
 to seek international respectability for his organization. He
 represented Haitian workers at the June conference of the
 International Labor Organization in Geneva He later met with
 officials of the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions (ICFTU) and with AFL-CIO officials to discuss
 assistance to the Federation. In March, a delegation of the
 ICFTU's regional organization, the Inter-American Regional
 Organization of Workers, visited Haiti to assess the local
 labor situation. In 1985, four federation members received
 labor training in the United States.
 
 
 578
 HAITI
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Roman Catholicism is the official religion of Haiti and is
 embraced to varying degrees by about 80 percent of the
 population. Voodoo, a religion combining Christian and
 African animist elements, is also practiced by a majority of
 Haitians. All other religions are freely practiced by their
 adherents, including Bahaism, Judaism, and numerous Protestant
 sects. The Government generally does not interfere with
 proselytizing, missionary activities, sects which affiliate
 with overseas coreligionists, religious instruction, or
 publishing.
 For many years now, the Catholic Church and the Government
 have competed in several areas, notably in the provision of
 such social services as education. Because of the church's
 independent influence, the state has traditionally been
 suspicious of the church and its foreign connections. The
 quality of church-state relations fluctuated in 1985, and they
 were troubled by five events: February's church-sponsored
 march in Port au Prince; an April incident in which a VSN
 member shot at a priest in the Port au Prince archbishopric;
 the July expulsion of the three Belgian priests; the December
 closing of Radio Soleil; and the death of Father DeSmett. The
 relationship reached a nadir when the church, to protest the
 expulsions, refused to participate in the VSN state
 ceremonies. The Government responded with a harsh week-long,
 antichurch campaign in the official media. The church
 continues to complain of government interference in clerical
 matters (such as the assignments of priests).
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government does not normally restrict domestic travel of
 citizens or foreigners. A sparse network of military
 checkpoints operates irregularly across the country, and
 foreigners and interurban transports are required to register
 with them before entering some towns. There are no
 restrictions on persons changing their residence or place of
 work. A few political activists have in the past been placed
 under police arrest and some must still inform the police each
 time they plan to leave Port au Prince.
 Haitians are legally required to purchase passports and exit
 visas before leaving the country. The exit and reentry visas
 are a tax used to raise revenue, and travel documents normally
 are not issued or denied based on political considerations.
 Expatriates are free to return to Haiti and many regularly do
 so. The Government encourages skilled Haitian emigrants to
 return to Haiti. Immigration officials at Port au Prince
 maintain and use a list of persons to be prevented from
 leaving or entering the country because of criminal, security,
 or political reasons.    On occasion, the Government
 confiscates the passports of political activists such as
 Sylvio Claude who, until he had his restored in September, was
 effectively barred from traveling abroad.
 An increasing number of Haitians are attempting to leave Haiti
 because of the country's poor economy; Their primary
 destination is the United States. Pursuant to the 1981
 U.S.-Haitian bilateral agreement on interdiction of
 undocumented migrants, 2,163 "boat people" were repatriated by
 the U.S. Coast Guard in 1985 (more than one-third of the total
 
 
 579
 HAITI
 since the accord was signed). In addition to serving as an
 effective obstacle to illegal migration from Haiti, the Coast
 Guard rescues hundreds of Haitians each year from unseaworthy,
 distressed vessels.
 Follow-up trips to the Haitian countryside by the
 Creole-speaking returnee officer of the U.S. Embassy continue
 to demonstrate that the migrants' incentive is primarily
 economic, and that the Government is honoring its commitment
 not to harass or persecute Haitians who have illegally left
 the country and then been returned. In the first 9 months of
 1985, 582 returnees were interviewed and no one alleged
 persecution or intimidation by the Haitian government.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Haiti is ruled by President-for-Life Jean-Claude Duvalier. He
 is assisted by a small group of advisors, but by law and
 custom he exercises absolute power. The Constitution grants
 the President-for-Life the right to name his Cabinet and all
 important government officials and to designate his
 successor. When the National Assembly is not in session, he
 may rule by decree. When in session, the Assembly follows the
 lead of the President, as it did during June 6-9 when, with
 almost no debate, it unanimously approved his proposed 31
 constitutional amendments and the political parties law. This
 legislation provided for regulating the functioning of
 political parties and creating a prime minister to be
 appointed by the President from the party winning the most
 Assembly seats in the next elections. The amendments also
 strengthened significantly the powers of the President in some
 areas, and slightly expanded the legislative prerogative of
 the Assembly. Elections for the Assembly were advanced from
 February 1990 to February 1987. The political parties law,
 Haiti's first, specified the conditions a party must fulfill
 to be registered and function legally. Key provisions require
 that parties accept the primacy of the president-for-life and
 submit to the Government the names and addresses of supporters
 whose numbers must constitute at least 0.3 percent of Haiti's
 population (approximately 18,000).
 The Government contends that the presidency-for-life provides
 Haiti with invaluable stability and is therefore
 non-negotiable. It further argues that the registration
 requirements are modeled on foreign laws and are reasonable,
 given claims by opposition leaders that they have extensive
 popular followings.
 There was widespread disappointment with the limited nature of
 the political changes. Opposition politicians immediately
 rejected any participation within the new framework. Critics
 focused on the handpicked nature of the prime minister, as
 well as the amendments strengthening the president's powers,
 the reaffirmation in the amendments and the legislation of the
 presidency-for-life, and the large number of affirmative
 declarations of party membership required by the political
 parties law. In the aggregate, the opposition argued, these
 provisions undercut any real democratization and in fact
 strengthen the power of the presidency. Oppositionists
 further dismissed the requirement for affirmative declarations
 of membership as unrealistic given Haiti's troubled political
 history. They insisted that radical changes, particularly the
 
 
 580
 HAITI
 elimination of the presidency-for-life, are necessary before
 they can consider participating in the new system.
 Faced with opposition and foreign rejection of the
 constitutional amendments and political parties law, the
 Government held a referendum to obtain popular backing for the
 measures on July 22 and claimed that 99.98 percent of a 90
 percent turnout voted in favor of the new law and amendments.
 However, the ballot did not offer a negative option, the
 mechanics of the poll compromised the secrecy of the vote, and
 observers confirmed that far less than 90 percent of the
 electorate actually voted in the referendum. Opposition
 leaders had called for abstention. The refusal of the
 Government to engage the opposition in a dialogue on the
 substance and execution of the referendum, not to mention the
 flawed manner in which it was conducted, revealed a broad lack
 of appreciation of democratic principles within the Government
 and was judged by international observers to be a setback for
 the President's promised political opening.
 Shortly after the referendum, several delegates of the
 National Assembly and many senior government officials
 announced the formation of a progovernment political party,
 the National Progressive Party. In November, Gregoire Eugene
 announced that he would begin the process of registering his
 previously inactive Social Christian Party of Haiti. Eugene
 is an independent lawyer who returned to Haiti in 1984 after 4
 years of exile in the United States.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 An important difference between the regimes of Francois
 Duvalier and Jean-Claude Duvalier is the latter's regard for
 international opinion. Visits by international human rights
 organizations to Haitian prisons have been accepted. In early
 1985, representatives of the International Committee of the
 Red Cross and the Paris-based International Federation of
 Human Rights met with a total of 19 political detainees at the
 Casernes Dessalines military prison, and at the national
 penitentiary. In June, a delegation of the Lawyers' Committee
 for International Human Rights met with members of the
 government human rights commission, judges and officials from
 the Ministry of Justice, private sector activists, and the
 Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Another group of
 American human rights activists was received in August by the
 Foreign Minister and many others.
 Two human rights organizations exist in Haiti. The first is
 the government-sponsored National Human Rights Commission
 created in 1982. This nine-member commission investigates
 citizens' complaints of government abuses, but it has only
 advisory powers and does not involve itself in "political"
 cases. The Haitian Human Rights League, founded in 1979, is
 affiliated with the International Federation of the Rights of
 Man. While articles by its president, local attorney and
 educator Gerard Gourgue, occasionally appear in the local
 press, the League itself is only minimally active. In late
 1985, Gourgue served several times as an intermediary between
 the Government and opposition figures, securing in September
 the release of two detainees and the return of the confiscated
 passports of three oppositionists.
 
 
 581
 HAITI
 The April 1985 release of a special Amnesty International
 report on Haiti caused widespread, indignant comment in Haiti,
 including by some anti-Duvalierists who agreed with government
 supporters that the report contained serious inaccuracies and
 failed to recognize the human rights improvements registered
 under Jean-Claude Duvalier.
 The chapter on Haiti in the Amnesty International Report 1985,
 covering events during 1984, expressed continued concern about
 the incarceration and mistreatment of prisoners of
 conscience. Freedom House rated Haiti as "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Haiti's population, growing by 1.9 percent annually, is
 estimated at 5.7 million, with over 1 million in the Port au
 Prince area. Haiti is the poorest nation in the Western
 Hemisphere with an estimated 1983 per capita income of about
 $300, although in rural areas it is considerably less.
 The economy is basically unregulated, but single companies
 (parastatal and private) control the distribution or
 production of many basic commodities. A small elite and a
 growing middle class in Port au Prince control most of the
 wealth in the country. Approximately 80 percent of the rural
 and half of the urban population subsist in dire poverty,
 which has provoked massive emigration, particularly during the
 last decade. Foreign remittances, estimated at up to $100
 million per year, are a crucial element of survival for many
 extended Haitian families.
 Haiti suffers from a dearth of natural resources and a
 topography which is 80 percent mountainous. In addition,
 erosion of the topsoil resulting from the destruction of
 forest cover on the hillsides, combined with frequent droughts
 and floods, have greatly lowered agricultural production and
 income for peasants. Coffee, essential oils, and more
 recently mangoes have been the primary agricultural exports.
 Most farming is on small plots owned by peasant families and
 subdivided for generations through inheritance. Consequently,
 agriculture is fundamentally inefficient. The entire output
 of goods and services grew by about 1.7 percent in 1985 while
 the rate of inflation exceeded 8 percent.
 The most dynamic sector of the economy is the assembly
 industry, which has created over 60,000 jobs in the past 15
 years. This has resulted from favorable government investment
 policies, high labor productivity, and a low minimum daily
 wage. The U.S. economy receives over 90 percent of the output
 from the assembly industry, which profits from duty free
 privileges for many of its products under the Caribbean Basin
 Initiative (CBI). Although vulnerable to international market
 trends, the assembly industry is expected to continue to
 grow. Employment generation in this sector has only
 marginally reduced Haiti's extremely high unemployment rate.
 Based on surveys, the International Monetary Fund estimates
 that the "effective" unemployment rate (which factors in
 underemployment) is 48 percent.
 The future of Haiti's small, open, and impoverished economy
 depands upon how it exploits its export potential.
 Restrictive trade practices are key constraints to industrial
 and agricultural export expansion. Import-substitution
 industries are protected by import licensing requirements and

 quotas, government import monopolies, and a highly
 differential tariff structure. This protection system
 distorts the structure of domestic prices relative to that of
 the world market, making local production uncompetitive. It
 also reduces the living standards of Haitian consumers, who
 must purchase some products at a price 20 to 50 percent higher
 than they would be in an open and competitive economy.
 The Government provides limited support to agricultural
 cooperatives designed to improve productivity and access for
 farmers to markets at home and abroad. The fiscal year 1986
 budget reflected the government's position that the country's
 development priorities are education and agriculture. Food
 imports are essential; however, many imports are sold at
 prices above the free market level because of high duties.
 According to 1982 figures, Haitians, on average, receive only
 85 percent of their daily caloric requirements and more than
 60 percent of children under age 5 suffered some degree of
 malnutrition--nearly 10 percent of the cases were
 characterized as serious. An estimated 88 percent of the
 population (100 percent in rural areas) did not have access to
 potable water in 1980. The infant mortality rate stood at
 106.90 in 1985, and life expectancy at birth was 54 years.
 The adult literacy rate was 20 percent, and the primary school
 enrollment ratio was 77 percent, according to World Bank
 statistics for 1981.
 The labor code provides for a daily minimum wage adjustable
 when the official annual inflation index exceeds ten percent.
 Presently, the minimum wage is $3.00 per day in Port au Prince
 and $2.64 elsewhere. The Ministry of Social Affairs employs
 approximately 15 inspectors responsible for overseeing
 legislation mandating safe, healthy working conditions. The
 minimum age for even limited employment is 12. Fierce adult
 competition for factory jobs ensures that child labor is not a
 factor in this sector. Many children, especially young
 teenagers, work long hours in cottage industries for less than
 the minimum wage.
 Haitian society consists of at least four broad groups. The
 extremely poor peasantry is numerically largest, but the urban
 poor, because they have a higher cost of living than the
 peasants, may be even more deprived than the peasants. The
 urban poor constitute at least 50 percent of city dwellers and
 perhaps 15 percent of the national population. Both of these
 groups are overwhelmingly black. Above them on the economic
 scale is a small but steadily expanding middle class, and at
 the top is an elite, about I percent of Haiti's population.
 The elite comprise businessmen (largely mulato) and top
 government officials (mostly black). Conflicts and distrust
 among these Haitian social groups have produced a weak
 tradition of public service. Mass education, for example, has
 at times been resisted actively by members of the elite as
 socially destabilizing. The same attitude has retarded
 agricultural and infrastructural development, health care, and
 openness to the outside world. More recently, however, the
 level of government cooperation with international donors and
 financial institutions has improved.
 The role of women in Haitian society is limited by tradition.
 Since 1982, there has been no legal discrimination between the
 two sexes; women enjoy full rights to education, property, and
 such social prerogatives as divorce. Particularly among the
 peasantty, however, women are still confined to the
 
 
 583
 HAITI
 traditional occupations of marketing, sewing, and
 housekeeping. Middle-class women often work out of economic
 necessity. They comprise a large part of the assembly
 workforce and dominate secretarial, teaching, and nursing
 positions. Few, however, rise to prominent positions in the
 private sector, even in the cultural and educational areas.
 Greater opportunities are generally available to women in the
 government bureaucracy. There have been a few women
 Secretaries of State in the last several years (there are two
 at present), and women are well-represented at the mid- and
 upper-level managerial ranks. Women may serve in the armed
 forces only as nurses.
