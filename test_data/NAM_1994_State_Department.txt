 NAMIBIA
 Namibia is a multiparty, multiracial democracy headed by President Sam
 Nujoma, leader of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), which
 
 
 178
 won N amibia's first free elections in November 1989 and the National Assembly and
 presidential elections in December 1994. President Nujoma and the SWAPO party
 received just over 70 .percent of the vote in the December 1994 presidential and Na-
 tional Assembly elections, which were generally regarded as free and fair.
 The Namibian police supervised by the Ministry of Home Affairs, and the Na-
 mibian Defense Force (qDF), supervised by the Ministr. of Defense, share respon-
 sibilities for internal security.  F soldiers reportedly killed two civilians along the
 country's border with Angola, and police members were accused of human rights
 abuses against civilians, including beatings of detainees. The authorities punished
 some police officers or charged them in court for committing such abuses.
 Namibia's modern market sector produces most of its wealth while a traditional
 subsistence agricultural sector (mainly in the north) supports most of its labor force.
 Mining, ranching, and fishing, the mainstays of the market sector, are still largely
 controlled by white Namibians and foreign interests. However, government policy is
 to "Namibianize the increasingly important fishing sector, so that more indigenous
 entrepreneurs are able to participate. In September the Government introduced leg-
 islation to redistribute underutilized, privately owned farmland, with owners to be
 compensated at fair market value.
 Namibians enjoy a wide range of cns titutionally provided civil, political, and eco-
 nomic liberties. Nevereess, there continued to be credible reports that police tor-
 tured or otherwise abused criminal suspects. SWAPO continued to delay providing
 a complete accounting for missing detainees held during the preindependence pe-
 riod. The    Government    refused  initially  in  August   to  permit   former
 counterinsurgency fighters to return to Namibia, but it abided by a subsequent High
 Court ruling that Namibian citizens had the constitutional right to return to their
 homeland. Inherited problems of racial discrimination and disparities-especially in
 education, health, employment, and working conditions--continued in 1994, despite
 sustained efforts b7 the Government to reduce them.
 Although the Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race and jgender,
 women continued in practice to experience serious legal and cultural discrimination.
 Women also experienced widespread societal violence.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated or other extrajudicial killings during 1994. However, there were credible
 reports that NDF soldiers killed two unarmed civilians in late 1994 along the river
 boundary between northern Namibia and southeastern Angola. Reportedly, NDF
 members shot the two while they were attempting to evade capture, as officially au-
 thorized by their commanders. The NDF actions may have been in response to an
 October campaign speech. At year's end, the Government had not taken any discipli-
 nary action against the soldiers responsible for the shootings.
 While several cases of preindependence political killings remained unsolved, in
 June, following lengthy inquest proceedings, the High Court determined that
 SWAPO activist Anton Lubowski, assassinated in 1989, had in all likelihood been
 killed by Irish citizen Donald Acheson at the behest of the former South African
 Civil Cooperation Bureau (CCB). The Government expressed its intention to put
 Acheson and his accomplices on trial for the murder but extradition proceedings
 had not been initiated by year's end. The Court also determined that high-ranking
 officials of the preindependence police and military forces, accused in 1993 by a local
 newspaper of planning Lubwksi's killing, had not been involved in the act.
 b. Disappearance.-here were no reports of disappearances in 1994. Neverthe-
 less, the public and political parties again focused on the unexplained disappear-
 ances of persons detained by   A     prior to independence. The number of SWAPO
 detainees still unaccounted for range between 154 and 256. In April senior SWAPO
 officials prmised a complete accounting before the end of the year of everyone who
 had died or disappeared during the liberation struggle, but it had not done so by
 year's end. This issue will likely remain controversial until the Government con-
 ducts and releases the results of a full investigation.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution states that "no persons shall be subject to torture or to cruel, inhu-
 man, or degrading treatment or punishment." There were credible allegations, how-
 ever, that members of the police beat or otherwise abused civilians, primarily during
 arrest and initial interrogation. For example, in one case in 1994, an NDF soldier
 sued the Government for his unlawful arrest by four police officers in October 1993.
 He was reportedly kicked and punched repeatedly by police at the Katutura police
 station before being released without charge. His case was pending trial at year's
 
 
 179
 end. The authorities suspended at least four police officers from the police force for
 beating prisoners in the Oshakati police cells. At year's end their cases had not yet
 been prosecuted in court.
 In connection with past offenses, in July the Windhoek magistrate's court ruled
 in favor of a person who charged that a joint police/NDF patrol had falsely arrested,
 beaten, threatened, and interrogated him in early 1993, based on his former status
 as a SWAPO detainee. At year's end, he was pursuing in the High Court a civil
 damages suit against the police and NDF members involved in the incident. Court
 proceedings also continued aainst three NDF members who carried out the June
 1993 unprovoked assault and beating of a farming couple near the town of Outjo.
 In the meantime, the three accused were initially dishonorably discharged from the
 military but were subsequently reinstated.
 Prison conditions are harsh but do not generally threaten the life or health of
 prisoners. During the year, the National Society for Human Rights charged that po-
 lice and prison cells were overcrowded and that food was inadequate, particularly
 in Windhoek and Oshakati. Despite admitting its resource constraints in addressing
 this problem, the Government did take an important step in ending the practice of
 holding youthful offenders in the same cells as adult criminals. It also stepped up
 the training of police and prison officials and continued to grant legal counsel, local
 nongovernmental organizations (NGO's), and diplomatic officials regular access to
 prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution forbids arbitrary arrest
 or detention, and the Government has generally respected these provisions in prac-
 tice. According to the Constitution, persons who are arrested must be informed of
 the reason for their arrest, and they must be brought before a magistrate within
 48 hours of their detention. A trial must take place within "a reasonable time," or
 the accused must be released. The accused are entitled to defense by a legal counsel
 of their choice; the State provides counsel for the indigent.
 Some traditional leaders reportedly continued to detain and imprison persons ac-
 cused of minor offenses without recourse to police or judicial review. The Govern-
 ment repeatedly condemned these actions and called upon the public to report such
 practices to the authorities. It also began training traditional leaders on the legal
 limits to their powers.
 As far as known, the Government held no political detainees or prisoners at year's
 end. The Government does not use exile for political purposes, but it temporarily
 blocked the return of former members of the preindependence counterinsurgency
 group, 'Koevoet," who were in self-exile in South Africa (see Section 2.d.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The constitutional right to a fair trial, with apre-
 sumption of innocence until proven guilty, is generally afforded by an independent
 judiciary. However, problems in the traditional system and the long delays in hear-
 ing some cases in the regular courts limit this right in practice. The formal system
 consists of three levels: magistrate's court, the High Court, and the Supreme  ourt.
 The latter also serves as the court of appeals and as a constitutional review court.
 Most rural Namibians first encounter the legal system through the traditional
 courts which deal with minor criminal offenses, such as petty theft and infractions
 of local customs, among members of the same ethnic group. A special commission,
 created to make recommendations on the prospective jurisdiction of traditional
 courts, concluded in 1993 that traditional cultural practices and structures should
 be maintained, provided they were consistent with constitutional protections and ex-
 isting laws. The Government had not yet presented its draft enabling legislation to
 Parliament at year's end.
 The lack of qualified magistrates and other court officials has resulted in a serious
 backlog of criminal cases. There is also a shortage of attorneys; there were only 100
 lawyers engaged in private practice in Namibia in 1994. As a result, as of August
 31, the Government had a backlog of over 2,000 cases, which in some instances
 translated into a 6-month delay between arrest and trial. To address these prob-
 lems, the Government, together with the University of Namibia, provided in-service
 legal training to magistrates and other court officials at the University's Training
 Center.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution grants all citizens the right to privacy and requires arresting officers
 to secure a judicial warrant for certain listed offenses before conducting a search.
 These rights were respected in practice.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for these freedoms,
 including academic freedom, and the Government respected them in practice.
 
 
 180
 The government-owned Nanibian Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) operates most
 radio and television services. Although the NBC routinely gave prominent coverage
 to the activities of government officials, it also provided significant coverage to the
 opposition and viewpoints critical of the Government. There are two private radio
 stations. A variety of privately owned newspapers operate without government re-
 striction and no apparent self-censorship.
 b. Freedom of Peacefd Assembly     Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association. Police or municipal permits are required for
 large, publicized public gatherings but are granted routinely. During 1994 various
 organizations, incuding political parties and religious groups, held large meetings
 and public gatherings without interference.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-There is no state religion, and the Government does not
 restrict the exercise of religious freedom.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides citizens the rights to travel freely, both do.
 mestically and abroad, to reside and settle in any part of the country, and to repa-
 triate. In practice, the Government respected these freedoms. However, in one con-
 troversial incident in early August, the Government denied entry to a group of Na-
 mibian former counterinsurgency fighters and dependents, who attempted to return
 home from South Africa, because of their preindependence military activities as
 members of the notorious Koevoet counterinsurgency unit, organized by the South
 African army, which many believe committed egregious human rights abuses. Two
 weeks later, the High Court ruled that the Government had acted illegally and un-
 constitutionally in refusing them the right to return to Namibia. The Government
 honored the Court's decision    and   allowed  the gup, plus other former
 counterinsurgency members who could document their N    ibian citizenship, to re-
 turn home.
 Local NGO's and opposition political parties continued to criticize the Government
 for its alleged lack of a consistent refugee or asylum policy. At midyear, the Govern-
 ment acceded to several U.N. conventions on refugees. Although it expressed initial
 reservations over Article 26 of the 1951 U.N. Convention (concerning freedom of
 movement and residence) the Cabinet subsequently ruled that skilled, recognized
 refugees would be allowed to work or study on a case-by-case basis, and this policy
 was in effect as the year ended. It was unclear, however, whether this policy would
 have any impact on the numbers of refugees allowed outside the camps. Some 90
 percent of the approximately 1,500 recognized refugees in Namibia are Angolans.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercised this constitutional right for the second time in free and fair
 presidential and parliamentary elections in 1994. The Constitution established a bi-
 cameral Parliament and provides for general elections every 5 years and regional
 elections every 6 years. Incumbent President Nujoma was reelected to a second 5-
 year term of office during the country's first postindependence elections for the Na-
 tional Assembly and the President in December 1994. The ruling SWAPO party won
 53 of the 72 elected National Assembly seats, the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance
 (DTA, the major opposition party) secured 15 seats, and the three smaller parties
 obtained a total of 4 seats.
 Women are increasingly involved in Namibia's political process but are seriously
 under represented. During 1994 women held three positions at the Cabinet or
 subeabinet level and seven seats in the two houses of Parliament. An additional
 three women were elected to the National Assembly as a result of the December
 elections. Historic economic and educational disadvantages have served to limit the
 participation of the indigenous San ethnic group in politics. For example, the only
 San member of the current National Assem ly has been unable to participate effec-
 tively because he cannot read or write in English and could not obtain a reliable
 San-English interpreter.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local organizations, such as the National Society for Human Rights and the Legal
 Assistance Centre, operated freely, criticizing the Government's handling of the
 SWAPO detainee issue, the treatment of refugees, misconduct by members of the
 police, and other matters.
 International human rights organizations traveled to Namibia and discussed
 human rights issues with governmental and nongovernmental representatives. The
 Government also invited international observers to witness its December elections.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, creed, gender, or religion,
 and specifically prohibits "the practice and ideology of apartheid."
 Worr.n.-Despite constitutional protections, women faced persistent discrimina-
 tion in both formal and customary law and most importantly, in deep-rooted soci-
 etal practices by all ethnic groups. A nuier of unfair preindependence statutes
 continued to discriminate against women in such areas as property, business, and
 employment. For example, a woman may not open a bank account without the ap-
 proval of her husband or other close male relative. Also, under existing community
 property laws, married women of all groups are defined as legal minors and need
 the written consent of their husbands before they may legally acquire or purchase
 property. Traditional practices als permit family members to confiscate the prop-
 err. of deceased men from their wicows and children, particularly in northern Na-
 mibia.
 The Government, prodded by women's groups, began to address these inequalities,
 and in October the Government announced its intention to introduce in Parliament
 in early 1995 a "married persons equality bill" aimed at removing provisions of law
 that discriminate against married women, but not single women.
 Violence against women remained widespread, most commonly in the form of
 beatings and rape. Because of traditional attitudes regarding the subordination of
 women, many incidents of abuse are never reported to the authorities. However in
 those few grave abuse cases where legal action has been initiated, the courts oiten
 sentenced male offenders, including spouses, to long terms of imprisonment. The
 courts sentenced convicted rapists to prison terms aver.ng 6 to 9 years. During
 the year the Namibian plice opened new "women and child abuse centres" in the
 towns o? Oshakati and Keetmanshoop, with specially trained female officers to as-
 sist victims of sexual assaults. The first facility of this kind was opened in
 Windhoek in mid-1993.
 Children.-Children's rights, including those of protection from economic exploi-
 tation and from work that is hazardous or harmful to their health, education, men-
 tal, spiritual, moral, or social development, are enumerated in the Constitution. In
 practice, the Government has been able to commit only limited resources to the pro-
 tection of children's welfare. Child abuse is a serious problem. The authorities vigor-
 ousy prosecuted cases involving crimes against children, particularly rape and in-
 cest, and encouraged discussion and the issuance of printed materials in the schools.
 Women and child abuse centers (see above) also worked to reduce the trauma suf-
 fered by abused children and provided training to police officials on handling this
 problem.
 Indigenous People.-The San people, Namibia's earliest known inhabitants, his-
 torically have been exploited by other ethnic groups. The Government has taken a
 number of measures to end this societal discrimination against the San, including
 seeking their advice about proposed legislation on communally held lands and in-
 creasing their access to primary education. By law, all indigenous groups in Na-
 mibia are able to participate equally in decisions affecting their lands, cultures, tra-
 ditions, and allocations of natural resources. Nevertheless, the San and many other
 indigenous Namibians have been unable to exercise fully these rights as a result
 of historically minimal access to education and economic opportunities under colo-
 nial rule, coupled with their relative isolation in remote areas of the country.
 NationallRacial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Constitution prohibits discrimination
 based on race and other factors and specifically prohibits "the practice and ideology
 of apartheid." Nevertheless, as a result of more than 70 years of South African ad-
 ministration, societal, racial, and ethnic discrimination persists, and some apart-
 heid-based statutes have not been repealed or replaced by the Parliament. Many
 nonwhites continued to complain that the Government was not moving quickly
 enough to lessen the continuing and serious inequalities in education, health, hous-
 i   employment, and access toland.
 Also, some opposition parties including members of the Herero and Nama ethnic
 groups, claimed that the SWAO-led Government provided more development as-
 sistsnce to the numerically dominant Ovambo ethnic group of far northern Namibia
 than to other groups or regions of the country. The application by the "Baster" com-
 munity for the Government to return its traditional land in the Rehoboth area was
 still being considered by the courts as the year ended.
 People -With Disabiities.-There were no reports of official discrimination on the
 basis of disability, and the Government continued its efforts to provide the disabled
 with appropriate treatment and education. The Government does not legally require
 special access to public buildings for the disabled. However, some municipal govern-
 ments have instlled ramps and special curbing at street crossings for the disabled.

 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for freedom of association,
 including the right to form and join trade unions. The 1992 Labor Act extended that
 right to public servants, farm workers, and domestic employees. Trade unions have
 no difficulty registering, and there are no government restrictions on who serves as
 a union official. No union has been dissolved by government action.
 Unions are independent of government and may form federations and confed-
 erations. The two principal trade union umbrella organizations are the National
 Union of Namibian Workers (NUNW), and the Nanibia People's Social Movement
 (NPSM). Roughly half of the wage sector is organized to some degree, although less
 than 20 percent of full-time wage earners are organized.
 Except for those providing essential services (e.g., jobs related to public health
 and safety), workers enjoy the right to strike once conciliation procedures have been
 exhaisted. Under the Labor Act, strike action may be used only in disputes involv-
 ing worker interests, such as pay raises. Disputes over worker rights, including dis-
 missals, must be referred to a labor court (which is convened on an ad hoc basis
 in the existing magisterial districts) for arbitration. The Labor Act protects legally
 striking workers from unfair dismissal.
 Trade unions are free to exchange visits with foreign trade unions and to affiliate
 with international trade union organizations. The unions have exercised this free-
 "dom without interference. The American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial
 Organization, through its African-American Labor Center representative based in
 South Africa, provided technical assistance to the NUNW during regular visits to
 Namibia in 1994.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The 1992 Labor Act provides
 employees the right to bargain individually or collectively. Collective bargaining is
 not widely practiced outside the mining and construction industries; wages are usu-
 ally set by employers. As unions become more active, however, informal collective
 bargaining is becoming more common.
 The Labor Act provides a process for employer recognition of trade unions and
 protection f or mers and organizers. The raw also empowers a labor court to rem-
 edy unfair labor practices and explicitly forbids unfair dismissals, which may also
 be appealed to the labor court.
 At present, the Labor Act also applies in the only existing export processing zone
 (EPZ), located at the town of Arandis. News reports that the Ministry of Trade and
 Industry might exem t an EPZ in Walvis Bay from the provisions of the Labor Act
 prompted the         to come out strongly in opposition to any area of Namibia
 ieng declared "union free." Draft EPZ legislation was presented to the Parliament
 in late 1994 but had not been debated or enacted as theyear ended.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is prohibited by law.
 Although there were no formal complaints filed with the Ministry of Labor in 1994,
 there were cntining reports that farm workers sometimes receive inadequate com-
 pensation for their labor and are subject to strict control by farm owners. Ministry
 of Labor inspectors sometimes encountered problems in gaining access to Namibia's
 expansive, privately owned commercial farms in order to document possible Labor
 Code violatons.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Chidren.-Undr the 1992 Labor Act, the
 minimum age for employment is 4 years, with higher age .reiurementa for certain
 sectors SUCh as mmg and construction and night wor. Mimsry of bor inspec-
 tors generally enforce minimum age regulations, but children blow the age of 14
 often work on family and commercial farms and in the informal sector. Boys in the
 rural areas traditionally start herding livestock at age 7.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There in no statutory minimum wage law. In
 Windhek's nonwhite town ships, many workers and their families have difficulty
 maintaining a minimally decent standard of living. White Naiibians earn signifi-
 cantly more on average than their black compatriots, in large part because whites
 own most of the country's productive resources and had preferential access to edu-
 cation that enabled them to take advantage of the skilled Labor shortage.  4
 After independence, the standard legal workweek was reduced from 4    o4
 hours, and includes at least one 24-hour rest period per week. An employer may re-
 uire no mere than 10 hours per week of overtime. The law mandates 24 consecu-
 tive days of annual leave, at least 30 workdays of sick leave per year, and 3 months
 of unpaid maternity leave. In practice, however, these provisions are not yet rigor-
 ously observed or enforced by the Ministry of Layor.
 Government-mandated occupational health and safety standards are set by law.
 The Labor Act empowers the President to enforce them through inspections and
 criminal penalties. The Government carried out a national survey of health and
 safety standards but had not released any report or upgraded standards by year's
 
 
 183
 end. The law requires employers to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of their
 employees and provides for their right to remove themselves from dangerous work
 situations.
