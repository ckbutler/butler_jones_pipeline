 CONGO
 The Congo became Africa's first avowed "People's
 Republic" in 1969. As such it is officially a one-
 party state of Marxist-Leninist political orientation.
 The Congolese Labor Party is the sole political
 party allowed by the Constitution. Most power is
 concentrated in the party and its leaders. Many high
 party and government officials, including the president,
 are military officers. The country also has national,
 regional, and local assemblies, elected from single
 party-approved lists. Public policy issues are
 often debated by the assemblies at the local and
 regional levels before decisions are made at the
 national level.
 The People's Republic of the Congo has a mixed economic
 system--state and private. Officially socialist, the
 state has nevertheless allowed a major part of its eco-
 nomy to remain in private hands. The state also
 encourages private investment in an effort to improve
 economic conditions. At 50 to 80 percent, the Congo
 has one of the highest literacy rates in the Third
 World. Its per capita Gross National Product (GNP) of
 roughly $730 makes it a middle-income developing country.
 From independence in 1960 to 1977, the country experienced
 repeated periods of political instability often related to
 regional and ethnic animosities which worsened human rights
 conditions.
 According to the Government, only two political prisoners
 are under detention, one of whom is former President
 Joachim Yhomby-Opango. According to Amnesty International,
 30 Angolan refugees and 34 Cabindans were being held with-
 out charges or trial in 1981.
 The country's assemblies at various levels do not make
 policy but did meet regularly in 1982 and act as
 sounding boards for popular opinion on a broad range
 of economic issues. The 120-member National Assembly
 debates political, social, and economic issues and
 questions ministers during its two sessions, particularly
 in regard to economic and budgetary matters. The
 country's first five-year plan entered into effect in
 January 1982. Rural agricultural development continues
 to be a priority of the Government.
 The most serious incidents affecting human rights in
 the Congo during 1982 were two terrorist bombings
 which killed innocent people in Brazzaville. The
 origin of the bombings has not been determined. The
 Congolese Government tightened security measures in
 response, and freedom of movement was somewhat restrict-
 ed. Security checkpoints and vehicle searches became
 common in many areas in Brazzaville. It is not known
 how many arrests may have been made in connection
 with the bombings.
 
 
 77
 Otherwise the general trend of recent years toward
 increasing observance of human rights and freedoms
 continued in the Congo. Notably, by the end of 1982
 the Congolese had drafted and begun discussion of a
 new family code to correct injustices affecting family
 members (see section 4). The Congo also ratified the
 African Human Rights Charter during the year and sent
 a delegate to the Human Rights Conference sponsored by
 the government of Toqo and UNESCO in Lome. Constraints
 on certain individual liberties, however, continued
 under the Congo's present political system.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 Bombings of unknown origin in March and July 1982
 caused the deaths of approximately a dozen innocent
 people in Brazzaville in a movie theater and at the
 airport. Many others were injured. A telephone call
 to Agence France Presse in Paris attributed the thea-
 ter bombing to "The Congolese Armed Patriotic Group,"
 presumably a creation of Congolese exiles. No group
 in the Congo, however, has claimed responsibility.
 The Congo does not have a history of violent acts of
 this nature, and President Sassou-Nguesso has denounced
 these incidents publicly in strong terms.
 b. Disappearance
 There is no evidence of persons being abducted,
 secretly arrested, or held in clandestine detention
 in the Congo.
 c. Torture
 The Constitution guarantees the inviolability of the
 person and makes *the state responsible for the respect
 and protection of the individual. There have been
 rumors of harsh questioning of persons arrested and
 detained in connection with the bombings, cited above,
 but they have not been substantiated.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 It is not uncommon in the Congo for the public or police to
 beat thieves caught in the act. Nor is it uncommon to see
 security officials at the port striking individuals for
 apparently trying to bypass controls or formalities. There
 have also been cases of militiamen harassing Congolese, and
 occasionally foreigners, for money, cigarettes, and the
 like. Amnesty International reports that six persons con-
 victed of murder were sentenced to death in the Congo in
 1981, but it is not known whether they were actually executed.
 Amnesty International also reports that five Cabindans died
 in detention in the Congo.
 Prison conditions in general are poor, and prisoners often
 lack adequate food and health care. Food is therefore
 usually brought to inmates by relatives. There have been
 
 
 78
 revisions in penal legislation, and the courts continue to
 examine ways to improve service to the public. However, no
 funds have been provided in the five-year plan for the
 improvement of prisons.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The Constitution guarantees protection against arbitrary
 indictment, arrest, and detention, but in practice a warrant
 is not required to make arrests. There is a habeas corpus
 provision, but it is not always honored. Congolese law
 allows for detention without charge for up to five days, but
 in cases involving the security of the state one can be held
 longer. Former President Yhomby-Opango, who was accused of
 corruption and deviation from party directives, has been
 under detention since March 1979 in accordance with a reso-
 lution of the Third Extraordinary Congress of the Congolese
 Labor Party. He has not been tried in the courts. Amnesty
 International in its 1982 report expressed concern for 35
 political detainees.
 Amnesty International has also reported that in June 1981 it
 was told the Congo was still holding without formal charges
 or trial 34 Cabindans of an original 100 suspected of having
 been involved in a 1977 attack on the rail line (see section
 3 below).
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 By law, the right to fair and public trial exists in all
 cases, but this is not always respected in practice.
 The legal system is not insulated from political inter-
 ference. However, nearly all cases tried in the Congo are
 not political, and defendants are assured of counsel in all
 circumstances, including cases litigated in military
 courts. Trial procedures are similar to those in other
 states with a legal system based on the Napoleonic Code.
 The Constitution provides for a supreme court and other
 lower courts. The supreme court, the highest court in the
 country, rules on the constitutionality of laws passed and
 controls the jurisdictional activities of the lower courts
 and tribunals. The Congolese judiciary is well-trained and
 highly professional.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The Constitution declares that the home is inviolable.
 The law requires a warrant to search a house. The law is
 not always adhered to in practice, but there were no reports
 in 1982 of widespread abuses, despite the emergency created
 by the bombings.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for "freedom of expression, press,
 association, processions, and demonstrations under conditions
 prescribed by law." As a matter of official policy, these
 individual liberties are restricted. The state censorship
 board regularly reviews the contents of newspapers, movies,
 
 
 79
 books, and records, mostly of foreign origin. Publications
 are normally censored if they contain articles which are
 critical of the Congo, are contrary to the image the Congo
 wishes to project either internally or externally, or judged
 to be contrary to social welfare. In one case in 1982 a
 recording of a Congolese song was questioned because it was
 considered detrimental to family values. Continued sale of
 the record was allowed but its broadcast on Congolese radio
 was banned. The Government does allow some internal criti-
 cism of its policies, but normally in less sensitive areas
 such as health and agriculture. There is also criticism in
 newspaper letter columns of the conduct of some public
 bureaucrats.
 Many Congolese are writers, playwrights, poets, painters,
 etc., whose themes often reflect various aspects of Congo-
 lese life, both positive and negative. The intelligentsia
 is not generally harassed. The state owns and controls the
 media, except for one church newspaper, and tends to follow
 a Marxist editorial policy. News reports in the government-
 owned media come from a variety of sources, including
 several foreign press agencies and French satellite feeds.
 Foreign journalists are permitted to visit the Congo and are
 given appointments to meet with various officials. Although
 several foreign journalists have been called to the state
 security office to explain the purpose of their visit to the
 Congo, their work has not been impeded.  There have been
 no confirmed reports of systematic government wiretapping
 or mail censorship.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right to peaceful assembly is limited by the state's
 perceived self-interest. The Congolese Trade Union Confede-
 ration represents workers, but, as an appendage of the
 state, is prohibited from striking.  Wildcat strikes,
 however, do occur with relative impunity. Unions have been
 effective within the government framework in expressing the
 desires and grievances of workers and achieving considerable
 change. The unions play a key role in the political process.
 The Congo has not forgotten that it was unionized workers
 who were instrumental in bringing down the Government
 of President Youlou in 1963 when he paid insufficient
 attention to their concerns. Workers have been
 effective in persuading the Government to provide
 transportation to and from work, cafeteria facilities
 at some ministries and agencies, vacation time and
 pay, travel and housing, etc.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed by law and honored
 in practice.  Catholic and Protestant churches,
 including the Salvation Army and the Kimbanguist and
 Matsouanist churches, are active in the Congo. Many
 of these churches run clinics in rural areas. The
 Catholic Church just recently commemorated the 100th
 anniversary of evangelism in the Congo, an event which
 was given official television coverage. During Pope
 John Paul II's historic visit to the Congo in May
 1980, the Pope and President Sassou-Nguesso jointly
 reaffirmed the principles of freedom of religion and
 church/state separation. There were no reports of
 serious ethnic or religious discrimination in 1982.
 
 
 80
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Conqolese Government does not restrict the internal
 movement of Congolese citizens, although identification
 cards may be checked. As noted above, movements in Brazza-
 ville are more closely checked as a result of two terrorist
 bombings. Military personnel movements are restricted both
 internally and externally. Congolese citizens who wish to
 travel abroad require exit authorization from the office of
 state security; in most cases this is a difficult process.
 In addition, government employees traveling abroad must
 obtain an "ordre de mission" from the appropriate government
 component. Passports, when issued, must be. returned to
 and held by state security after the traveler's return
 to the Congo. The Constitution accords asylum rights
 to persons persecuted because of "democracy, national
 liberation, freedom, scientific and cultural work, or
 defense of the rights of the working classes." The Congo is
 the home of numerous exiles and refugees, mostly from
 surrounding central African states. Most refugees, includ-
 ing some Zairians, are permitted to travel to other countries
 under the auspices of the United Nations High Commissioner
 for Refugees. Amnesty International reports that in 1981
 more than 30 Angolan refugees had been detained in the Congo
 without charge or trial since 1977.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Political power is centralized in the sole political party,
 the Marxist-Leninist Congolese Labor Party which determines
 opportunities for participation in the political process.
 No other political parties are permitted to operate. The
 Congolese Labor Party membership, which presently numbers
 approximately 7,000, is highly controlled on the basis of
 loyalty and performance. Theoretically, the PCT Party
 Congress is the supreme party organ and elects the 60-member
 Central Committee and the president. The Congress meets
 every five years. Although never referred to in the Consti-
 tution, the Political Bureau is elected by and from the
 Central Committee and acts as the premier policy-making
 body in the polity. The decisions of the Political Bureau
 are binding on all other state and party organizations, and
 if the existing president were incapacitated he would be
 replaced, according to the Constitution, by the Political
 Bureau from among its own members. The elections for local
 and regional organs and the National Assembly which were
 held in July 1979 were the first elections in the Congo
 since June 1973.
 The party president, elected for five years, is also
 president of the republic, chief of state, and president
 of the Council of Ministers. The Council of Ministers is
 the highest executive organ of the state and consists of
 the president, the prime minister, and the other ministers.
 As there are no democratic elections involving more than
 one candidate or political party, opportunities for political
 involvement are limited to the PCT, including the national,
 regional and local assemblies and the "mass" and "elite"
 organizations. The National Assembly meets twice yearly
 with each session limited to a maximum of two months.
 
 
 81
 "Mass" and "elite" organizations, which are party appen-
 dages, include the Revolutionary Union of Congolese Women
 (URFC) and the Union of Socialist Youth of the Congo.
 Membership requirements in the UJSC are as strict as those
 of the PCT parent party. Other parties or opposition
 groups are not permitted.
 Under the Constitution, women have the same rights as men in
 the private, political, and social domains, and for equal
 work they are entitled to the same social welfare rights.
 There is a disparity, however, between salaries for men and
 women, and women are relegated to a secondary role in
 society. Although no women are ministers or members of the
 Political Bureau at present, women occupy senior government
 and party positions such as counselor to the president.
 Only one of the 60 members of the party's Central Committee
 is a woman. The 120-member National Assembly includes 12
 women, one of whom is assembly vice president. A woman is
 appellate court counselor, and another a judge in the
 appeals court. There are approximately eleven other women
 holding high positions in the courts. One Congolese embassy
 is headed by a female ambassador. Although there were few
 long-term results evident in 1982, the URFC continued its
 program to improve the lot of Congolese women through
 education, economic activities, and literacy. In secondary
 schools increasing numbers of young women are enrolled in
 technical courses, and university attendance among women
 continues to rise.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 The Congolese Government has demonstrated its willingness to
 listen and respond to human rights inquiries on a case-by-
 case basis. President Sassou granted in 1979 a widespread
 amnesty which affected several political detainees listed
 by Amnesty International. In its 1982 report, that organi-
 zation continued to express concern for the detention
 without trial of former President Yhomby-Opango and three of
 his associates since 1979. Amnesty International reported
 separately in 1982 that more than 30 Angolan refugees were
 detained without charge or trial since 1977 and that five
 reportedly had died in detention. Some 100 Cabindans
 reportedly held by Congolese authorities were believed to
 have been released following queries by the organization.
 In 1980, the International Committee of the Red Cross was
 permitted to inspect local prisons. In July 1982, however,
 President Sassou said that his Government would not heed
 protests of outside organizations regarding treatment of
 the perpetrators of the Brazzaville bombings, once caught.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 In 1982, the Congolese economy marked its fifth consecutive
 year of strong economic growth, spurred by petroleum revenues.
 Increased output in the oil sector, combined with the fall
 of the French franc relative to the dollar improved the
 Congo's foreign reserve position. Construction, transport,
 and forestry all posted gains during 1981, while agricultural
 production in general barely maintained 1980 levels.
 Structural bottlenecks continue to hinder economic growth,
 and nearly 30 percent of the funds allocated for the Congo-
 lese five-year plan (1982-86) will be devoted to dealing
 with infrastructure, particularly in the transport sector.
 
 
 The state enterprise sector did not appreciably improve its
 performance over 1981 and remains a drain on the economy.
 The state enterprise system, intended to transfer the means
 of production out of expatriate (largely French) hands, has
 imposed a heavy burden of inefficiency on the Congolese
 economy. As a result, despite the Government's Marxist-
 Leninist professions, a sizeable private sector still
 flourishes in the Congo, with a predominant input from
 expatriates.
 The Congo's per capita GNP, in 1980 put at $730, places
 the Congo above many other developing nations. The under-
 pinning for this relatively high income level, as for
 virtually all vitality in the Congolese economy, is petroleum,
 which in 1982 accounted for 70 percent of the Government's
 revenues and nearly 60 percent of GNP. The combination of
 private enterprise and petroleum earnings has carried the
 Congolese economy to a major recovery since 1979 and enabled
 the Government to reduce its balance of payments deficit of
 $192 million in 1979 to $142 million in 1980. In addition,
 the Congo receives development assistance from France, the
 USSR, China, the U.S. and a dozen other bilateral and
 multilateral sources with both capitalist and communist
 alignments.
 The onrush of oil revenues tends to obscure structural
 imbalances in the economy. Although major pockets of rela-
 tive prosperity can be found, some sectors of the economy
 and regions of the country lag markedly behind. One
 estimate gives rural agricultural income as $130 per capita
 annually. Income distribution data do not exist. In urban
 areas, the Congo's oil wealth is distributed widely though
 unevenly, entering the economy largely as civil service
 salaries and spreading through an informal welfare network
 based on extended family ties.
 The concentration of 70 percent of the nation's popu-
 lation in Brazzaville, Pointe Noire, and along the rail line
 connecting them has eased somewhat the task of delivering
 social services. The Government has made a commitment to
 improve and expand health care throughout the country, a
 policy underscored by the five percent budget share of the
 health ministry (fourth among all ministries). Life expec-
 tancy, currently 59.3 years at birth, has been rising
 nationally, but is probably lower outside urban centers.
 A similar urban/rural dichotomy exists with regard to
 infant mortality. Mothers in cities have access to clinics
 with at least some medications and equipment, as well as
 trained professional staff. Medical care is much more
 limited in some areas of the countryside. Nationwide, the
 infant mortality rate is 129.3 per thousand live births.
 While the annual population growth rate has accelerated
 from 2.1 percent in the 1970's to 2.6 percent in 1980, the
 Congo with only 1.6 million inhabitants, does not face an
 overpopulation problem. It is concerned, however, with
 problems that derive from non-planning of families and
 offers family planning and child spacing information ser-
 vices in urban maternal and child care centers.
 
 
 Despite the lack of an agricultural tradition and an
 absence of rural infrastructure, the Congo has been spared
 serious nutritional deficiencies, largely due to the relative
 fertility of the soil. About 103 percent of the calories
 required for proper nutrition are available, although some
 shortage of protein exists in the national diet, owing to
 the heavy consumption of manioc (cassava), the staple food.
 Provision of safe drinking water has been a problem in
 both urban and rural areas, and only about 38 percent
 of the population has consistent access. The Government
 has vowed to provide safe drinking water throughout the
 country.
 The Congo, which devoted 15.8 percent of its 1982 operating
 budget to education, has had notable success in maintaining
 the high level of literacy (over 50 percent and, by some
 accounts, close to 80 percent) the country inherited from
 the colonial period. There are primary schools all over the
 country, and adjusted primary enrollment (including adult
 enrollment) is over 156 percent of the school-age population
 in the cities. The figure drops off in the countryside.
 The Government encourages parents to send their children to
 school. University enrollment has drastically increased,
 and in 1982 the Government acknowledged that it had far
 too many applicants for available university scholar-
 ships.
 A new family code has been drafted relative to the rights of
 family members. It is designed to put an end to social
 injustices deriving from traditional customs and practices.
 The code, for example, will provide for the protection of
 widows, establish more equitable rules for inheritance, and
 strengthen the rights of women. It will be introduced to
 the National Assembly, probably in 1983.
 Despite long cultural ties to Franc, many norms of traditional
 African society remain strong. For example, those who have
 access to funds are expected to share their income with
 family members. The consequent diffusion of resources has a
 profound effect on the economy and society. Polygamy is
 legal and widespread in the Congo, but the pressures
 of urbanization and modernization induce most couples
 to opt for monogamy.
