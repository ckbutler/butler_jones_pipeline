 ALBANIA
 Albania is a republic with a multiparty parliament, a prime minister, and a presi-
 dent elected by the Parliament. The prime minister heads the government; the pres-
 idency is a largely ceremonial position with limited executive power. The Socialist
 Party and its allies won 121 of 155 parliamentary seats in 1997 elections held after
 a 5-month period of chaos and anarchy. Observers deemed the elections to be ac-
 ceptable and satisfactory under the circumstances. However, the largest opposition
 group, the Democratic Party, boycotted Parliament from October 1997 to March
 1998 and again from June 1998 through year's end, charging unfair practices by the
 ruling Socialists and their coalition partners. The Socialist Party chairman, Fatos
 Nano, formed a government following the elections and remained in office until Sep-
 tember 1998, when he resigned following a series of often violent demonstrations
 against his administration. The Socialists then chose Pandeli Majko to serve as
 Prime Minister in October 1998. A parliamentary commission drafted a new Con-
 stitution that was approved in a national referendum in November; observers found
 that the referendum in general was conducted fairly. The Democratic Party boy-
 cotted the process of drafting the Constitution and called for a boycott of the ref-
 erendum as well. The judicialsystem, inefficient and subject to corruption and exec-
 utive pressure in normal times, was undermined further by the country's continued
 instability.
 Local police units reporting to the Minister of Public Order are principally respon-
 sible for internal security, but the officers are typically untrained and often unreli-
 able. The Ministry also has a small force of well-trained and effective police officers
 organized into special duty units. The looting of military arsenals in 1997 put hun-
 dreds of thousands of weapons into the hands of civilians. The police exercise only
 marginal control in some areas of the country; government authority is particularly
 absent in some areas along the northeastern border. The police are affected by, and
 are sometimes a part of, the country's endemic corruption. The national intelligence
 service (ShIK) is responsible for both internal and external intelligence gathering
 and counterintelligence. It and its predecessor organization also had a long history.
 of engaging in political repression under previous governments. Under the Socialist
 Government, the ShIK has become smaller and less active, and the organization ap-
 parently no longer has a political role. A new law for the ShIK and an accompany-
 ing plan to restructure the intelligence service was passed by Parliament in Decem-
 ber. The military has not had a role in domestic security until recently, when a spe-
 cial 120-man "commando" unit was authorized in October. Once organized, the new
 unit is to operate in an antiterrorist role under the Minister of Defense, but during
 times of domestic crisis the Minister of Public Order can request its transfer to his
 authority directly from the Minister of Defense. The police committed some human
 rights abuses.
 Albania is a poor country in transition from central economic planning to a free
 market system, and many issues related to privatization, ownership claims, and the
 appropriate regulation of business are not yet resolved. Economic recovery from the
 collapse of 1997 was slow, but inflation was about 10 percent during the year com-
 pared with about 40 percent in 1997, and gross domestic product (GDP) grew by
 about 10 percent. The official unemployment rate was 17 percent. With two-thirds
 of all workers employed in agriculture-mostly at the subsistence level-remittances
 from citizens working abroad are extremely important, as is foreign assistance. The
 GDP may be underestimated because considerable income also is thought to be de-
 rived from various organized and semiorganized criminal activities. A variety of
 other unreported, noncriminal activities, such as unlicensed small businesses, along
 with the Government's inability to collect fully accurate statistics, also contribute
 to the GDP's underestimation.

 The Government's overall human rights record improved somewhat, in hand with
 the gradual quieting of the massive civil unrest of 1997; however, problems re-
 mained in several areas. The opposition Democratic Party made numerous allega-
 tions that the Government was responsible for the murders of various Democratic
 Party members during the year, but the Party never produced evidence to support
 these claims. The police beat and otherwise abused suspects and prisoners. The
 Democratic Party often legitimately complained about incidents of police harass-
 ment of its members and of the dismissal of some of its members from official posi-
 tions for political reasons. The judiciary is inefficient and subject to corruption and
 executive pressure. There were complaints of unqualified and unprofessional judges
 and credible accounts of judges who were intimidated or bribed by powerful crimi-
 nals. The Government infringed on citizens' privacy rights. Government respect for
 freedom of speech and of the press improved; however, academic freedom was con-
 strained. Government respect for freedom of assembly improved. The gains in
 human rights were largely offset by the Governmenfs stubbornly passive approach
 to-basic law enforcement: in too many instances crime, corruption, and vigilantism
 undermined the Government's efforts to restore civil order. Violence and discrimina-
 tion against women are problems, and trafficking in women and children is a signifi-
 cant problem. Child abuse is also a problem. The Government took steps to improve
 the treatment of ethnic minorities; however, societal discrimination against Roma
 remains a problem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no confirmed cases of po-
 litical killings by the Government, despite repeated claims by the main opposition
 party that its members were harassed, beaten, and sometimes murdered by govern-
 ment agents. Democratic Party members were the victims of numerous attacks and
 murders, but in the general atmosphere of lawlessness and lax law enforcement,
 neither culprits nor motives were ever found for most of these crimes. However, po-
 lice investigation of many of the cases was not aggressive.
 The murder of Democratic Party Member of Parliament (M.P.) Azem Hajdari by
 an unknown gunman in September 1998 was the most significant of these incidents
 and set off days of protest marches and rioting in the capital, which left at least
 four persons dead. In September 1997, Hajdari was shot and seriously wounded by
 a Socialist M.P. after a scuffle inside the Parliament building; in March the Socialist
 M.P., Gafur Mazreku, was subsequently convicted of attempted murder and sen-
 tenced to 12 years in prison. The police, local human rights organizations, and diplo-
 matic representatives found no evidence to back claims of government involvement
 in any of these incidents.
 In January police officers in Fieri reportedly beat to death a man after removing
 him from a hospital. In September 3 persons were shot and killed when approxi-
 mately 50 persons reportedly tried to take over the police commissariat in Lezha.
 The country continued to experience high levels of violent crime, some of which
 was politically motivated. Antigovernment crowds seized much of the city of
 Shkodra in February, for example, and burned the city's main police station. In Sep-
 tember rioters attacked and burned government office buildings and the residence
 of the Prime Minister after the murder of Democratic Party M.P. Hajdari. In the
 2 days of antigovernment violence, 2 protesters were killed and 10 persons were
 wounded.
 Many killings occurred throughout the country as the result of individual or clan
 vigilante actions, or in conflicts involving various criminal gangs.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no confirmed reports of politically motivated dis-
 appearances. At least one prominent businessman disappeared; no information on
 his fate emerged by year's end, and some observers claimed that there might be a
 political connection.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Law on Fundamental Rights and Freedoms stipulates that "no one can be sub-
 ject to torture, or cruel and brutal treatment;" however, the police often beat sus-
 pects in the process of arresting them, and there were reports that the police beat
 or otherwise mistreated prisoners. The Penal Code makes the use of torture a crime
 punishable by up to 10 years in prison. The Albanian Helsinki Committee reported
 in June that major police stations were the sites of the worst abuse of detainees,
 and that all stations were overcrowded and some were "out of control." Local human
 rights organizations also reported that police brutality often occurred outside the po-
 lice stations and therefore was more difficult to detect unless reported by victims.
 Human Rights Watch reports that in January, the police beat two Democratic Party
 
 
 1105
 
 activists in Kutchova and Vlora. In February the police beat several journalists (see
 Section 2.a.). Police officials typically do not investigate and arrest the perpetrators.
 The Democratic Party also made credible complaints of incidents of police harass-
 ment of its members.
 According to Democratic Party representatives, six or seven demonstrators were
 injured and five were arrested during a demonstration by the Party in Tirana on
 August 27. According to the authorities, six or seven police officers also were injured
 (see Section 2.b.).
 The police were often unable to maintain public order. The police station in the
 northern city of Shkodra was taken over on February 22, and 35 detainees were re-
 leased. The city hall and local shops were damaged and looted. The main bridge at
 the entrance to the city reportedly was mined, apparently to prevent additional po-
 lice forces from reaching the city. During the funeral procession for Democratic
 Party M.P. Hajdari on September 14 in Tirana, armed antigovernment demonstra-
 tors attacked and looted the office of the Prime Minister. The demonstrators briefly
 controlled the building in which the Prime Minister's office is located, the Albanian
 State Television and Radio Building, and other government offices in central Tirana.
 In November a "training grenade" was detonated in a cafi in front of Democratic
 Party headquarters in Tirana, according to local police. No one was hurt and there
 was no damage to the building.
 The majority of police officers receive little or no training. Western governments
 established police training programs that aim at improving technical expertise,
 operational procedures, and respect for human rights. Local nongovernmental orga-
 nizations (NGO's) also launched programs to educate police officers in human rights.
 These training and education programs have begun to improve the level of profes-
 sionalism of the police, but the overall performance of law enforcement remains
 weak. In February Parliament passed an anticrime law that allows police officers
 to shoot without warning at members of armed groups that resist the police.
 Prison conditions vary from poor to harsh but generally were not life threatening.
 All of the country's prisons were destroyed or severely damaged in 1997 when
 armed groups stormed them and released the prisoners. The Government has re-
 opened 5 prisons and returned to custody perhaps a quarter of the 1,200 inmates
 who escaped, but the existing facilities are inadequate to house properly all current
 prisoners. The overcrowding has created very difficult living conditions, including
 the incarceration of juveniles with adults. Three other facilities are under construc-
 tion or repair, including a prison for juvenile offenders, but despite international fi-
 nancial assistance the projects are running many months behind schedule. A riot
 took place at the Tirana prison in February. Family visitation is allowed. The Gov-
 ernment has cooperated with the International Committee of the Red Cross and
 with other NGO's and has improved access for prison inspections. However, the ad-
 ministration of the prison in Burrel retains a reputation for not cooperating with
 human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The 1995 Penal Procedures Code sets out
 the rights of detained and arrested persons. By law, a police officer or prosecutor
 may order a suspect into custody. Detained persons must immediately be informed
 of the charges against them and of their rights. A prosecutor must be notified imme-
 diately after a suspect is detained by the police. Within 48 hours of the arrest or
 detention a court must decide, in the presence of the prosecutor, the suspect, and
 the suspect's lawyer, the type of detention to be employed. Legal counsel must be
 provided free of charge if the defendant cannot afford a private attorney.
 Bail in the form of money or property may be required if the judge believes that
 the accused otherwise may not appear for trial. Alternatively, a suspect may be
 placed under house arrest. The court may order pretrial confinement in cases where
 there is reason to believe that the accused may leave the country or is a danger
 to society.
 The Penal Procedures Code requires completion of pretrial investigations within
 3 months. The prosecutor may extend this period by 3-month intervals in especially
 difficult cases. The accused and the injured party have the right to appeal these ex-
 tensions to the district court. In practice lengthy pretrial detention is a problem.
 There is also a serious problem with delayed investigations, and the cases of many
 detained persons exceed the time limits set by law.
 On November 10 police in Shkodra arrested three Democratic Party supporters
 under a warrant signed by the military tribunal for participation in the mid-Sep-
 tember unrest. The most prominent of the three was a bodyguard for slain Demo-
 cratic Party M.P. Hajdari (see Section l.a.) and another is a distant cousin of former
 president Sali Berisha. All were released the same day, except for Hajdari's former
 bodyguard, after armed men negotiated with the Shkodra prefect for a number of
 hours. Armed men apparently blocked off the main street in Shkodra on which the
 
 
 1106
 police commissariat is located for an extended period. The office of the Organization
 or ecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Shkodra was attacked the same
 day, an event which local observers believe was connected to the arrests (see Section
 4).
 There were no clear cases of detainees being held for strictly political reasons, but
 several notable arrests appeared to be motivated by politics as well as law enforce-
 ment reasons. In August the police arrested six individuals who had held positions
 in the previous government, including the former Ministers of Defense and Interior
 and the former head of the State Control Commission. Prosecutors charged them
 with "crimes against humanity" in connection with their actions during the massive
 civil unrest of 1997. The Democratic Party complained that the arrests were purely
 political, and that the charges of "crimes against humanity" were concocted to get
 around the amnesty signed by the 10 major political parties in March 1997 for all
 actions concerning the unrest. Many international observers believe that the ac-
 cused persons might be serving as political scapegoats and noted that almost all po-
 litical factions in 1997 appeared to have contributed to the misjudgments and ille-
 galities that marked the crisis. In September the chairman of the Monarchist Legal-
 ity Party was arrested and charged with participating in the armed uprising earlier
 in the month, when antigovernment rioters seized and then burned several public
 buildings. Neither this case, nor the case of the six Democratic administration offi-
 cials had come to trial by year's end, and the Government had not released any in-
 formation on the basis for the charges.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The new Constitution provides for an independent
 judiciary; however, continued political instability, limited resources, political pres-
 sure, and endemic corruption have all weakened the judiciary's ability to function
 independently and efficiently. Corruption remains a serious problem, especially with
 the growth of organized crime, and judges are subjected both to bribery attempts
 and intimidation. On November 11, a bomb destroyed much of the home of the Chief
 Justice of the Constitutional Court. No one was injured. The Chief Justice pre-
 viously had served as a Socialist Party M.P. and was named to the position follow-
 ing a long, public, and highly politicized struggle between the Speaker of the Par-
 liament and the previous Chief Justice, who had been appointed by the previous
 Democratic Party government.
 Many court buildings were destroyed in 1997's civil unrest, and although all have
 been reopened, important records and legal materials were permanently lost. Seri-
 ous case backlogs are typical. The Government made limited progress toward build-
 ing an independent judiciary by moving the judicial budget out of the Ministry of
 Justice in October and into a separate account and by establishing a magistrates'
 school. However, it was accused of trying to stack the court system when Parliament
 passed a law in December to dismiss those judges who did not meet new educational
 requirements. The opposition Democratic Party claimed that the proposal was
 aimed specifically at judges named by the previous (Democratic) government and
 vigorously protested. Many of the judges who were likely to be affected by the meas-
 ure went on a protracted hunger strike in September 1997 before the government
 backed down.
 The judicial system comprises district courts of the first instance, military courts,
 six courts of appeal, and the Court of Cassation. There is also a separate and inde-
 pendent Constitutional Court. The Court of Cassation hears appeals from the
 Courts of Appeal, while the Constitutional Court reviews those cases requiring con-
 stitutional interpretation.
 The President heads the High Council of Justice, which has authority to appoint,
 discipline, and dismiss judges of the courts of first instance and of the courts of ap-
 peal. Judges who are dismissed have the right to appeal to the Court of Cassation.
 In addition to the President, the Council consists of the Minister of Justice, the head
 of the Court of Cassation, the Prosecutor General, three judges (chosen by sitting
 judges), two prosecutors (selected by the prosecutors), and four independent, well-
 known lawyers named by the Parliament.
 The President proposes the president and vice president of the Court of Cassation,
 and the Parliament elects all of the justices of that court. Four of the nine members
 of the Constitutional Court are selected by the President; five are elected by the
 Parliament. Parliament has the authority to approve and dismiss the judges of the
 Constitutional Court and the members of the Court of Cassation. According to the
 law, dismissal only may be ordered after conviction of a serious crime or for mental
 incompetence. In March the chief of the Constitutional Court was dismissed for al-
 legedly having been an informer for the Communist-era state security service; no
 trial was held, and the dismissal appeared to be at least partially motivated by po-
 litical considerations. The dismissal was initiated after a struggle between the Par-
 
 
 1107
 liament and the Constitutional Court on the issue of the rotation of the judges of
 the Court. During the controversy, both sides engaged in a heated public exchange
 with clearly political overtones. In March representatives of the Government sharply
 attacked the Chief Justice of the Court of Cassation. Although the progovernment
 media accused the Chief Justice of corruption and attacked the integrity of the
 Court of Cassation, the Chief Justice was not removed from office.
 Constitutional Court justices in theory serve maximum 9-year terms, with three
 justices rotating every 3 years. Justices of the Court of Cassation serve for 7 years.
 Under the new Constitution, the President appoints the general prosecutor with
 the consent of the Parliament. The President appoints and ismisses other prosecu-
 tors on the recommendation of the general prosecutor.
 Parliament approves the courts' budgets and allocates the funds. Each court may
 determine how it wishes to spend the money allocated to it. The Justice Ministry
 provides and a pproves administrative personnel, and jurists complain that the ar-
 rangement produces inadequate support and compromises their independence.
 Courts operate with very limited material resources, inadequate legal libraries,
 and often do not have copies of recently passed legislation. The destruction of many
 court and police records in 1997, together with continued civil unrest, seriously im-
 paired the ability of prosecutors and police to investigate and prepare cases prop-
 erly. As a result, the court system was unable to process cases in a timely fashion.
 Despite these many handicaps, the court system continued to function and to en-
 gage in debate on issues of judicial independence and administrative procedure.
 The state provides all citizens the right to a fair, speedy, and public trial, except
 in cases where the necessities of public order, national security, or the interests of
 minors or other private parties require restrictions. All proceedings are conducted
 in the Albanian language; defendants, witnesses, and others who do not speak Alba-
 nian are entitled to the services of a translator. If convicted, the accused has the
 right to appeal the decision within 5 days to the Court of Appeals.
 There were no reports of political prisoners. However, opposition political leaders
 frequently charged that the Government arbitrarily arrested and detained its sup-
 porters on political grounds. There is little solid evidence to back up these claims,
 and most international observers believe they are baseless.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Law on Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms provides for the inviolability of
 the individual person, of dwellings, and of the privacy of correspondence; however,
 the Government sometimes infringed on these rights. Police often conduct searches
 without first obtaining warrants. The Democratic Party made credible complaints of
 the dismissal of some of its members from government or military positions for po-
 litical reasons.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Law on Fundamental Human Rights and
 Freedoms provides for freedom of speech and of the press, and the Government gen-
 erally respected these rights. The media are active and unrestrained but have devel-
 oped little sense of journalistic responsibility or professional integrity. Sensational-
 ism is the norm in the newspapers, and the political party-oriented newspapers in
 particular print gossip, unsubstantiated accusations, and outright fabrications. A
 survey conducted early in the year by the Albania Media Institute showed that 63
 percent of readers believed the press was itself causing problems for ordinary citi-
 zens, and only 18 percent thought that the press was making a positive contribution
 to the life of the nation. Some publications appear to be making efforts to improve
 professional standards and to provide more balanced and accurate reporting.
 Political parties, trade unions, and various societies and groups publish their own
 newspapers or magazines, and competition between the commercial publications is
 very keen. At any time, an estimated 200 different publications are available, in-
 cluding daily and weekly newspapers, magazines, newsletters, and pamphlets.
 Three Greek minority newspapers are published in the Greek language in southern
 Albania. Difficult economic times, coupled with readers' distrust of the press, re-
 sulted in a significant drop in newspaper sales during the year. Total daily circula-
 tion of all newspapers dropped from about 85,000 copies to about 75,000 copies.
 'Prime Minister Pandeli Majko created a new Ministry of Information when he
 came to office in October. The Ministry is tasked with implementing the law on
 press freedom, which originally was passed by Parliament in 1997 but has not yet
 been implemented. The licensing board, whose creation was mandated by the law,
 had yet to start functioning or issuing private commercial broadcasting licenses.
 State-run radio and television provide the most widespread and universally acces-
 sible domestic programming, and the wide availability of satellite dishes has pro-
 vided citizens with easy access to international programming. Numerous small pri-
 
 
 1108
 
 vate radio and television stations are in operation around the country. However,
 they are unregulated, and the Government established new licensing procedures to
 promote a more stable broadcasting environment.- Despite frequent complaints by
 opposition politicians that the state-run media do not give their parties fair coverage
 or equal access, most international observers agree that the current Government's
 record is a significant improvement over past practice. However, a Society for a
 Democratic Culture media monitoring project from March to July showed that state-
 run television's news coverage is lopsided in favor of the Government. According to
 international observers, the state television channel gave balanced coverage on the
 constitutional referendum campaign up until a few days before voting, when it
 began to give more coverage to government positions.
 Attacks on journalists continued-both beatings by the police and attacks by un-
 known assailants. According to human rights NGO's, in February police officers in
 Librazhdi beat two journalists, reportedly because of the stories they had written.
 Also in February police officers in Elbasani beat a reporter for the daily Republika.
 In May a bomb exploded at the home of a journalist for the newspaper Koha Jone
 and injured her two children and two neighbors.
 Academic freedom continues to be limited. University professors complain that
 some faculty members are hired or fired for political reasons and that students who
 have the right political connections get preferential treatment regardless of their
 personal qualifications. Some international monitoring of the magistrates' school en-
 sured selection on the basis of merit. The Government maintains that changes to
 university staffing are made on the basis of merit.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Law on Fundamental
 Human Rights and Freedoms provides for the right of peaceful assembly and states
 that "no one may be denied the right to collective organization for any lawful pur-
 pose;" the Government generally respected this right in practice. According to the
 law, organizers must obtain permits for gatherings in public places, which the police
 may refuse to issue for reasons such as security and traffic. In practice rallies and
 demonstrations were very common, and the Government usually made no concerted
 efforts to prevent them even when violence seemed possible, or when permits had
 not-been issued. However, during a Democratic Party rally in Tirana on August 27,
 six or seven demonstrators were injured and five were arrested. Six or seven police
 officers were also injured (see Section 1.c.).
 The Law on Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms provides for the right of
 association, and the Government generally respects this right in practice. A political
 party must apply to the Ministry of Justice for official certification. It must declare
 an aim or purpose that is not anticonstitutional or contrary to law, and it must de-
 scribe its organizational structure and account for all public and private funds it re-
 ceives.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-According to the new Constitution, the state has no offi-
 cial religion, and all religions are equal. The majority of citizens are secular in ori-
 entation after decades of rigidly enforced atheism. Muslims, who make up the larg-
 est traditional religious group, adhere to a moderate form of Sunni Islam. The Alba-
 nian Autocephalous Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches are the other large de-
 nominations. The Albanian Orthodox Church split from the Greek Orthodox Church
 early in the century, and adherents strongly identify with the national church as
 distinct from the Greek Church. The current archbishop is a Greek citizen, even
 though the Albanian Orthodox Church's 1929 statute states that all its archbishops
 must be of Albanian heritage, because there are no Albanian clerics qualified for
 this position.
 Foreign clergy, including Muslim clerics, Christian and Baha'i missionaries, Jeho-
 vah's Witnesses, and many others freely carry out religious activities. The Religious
 Council of the State Secretariat, an office that functions under the Prime Minister's
 authority, but has no clear mandate and is unable to make decisions on its own,
 estimates that there are 20 different Muslim societies and sects with around 95 rep-
 resentatives in country. There are more than 2,500 missionaries representing Chris-
 tian or Baha'i organizations.
 In 1967 the Communists banned all religious practices and expropriated the prop-
 erty of the established Islamic, Orthodox, and Catholic churches. The Government
 has not yet returned all the properties and religious objects under its control that
 were confiscated under the Communist regime. In cases where religious buildings
 were returned, the Government often failed to return the land that surrounds the
 buildings. The Government also is unable to compensate the churches adequately
 for the extensive damage that many religious properties suffered. "
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Law on Fundamental Human Rights and Freedoms provides for
 
 
 1109
 freedom of movement within the country and for freedom to travel abroad and re-
 turn, and the Government respects these rights in practice.
 Citizens who fled the country during or after the Communist regime are welcomed
 back, and if they lost their citizenship they may have it restored. Albanian-born citi-
 zens who emigrate may hold dual citizenship.
 The new Constitution, approved in November, gives foreigners the right of refuge
 in the country, and an asylum law passed in 1996 includes provisions for granting
 refugee/asylee status. The Government accepts the entrance of refugees, does not
 expel those with valid claims to refugee status, and works with the international
 community to provide housing and support for them. It also provides first asylum.
 Over 20,000 Kosovar Albanians were afforded refuge in Albania during the year,
 finding shelter with extended family or in facilities operated by the United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) or other international entities. The Gov-
 ernment cooperated with the UNHCR and others to provide support to the refugees,
 but its efforts were limited by a lack of resources and organization.
 Organized criminal gangs have made the smuggling of illegal immigrants--Alba-
 nians, Kurds, Pakistanis, Chinese, Turks, and others from the Middle East and
 Asia-into a lucrative business. Italy is the most common destination. Although
 some of these illegal immigrants might meet the criteria for refugee status, many
 were attempting to enter Western Europe for economic reasons. Individuals who be-
 come stranded in Albania while trying to use this illegal pipeline are eligible for a
 "care and maintenance" program run by the UNHCR and the Albanian Red Cross
 and can have their cases evaluated by UNHCR officials.
 There were no reports of the forced return of persons to a country where they
 feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The new Constitution states that "Governance is based on a system of elections
 that are free, equal, general, and periodic." Citizens elected a government in 1997
 in what international observers considered to be a satisfactory process, given the
 preceding months of chaos and anarchy. However, in the by-election in Vlora in
 June for mayor one polling station was closed due to ballot stuffing. As in other elec-
 tions in the past 2 years, local election commissions permitted family members to
 vote on behalf of relatives who were not present. Similar infractions again occurred
 in the referendum held in November on the new Constitution, but international ob-
 servers judged that they had no impact on the result.
 The main opposition group, the Democratic Party, boycotted the Parliament
 throughout the year and refused to participate in virtually all government functions
 at the national level. The leader of the Democratic Party, former president Sali
 Berisha, maintained that the boycott was a necessary response to intolerable provo-
 cations by the Government, including alleged assault by its agents. Over the course
 of the year, international observers increasingly questioned this rationale for with-
 drawal from the political process and called on the Democrats to end their -boycott.
 In August and September, the police arrested six leaders of the Democratic Party,
 including former ministers, and a leader of the Monarchist Legality Party. Three
 Democratic Party supporters were arrested in November in Shkodra and two were
 released the same day. These arrests may have been in part politically motivated
 (see Section 1.d.).
 The new Constitution prohibits the formation of any party or organization which
 is based on totalitarian methods, which incites and supports racial, religious or eth-
 nic hatred, which uses violence to take power or influence state policies, as well as
 those with a secret character. In October Parliament amended the law on referen-
 dums to require only a simple majority, rather than a majority of all registered vot-
 ers, for the vote on the new Constitution.
 No legal impediments hinder the full participation of women and minorities in
 government. The major political parties have women's organizations and have
 women serving on their central committees. However, women continue to be under-
 represented in both politics and government. In Parliament 11 of 150 M.P.'s are
 women, 1 of whom is a deputy speaker. In the Government, two ministers and three
 deputy ministers are women. Ethnic Greeks constitute the largest minority. They
 are well represented in the current Government and participate actively in various
 political parties.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government generally permitted human rights and related organizations to
 function freely, although the lawlessness in some areas of the country severely lim-
 
 
 1110
 
 ited the -practical access of some of these organizations. The Albanian Helsinki Com-
 mittee, the Albanian Human Rights Group, the Albanian Human Rights Docu-
 mentation Center, the Society for Democratic Culture, and the Albanian Institute
 for Contemporary Studies were among the most active local NGO's involved in
 human rights activities. Despite the assistance of international donors, the work of
 all of these organizations is hampered by a lack of funds and equipment. The Gov-
 ernment meets with the representatives of these domestic NGO's and generally is
 responsive to their inquiries. While government-NGO relationships often are
 strained over particular issues, virtually all domestic NGO leaders report that the
 current Government gave them significantly greater access and cooperation than
 they received from previous governments.
 A wide variety of international human rights NGO's visit or operate within the
 country with the cooperation of the Government and generally without restriction.
 These organizations are free to publish and disseminate their findings, including
 criticisms of the Government. The Government also cooperates with the United Na-
 tions and other international entities on human rights issues.
 The OSCE office in Shkodra was attacked on November 10, probably in retaliation
 for the arrests of three Democratic Part supporters that day, according to local ob-
 servers (see Section 1.d.). Masked attackers armed with rifles smashe a computer
 and other equipment and stole personal valuables, cash, and OSCE vehicles. Demo-
 cratic Party leaders sharply criticized the OSCE for its support of the new Constitu-
 tion. The chief OSCE official in the country reported that he was told that organiz-
 ers of a Democratic Party rally in Gjirokastra told the crowd that he would be wel-
 comed with gunfire if he were to travel to Gjirokastra. Prior to the constitutional
 referendum in November, he received a death threat, and OSCE offices in Kukesi
 and Gjirokastra also received threats.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Law on Major Constitutional Provisions prohibits discrimination based on
 sex, race, ethnicity, language, or religion. However, women and some minority
 groups complain that in practice some discrimination continues, and trafficking in
 women for prostitution was a significant problem.
 Women.-Viol6nce against women and spousal abuse still occur in this traditional
 male-dominated society; cultural acceptance and the lax police response result in
 most abuse going unreported. For the second half of the year the Tirana police de-
 ployed a (female) sex crimes officer. No government-sponsored program protects the
 rights of women. An NGO maintains a shelter in Tirana for abused women, but the
 facility can hold only one or two women at a time. The NGO also operates a hot
 line that women and girls can call for advice and counseling; it received some 4,000
 calls during the year.
 Many men, especially those from the northern part of the country, still follow the
 old traditions known as the kanun, in which women are considered chattel and may
 be treated as such. The concepts of marital rape and sexual harassment are not well
 established, and most such acts would not be considered crimes.
 Trafficking in women for the purpose of prostitution is a significant problem.
 Criminal gangs recruit or coerce women into working as prostitutes abroad, most
 often in Italy and Greece. There are also reports of traffickers kidnaping women for
 prostitution and of family members selling daughters, sisters, and wives to traffick-
 ers against their will. There are no laws that criminalize trafficking in women. The
 Government has had only periodic success in arresting the criminal organizers, and
 there are no reports of any convictions for trafficking in women in recent years. But
 there is rising awareness of the issue.
 Women are not excluded, by law or in practice, from any occupation; however,
 they do not typically rise to the top of their fields. The Labor Code mandates equal
 pay for equal work, but no data are available on how well this is implemented in
 practice. Women enjoy equal access to higher education, but they are not accorded
 full and equal opportunity in their careers, and it is common for well-educated
 women to be underemployed or to work outside the field of their training. An in-
 creasing number of women are beginning to venture out on their own, opening shops
 and small businesses. Many are migrating along with men to Greece and Italy to
 seek employment.
 Children.-The Government's commitment to children's rights and welfare is codi-
 fied in domestic law and through international agreements. The law provides for the
 right to a free education that lasts at least 8 years and also authorizes private
 schools. School attendance is mandatory through the eighth grade (or age 18, which-
 ever comes first). In practice many children leave school earlier than allowed by law
 in order to work with their families, especially in rural areas.

 Child abuse is a little-reported problem, but authorities and NGO's believe that
 it exists. Trafficking in children is a serious problem. Criminals may kidnap chil-
 dren from families or orphanages to be sold to prostitution or pederasty rings
 abroad. Within the country, Romani children often are used as beggars, and the po-
 lice generally ignore the practice.
 People With Disabilities.-Widespread poverty, unregulated occupational hazards,
 and poor medical care combine to account for the condition of a significant popu-
 lation of disabled persons. The disabled are eligible for various forms of public as-
 sistance, but budgetary constraints mean that the amounts that they receive are
 very low. No law mandates accessibility to public buildings for people with disabil-
 ities, and little has been done in that regard.
 National/RaciallEthnic Minorities.-The Government played a constructive role
 in maintaining the nation's generally positive record on the treatment of minorities.
 There are two main minority populations, ethnic Greeks and Macedonians. While
 no recent official statistics exist regarding the size of the various ethnic commu-
 nities, ethnic Greeks are the most organized and receive the most attention and as-
 sistance from abroad. Unknown numbers of ethnic minorities have left the country
 due to civil unrest or economic stagnation; many ethnic Greek villages in the south
 are reported to have virtually emptied in recent years.
 Relations between Albania and Greece continued to improve in 1998, as did the
 status and rights of ethnic Greeks in the country. Greek-language public elementary
 schools are now common in much of the southern part of the country (where almost
 all of the ethnic Greek minority lives). However, there are no Greek-language high
 schools. A Greek-language public primary school was opened in Tirana in Septem-
 ber, and also during the year Parliament approved Greek as one of the foreign lan-
 guages that may be offered as a course in any public school. There is a Greek chair
 at the University of Girokastra. New immigration procedures were agreed upon by
 Albania and Greece to allow residents of the border areas easy access for day-to-
 day travel across the border for business or family reasons.
 Classes in the Macedonian language are available to students in the districts of
 Pogradeci and Devolli bordering the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
 (FYROM). The FYROM Government provides texts for these classes. There is a
 small group of ethnic Montenegrins and ethnic Serbs in the north. No discrimina-
 tion was reported against the Vlachs, who speak Romanian as well as Albanian, or
 against the Cams, non-Orthodox ethnic Albanians who were exiled from Greece in
 1944. Both groups live mainly in the south.
 Two distinct groups of Roma, the Jevg and the Arrixhi (Gabel), are established
 in the country. The Jevg tend to be settled in urban areas and are generally more
 integrated into the economy than the Arrixhi. Roma are clearly the most neglected
 minority group. Broadly speaking, they suffer from high illiteracy, poor public
 health conditions, and marked economic disadvantage. Roma encounter much soci-
 etal discrimination, but generally neither the police nor individuals target the Roma
 for violence. In the past, NGO's have reported severe hazing of Roma in the mili-
 tary.
 According to a human rights NGO, four Romani police officers in Levan lost their
 jobs in April. The police force hired the Roma in the aftermath of the 1997 civil vio-
 lence, when both Roma and non-Roma died in Levan. The Ministry of Interior
 waived certain conditions to hire the Roma in the interests of preventing intercom-
 munal violence. The Levan police chief fired the Roma police officers reportedly be-
 cause he believed that Roma no longer were in danger of violence from non-Roma
 and that the police department was able to protect them. However, Roma living in
 Levan still fear revenge from the families of the non-Roma who died during the un-
 rest.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers obtained the right to form independent
 trade unions in 1990. The 1993 Labor Code established procedures for the protection
 of workers' rights through collective bargaining agreements. Two federations act as
 umbrella organizations for most of the country's unions: The Independent Confed-
 eration of Trade Unions of Albania claims over 200,000 members, and the Confed-
 eration of Trade Unions claims over 100,000 members. Some unions have chosen not
 to join either of these federations. No union has an official political affiliation, and
 the government does not provide any financial support for unions.
 The Law on Major Constitutional Provisions and other legislation provide that all
 workers except the uniformed military, the police, and some court officials have the
 right to strike. The law forbids strikes that are openly declared to be political or
 that are judged by the courts to be political. A number of strikes took place during
 the year.

 Unions are free to join and maintain ties with international organizations.
 Government statistics indicated that 410,400 workers were formally employed
 (211,800 in the private sector and 198,600 in the public sector) and that an addi-
 tional 750,000 persons worked in agriculture. A total of 226,400 persons were reg-
 istered as unemployed.
 b. The Right to Organize-and Bargain Collectively.-Citizens in all fields of em-
 ployment, except uniformed members of the armed forces, police officers, and some
 court employees, have the right to organize and bargain collectively. In practice
 unions representing public sector employees negotiate directly with the government.
 Labor unions do not operate from a position of strength, given the country's cur-
 rent conditions-very high unemployment, slow recovery from the economic collapse
 of 1997, and extensive destruction of economic infrastructure due to recurrent epi-
 sodes of violence and looting. Effective collective bargaining in these circumstances
 is very difficult, and agreements are hard to enforce.
 There are no functioning export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Law on Major Constitutional
 Provisions and the Labor Code prohibit forced or compulsory labor, and generally
 it is not known to occur. However, there were reports that traffickers kidnap women
 for prostitution, and that family members sell daughters, sisters, and wives to traf-
 fickers against their will. The law also forbids forced or bonded labor by children,
 and the Government generally enforces these prohibitions; however, there were re-
 ports that children are forced to work abroad as prostitutes or beggars.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The
 Labor Code sets the minimum age of employment at 16 years and limits the amount
 and type of labor that can be performed by persons under age 18; children between
 the ages of 14 and 16 legally may work in part-time jobs during summer vacation.
 Primary school education is compulsory and free through age 18 or the eighth grade,
 whichever comes first. In rural areas, children continue to be called on to assist fam-
 ilies in farm work.
 The Ministry of Labor may enforce the minimum age requirements through the
 courts, but no recent cases of this actually occurring were known. In Tirana and
 other cities it is common to see children selling cigarettes and candies on the street,
 regardless of the season or hour. The law forbids forced or bonded labor by children,
 and although the Government generally enforces these prohibitions, there were
 some reports of such practices (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legal minimum wage for all workers over
 age 16 is approximately $40 (5,800 lek) per month. This is not sufficient to maintain
 a decent standard of living, especially for a worker and family. Many workers look
 for second jobs, which are difficult to find. Remittances from those working abroad
 are very important for many families. The law provides for social assistance (income
 support) and unemployment compensation, but these are very limited, both in terms
 of the amounts received and the number of persons actually covered. The average
 wage for workers in the public sector is approximately $69 (10,015 lek) per month.
 No data are available for private sector.wages, but the average is believed to be con-
 siderably higher than in the public sector.
 The legal maximum workweek is 48 hours, although in practice hours typically
 are set by individual or collective agreement. Many workers work 6 days a week.
 The Government sets occupational health and safety standards, but it has limited
 funds to make improvements in the remaining state-owned enterprises and limited
 ability to enforce standards on the private sector. Actual conditions in the workplace
 are generally very poor. The Labor Code lists the safety obligations of employers
 and employees but does not provide specific protection for workers who choose to
 leave a workplace because of hazardous conditions.
