 WESTERN SAHARA
 The sovereignty.of the Western Sahara remains the subject of
 diplomatic and military dispute. Morocco assumed
 administration of the northern three provinces of the Western
 Sahara after the withdrawal of Spanish forces in 1975, and of
 the southernmost province in 1979 when Mauritania renounced
 its claim to the area. Since 1973 the Polisario, an
 organization which Algeria has supported and which seeks
 independence for the Western Sahara, has challenged first
 Spain's and later Morocco's claim to the territory. Though
 Moroccan and Polisario forces have fought since 1975, there
 were no significant clashes in 1990. An estimated 165,000
 Sahrawi refugees have resided since the mid-1970's in camps
 near Tindouf in Algeria.
 At the request of the United Nations General Assembly, the
 International Court of Justice issued an advisory opinion in
 1975 that the people of the Western Sahara were entitled to
 self-determination and that Spain, Morocco, and Mauritania
 were not entitled to exercise sovereignty over the territory.
 The Organization of African Unity (OAU) attempted without
 success to mediate a solution. In 1981 Morocco agreed to hold
 a referendum to determine the population's wishes regarding
 independence or integration with Morocco. Attempts to resolve
 the question of sovereignty through mediation or referendum
 collapsed in 1984 when the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic
 (SADR), the civilian arm of the Polisario, was seated at the
 OAU summit and Morocco withdrew from the OAU in protest. In
 1986 Morocco agreed to revive efforts to reach a solution and
 asked the United Nations to administer a referendum; in 1986
 U.N. Secretary General Perez de Cuellar began efforts to
 arrange it. In November and December 1987, a U.N. technical
 team visited the territory to explore the practical
 arrangements for a referendum. On August 30, 1988, Morocco
 and the SADR accepted in principle the Secretary General's
 proposal for a referendum under U.N. and OAU auspices, and the
 Secretary General named a special representative to work out
 the details.
 In 1990 the Secretary General made progress towards organizing
 a referendum in the Western Sahara in which the Sahrawi would
 decide between integration with Morocco or independence. Both
 the Secretary General and his special representative held
 consultations in the region with all parties to the conflict.
 The U.N. Security Council in June unanimously approved the
 Secretary General's report on the Western Sahara and urged him
 to draw up a final plan for a referendum. Though the
 interested parties are still not in complete agreement on
 several important modalities for conducting the referendum,
 the Secretary General is continuing his efforts.
 Since 1977, the northern provinces of El Ayoun, Smara, and
 Boudjour have participated in Moroccan elections. The
 southernmost province of Oued ed Dahhab also participated in
 the 1983 and 1984 Moroccan elections. Sahrawi fill all 10
 parliamentary seats allotted to the Western Sahara, and the
 four governors of the region, who are appointed by the King of
 Morocco, are Sahrawi. In December 1989, Moroccan voters
 approved (by a majority of 99 percent with a reported 100
 percent participation, according to the Government) a 2-year
 extension of the term of the current Parliament to allow time
 for holding a referendum in the Western Sahara so that Western
 S~harans would be able to participate in thq next parliamentary
 e'e'-ions, which must occur before September 1992.

 WESTERN SAHARA
 The civilian population in the approximately 85 percent of the
 Western Sahara under effective Moroccan control is subject to
 Moroccan law. In general, they experience the same human
 rights and worker rights practices as Moroccans in Morocco.
 There are reports that Sahrawi often have more difficulty
 obtaining passports, that their political views are more
 closely monitored than those of residents of Morocco proper,
 and that police and paramilitary authorities react especially
 harshly against those suspected of supporting the Polisario.
 The Moroccan Government denies such charges and counters with
 allegations of Polisario human rights abuses. Since there has
 been no opportunity to evaluate the human rights practices of
 the Polisario in areas of the Western Sahara outside of the
 Moroccan Berm, the earthwork defense line which runs along the
 eastern and southern borders of the Moroccan-occupied area,
 these allegations cannot be confirmed or refuted.
 Freedom of movement within the Western Sahara is limited in
 militarily sensitive areas, but is otherwise unrestricted, as
 is travel to Morocco. There are frequent commercial flights
 and buses between the Western Sahara and Casablanca,
 Marrakech, and other Moroccan cities. In 1989 and 1990 there
 were highly publicized defections to Morocco of Polisario
 officials, who were accorded warm welcomes in Morocco and, in
 several cases, positions in the Moroccan Government.
 The same labor laws that apply in Morocco apply in the
 Moroccan-controlled areas of the Western Sahara, and
 enforcement is equivalent to that in Morocco proper.
 Within the Western Sahara there is little organized labor
 activity. Since salaries in both private and public sectors
 are significantly higher than those in Morocco, wage demands
 are not an issue. Unemployment is also not a problem because
 of the Government's investment in the region and a program of
 taking young people out of the region to work in Morocco.
 This program reportedly eliminated youth unemployment, but the
 Polisario launched an international human rights campaign
 accusing Morocco of abducting youth for use as forced labor.
 This accusation appears groundless.
 Outside the territory controlled by Morocco, the Polisario has
 established a labor wing called the Sario Federation of Labor
 (UGTSARIO), which reportedly enjoys close relations with a few
 Arab and African national labor centers. UGTSARIO does not
 engage in customary trade union activities in the
 Polisario-controlled areas.
