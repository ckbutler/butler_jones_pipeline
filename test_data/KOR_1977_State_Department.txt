 REPUBLIC OF KOREA
 The division of the Korean peninsula and the continuing
 hostility of North Korea toward the South are pervasive
 factors in South Korea's existence.
 President Park Chung Hee led a bloodless military coup
 in 1961. He was elected President in 1963. After he
 declared martial law in 1972, the constitution was
 substantially revised to concentrate power into the
 hands of the executive.
 South Korea has emerged as a mid-level economic power
 following several years of impressive economic growth.
 The Republic of Korea receives U.S. security support
 which we provide due to U.S. strategic interests in
 Northeast Asia.
 As 1977 drew to a close, the Korean Government announ-
 ced several significant releases of political prisoners
 on December 25 and on December 31. One well-known
 prisoner, Kim Tae-chung, was moved from prison to
 hospital.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The Amnesty International Mission to Korea in early
 1975 reported numerous credible cases of torture
 during the years 1971-74. Additional reports of
 torture during 1975 have been cited by Amnesty and
 the International League for Human Rights. There
 were few allegations in 1976 of torture. However,
 during the past year, retired general and national
 assemblyman Kang Mun-pong stated in court that he
 had been tortured during interrogation about income
 tax evasion. Although excesses cannot be ruled out
 in isolated cases, especially those involving accused
 espionage agents, we do not believe that torture is
 now regularly employed in South Korea.
 b. Cruel,Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Persons suspected of distributing anti-government
 charters or organizing student demonstrations have
 (246)
 
 
 sometimes been beaten or threatened with physical
 abuse. These incidents have usually occured imme-
 diately after apprehension during the interrogation
 period. Within prison, the physical conditions for
 political prisoners are considered now to be better
 than those for common criminals, partly because the
 two groups are now separated. This contrasts favor-
 ably with the Amnesty International report in early
 1975 and our information that political prisoners
 were singled out for especially harsh treatment at
 that time. Amnesty's 1977 report cites cases of
 individuals held in solitary confinement and denied
 medical attention. However, the Embassy has been
 unable to substantiate allegations that medical
 treatment was denied to any prisoners mentioned in
 the Amnesty report. Recently, Kim Tae-chung, former
 opposition presidential candidate imprisoned since
 1976, was transferred from jail to a hospital to
 receive medical treatment. There have been some
 instances of solitary confinement.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The Korean Government uses "Emergency Measures" autho-
 rity to effect arrest, detention, search or seizure
 without warrant. Those measures conflict with inter-
 national standards with respect to civil and political
 liberties. Short temporary detention for questioning
 is used to prevent political activists from carrying
 out demonstrations or in the hope of halting other
 anti-government political activities. The 1977 Amnesty
 report states that arbitrary arrest and harassment has
 been used against opposition political and religious
 leaders, teachers, journalists and trade union leaders.
 Although large numbers of individuals have been appre-
 hended following demonstrations or other incidents in
 the past, extended imprisonment has occurred only in
 connection with formal charges and trial for violations
 of specific laws or emergency decrees. As of late
 December 1977 we estimate that. fewer than 150 persons
 remained in prison under Korean emergency measures.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are public. There have been credible reports
 of executive branch pressure on judges in some trials
 
 
 of a political nature, and of harassment of legal
 counsel and witnesses for the defense in politically
 sensitive trials. Under 1974 Emergency Measures
 (now rescinded) trials were by special military
 court and were not public. Eight alleged members of
 the "People's Revolutionary Party" were tried and
 convicted under those measures and were hanged on
 April 9, 1975, the day after the Supreme Court upheld
 their death sentences. Amnesty International concluded
 that the charges in the People's Revolutionary Party
 case were "fabricated" and that the case was prosecuted
 in such a manner as to raise serious doubts as to
 whether or not those charged received a fair trial.
 The U.S. Government has never had sufficient evidence
 to make an.independent judgment on the merits of the
 Al conclusions.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Police and security officials may enter and search
 the homes of suspects without warrant under the
 provisions of an emergency decree. There are sporadic
 reports of this authority being used in connection
 with cases of political dissenters.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 The cornerstone of the Korean Government's popular
 support has been its economic performance, both in
 stimulating growth and in providing access to the
 increased wealth by most elements of the society.
 Per capita GNP has grown from less than $200 in 1968
 to more than $800 in 1977, and the World Bank has
 praised the success of the Koreans in maintaining a
 relatively egalitarian pattern of income distribution,
 providing widespread and useful educational opportuni-
 ties, and making available productive employment for
 a growing labor force (at the same time reducing the
 population growth rate). Much remains to be done, and
 public health care, vocational education, labor relations
 and industrial safety are priority items for the next
 five-year economic plan. Real income has been rising
 in the economy as a whole.
 
 
 249
 South Korea is exceptional among developing countries
 in its lack of class distinctions., rapid social mobility,
 use of a merit system in determining access to higher
 education, and efforts to reduce the disparity between
 rural and urban incomes.
 The government has conducted an intense campaign which
 has virtually eliminated low-level corruption and
 significantly reduced it at the higher levels. During
 1977 the opposition New Democratic Party conducted a
 major campaign to expose alleged corruption within
 the government. President Park has responded with
 strong admonitions to his cabinet to enforce discipline
 and honesty, and has supported the publication in the
 press of the names of corrupt public officials.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 At the heart of the human rights problems in Korea
 is the restriction of political liberties. The 1972
 Yushin Constitution does not provide for the direct
 election of the president, and constitutional reform
 is the focus of anti-government critics who charge
 that the constitution was rammed through the assembly
 illegally. Emergency Measure No. 9 (EM-9), promulgated
 March 13, 1975,in accord with the emergency provision
 of the constitution, prohibits specified political
 activities, including calls for constitutional revision
 and criticism of the emergency measure itself, any
 political activities by students, and the reporting
 of activities prohibited under the emergency measure
 as well as the spreading of "false rumors."
 In addition, the Korean National Assembly passed laws
 in 1975 making it a criminal offense to criticize the
 government to foreigners and providing for political
 surveillance, limitations on residence, and possible
 preventive detention for former "anti-state" prisoners.
 We believe that more than 500 individuals have been
 charged at one time or another for violation of the
 currently enforced EM-9.
 
 
 In 1976 the courts concluded two especially important
 trials which dramatically enforced the Emergency Measure
 No. 9 restrictions on political expression. The Myong-
 dong Declaration case, in which a number of prominent
 political and religious personalities issued a strong
 criticism of the regime on March 1, 1976, ended in
 sentences of up to five years for some of the accused
 for political activities prohibited under EM-9. The
 courts also sentenced poet Kim Chi-ha to seven years
 for violating the Anti-Communist Law (although Kim was
 already serving a life term for a previous emergency
 measure conviction). While some criticism of court
 procedures may be valid, due process under Korean law
 was observed. Nevertheless, the trial and conviction
 of individuals on these charges brought under the
 Emergency Measure were      adverse developments for
 the freedom of political expression in the Republic of
 Korea.
 Since early 1977, the government has for the most part
 avoided court trials, formal arrest, or long-term
 detention. Instead, in the face of potential challenge --
 especially from the students -- security forces have
 stepped up surveillance to frustrate efforts to mount
 significant demonstrations and undertake other political
 activities. However, some arrests continue to take
 place.
 The most recent signs of possible relaxation include
 a resolution passed by the Government controlled
 National Assembly on July 6 requesting that Emergency
 Measures be lifted and leniency be shown to the Emer-
 gency Measure prisoners. This was followed by the
 parole of 14 EM-9 prisoners on July 17 and 17 more
 on August 15 who were released after signing" a care-
 fully worded statement of regret, the text of which
 had been negotiated between the Korean Government and
 Korean human rights and church leaders. In October
 1977, the government entered into unprecedented direct
 discussions with leading dissidents in an effort to
 work out a plan for release of most EM-9 prisoners.
 As 1977 drew to a close, prisoner releases took a sig-
 nificant step forward. Eleven EM-9 violators, including
 one Myongdong defendant, were released from prison on
 Christmas Day. On December 31, the ROKG released the
 
 
 251
 five Myongdong defendants who were still in prison.
 The only Myongdong defendant who remained in custody
 was former presidential candidate Kim Tae-chung.
 Kim had been moved from prison to Seoul National
 University Hospital December 19 for medical treatment.
 Within the past six months, the press, although still
 under significant restraints, has expanded considerably
 the dimensions of its discussion of controversial
 issues, including fuller reporting of national assembly
 debates and forthright coverage of U.S. congressional
 hearings related to Korean influence-buying scandals
 and the subject of Mr. Tongsun Park.
 Religious activities are given wide latitude and no
 restrictions exist on proselytizing by any sect.
 Trade union organization is permitted, but unions may
 not strike. Collective bargaining contracts cover
 720,000 workers resulting in better wages and working
 conditions than their unorganized counterparts.
 Low wages and long working hours remain continuing
 problems particularly among smaller, marginal companies.
 Labor conditions among such companies have drawn sharp
 attacks from foreign and Korean social critics.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is freedom of movemeit within the country. There
 are some restrictions on foreign travel, for political,
 security and economic reasons. However, by 1980 the
 Korean Government hopes its foreign exchange position
 will permit tourism abroad. The Korean Government has
 a liberal emigration policy - e.g., more than 30,000
 Koreans emigrated to the U.S. in 1976.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There is universal suffrage for adults over 20. The
 only directly elected officials in Korea are two-thirds
 of the national assembly representatives. Most effective
 power is centralized in the Office of the President.
 He appoints one-third of the national assembly member-
 ship, the prime minister and cabinet, and may suspend
 individual rights by decree.
 
 
 252
 Since World War II, national assemblymen have generally
 had very high prestige in Korea. Following the intro-
 duction of the present Yushin Constitution in 1972,
 however, the public has correctly perceived the reduced
 influence and independence of the national assembly
 and the prestige of assemblymen has declined correspond-
 ingly. However, the 1977 assembly session witnessed a
 marked revival of active debate and criticism of
 government policies. Grass roots exchanges between
 the people and the bureaucracy take place through an
 extensive system of village councils and self-help
 projects.
 4.   Government Attitudes and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Korean Government has allowed a number of outside
 human rights groups to visit and interview opposition
 figures with few formal restrictions. Amnesty Inter-
 national sent a mission to Korea in early 1975.
 Newsmen also have freedom of movement within South
 Korea. The government has not allowed interviews
 with persons actually in prison, and investigating
 groups have complained that those whom they have met
 have sometimes been harassed and questioned by govern-
 ment officials.
