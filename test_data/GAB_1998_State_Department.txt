 GABON
 A one-party state until 1990, Gabon held its first multiparty elections in 1991,
 with President Omar Bongo's party retaining a large majority in the National As-
 sembly. President Bongo, in office since 1967, was reelected in 1993 in an election
 marred by serious irregularities. In October 1994, following several months of con-
 tention and civil unrest, political parties supporting the President and the principal
 opposition parties negotiated the 'Paris Accords." These agreements included prom-
 ises of reforms to amend electoral procedures, to include opposition leaders in gov-
 ernment, and to assure greater respect for human rights. These were approved by
 a national referendum in 1995. Opposition parties won disorganized municipal elec-
 tions in the capital in October and November 1997, while in December 1997 parties
 supporting the President won more than two-thirds of the seats in the National As-
 sembly in poorly run, fraudulent elections. Regional councils later elected 91 mem-
 bers of the national Senate, more than half of whom represent the President's party.
 In December President Bongo was reelected to a 7-year term with almost two-thirds
 of the vote in an election marked by organizational deficiencies and irregularities
 that included incomplete and inaccurate electoral lists and the use of false docu-
 ments to cast votes. Although an independent election commission originally was to
 be responsible for the voting under a pact signed with opposition parties to ensure
 fairness, in July the Government passed a law that transferred key election func-
 tions from the commission to the Interior Ministry. Opposition parties alleged wide-
 spread fraud and called for the annulment of the election. The judiciary is independ-
 ent but remains vulnerable to government manipulation.
 The national police and the gendarmerie enforce the law and maintain public se-
 curity. In conformity with the Paris Accords, the National Assembly reassigned au-
 
 
 thority over these security forces from the Ministry of Defense to the Ministry of
 Interior and redesignated them the 'Republican Guard," an elite, heavily armed
 corps that protects the President. In 1994 the Defense Minister used this corps for
 violent repression of public dissent; there have been no reported incidents since that
 time. Members of the security forces sometimes beat persons in custody.
 The Government generally adheres to free market principles, particularly in the
 export sector, in which trade is dominated by petroleum, timber, and minerals. A
 majority of workers in the formal sector are employed- by the Government or by
 large, inefficient, state-owned organizations, although the country is making
 progress toward its privatization goals. In 1998 lower than anticipated oil prices,
 along with a substantial decline in timber exports to Asia, necessitated major revi-
 sions of budget estimates. Per capita income is approximately $4,600 annually, and
 income distribution is badly skewed in favor of urban dwellers and a small economic
 elite. Immigrants from other African countries dominate the informal sector. The
 rural population is poor and receives few social services. Financial mismanagement
 and corruption have resulted in significant arrears in domestic and external debt.
 Although the Government continued to meet most of its structural adjustment per-
 formance goals, shrinking revenues were expected to hinder its efforts.
 The Government generally respected the rights of its citizens in some areas; how-
 ever, longstanding human rights abuses continued. The security forces beat and tor-
 tured prisoners and detainees, and prison conditions remained harsh and life threat-
 ening. The judiciary sometimes is subject to government influence, and there were
 allegations of government infringement on freedom of the press. Societal discrimina-
 tion and violence against women and exploitation of expatriate children as domestic
 and agricultural workers remained problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killing.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture or cruel and inhuman punishment. However, se-
 curity forces often beat or physically mistreat prisoners and detainees as punish-
 ment and to exact confessions.
 Conditions in most prisons are abysmal and life threatening. Sanitation and ven-
 tilation are poor, and medical care is almost nonexistent. Prisons provide inad-
 equate food for inmates. There were no known visits by human rights monitors to
 prisons during the year.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law provides for up to 48 hours of
 initial preventive detention, during which time police must charge a detainee before
 a judge. In practice, however, police rarely respect this provision. Bail may be set
 if there is to be a further investigation. Pretrial detainees have the right to free ac-
 cess to their attorneys, and this right is respected in practice. Detainees have the
 right to an expeditions trial, as defined by the law. Pretrial detention is limited to
 6 months for a misdemeanor and to 1 year for a felony charge. These periods may
 be extended for 6 months by the examining magistrate. The Attorney General's of-
 fice estimates that roughly 40 percent of persons in custody are pretrial detainees.
 On October 16, immigration police arrested and detained three Togolese non-
 governmental organization (NGO) workers who were in Gabon to monitor the
 preelection process. The authorities deported them the next day. The Government
 claimed that the incident was a case of mistaken identity and stated that represent-
 atives of the NGO could return.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary; however, while the judiciary is generally independent in principle, it remains
 vulnerable to government manipulation.
 The judicial system includes the regular courts, a military tribunal, and a civilian
 State Security Court. The regular court system includes trial courts, appellate
 courts, and the Supreme Court. The Constitutional Court is a separate body charged
 with examining constitutional questions, including the certification of elections.
 There are no traditional or customary courts. In some areas, minor disputes may
 be taken to a local chief, but the Government does not recognize such decisions. The
 State Security Court, last convened in 1990, is constituted by the Government as
 required to consider matters of state security.
 The Constitution provides for the right to a public trial and the right to legal
 counsel. These rights are generally respected in criminal cases. Nevertheless, proce-
 
 
 dural safeguards are lacking, particularly in state security trials. The law applies
 the concept of presumed guilt. A judge may thus deliver an immediate verdict at
 the initial hearing if sufficient evidence is presented by the State.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for protection from surveillance, from searches without war-
 rant, and from interference with private telecommunications or correspondence. As
 part of criminal investigations, police may request search warrants from judges,
 which they obtan easily, sometimes after the fact. The Government has used them
 in the past to gan access to the homes of opposition figures and their families. Gov-
 ernment authorities also routinely monitor private telephone conversations, per-
 sonal mail, and the movements of citizens.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press and, although citizens generally speak freely and criticize leaders,
 there were instances when the Government allegedly infringed on press freedom.
 Legislators in the National Assembly openy criticize government policies, ministers,
 and other officials.
 The only daily newspaper is the government-owned L'nion, but there are more
 than a half-dozen weekly or periodical publications in newspaper format, represent-
 ing independent views and those of various poltical parties. All-including
 L'Union-actively criticie the Government and political leaders of all parties. Most
 also criticize the President.
 In January authorities accused an opposition newspaper, the Lumberjack, of in-
 sulting President Bongo and suspended its publication for 1 month. The newspaper's
 director was given a 4-month suspended sentence and a caricaturist received a 6-
 month sentence.
 In August police arrested and charged three journalists with defamation, in sepa-
 rate cases, against the Minister of Communication, who filed one of the complaints,
 and the chief executive officer of state-owned Air Gabon. Courts sentenced the three
 journalists to fines and sentences ranging from 1 month to 8 months. It closed an
 opposition newspaper, La Griffe. Although the National Communication Council
 (NC) maintained that the newspaper closure was outside the Communication Min-
 istrys competence, a decision to reopen La Griffe had not been made by year's end.
 Journalists staged two demonstrations to protest the incarceration of their col-
 leagues. The local journalist association, union organizations, and the political oppo-
 sition criticized the Government over the sentences, and claimed that they con-
 stituted an effort by President Bongo to muzzle or control the media prior to the
 December presidential election. Two of the journalists and left the country and
 failed to appear in court. According to opposition sources, the journalists fled to
 avoid persecution; the Government maintains that the journalists are fugitives.
 The Government controls the national electronic media, which reach all areas of
 the country. Four private radio stations have been licensed. A fifth station hre-
 viously operating under a temporary license closed for financial reasons. Journalists
 are subject to an extensive code of rights and responsibilities approved by the Na-
 tional Assembly in 1995.
 The Government does not inteere with broadcasts of international radio stations
 Radio France 1, Africa No. 1, or the Voice of America. Foreign newspapers and mag-
 azines are widely available.
 There are no restrictio  ons academic freedom, including research.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.--Citizens and recognized orga-
 nizations normally enjoy freedom of assembly and association, which are provided
 for by the Constitution. Groups must obtain permits for public gatherings in ad-
 vance, and the Government usually grants them.
 c. Freedom of Religion.The Constitution provides for religious freedom, and au-
 thorities do not engage in religios persecution or favoritism. There is no state reli-
 gon. While the Government has not lifted its ban on Jehovah's Witeses, neither
 has it enforced this ban.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Enigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights. There are no legally man-
 dated restrictions on internal movement. Police and gendarmes frequently stop trav-
 elers to check identity, residence, or registration documents, and members of the se-
 curity forces regularly harassed expatriate Africans working legally as merchants,
 service sector employees, and manual laborers. They extorted bribes and demanded
 services with the threat of confiscation of residence documents or imprisonment.
 Residence permits cost up to $,000. In October authorities expelled three foreign
 
 
 163
 NGO workers from the country, but later stated that the NGO could again send rep-
 resentatives (see Section 1.d.).
 An unevenly enforced law requires married women to have their husbands' per-
 mission to travel abroad. An exit visa is no longer required for citizens to travel
 abroad. Aliens resident in the country must obtain a visa in order to leave and re-
 turn.
 The Government strictly controls the process of refugee adjudication. Coordination
 with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is generally
 adequate. In 1997 the Government failed to respond to international protests over
 the treatment of refugees from Equatorial Guinea during the year.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The 1991 Constitution explicitly provides this right, but mismanagement and seri-
 ous irregularities in both the 1990 and 1996 legislative elections and the 1993 and
 1998 presidential elections called into serious doubt the extent to which this right
 exists in practice.
 In a July 1995 constitutional referendum, citizens approved by a 96 percent ma-
 jority reforms previously ageed upon in the Paris Accords, including most signifi-
 cantly the establishment of an independent National Electoral Commission (NEC).
 The referendum was carried out under arrangements that assured that all political
 parties could monitor voting and vote counting.
 National Assembly, Senate, and municipal elections were held in late 1996, after
 a series of postponements due to both legislative inaction and requests by the NEC
 for additional time. Delays in registering voters and organizing elections were at-
 tributed by all sides to logistical rather than political obstacles.
 Local elections held in 1996 were poorly organized and were later repeated in key
 districts. In both rounds, opposition parties won most of the municipal council seats
 in the capital, Libreville. This outcome was reversed in the official results of poorly
 run legislative elections held in December 1996, in which parties supporting the
 President won more than 80 of the 120 National Assembly seats, including 8 of the
 10 seats representing the capital. The military and NEC magistrates fraudulently
 ensured victory for parties supporting the President by arbitrarily altering vote
 counts, particularly in the capital. In early 1997, municipal and regional leaders
 elected 91 members to the new national Senate without controversy. There are no
 restrictions on the participation of women and minorities in politics. There are 6
 women among the 120 National Assembly representatives, 9 of 91 members of the
 Senate are women, and there is 1 woman in the Cabinet. Women serve at all levels
 within the various ministries, the judiciary, and the opposition. Despite govern-
 mental protections, indigenous Pygmies rarely participate in the political process,
 and the Government has made onl marginaefforts to include them (see Section
 5).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government officially allows the existence of independent human rights
 groups. There are two human rights groups, neither of which was active.
 In October authorities arrested, detained, and expelled from the country three for-
 eign NGO workers; however, the Government later stated that the NGO could again
 send representatives (see Section 1.d.).
 There have been no active inquiries from foreign groups in recent years.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution forbids discrimination based on national origin, race, gender, or
 opinion. The Government does not uniformly enforce these constitutional guarantees
 and tolerates a substantial degree of discrimination against women, especially in do-
 mestic affairs. It has also provided a lower level of health care and educational serv-
 ices to children of families of other African nationalities than it provided to citizens.
 Women.-Violence against women is common and is especially prevalent in rural
 areas. While medical authorities have not specifically identified rape to be a chronic
 problem, religious workers and hospital staff report that evidence of beatings of
 women is common. Police rarely intervene in such cases, and women virtually never
 file complaints with civil authorities. Only limited medical and legal assistance is
 available.
 The law provides that women have rights to equal access in education, business,
 and investment. Women own businesses and property, participate in politics, and
 work throughout the government and the private sector. Women nevertheless con-
 tinue to face considerable societal and legal discrimination, especially in rural areas.
 
 
 164
 By law couples must stipulate at the time of marriage whether they will adhere
 to a monogamous or a polygynous relationship. For monogamous married couples,
 a common property law provides for the equal distribution of assets after divorce.
 Wives who leave polygynous husbands suffer severe reductions in their property
 rights. In inheritance cases, the husband's family must issue a written authorization
 before his widow can inherit property. Common law marriage, which is socially ac-
 cepted and widely practiced, affords a woman no property rights.
 The law still requires that a woman obtain her husband's permission to travel
 abroad; however, this requirement is not consistently enforced.
 Children.-The Government has used oil revenue to build schools, to pay ade-
 quate teacher salaries, and to promote education, even in rural areas. The country
 has a relatively high infant mortality rate, and not all children have access to vac-
 cination. Traditional beliefs and practices provide numerous safeguards for children,
 but children remain the responsibility of the extended family-including aunts,
 grandmothers, and older siblings. There is little evidence of physical abuse of chil-
 dren. Protection for children's rights is not codified in law.
 There is concern about the problems facing the large community of children of Af-
 rican noncitizens. Almost all enjoy far less access to education and health care than
 do children of Gabonese, and are sometimes victims of child labor abuses (see Sec-
 tion 6.d.). Female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by inter-
 national health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, oc-
 curs among the resident population of expatriate Africans. There are no laws
 against FGM, but according to local women's groups, it is not practiced on Gabonese
 children.
 People With Disabilities.-There are no laws prohibiting discrimination against
 persons with disabilities, or providing for access to buildings or services.
 Indigenous People.-Several thousand indigenous Pygmies live in northeastern
 Gabon. In principle they enjoy the same civil rights as other citizens. Pygmies are
 largely independent of formal authority, keeping their own traditions, independent
 communities, and local decisionmaking structures. Pygmies did not participate in
 government-instituted programs that integrated many small rural villages into larg-
 er ones along major roads. As a result, their access to government-funded health
 and sanitation facilities was limited. There are no specific government programs or
 policies to assist or hinder Pygmies.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Persons from all major ethnic groups contin-
 ued to occupy prominent positions in government, in the military services, and in
 the private sector. Credible reports suggest, however, that ethnic favoritism in hir-
 ing and promotion is pervasive. There was evidence, especially within the armed
 forces, that members of the President's ethnic group held a disproportionately large
 share both of senior positions and ofjobs within the ranks.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution places no restrictions on the right
 of association and recognizes the right of citizens to form trade and labor unions.
 Virtually the entire formal private sector work force is unionized. Unions must reg-
 ister with the Government in order to be recognized officially. Public sector employ-
 ees may unionize although their right to strike is limited if it could jeopardize public
 safety. Until 1990 there was only one recognized labor organization, the Gabonese
 Labor Confederation (COSYGA), to which all unionized workers contributed a man-
 datory percentage of their salaries. In 1992 the Government accepted the establish-
 ment of independent unions and abolished the mandatory contribution to COSYGA.
 In 1994 the National Assembly passed an extensively revised version of the Labor
 Code, which was published and implemented in early 1995. The Code provides ex-
 tensive protection of worker rights.
 Strikes are legal if they are held after an 8-day notice advising that outside arbi-
 tration has failed. The Labor Code prohibits direct government action against indi-
 vidual strikers who abide by the arbitration and notification provisions. It also pro-
 vides that the Government cannot press charges against a group for criminal activi-
 ties committed by individuals. Unions and confederations are free to affliate with
 international labor bodies and participate in their activities. COSYGA is affiliated
 with the Organization of African Trade Union Unity, while the Gabonese Confed-
 eration of Free Unions (CGSL) is affiliated with the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions. Both COSYGA and CGSL have ties with numerous other inter-
 national labor organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code provides for
 collective bargaining. Labor and management meet to negotiate differences, and the
 Ministry of Labor provides an observer. This observer does not take an active part
 in negotiations over pay scales, working conditions, or benefits. Agreements also
 
 
 165
 apply to nonunion workers. While no laws specifically prohibit antiunion discrimina-
 tion, the court may require employers who are found guilty by civil courts of having
 engaged in such discrimination to compensate employees.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced labor,
 and there are no reports that it exists in the adult community. The Government also
 specifically prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, but does not enforce this
 prohibition effectively. As reported by UNICEF and other concerned organizations,
 immigrant children in particular are often found working as domestic or agricul-
 tural help.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Children
 below the age of 16 may not work without the express consent of the Ministries of
 Labor, Education, and Public Health. These ministries rigorously enforce this law
 with respect to Gabonese children, and there are few Gabonese under the age of 18
 working in the modern wage sector. A significant number of children work in mar-
 ketplaces or perform domestic duties. The U.N. Children's Fund and other con-
 cerned organizations have reported that government officials often privately use for-
 eign child labor, mainly as domestic or agricultural help. These children do not go
 to school, have only limited means of acquiring medical attention, and are often vic-
 tims of exploitation by employers or foster families. Laws forbidding child labor
 theoretically extend protection to foreign children as well, but abuses often are not
 reported. Education is compulsory until age 16.
 The Government prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, but does not en-
 force this prohibition effectively (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code governs working conditions
 and benefits for all sectors and provides a broad range of protection to workers. The
 Code stipulates a 40-hour workweek with a minimum rest period of 48 consecutive
 hours. Employers must compensate workers for overtime work. All companies in the
 modern wage sector pay competitive wages and grant generous fringe benefits re-
 quired by law, including maternity leave and 6 weeks of annual paid vacation.
 Traditionally, representatives of labor, management, and the Government met an-
 nually to examine economic and labor conditions and to recommend a minimum
 wage rate within government guidelines to the President, who then issued an an-
 nual decree. This procedure has not been followed since 1994, in part because the
 Government was pursuing a policy of wage austerity recommended by international
 financial institutions. The monthly minimum wage was kept at its 1994 level of
 about $110 (cfa 64,000). Wages provide a decent standard of living for a worker and
 family.
 The Ministry of Health has established occupational health and safety standards,
 but does not enforce or regulate them effectively. Application of labor standards var-
 ies greatly from company to company and between industries. The Government re-
 portedly does not enforce Labor Code provisions in sectors where the bulk of the
 labor force is non-Gabonese. Foreigners, both documented and undocumented, may
 be obliged to work under substandard conditions; may be dismissed without notice
 or recourse; or may be mistreated physically, especially in the case of illegal aliens.
 Employers frequently require longer hours of work from noncitizen Africans and pay
 them less, often hiring on a short-term, casual basis in order to avoid paying taxes,
 social security contributions, and other benefits. In the formal sector, workers may
 remove themselves from dangerous work situations without fear of retribution.
