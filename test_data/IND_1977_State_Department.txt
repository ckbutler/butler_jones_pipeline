 INDIA
 Human rights and democracy have been restored in India.
 The period of emergency rule, June 1975 - March 1977,
 included numerous reports of violations of basic rights
 connected with the arrest and detention of political
 prisoners as well as restrictions on many basic personal
 and civic freedoms. These policies and practices dis-
 appeared following the inauguration of the Desai govern-
 ment in March 1977 and the termination of emergency rule.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Unlike during the emergency period, there have-been no
 reports of torture since the inauguration of the Desai
 government in March 1977.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punish-
 ment
 Unlike during the emergency period, there have been no
 reports of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
 punishment since March 1977.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The government informed Parliament on November 23, 1977
 that the total number of detainees in jail under the
 Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA) was 403 as
 of November 12, compared to 6,851 on March 25, 1977.
 Of these, 388 were foreigners awaiting deportation from
 India. We have no information on the remaining 15. We
 believe the government's figures are accurate.
 The Indian Home Ministry reported in July 1977 that
 arrests under the Defense and Internal Security of India
 Rules (DISIR), also adopted to permit arbitrary detention,
 totalled 39,832 as of March 1977 covering all but seven
 states for which data were not available. The central
 government issued instructions that all cases under DISIR
 be dropped or withdrawn excepting those involving vio-
 lence and that persons undergoing sentences were to be
 released subject to the same exception.

 A government report tabled in Parliament on November
 16, 1977 noted that 297 persons were being detained,
 perhaps under DISIR, in 18 states and union territories.
 Under the Indian Constitution, the states are respon-
 sible for the administration of police powers.
 The government promised a report on the exact status
 of Naxalites, members of an extremist revolutionary
 group accused of violent activities, principally in
 West Bengal, beginning in the late 1960s. A large
 number of Naxalites, some estimates ranging as high as
 10,000, were under detention by the state governments
 up to March 1977. Although precise numbers are lacking,
 the great majority appear to have been released in March-
 April following a recommendation to that effect to the
 states from the new government. However, an undetermined
 number of Naxalites face criminal charges such as arson
 and murder.
 The government has also stated that it will table data
 on the detention of members of the Anardz. Marga, a
 religious organization which the Indian authorities have
 accused of violent activities. Currently 17 Ananda Mar-
 gis are known to have been convicted of or charged with
 criminal offenses.
 Although the emergency has been lifted, laws which permit
 preventive detention with certain legal safeguards remain
 on the books. There have been no cases in which the new
 government has invoked these powers. Legislation is ex-
 pected in early 1978 revoking or amending present deten-
 tion laws.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Since the lifting of the state of emergency there have
 been effective legal safeguards for insuring fair and
 public trials to those charged with any category of
 offense under the law.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Since March 1977, there have been effective legal safe-
 guards against arbitrary invasion of the home.

 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education.
 The Desai government has made a commitment to increasing
 rural income levels through increased investment in
 rural infrastructure and in the development and expan-
 sion of small industries. It has pledged to eliminate
 destitution in ten years. Janata Party proposals specify
 that at least 40 percent of development funds be allotted
 to the agricultural sector. If realized, such an allo-
 cation will stand in sharp contrast-with the 12-15 per-
 cent share previously reserved by the Five Year Plans for
 agricultural programs. Nonetheless, there will be nu-
 merous practical difficulties to overcome, including in-
 sufficient state funds for implementation of ancillary
 programs, the absence of enthusiasm in most states for
 land reform and the lack of agricultural credit to help
 the rural poor.
 The government announced in an April 28 policy statement
 that it intends to mount an integrated family welfaxe
 program which will include population planning, nutrition,
 clothing, shelter, education and women's welfare. The
 goal is to promote total welfare of the family and the
 community. Although not specifically addressed to the
 condition of poor and rural women, such a program could
 help improve their condition. Women often have received
 less official attention and fewer welfare resources in
 *the past than men. With respect to family planning, the
 government stated there will be no compulsion, coercion,
 or pressure of any sort; the approach is to be education-
 al and wholly voluntary.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 There is full freedom of thought, speech, press, religion,
 and assembly in India. There are no restrictions on the
 activities of trade unions.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration

 There is full freedom of movement within India for all
 citizens regardless of ethnic or religious background,
 except for a longstanding requirement of permits to enter
 sensitive tribal border areas. There is also freedom of
 foreign travel and emigration. The passports of a
 limited number of people associated with the previous
 government have been impounded in connection with the in-
 vestigation of alleged criminal cases. The Desai admin-
 istration has said that the process of passport issuance
 is to be simplified and expedited to facilitate travel.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Democracy has been fully restored in India under the
 Desai government.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Viola-
 tions of Human Rights
 There have been no international investigations of human
 rights conditions in India since the termination of the
 emergency in March 1977. However, it is likely that the
 present government would cooperate fully with such efforts
 should aspects of the Indian human rights record come into
 question. It has appointed its own commissions to inves-
 tigate offenses committed under the emergency. Recent
 charges of attacks on untouchables (known as Harijans)
 in rural areas of Bihar State were followed by the appoint-
 ment of a commission of inquiry. The efforts of the un-
 official Tahkunde Commission, headed by a retired Justice
 of the Supreme Court, to investigate the state of civil
 and human rights under the emergency have been strongly
 endorsed by prominent members of the government, including
 Prime Minister Desai.
