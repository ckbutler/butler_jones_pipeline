 BARBADOS
 Barbados is a constitutional democracy with a multiparty, parliamentary form of
 government and is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. The Queen is head
 of state and is represented by an appointed Governor General. Prime Minister Owen
 Arthur is the head of government and governs with an appointed cabinet. The judi-
 ciary is independent.
 The Royal Barbados Police Force is charged with maintaining public order. The
 small volunteer Barbados Defence Force (BDF), responsible for national security,
 can be employed to maintain public order in times of crisis, emergency, or other spe-
 cific need. In response to increased crime in tourist areas, the BDF has assisted the
 police since 1993 by patrolling beaches. On the wholepolice olice respected constitu-
 tional and legal provisions protecting human rights, but there continued to be infre-
 quent reports of abuses by police.
 The economy is based on tourism, services, light manufacturing, and agriculture,
 which makes it vulnerable to external economic developments. Per capita gross do-
 mestic product (GDP) was about $8,200. The coun  has experienced a continued
 strong recovery after a recession in the early 1990's. In 1997 estimated GDP growth
 was 3 percent, and in 1998 the economy was expected to grow approximately 2.5
 percent.
 Citizens enjoy a wide range of rights and freedoms, and the Government respects
 constitutional provisions regarding human rights. Principal human rights problems
 continued to be occasional instances of excessive use of force by police and societal
 violence against women and children.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution specifically prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment. However, the local press reported numerous allegations
 of coerced confessions. There continued to be credible reports that law enforcement
 officials sometimes used force during detention to extract confessions from detain-
 ees. Following a report in May 1997 that police abducted a homeless carwasher,
 took him to a field, and shot him in the back, the authorities suspended four officers
 and brought charges against two of them. The criminal case was heard in December,
 and the court upheld no-case submissions from the defendants' attorneys. The court
 cleared both officers of all charges on the grounds of insufficient evidence.
 In February two youths were rushed unconscious to the hospital after being held
 in choke holds during a police raid. In June another youth was shot in the shoulder
 during another alleged raid. The police investigated both cases and submitted re-
 ports to the Director of Public Prosecutions. At year's end, the police awaited the
 prosecutor's decision regarding further action.

 In December the police took two foreign citizens into custody for questioning in
 connection with a bank burglary. Both individuals were in good health when the o-
 lice picked them up, according to eyewitnesses. However, 2 days later, the police
 took both men to the local hospital following complaints of abdominal pain. One
 man suffered severe injury to his abdomen, liver, and colon and had to undergo ex-
 tensive emergency surgery for life-threatening internal bleeding. Doctors treated the
 second man for injuries to the abdomen and groin. Both men asserted that they
 were beaten while in police custody. They were allegedly taken to separate rooms,
 where their heads were covered and hands taped,, and they were each forced to lie
 down on a desk while five to six men beat them with blunt instruments. The au-
 thorities charged neither person with a crime. At year's end, the case was under
 investigation by the Criminal Investigation Department within the police.
 The majority of complaints against the police fall into the categories of unpro-
 fessional conduct and beating or assault. While an Ombudsman's office has been es-
 tablished to hear general complaints against the Government, there is no com-
 plaints board for the police. However, in June the Attorney General introduced in
 Parliament an amendment to the Police Act to set up an independent Police Com-
 plaints Authority (PCA). No action had been taken on the amendment by year's end.
 Poice procedures provide that the poice may question suspects and other persons
 they holdonly at apolice station, except when expressly permitted by a senior divi-
 sional officer. An officer must visit detainees at least once every 3 hours to inquire
 about the detainees' condition. After 24 hours, the detaining authority must submit
 a written report to the deputy commissioner. The authorities must approve and
 record all movements of detainees between stations. The authorities generally ad-
 here to these basic principles, although officials occasionally used excessive force.
 The authorities issued firearms -to special units and some foot patrols in high-
 crime areas in response to the 1993 shooting death of a policeman and a rise in gun-
 and dg-related crime. Aside from this development, the police force is still mainly
 unarmed, in keeping with its British traditions.
 The only prison is antiquated and overcrowded, with over 800 inmates in a struc-
 ture built for 350 inmates. The Caribbean Human Rights Network has called for
 reform of the penal system and advocates the development of alternatives to impris-
 onment such as community service to alleviate the problem of severe overcrowding
 in prisons. According to Penal Reform International, a London-based nongovern-
 mental organization (NGO), the Government is preparing to introduce several alter-
 native noncustodial sentencing options.
 The Government allows private groups to visit prisons to ascertain conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitra  ar-
 rest and imprisonment and requires detainees to be brought before a court of law
 within 72 hours of arrest. The Government generally respects these provisions in
 practice. Criminal defendants have the right to counsel, and attorneys have ready
 access to their clients.
 The authorities do not use exile as a punishment or means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair _Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and it is free of intervention by other branches of government.
 The judiciary includes the Supreme Court, which consists of the high court and
 court of appeal. The Governor General, after consultation with the Prime Minister
 and the Leader of the Opposition, appoints the Chief Justice. Other judges who
 make up the court are appointed on the advice of the Judicial and Legal Service
 Commission. Judges serve until the age of 65.
 The Constitution provides that persons charged with criminal offenses be given
 a fair public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial
 court, and the Government respects this right in practice. The judicial system pro-
 vides for the right of due process at each level. The law presumes defendants inno-
 cent until proven guilty. The Government provides free legal aid to the indigent
 with the exception of a 1,300 pounds sterling cap on expenses incurred for appeals
 by death row prisoners to the Privy Council in London. Two inmates have chal-
 lenged this limit and are suing the Government on the grounds that it effectively
 deprives them of their right to due process.
 There were no-reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search, or seizure, and the law requires war-
 rants to be issued before privately owned property may be entered and searched.
 The Government does not routinely interfere in the private lives of its citizens.
 Nonetheless, there continued to be credible reports that, in response to increased
 drug-related crime, the police resorted to searches of homes in certain neighbor-
 hoods, sometimes without warrants. The Government does not censor mail. How-
 ever, the Government restricts the receipt of foreign publications deemed to be por-
 
 
 nographic. Other foreign publications of a nonprurient nature are allowed without
 -restriction.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the authorities respect these rights in practice. There are two
 independent daily newspapers, both of which present opposition political views. The
 Government regularly comes under attack in the newspapers and on daily call-in
 radio programs. There are six radio stations, two of which are owned by the Govern-
 ment. The Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) television service (the only
 television source, excluding direct satellite reception) is government owned. Al-
 though CBC is a state enterprise, it regularly reported views opposing government
 policies. Critics allege that the Government sometimes uses its influence to discour-
 age media reporting on sensitive issues, but the press remained vigorously critical
 of the Government on a broad span of issues. The Government prohibits the produc-
 tion of pornographic materials.
 The Government does not restrict academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government observes the
 constitutional provisions for peaceful assembly and private association in practice.
 Political parties, trade unions, and private organizations function and hold meetings
 and rallies without hindrance.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens and legal residents move freely within Barbados and leave and
 enter the country without restriction.
 The Government has not formulated a policy regarding refugees, asylees, or first
 asylum. The issue of the provision of first asylum did not arise. There were no re-
 ports of forced expulsion of anyone having a valid claim to refugee status. However,
 government practice remains undefined.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have this right in law and exercise it in practice. Political parties freely
 compete in fair elections by secret ballot at least every 5 years. In the most recent
 election in September 1994, the Barbados Labour Party won a decisive victory, gain-
 ing a 19-to-8 majority over the Democratic Labour Party. The National Democratic
 Party won one seat, its first ever in Parliament. The next general elections are
 scheduled to be held on January 20, 1999. There are no impediments to participa-
 tion in the political process, and all citizens over age 18 may vote. The Prime Min-
 ister exercises executive power along with the Cabinet of Ministers he appoints, bal-
 anced by the bicameral Parliament and the judicial system.
 Women are well represented at all levels of government and politics. The Deputy
 Prime Minister is a woman (she also serves concurrently as Foreign Minister), and
 the Ministries of Health and Education are also headed by women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local groups involved with human rights operate freely and without government
 hindrance. The Caribbean Human Rights Network, a Caribbean-wide human rights
 organization which has its headquarters and a small staff in Barbados, investigates
 and reports on allegations of human rights violations throughout the region.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equal treatment under the law, regardless of race,
 religion, or sex. The Government respects these rights in practice.
 Wuomen.-Violence and abuse against women continued to be significant social
 problems. Women's rights groups reported that the known incidence of sexual as-
 saults, domestic violence, incest, and rape increased, despite the fact that there is
 still some reluctance on the part of victims to report such incidents. There are public
 and private counseling services for domestic violence, rape, suicide, and child abuse.
 The 1992 Domestic Violence Law specifies the appropriate police response to do-
 mestic violence, intended to protect all members of the family, including men and
 children. It applies equally to marriages and to common law relationships. Criminal
 penalties for violent crimes are the same, regardless of the sex of the offender or
 the victim. The courts heard a number of cases of domestic violence against women
 involving assault or wounding. Victims may request restraining orders, which the
 courts often issue. The courts can sentence an offender to jail for breaching such
 
 
 500
 an order. Human rights monitors continued to criticize the inconsistency in sentenc-
 ing for rape, incest, and statutory rape, which is often left to the discretion of the
 judge. They noted that the lack of sentencing guidelines resulted in longer sentences
 for persons convicted of petty theft than for incest; and lesser sentences for incest
 than for rape or sexual assault of nonfamily members.
 Women actively participate in all aspects of national life and are well-represented
 at all levels of both the public and private sectors. They form a large percentage
 of heads of household and are not discriminated against in public housing or other
 social welfare programs. The National Organization of Women (NOW) is an affiliate
 of a regional women's organization called the Caribbean Women's Association.
 The Business and Professional Women's club, an affiliate of the NOW, runs a cri-
 sis center staffed by 30 trained counselors and provides legal and medical referral
 services. The center also has a hot line for clients who wish to maintain their ano-
 nymity. The Government has allocated $190,000 for a new battered women's shelter
 to be opened in 1999 and run by the crisis center.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's human rights and welfare,
 although violence and abuse against children remain serious problems. The Child
 Care Board is the key agency responsible for monitoring and responding to the criti-
 cal welfare needs, interests, and rights of children. Statistics from the Child Care
 Board show that over 1,100 children suffered abuse in 1997-98, nearly 200 more
 than the previous year and the highest in the last 5 years.
 People With Disabilities.-In late 1997, the Ministry of Labor established the Dis-
 abilities Unit to address the concerns of the disabled, and in early 1998 it created
 an advisory committee on disabilities. However, the law does not prohibit discrimi-
 nation against the physically disabled in employment, education, or the provision
 of other state services. The Labor Department, a unit within the ministry that finds
 jobs for the disabled, has long advocated the introduction of such legislation. In May
 the Government, labor leaders, and the private sector jointly announced as part of
 their continuing social partnership an agreement to promote a code of practice on
 the employment of people with disabilities. They also agreed to establish targets and
 time frames for the employment of disabled persons in the private and public sec-
 tors.
 While there is no legislation mandating provision of accessibility to public thor-
 oughfares or public or private buildings, the Town and Country Planning Depart-
 ment has in place provisions for all public buildings to include accessibility to per-
 sons with disabilities. As a result, the majority of new buildings now have ramps,
 reserved parking, and special sanitary facilities for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers freely exercise their right to form and be-
 long to trade unions and to strike. There are two major unions and several smaller
 ones, representing various sectors. The public service union, the National Union of
 Public Workers, is independent of any political party or the Government. The larg-
 est union, the Barbados Workers' Union (BWU), was closely associated with the
 Barbados Labour Party prior to 1954. After 1954, officers of the BWU became per-
 sonally associated with the Democratic Labour Party. A new Congress of Trade
 Unions and Staff Associations was inaugurated in August 1995. Most unions belong
 to this organization.
 The law accords full protection to trade unionists' personal and property rights.
 Another law prohibits strikes against public utilities. All private and public sector
 employees are permitted to strike, but essential workers may strike only under cer-
 tain circumstances and after following prescribed procedures. There were no major
 strikes or long-term work stoppages during the year.
 Trade unions are free to form federations and are affiliated with a variety of re-
 gional and international labor organizations. The Caribbean Congress of Labor has
 its headquarters in Barbados.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for the right
 to organize and bargain collectively, and the authorities respected it in practice. De-
 spite recent modest increases in union membership, job losses in traditional sectors
 of the economy have reduced overall union membership to approximately 30 percent
 of the working population. Normally, wages and working conditions are negotiated
 through the collective bargaining process, but a tripartite prices and incomes policy
 accord signed in the summer of 1993 established a 2-year wage freeze. A revised
 (second) protocol contained provisions for negotiated increases in basic wages and
 increases based on productivity, which covered 1995-97. In May the tripartite part-
 ners signed a third protocol covering 1998-2000, broadened to address the needs of
 disabled workers and to express support for international efforts against child labor.

 Employers have no legal obligation to recognize unions under the Trade Union Act
 of 1964, but most do so when a significant percentage of their employees signify a
 desire to be represented by a registered union. While there is no specific law prohib-
 iting antiunion discrimination, the courts provide a method of redress for employees
 alleging unfair dismissal. The courts commonly award monetary compensation but
 rarely order reemployment.
 There are no manufacturing or special areas where collective bargaining rights
 are legally or administratively impaired. There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced,
 compulsory, or bonded labor, including that by children, and there were no reports
 of its use.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The legal
 minimum working age of 16 is broadly observed. Compulsory primary and secondary
 education policies, which require school attendance until age 16, reinforce minimum
 age requirements. The law prohibits forced or bonded labor by children, and the au-
 thorities effectively enforce it (see Section 6.c.). The Labor Department has a small
 cadre of labor inspectors who conduct spot investigations of enterprises and check
 records to verify compliance with the law. These inspectors may take legal action
 against an employer who is found to have underage workers.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law sets and the authorities establish min-
 imum wages for specified categories of workers. Only two categories of workers have
 a formally regulated minimum wage-household domestics and shop assistants
 (entry level commercial workers). Household domestics receive a minimum wage of
 about $0.75 (bds $1.50) per hour, although in actual labor market conditions, the
 prevailing wage is almost double that amount. There are two age-related minimum
 wage categories for shop assistants. The adult minimum wage for shop assistants
 was raised by 13 percent in June 1997, to $2.13 (bds $4.25) per hour;, the juvenile
 minimum wage for shop assistants is $1.62 (bds $3.25) per hour.
 The minimum wage for shop assistants is marginally sufficient to meet minimum
 living standards; most employees earn more. In 1992 an International Labor Orga-
 nization (ILO) Committee of Experts (COE) cited Barbados for not adhering to the
 ILO convention on equal remuneration in its wage differentials in the sugar indus-
 try. The COE admonished the Government to ensure application of the principle of
 equal remuneration for work of equal value to male and female workers in the sugar
 industry or to provide further information on job descriptions that might justify
 such wage distinction. The Labor Department reported that this issue was resolved
 after discussions late in the year among unions, employers' representatives, and
 ministry officials.
 The standard legal workweek is 40 hours in 5 days, and the law requires overtime
 payment for hours worked in excess. Barbados accepts ILO conventions, standards,
 and other sectoral conventions regarding maximum hours of work. However, there
 is no general legislation that covers all occupations. Employers must provide work-
 er a minimum of 3 weeks' annual leave. Unemployment benefits and national in-
 surance (social security) cover all workers. A comprehensive, government-sponsored
 health program offers subsidized treatment and medication.
 The Factories Act of 1983 sets out the officially recognized occupational safety and
 health standards. The Labor Department enforces health and safety standards and
 follows up to ensure that problems cited are corrected by management. The Fac-
 tories Act also requires that in certain sectors firms employing more than 50 work-
 ers set up a safety committee. This committee can challenge the decisions of man-
 agement concerning the occupational safety and health environment. Trade unions
 have called on the Government to increase the number of factory inspectors in order
 to enforce existing and proposed safety and health legislation more effectively, and
 to follow up to ensure that problems cited are corrected by management Govern-
 ment-operated corporations in particular were accused of doing a "poor job" in
 health and safety. The Government has promised to undertake inspections of gov-
 ernment-operated corporations and manufacturing plants as a priority. Workers
 have a limited right to remove themselves from dangerous or hazardous job situa-
 tions without jeopardizing their continued employment.
