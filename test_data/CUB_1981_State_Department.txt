 CUBA
 
 Cuba is a Marxist-Leninist state closely allied with,
 and heavily dependent upon, the Soviet Union. Although
 most Cubans have the basic necessities of life, they
 have paid a high price in terms of political liberties.
 Cuba's government attempts to exert control over most
 facets of the lives of Cubans. Under the 1976 constitution,
 the government may restrict any right or freedom when
 exercised in opposition to the state. All political,
 economic, social and cultural activities are under the
 close control of the Cuban Communist Party. No political
 opposition or public dissent is allowed. The press and
 other media are owned and controlled by the party-state
 apparatus. Freedom of speech does not exist. Individual
 citizens have a semblance of political participation
 at the grass-roots level, through a system of peoples'
 assemblies (city councils) and local units of nationwide
 "mass" organizations covering workers, women, youth,
 farmers and neighborhood block committees. In practice,
 however, this participation is confined within tightly
 controlled and officially approved bounds. National
 and foreign policies are decided by a small elite within
 the Communist Party's politburo and secretariat.
 The Cuban government has shown itself willing to use
 repression if necessary to stifle popular discontent,
 and in 1980 it instituted a far-ranging security crackdown
 and pressured disaffected and undesirable elements to
 leave the country. The Cuban government was shocked,
 however, by the massive popular response to its offer
 of an opportunity to depart, which resulted in the Mariel
 sealift. Very poor economic performance continues to
 be a major source of discontent and emigration pressures.
 The government has indicated that it has few short-term
 solutions to these problems. Its apparent success in
 reducing past inequities in the distribution'of wealth
 involved redistributing diminishing resources, and even
 that success stands in stark contrast to the communist
 system's failure to increase production, provide adequate
 consumer goods to its people or place the economy on
 a viable and independent basis. Indeed, Soviet subsidies
 now provide 25 percent of the GNP, over $300 per capita
 per year, by far the highest proportion provided by one
 country to another in the world. The government has
 made progress in establishing a system of universal education,
 increased literacy and improved basic medical care.
 As a result of these measures, the formerly poorest sectors
 of the population have made some genuine gains. However,
 housing continues to be a problem. Rationing remains
 in effect. Unemployment is growing. In addition, recent
 epidemics of dengue fever and hemorrhagic conjunctivitis
 have demonstrated the weakness of the Cuban public health
 system.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Use of torture by the Cuban security service, especially
 during interrogation, was common during the 1960s. In
 spite of the fact that Cuban constitution outlaws this
 practice and states that "the person who has been arrested
 or the prisoner is inviolable in his personal integrity,"
 (396)
 
 
 397
 released political prisoners have reported incidents
 of torture in 1980 and 1981.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The Cuban government classifies its prisoners as either
 common criminals or counterrevolutionary prisoners.
 The Cuban authorities in 1971 implemented a "progressive
 plan" to replace an earlier policy of compulsory political
 re-education which included recantation of past opposition
 to the revolution. Under the new political reeducation
 scheme, prisoners work at prison facilities and receive
 monthly salaries for work satisfactorily performed.
 They are granted various rights and privileges, e.g.,
 home visits, visits by family and possibly early release,
 depending on their prison category.
 Although prison conditions in most facilities have improved
 since 1975, reports of abuses have continued, particularly
 with respect to the treatment of several hundred political
 prisoners (who call themselves "plantados") who have
 persistently rejected government re-education schemes.
 These prisoners refuse to take part in official prison
 duties and activities or to wear prison uniforms. Amnesty
 International, in its 1981 report, expressed deep concern
 about allegations that prison authorities have several
 times withdrawn food and medical treatment from political
 prisoners, many of whom are old and sick, because of
 their refusal to accept prison regulations.
 Cuban officials, while admitting that certain restrictions
 are imposed on the "plantados," insist that all prisoners
 receive minimum rights, including adequate medical attention
 and exercise, and that even prisoners in the severest
 category receive "one visit and one letter every three
 months." However, the December 1979 Inter-American Human
 Rights Commission (IAHRC) report concluded that "the
 treatment of 'intransigent' prisoners is characterized
 by mistreatment, absence of medical attention, lack of
 proper food and absence of due process." The same report
 also cited instances of political prisoners being subjected
 to forced labor, in violation of International Labor
 Organization conventions on this subject which have been
 ratified by Cuba.
 In July 1979, 100-120 of the "plantados" were moved from
 Combinado del Este prison to Boniato prison, where living
 conditions are reputed to be much more rigorous. The
 Amnesty International 1980 report expressed concern over
 the transfer, citing reports that the prisoners were
 transported in small vans inadequate for the 1,000 kilometer
 trip. The conditions of the journey reportedly sparked
 a hunger strike by those prisoners. Since the transfer,
 little information has been available on their status
 or treatment. Amnesty International stated that guards
 and common criminals reportedly harass political prisoners
 in Boniato. There were also reports that in November
 1980 a number of the "plantados" were severely beaten
 by prison guards in a melee stemming from the cancellation
 of family visits. Following the incident, a group of
 the "plantados" again went on a hunger strike. According
 to Amnesty International's 1981 report, the suspension
 of family visits was reported to be frequent and arbitrary.
 There have been unconfirmed reports of individual hunger
 strikes among "plantado" prisoners in 1981, as well as
 allegations of continued harsh prison methods to which
 
 
 398
 they are submitted. In January 1981 Amnesty International
 asked the government to intervene .to protect the health
 of the group of the "plantados" whose lives were thought
 to be in.danger.
 There were no-confirmed reports of executions during
 1981.
 Some of the 33 American citizen prisoners released by
 Cuba in October 1980 reported that during pre-trial interro-
 gation they had been held in solitary confinement as
 a means of coercing confessions. During 1981, for the
 first-time, the Cuban authorities-granted consular access
 to American.citizen prisoners in the pre-trial phase,
 but their performance in notifying United States government
 representatives of the arrest of American citizens is
 not as prompt-as required by the Vienna Convention on
 Consular Relations. In addition, Cuban authorities continue
 to deny family visits to American citizen prisoners on
 short notice.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross is not allowed
 access to Cuban political prisoners.
 c. Disappearances
 There is no recent evidence of disappearances in Cuba.
 Arrests generally are made openly, and eventually the
 arrested persons-are either released or tried. However,
 there are numerous reports of arrested persons being
 held incommunicado, without even their families being
 informed, for long periods of time before being brought
 to trial.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The constitution, although enumerating fundamental rights,
 duties-and guarantees, also includes a fail-safe statement
 that "none of the freedoms which are recognized for citizens
 can be exercised contrary to... the existence and the
 objective of the socialist state, or contrary to the
 decision of the Cuban people to build socialism and communism.
 Violation of this principle can be punished by law."
 Thus, repression of all freedoms is accorded legal authority
 by the nation's fundamental legal document. The 1979
 IAHRC report points out that, in practical terms, this
 clause often translates into the imprisonment of individuals
 who are merely exercising basic freedoms, including their
 right to express themselves.
 Cuba continues to hold up to 1,000 political prisoners.
 In late 1978 President Castro said there were 3,000 "counter-
 revolutionaries" imprisoned for "crimes against the security
 of the state" and 600 persons imprisoned for "illegal
 departure." He said these totals did not include about
 400 prisoners held for serious crimes committed during
 the Batista era (the so-called "batistianos") or prisoners
 "affiliated with terrorist groups." Castro pledged to
 release all prisoners in the first two categories during
 1979, but made no promises regarding the "batistianos"
 or the "terrorists."
 At the end of 1979, after a total of 3,900 political
 prisoners had been freed, the government stated that
 the release program had been completed and that any additional
 releases would be handled on a case-by-case basis. The
 
 
 399
 1979 IAHRC report placed the number of remaining political
 prisoners at approximately 1,000. Amnesty International's
 1981 report stated that there are "about 250 long-term
 political prisoners," such as noted poet Armando Valladares
 and the writer Angel Cuadra, who are neither "batistianos"
 nor "terrorists." Amnesty International's 1981 report
 noted that Amnesty had written to medical authorities
 at Valladares' prison about allegations that he had been
 denied medical treatment since April 1980, after having
 been allegedly mistreated by guards. No information
 is available on how many Cubans may have been jailed
 during 1981.
 As to the question of distinguishing "prisoners of conscience"
 from those detained because of politically motivated
 acts of violence, Amnesty International has noted that
 certain individuals may have been arrested and sentenced
 to long terms of imprisonment more because of their opposition
 to the government than because of any specific offense.
 The government acknowledges holding prisoners convicted
 of political crimes, but takes the position that there
 are no "prisoners of conscience"; rather, all are said
 to have been guilty of "crimes against the integrity
 and security of the state."
 Both Amnesty International and the IAHRC have expressed
 concern that some political prisoners due for release
 have been re-sentenced.
 Former political prisoners often find it difficult to
 find satisfactory employment and become reintegrated
 into Cuban society. The government encourages their
 emigration, thereby relieving the state of the burden
 of supporting the politically suspect, minimizing the
 risk of their becoming a source of dissent and shifting
 the costs of providing services to others.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Cuban constitution specifies that the courts shall
 be "a system of state organs independent of all other."
 However, in practice, independent courts do not exist.
 All cqurts are subordinated to the National Assembly
 of People's Government and thus, also, to the Council
 of State. The 1977 Judicial System Law confirmed provisions
 of a 1973 law disbanding the revolutionary tribunals
 which until then had been empowered to deal specifically
 with "counter-revolutionary offenses." Such political
 offenses now fall within the competence of the state
 security chambers of the higher-ranking people's courts.
 The courts appoint lawyers to represent all defendants.
 Defendants may also hire their own counsels through the
 lawyers' guild.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The Cuban constitution states% "The home is inviolable.
 No one can enter the home of another against his will,
 except in those cases unforeseen by law." In practice,
 the individual has scant legal protection against arbitrary
 search. In a rigidly controlled state like Cuba, it
 is difficult to estimate the prevalence of invasion of
 the home.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 
 
 400
 The freedoms of speech, press and assembly do not exist
 in Cuba. The 1979 IAHRC report noted that "the legal
 system in Cuba prevents free expression and any expression
 of disagreement with the socialist system. There are
 individuals who are in prison for the mere fact of having
 expressed their opposition to the system." All print
 and electronic media are government-owned, so that material
 appearing in them is determined by the government. All
 group activities are controlled and monitored by the
 Communist Party and/or political block committees. Mass
 organizations, the most important of which are the Committees
 for the Defense of the Revolution and the Women's Federation,
 include 80 percent of Cuba's adult population.
 The Cuban constitution guarantees the right to profess
 and practice any religion. The constitution also states,
 however, that it is illegal to "put one's faith or religious
 belief in opposition to the constitution which is prere-
 quisite to many sectors of employment...." Communist
 Party membership is considered to be inconsistent with
 the exercise of religious beliefs, thus effectively excluding
 those who practice religion from positions of authority
 in the government or armed forces. There are also reports
 of persons who practice regular religious observance
 being discriminated against in employment, housing and
 schooling. Members of religious groups such as the Jehovah's
 Witnesses, who disagree with the government on such matters
 as employment, education and compulsory military service,
 are subject to persecution for their dissent.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Travel within Cuba is not circumscribed or controlled.
 However, foreign travel is rarely available to the vast
 majority of the Cuban people. Those who wish to travel
 abroad temporarily must obtain an exit permit from the
 government. The penal code makes it illegal to enter
 or leave the country without specific authorization.
 Several hundred of the Cubans who arrived in the United
 States in 1980 from the port of Mariel subsequently changed
 their minds and have sought to return to Cuba. The Cuban
 government has refused to permit their return. This
 contravenes the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
 the International Convention on the Elimination of All
 Forms of Racial Discrimination and the International
 Convenant on Civil and Political Rights. Some of the
 Cubans have returned to Cuba without permission. Their
 treatment in Cuba is unknown.
 With the exception of some special categories (e.g.,
 dual nationals or ex-political prisoners), there was
 virtually no legal means for Cubans to emigrate between
 1973 (when the Cuban government unilaterally ended the
 "freedom flights") and 1977. Beginning in 1978 an increasing
 number of persons have attempted to leave illegally by
 various avenues. In April 1980, in reaction to the invasion
 of the Peruvian embassy by over 10,000 asylum-seekers,
 the Cuban government opened the port of Mariel for massive
 emigration. Cuban-Americans were told that they could
 pick up family members and friends, and hundreds of small
 boats arrived in Mariel from Florida. Between April
 and September, more than 125,000 Cubans arrived in the
 United States via this illegal sealift. The popular
 response to the offer appears to have profoundly shocked
 the Cuban authorities. United States authorities had
 
 
 401
 no opportunity to interview and determine the eligibility
 of any of those arriving. During this period, Cubans
 who sought to leave the island were frequently subjected
 to degrading treatment at the hands of police and the
 political block committees (Committees for the Defense
 of the Revolution). Would-be emigrants were verbally
 and physically attacked by mobs incited by government
 rhetoric. Numerous persons suffered severe beatings,
 and there were even a few unconfirmed reports of deaths
 resulting from such incidents. After stories and photographs
 of this wave of violence had appeared in the international
 press, the block committees were issued instructions
 on how to harass would-be emigrants without resorting
 to physical violence. Many of those seeking to leave
 were virtually held prisoners in their homes for extended
 periods; their utilities were cut off, and they were
 unable to communicate with anyone outside or obtain food.
 Many emigrants reported being physically abused by police
 at processing centers while waiting to be put aboard
 boats at Mariel. Some were kept for days at camps near
 Mariel with little or no food.
 Those who left via Mariel were placed on board small
 boats that were dangerously overcrowded, conditions that
 may have contributed to the deaths of at least 26 people
 by drowning or carbon monoxide asphyxiation. Cuban authorities
 put aboard these boats people suffering from serious
 physical and mental illnesses. Hundreds of hardened
 criminals were given the choice of remaining in prison
 or boarding boats bound for the United States. Other
 Cubans apparently were coerced to leave by being threatened
 with the alternative of imprisonment for alleged offenses,
 such as vagrancy or anti-social conduct. In some cases,
 Cuban authorities contributed to the separation of families
 by granting exit visas to some family members but withholding
 them from others or by separating immediate relatives
 at dockside.
 The emigrants were stripped of all personal belongings
 before leaving. Some persons who held professional degrees
 have claimed that they were obliged to repay the state
 for their education before being allowed to depart.
 These payments allegedly amounted to thousands of dollars
 in some cases. Those who had sought asylum at the Peruvian
 embassy had their ration cards taken away when they emerged
 from the diplomatic compound. It is not clear whether
 this practice has been followed with regard to others
 seeking emigration; some seem to have been permitted
 to retain ration cards. Virtually all who applied for
 exit permits lost their jobs, thus forcing them to subsist
 on charity from relatives or friends until they could
 leave, often an extended period of time.
 With an unknown, but very large number of Cubans still
 enroute to Mariel, the Cuban government suspended the
 sealift on September 25, 1980. There has been no mass
 exodus of Cubans since then nor any repetition of the
 abuse of April-May 1980 directed against intending emigrants.
 It is estimated, however, that from 100,000 to 500,000
 Cubans have applied to emigrate, and that as many as
 200,000 have received exit visas. Estimates of those
 interested in leaving range between one and two million.
 The closure of Mariel, in effect, stranded many of them
 in Cuba with no job, no place to live, dependent on family
 and friends for their existence, a status with little
 prospect for improvement. The Cuban government has made
 
 
 402
 few efforts to reincorporate these people into Cuban
 society, and many are in desperate circumstances. Persons
 believed to be in this situation forced their way into
 the Papal nunciature in December 1980 and the Ecuadoran
 embassy in February 1981 in unsuccessful attempts to
 leave Cuba, resulting in the death of one nunciature
 employee. At least one other person died in an effort
 to escape in the wheel lodging of an airliner bound for
 Mexico. Conversely, however, some Mariel refugees have
 sought to return to Cuba, and some have used such terrorist
 methods as hijacking airplanes from the United States
 to Cuba to achieve their goal. The Cuban government
 announced in September 1980 that hijackers would be either
 severely punished in Cuba or returned to the United States
 for trial, and promptly returned two hijackers to United
 States custody. In July 1981 there was one more hijacking
 by Mariel refugees. The Cuban government stated it would
 prosecute the men involved, but there is no confirmation
 that this happened, nor is there any information concerning
 what happened to the women involved.
 Cuba has accepted a number of refugees, mostly those
 fleeing from anti-leftist governments in Latin America,
 such as Chile and Guatemala. By and large, these refugees
 are treated as though they were Cuban citizens. Many
 are members of political organizations supported by Cuba,
 including terrorist groups such as the Uruguayan Tupamaros,
 the Colombian M-19, the Argentine Montoneros and the
 Chilean MIR (Movement of the Revolutionary Left).
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Cuba is a centralized Marxist-Leninist state. The Communist
 Party is Cuba's only legal political party. After the
 revolution, the Castro government either abolished or
 brought under its control all existing mass organizations.
 It also created several new organizations such as the
 Committees for the Defense of the Revolution. As a result,
 most sectors of Cuban society -- labor, women, youth,
 and artists, for example -- are highly organized. The
 government encourages all Cubans, including children,
 to participate in mass organizations. The Committees
 for the Defense of the Revolution, for example, claim
 a total membership of 5,500,000, or almost 80 percent
 of the adult population. In 1980 the Territorial Militias
 were created, with a current membership of 500,000 but
 projected to reach one million. Although ostensibly
 a home defense organization, the Militias serve as a
 mass organization. These mass organizations are used
 more for political and economic mobilization than for
 popular representation. They use both persuasion and
 coercion to channel the energies of the people toward
 goals established by the Communist Party. Citizens have
 some limited participation in discussion of local issues
 (e.g., public transportation, sanitation and crime prevention)
 within the people's assemblies established in 1976.
 Cuba has constitutionally outlawed discrimination against
 women and minorities. There has been advancement of
 women's rights in employment and working conditions.
 At the political level, however, few women are at the
 top of government, in spite of publicly proclaimed efforts
 of the party to promote them. Only 18 of the 225 members
 (full and alternate) of the Communist Party Central Committee
 elected in December 1980 are women. Only one Politburo
 member, an alternate member, is a woman. Women do hold
 
 
 403
 important posts in some mass organizations, such as the
 Committees for the Defense of the Revolution and the
 Cuban Federation of Women.
 Blacks and other minorities, who comprise more than one
 quarter of the population, benefit from universal public
 education and public health services but are not well
 represented in the top levels of government. The percentage
 of blacks and mulattoes in the Central Committee (full
 and alternate members) is about ten to 15 percent, a
 ratio which does not notably exeed their 9.4 percent
 representation in the 1945 National Congress. Only two
 of the members (full and alternate) of the Politburo
 are black.
 Nearly all Cuban workers belong to the Confederation
 of Cuban Workers, which serves primarily as an instrument
 of the state to maintain political and work discipline,
 spur worker effort and productivity and hold down labor
 costs, rather than to seek wage and benefit improvements
 and defend worker interests. There is no collective
 bargaining or right to strike. Labor-management relations
 are administered by the ministry of labor. Union members
 can vote for the officers of their local sections, but
 not the municipal, provincial and national officers who
 represent the union within the ministry that regulates
 their particular industry.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In December 1980 Amnesty International renewed its appeal
 to the Cuban authorities to allow a visit of an independent
 observer to investigate allegations of ill treatment
 of the "plantado" prisoners. No answer was received.
 Cuba was suspended from participation in the Organization
 of American States in 1962. The Cuban government, therefore,
 has neither signed the American Convention on Human Rights
 nor allowed the IAHRC to visit Cuba.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Over the past 20 years the Cuban government has placed
 great emphasis on health care and education. It also
 made'a major effort to redistribute the existing housing
 and land. In 1963, 71 percent of all arable land was
 in large estates administered by private enterprise.
 Today 75 percent is owned and administered by the state.
 There has been little improvement in diet. The government
 has had little or no success in increasing the supply
 of food, clothing and other consumer goods available
 to the public. Per capita consumption of many items
 has even declined since the late 1950's. Failures in
 this regard were a major contributing factor to the sharp
 rise in domestic discontent during 1978, 1979 and 1980.
 The Cuban constitution guarantees the right to work.
 The policy of attempting to provide some work for everyone
 until recently resulted in a high level of underemployment
 but very little unemployment in Cuba. Over the past
 two years, however, unemployment has become a growing
 problem, with one Eastern European estimate that 150,000
 people are now unemployed in Cuba. This is due in part
 to the fact that Cuba experienced a baby boom from 1958-
 
 
 404
 64, and that group is now entering the labor force.
 This demographic factor should create serious problems
 for Cuba over the next two decades. One means of coping
 with this problem has been to export semi-skilled and
 skilled labor services to Eastern Europe, the Middle
 East and Africa. Another means has been to encourage
 emigration. There is also the difficulty of rewarding
 the thousands of Cubans returning from "internationalist"
 service in Africa and elsewhere with adequate housing
 and jobs.
 All citizens reportedly have access to free health protection
 and care (including dental care), medical examinations,
 vaccinations and hospitalization. Cuba has one doctor
 for every 626 persons. Deaths from contagious diseases
 have been reduced since 1959, although there have been
 recent serious outbreaks of tropical diseases not endemic
 to this hemisphere. The government has placed particular
 emphasis on maternal and child care. Infant mortality
 rate was 25 per 1,000, and life expectancy was 72 years
 in 1980. In general, health care is widely available,
 although its quality is often uncertain.
 Similarly, free education is guaranteed for all. According
 to the government, 92 percent of children between the
 ages of six and 16 are enrolled in school. The literacy
 rate was reportedly 96 percent in 1980.
 Petty corruption (black marketing, illegal diversion
 of state property or services, etc.) is widespread and
 is frequently denounced by high government officials.
 Government measures to limit black marketing, which in
 the past were almost exclusively punitive, are now beginning
 to address the root causes of the problem. In April
 1980, for example, in an effort to regularize the black
 market, limited free markets for agricultural products
 were allowed to operate. This minor venture in capitalism
 resulted in an increase in the availability of agricultural
 foodstuffs, especially fresh vegetables and tubers, to
 those Cuban consumers able to pay the high prices for
 them, but has not completely eliminated black marketing.
 The character of Cuba's economy, like its political structure,
 is Marxist-Leninist and modeled on the Soviet system.
 Since the early 1960s, the state has owned most of the
 land, and the country's business and industrial sectors
 have been completely nationalized. The economy is a
 centrally planned, non-market system in which nearly
 all economic activity is controlled and executed by state
 entities. Some small family farms have been allowed
 to remain in private hands, but the percentage of arable
 land available to private individuals has decreased since
 1963 from 29 percent to 25 percent. Some private subsistence
 farming and quasi-truck gardening continues on such farms.
 An effort to increase productivity and output by placing
 greater reliance on capitalist-style wage incentives
 and enterprise profitability is beginning to show some
 positive results, but its effect thus far has been primarily
 cosmetic, with fundamental economic problems untouched.
 Cuba's average annual economic growth rate per capita
 over the past five years appears close to two percent,
 but is actually smaller because of some inflation in
 the Cuban economy.
 Cuba's strict rationing system has curbed starvation
 and malnutrition, but it also imposes lean dietary standards
 
 
 405
 on the population. For example, each adult is alloted
 2.5 pounds of beef, 1.5 pounds of chicken and four ounces
 of coffee per month. Some Cubans can supplement their
 rations by dining occasionally at restaurants and by
 purchasing foodin the free markets or on the black market.
 However, food from these sources is significantly more
 expensive than at ration stores. Average caloric intake
 per person in 1980 was about 2,800 per day, about 50
 percent from tubers. The chief complaints of Cuban consumers
 concern the quality of their food, its high cost and
 the amount of time (queues) required to acquire it.
 Nationwide food shortages, exacerbated by the export
 of agricultural and marine products that earn hard currency,
 have increased these complaints. Cuba has become increasingly
 dependent on sugar exports, with no significant improvement
 in crop diversification.
 There is a shortage of adequate housing, particularly
 in Cuba's urban centers.  In 1971 President Castro established
 a goal of constructing 100,000 new housing units a year
 by 1975, but actual construction from 1976 through 1980
 averaged 16,587 units per year. The government has made
 a major effort to train skilled construction workers
 (some of whom are sent to work in Third World countries),
 but its housing industry suffers from inefficiency, a
 lack of incentives to build and shortages of construction
 materials, such as lumber and cement. Newly-constructed
 housing is made available on the basis of political criteria
 as well as family needs. Maintenance of existing housing
 continues to be a formidable problem.
