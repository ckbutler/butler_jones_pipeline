 THE CZECH REPUBLIC
 The Czech Republic is a parliamentary democracy. Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus
 and his Civic Democratic Party lead the current minority coalition Government,
 formed after the June parliamentary elections. The country has essentially com-
 pleted the reform of political and economic structures initiated after the 1989 "vel-
 vet revolution." President Vaclav Havel is an internationally recognized advocate of
 human rights and social justice. The judiciary is independent.
 The Ministry of the Interior oversees the police. The civilian internal security
 service, known as the Security and Information Service (BIS), is independent of
 Ministry control, but reports to Parliament and the Prime Minister's office. Police
 and BI authorities generally observe constitutional and legal protection of individ-
 ual rights in carrying out their responsibilities. However, there were occasional re-
 ports of abuses by some members of the police.

 The market-based economy continued to show solid growth, with over two-thirds
 of the gross domestic product (GDP) produced by the private sector. Most macro-
 economic indicators (balanced budget, low inflation and unemployment) were favor-
 able. Significant trade and current account deficits persisted, which were financed
 by strong capital inflows. The work force was employed primarily in industry, retail
 trade, and construction. Leading exports were intermediate manufactured products
 and machinery and transport equipment, primarily to European Union countries.
 GDP per capita reached approximately $5,100.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens. However,
 popular prejudice and skinhead violence against Roma remain problems. Other
 problems include the 1992 Citizenship Law; the law on lIstration (screening), which
 forbids ceitain pre-1989 Communist officials and secret police collaborators from
 holding certain positions; and the laws criminaizing defamation of the State and
 presidency. There is increasing public awareness about violence against women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 In 1995 Frantisek Kahanek, the confessed rapist and murderer of a 10-year-old
 child, was found dead in his jail cell while awaiting trial. In December three of the
 four wardens charged with assault and abuse of public office in connection with the
 death were acquitted by the district court in Pilsen. The remaining warden was
 given a 6-month sentence with 1 year of probation.
 In July the Prague-West district court sentenced a police officer to 8 months in
 prison for using excessive force during a roadside traffic check and banned him from
 the police force for 5 years. The officer caused the death of a German tourist during
 a traffic check in Pribram in October 1994.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture is prohibited by the Constitution, and there were no reports of such prac-
 tices.
 In May some 60 armed police officers used truncheons to beat dozens of people
 attending a rock concert in a Prague club. Several attendees were injured as a re-
 sult. Following the completion in November of an investigation by the Inspectorate
 of the Interior Ministry, the leader of the police action was charged with abuse of
 public office.
 In August an officer was charged with abuse of public office in connection with
 a police action in 1995, when the Brno police allegedly used excessive force in break-
 in up a late-night party outside a theater.
 e police underwent significant restructuring and have brought many new offi-
 cers onto the force. Police approval ratings remained rather low in public opinion
 polls, but that may be partially explained by increased public anxiety over crime.
 There have been reports of police shakedowns and anecdotal stories of physical
 abuse and malfeasance, often directed at foreigners and Roma.
 Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Government
 permits visits by human rights monitors. There is overcrowding in some prisons. Ac-
 cording to the prison authority, as of September the prison system was at 112 per-
 cent ofcapacity, and 7 of the country's 32 prisons were 25 percent or more over ca-
 pacty.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest, deten-
 tion, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition. Authorities may hold
 persons without charge for 24 hours, during which time they have the right to coun-
 sel. A person charged with a crime has the right to appear before a judge for ar-
 raignment, when the judge determines whether custody is necessary pending trial.
 Pretrial custody may last as long as 4 years, with periodic judicial review, for
 criminal charges. The law does not allow bail for certain serious crimes. If the court
 does not approve continued detention at any of the legally mandated review dates,
 the suspect must be released. A suspect may petition the appropriate investigating
 authorities at any time for release from custody.
 Since 1989 the average length of pretrial etention has increased from 89 days
 to 216 in 1996, although that figure is down slightly from 1995. According to the
 prison service, nearly 39 percent of prisoners are currently awaiting trial or sentenc-
 ing, down from 42 percent in 1995. The lack of experienced judges and investigators,
 combined with a still-evolving legal environment, led to a backlog of court cases. At-
 torney and family visits are permitted. The authorities follow these guidelines in
 practice.
 
 
 915
 
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and it is impartial and independent in practice. Judges are not fired or trans-
 ferred for political reasons.
 The court system consists of district, regional, and high courts. The Supreme
 Court is the highest court of appeal. In addition a Constitutional Court rules sepa-
 rately on the constitutionality of legislation. he shortag of qualified judges is
 being gradually overcome by the hiring of new personnel. Public opinion polls indi-
 cate that over half of the population nevertheless remains somewhat skeptical of the
 courts' effectiveness as an instrument of justice.
 The law stipulates that persons charged with criminal offenses are entitled to fair
 and open public trials. They have the right to be informed of their legal rights and
 of the charges againt them, to consult with counsel, and to present a defense. The
 State provides lawyers for indigent defendants in criminal and some civil cases
 through the bar association. According to the International Helsinki Committee,
 many eligible parties fail to complete the demanding process of applying for such
 representation. Defendants enjoy a presumption of innocence and have the right to
 refuse to testify against themselves. They may appeal any judgments against them.
 The authorities observe these rights in practice.
 The 1991 lustration law bars many former Communist Party officials, members
 of the people's militia, and suspected secret police collaborators from holding a wide
 range of elective and appointive offices, including appointive positions in state-
 owned companies, academia, and the media, for a period of 5 years; some other em-
 ployers have also required applicants to produce proof of noncollabration.
 Late in 1992 the Czchoslovak Federal Constitutional Court eliminated the larg-
 est category of offenders from the law (those listed as collaborators but who in fact
 may only have been intelligence targets). Acodn to the Interior Ministry, of ap-
 proximately 300,000 requests for lustration received by late 1996, roughly 3 percent
 revealed that the applicants were suspected of some form of collaboration. Those
 positively identified may appeal to an Interior Ministry "Independent Commission"
 created to review such cases. They may also ifie a civil suit against the Interior Min-
 istry for a charge similar to slander. From the beginning of ustration in 1993 until
 mid-Octber 1996, 581 such suits had been filed. According to the Ministry, of the
 472 court cases that had been decided by then, about half were "fuly successful,"
 and another quarter were "partialy successful." In January former member of the
 Czechoslovak Federal Assembly and longtime dissidentpublisher in London Jan
 Kavan, who had been accused of collaboration with the zechoslovak secret police,
 was completely exonerated by the court. Many of those unjustly accused of collabo-
 ration feel that they have suffered diminished career prospects and damaged per-
 sonal reputations.
 The screening process has been criticized because it is based on the records of the
 Communist secret police, records many suspect were incomplete or unreliable. The
 law has also been criticized as a violation of human rights priciples probibit'mn, dis-
 crimination in employment and condemning collective guilt. International criticism
 of the screening law was muted in 1996, as most organizations that had criticized
 ustration in the past, such as the Organization for Security and Cperation in Eu-
 rope and the Council of Europe (COE), rarely if ever received complaint from ag-
 grieved parties. In 1995 Pariament voted to extend the law to the year 2000, over-
 riding a veto by President Have.
 Although a 1993 law defining the pre-1989 Communist regime as criminal and
 lifting the statute of limitations for crimes committed by the Communist Party of
 Czechoslovakia during its 40-year rule remained on the books, it was rarely invoked.
 The anti-Communist law was upheld by the Constitutional Court in December 1993.
 Several charges filed by the Office for the Domentation and Investigation of the
 Crimes of Communism (UDV) were dismissed by th      e prosecutrs office for pro-
 cedural errors or lack of evidence. In September nsident Havel ordered that
 charges against former Communist Defense Minister Milan Vaclavik be dropped,
 citing the advanced age and poor health of the accused. The UDV had charged
 Vaclavik with illegally supplying the people's militia with arms.
 In October an inividual wgo had been fired from the theological faculty at
 Prague's Charles University charged that secret police collaborators were still em-
 rloyed at his former workplacei. Thehead of the UDV confirmed this information,
 utthe office did not involve itself in the matter further, as no laws applied to the
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Corespondence.-Elee-
 tronic surveillance, the tapping of telephones, and interception of mail require a
 court order. The Government complied with this requirement.
 
 
 916
 
 In November the head of BIS resigned amid charges that his agency placed a
 leading politician under surveillance in 1992, reportedly due to the politician's ties
 with a banker under investigation. A government investigator found that BIS had
 tampered with evidence in the case, but no evidence emerged of any political moti-
 vation for the surveillance.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for freedom of spech and the
 press, and the Government respects this right in practice. Individusis can and do
 speak out on plitical issues and freely criticize the Government and public figures.
 However, "defamation" of the Republic and the President are punisha~ble by prison
 terms of up to 2 years under the Pena Code. In practice the courts gave suspended
 sentences in the handful of such cases to date. In 1994 the Constitution  Court
 struck out language that also criminalized defamation of the "Parliament, Govern-
 ment, or Constitutional Court." Nevertheless, these laws continued to be criticized
 by both domestic and international human rights observers as limiting freedom of
 expression.
 n March President Havel pardoned Pavel Karhanek, who had been given a 9-
 month suspended sentence in 1995 under the law on defamation of the President
 for putting up posters in a local government office calling the President a former
 alcoholic, a swindler, and a Communist collaborator. According to the Office of the
 President, Ravel routinely pardons those convicted under the law when they request
 it or when his office learns of such cases. In May the district court in Kreriz ro-
 nounced a 4-month suspended sentence on Zdenk Spalovaky under the same aw
 for publishing statements in local and emigre newspapers in 1994 that Havel was
 a traitor and a false prophet.
 In October the Constitutional Court struck down a 1995 proclamation by the
 Znojmo town hail that placed limitations on the use of foreign languages in shop
 signs.
 A wide variety of newspapers, magazines, and journals publish without govern-
 ment interference. The capital, Prague. is home to at least a dozen daily newspapers
 with national distribution, as well as a variety of entertainment and special interest
 newspapers and magazines. These publications are owned by a variety of Czech and
 foreign investors. Some newspapers are still associated with the interests of a politi-
 calTparty; others are independent.
 Selectronic media are independent. There       4 television stations, 2 public
 and 2 private, and more than 60 private radio stations in addition to Czech Public
 Radio. The leading television channel, Nova, is privately owned, partially by foreign
 investors. In addition, many viewers have access to foreign broadcasts via satellite
 and cable.
 A parliamentary commission has broad oversight and power to approve or reject
 candidates for the Television and Radio Council. The Council has imited regulatory
 responsibility for poicymaking   answers to the parliamentary media committee.
 The Council can issue and revoke radio and television licenses and monitors pro-
 gramming.
 By year's end, Parliament had not yet voted on two Iong-delayed media laws: one
 for print and one for broadcast media. New laws are needed because the print law
 on the books dates from 1966 and the current broadcast law, dating from 1991, did
 not envision private media. The print media law has gone through several drains
 in the process of working its way through various parliamentary committees. Czech
 journalists criticize the drait law for not affirming the right of a journalist to protect
 sources and for not requiring government officials to supply information to the
 media.
 The law provides for academic freedom but also forbids activities by established
 political parties at universities.
 b. Freedom of Peacefud Assembly and Association.-The law provides for the right
 of elersons to assemble peacefully. Permits for some public demonstrations are re-
 quired by law but are rarely refused. However, the law forbids political party activ-
 ity at universities (see Section 2.a.). Police generally do not interfere with sponta-
 neous, peaceful demonstrations for which organizers lack a permit.
 In April the Constitutional Court struck down a proclamation by the central dis-
 trict of the city of Brno that placed restrictions on the use of Freedom Square for
 promotional, cultural, or political events. The proclamation had been adopted in
 1993 after a rock musician was stabbed in the stomach by a man who was appar-
 ently irritated by noise from the musiciands concert on the Square.
 Since late 1995, the Constitutional Court has also overturned five ganti-Com-
 munist" decrees from various towns. In April the court overturned proclamations by
 the town councils of Bro and Nova Paka that banned the promotion of parties and
 
 
 917
 movements spreading ethnic, racial, political, or class hatred. In June the same
 Court overturned two proclamations that banned Communist, Nazi, and Fascist
 propaganda in the towns of Pardubice and Jicin. The Court has also overturned a
 similar measure from Usti Nad Labem.
 The right of persons to associate freely and to form political parties and move-
 ments is provided for by law and the Government respected this right in practice.
 Either the Government or te President may submit a proposal to the Supreme
 Court calling for a political party to he disbanded, hut there have been no such cases
 since 1989. Organz ations, associations, foundations, and political parties are re-
 quired to register with local officials or at the Interior Ministry, but there is no evi-
 dencethat this registration is either coercive or arbitrarily withheld. The Com-
 munist Party, although fragmented, is represented in the Parliament and in local
 government.
 c. Freedom of Reliqion.-The law provides for religious freedom, and the Govern-
 mnt resjpect this rght inpaie.oTheuState provides support to all religions that
 are registered with the    i    of    lture. Thee are currently 21 registered
 churches. A church must have at least 10,000 adult memhers to register. Smaller
 religious groups, such as the Muslim minority, lack an alternative legal mechanism
 that would enable them to own community property.
 One Christian political party, the Christian-Democratic Union-Czechoslovak Peo-
 ple's prty is a member of the governing coalition. A smaller Chris Party, the
 Chrtian   emocratic Party, merged with the Civic Democratic Party, the largest
 party in the coalition Government, early in the year.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on domestic or foreign travel, emigration, and
 repatriation. Passports are readily available to all wishing to travel abroad. Czechs
 who emigrated during the period of Communist rule frequently return to visit, or
 even to settle, and are able to regain Czech citizenship if they wish, although to do
 so they must relinquish claim to any foreign citizenship. Citizenship is not revoked
 for political reasons. Nonetheless, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refu-
 gees (UNHCR) has expressed concern to the Government that its 1992 Citizenship
 Law has created a problem of statelessness that may lead to irregular movements
 (see Section 5).
 The Government provides first asylum and cooperates with the UNHCR and other
 humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. Most migrants used the Czech Re-
 public as a transit route toward the Wet;however, the country is becoming the
 Final destination for increasing numbers. According to the Interior Ministry, accept-
 ance rates for asylum applications have decreaseT from over 35 percent in 1991 to
 just over 4 percent in 1996. This trend reflects the rationalization of border controls;
 a more restrictive attitude toward accepting economic migrants; and perhaps also
 the belief that certain foreigners have contributed to higher crime rates since 1989.
 There are 4 reception centers for asylum seekers, 6 humanitarian centers for
 Bosnians under temporary protection, and 10 integration centers for recognized ref-
 ugees. In April the Parliament abolished a provision in the law on refugees allowing
 refugee status to be granted only for 5 years, thus bringing domestic law into har-
 mony with the State's international commitments in the 1951 Convention Relating
 to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. As a result of the April amendment,
 refugees may now apply for citizenship after 5 years. Nongovernmental organiza-
 tions (NGO's) work closely with the Interior Ministry to ease the refugees' transition
 into society. In practice, however, many potential refugees choose to apply for per-
 manent settlement elsewhere.
 According to the Interior Ministry, as of October there were officially 334
 Bosnians under temporary protection in humanitarian centers and approximately
 470 in other living arrangements. Nearly 1,000 have obtained either long-term or
 permanent residency, and an unknown number remain in the country illegally. Par-
 ticipation by recognized refugees in the September elections in Bosnia was facili-
 tated by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Embassy
 of Bosnia-Herzegovina in Vienna. Voluntary repatriation of Bosnian refugees began
 in July; by Otober, 277 had returned to Sarajevo on three flights specially char-
 tred by the Government and were given a resettlement stipend.
 The Goveent devoted increased attention to illegal migration into the country
 and took steps with its neighbors to control the movement of people across its bor-
 ders. The Government has signed readmission agreements with al of the country's
 neighbors, and with Hungary, Romania, and Canada. In 1996 the UNHCR observed
 that these agreements "do not specifically take into account the special situation of
 asylum seekers" nor "ensure access to refugee status determination procedure,"
 while noting that in practice the Government allows all interested parties to apply
 for such protections.
 
 
 918
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government by
 democratic means, and citizens exercise this right in practice. Citizens over the age
 of 18 are eligible to vote by secret ballot in republic-wide and local elections. Opposi-
 tion groups, including political parties, function openly and participate without hin-
 drance in the political process. Prior to the June parliamentary elections, a number
 of small political parties protested the introduction of an election-deposit require-
 ment, charging that they were unable to afford the sums demanded and were thus
 effectively excluded from participating in the democratic process. Prior to the No-
 vember Senate elections, the district and central election committees were criticized
 for forcing several candidates from various parties to withdraw from the race for
 sometimes minor irregularities in their registration papers. There was no evidence
 of partisanship in such decisions. The Supreme Court in the overwhelming majority
 of cases ruledin favor of the candidates. International observers have noted that
 former Czechoslovaks who elected representatives to the Czech National Assembly
 in 1992 and whose current citizenship status is unclear continue to lack voting
 rights (see Section 5).
 The        three-party center-right minority Government was formed in July fol-
 lowing the Czech Republic's first national elections. There are also a number of left-
 of-center opposition parties and one party of the radical right. The Constitution
 mandates elections to Parliament at least every 4 years, base on proportional rep-
 resentation in eight large electoral districts. There is a 5-percent threshold for par-
 ties to enter Parliament. The first elections to the Senate were held in November.
 With its establishment, the Czech Republic's parliamentary system came into com-
 pliance with the country's Constitution. The President, who is elected by Par-
 liament, serves a 5-year term. The President has limited constitutional powers but
 may use a suspense veto to return legislation to Parliament, which can then over-
 ride that veto by a simple majority.
 There are no restrictions, in law or in practice, on women's participation in poli-
 tics. Nevertheless relatively few women hold high public office. The state attorney
 and the mayors o? Brno and a number of smaller towns are women; the 200-member
 Parliament includes 29 female deputies, including 1 deputy speaker. Nine women
 are senators in the newly elected 81-member Senate; one of the four vice chairmen
 is a woman.
 Representatives from all minority groups sit on the government-sponsored Council
 for Nationalities. Slovaks, of whom there are an estimated 300,000, are almost all
 "Czechoslovaks" who elected to live in the Czech Republic after the split. Many
 serve in high positions in the civil service. For the most part, these Slovaks define
 their interests in the context of Czech politics, not along ethnic lines; there is no
 Slovak party in the Parliament.
 Many of the estimated 200,000 to 250,000 Roma have not been fully integrated
 into society, and the party that represented their interests immediately following
 the demise of communism, the Romani Civic Initiative, is in disarray. The political
 culture generally defines Roma as outsiders. The Rma themselves have not united
 behind a program or set of ideals that would enable them to advance their interests
 in the democratic structures of the country (see Section 5). Since mid-1995, however,
 various Romani gups have joined forces to protest interethnic violence against
 them. Even if allRemanl citizens of voting age were to unite behind a single party,
 they would not garner the required 5 percent of votes cast to be represented in the
 lower house, and no seats are reserved in either house for ethnic minorities. There
 are currently no Remani deputies in the Parliament.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights groups operate without government restriction, and government of-
 ficials are generally cooperative and somewhat responsive to their views. The presi-
 dency of former dissident and human ights monitor Vaclav Havel serves as an im-
 portant symbol for these groups. While the Government has demonstrated a willing-
 ness to examine and redress individual cases of human rights abuse, it has been
 less flexible when considering larger systemic changes. There is a government-spon-
 sored Council for Nationalities, which advises the Cabinet on minority affairs. In
 this body, Slovaks and Rema have three representatives each; Poles and Germans,
 two each; and Hungarians and Ukrainians, one each. In Parliament there is a peti-
 tion committee for human rights and nationalities, which includes a subcommittee
 for nationalities. The Senate has also formed a committee for human rights and na-
 tionalities.
 
 
 919
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law provides for the equality of citizens and prohibits discrimination. Health
 care, education, retirement, and other social services generally are provided without
 regard to race, sex, religion, disability, social status, or sexual orientation. In prac-
 tice Roma face discrimination in such areas as education, housing, and job oppor-
 tunity.
 Women.-The true extent of violence against women is unknown, and public de-
 bate about it is rare, despite the efforts of a handful of women's groups to bring
 this issue to the attention of the public. The press devoted increased coverage to the
 issues of violence against women and trafficking in women. Official statistics fail to
 track violence against women effectively. Since 1989 official police statistics have re-
 corded 700 to 900 rape cases per year, and approximately 80 percent of the cases
 are solved. Studies by the Sexology Institute found that 12 percent of women over
 the age of 15 had experienced some form of sexual assault in their lifetime and that
 only 3 percent of rape victims report the crime. Gender studies experts say that
 women are ashamed to speak about rape and that the police are not equipped, ei-
 ther by attitude or training to help. According to legal experts there is an uns1poken
 understanding in the court system that spousal abuse should be prosecuted as a
 crime only if a doctor determines that the victim's condition warrants medical treat-
 ment for 7 days or mere. There are state-supported shelters that accept women in
 most major cities and towns. According to NGO's, the situation has improved in re-
 cent years, but there are still not enough spaces to meet demand.
 In a 1995 study by the Sociology Institute, 43 percent of women reported experi-
 encing some form of sexual harassment in the workplace during their career. A
 study by the Defense Ministry in 1996 found that nearly half of female soldiers ex-
 perienced harassment on duty. In a landmark case, a major bank forced a local
 branch manager to resign in August after he made repeated, unwelcome advances
 toward female employees. The bank had declined to act following the first incident
 and in the resulting national discussion, press commentators generally dismissed
 the concerns of women's groups over the extent of sexual harassment in the work-
 place.
 Women are equal under the law and in principle receive the same pay for the
 same job. However, according to a survey of employers by the Ministry of Labor,
 women's median wages lagged behind those of men by roughly 25 percent in 1996
 (a private survey produced omparable results), although the gap is narrowing. Ac-
 cording to a 1995 study, women are concentrated in professions in which the median
 salary is low: medicine, teaching, and white-collar clerical jobs. At the same time,
 women have made deep inroads into the private sector since 1989, and the number
 in agricultural work has fallen by 50 percent over the last decade. Women have
 steadily represented roughly half of the labor force over the same period. They enjoy
 equal property, inheritance, and other rights with men.
 Prostitution is legal, although a Noveiber 1995 amendment to the law on com-
 munities provides  at it    be regulated by local authorities. Under the Penal
 Code, trafficking in prostitutes is punishable b)y a prison term of up to 8 y.ears (up
 to 12 years if the victim is under the age of 15). According to the police unit respon.
 sible for fighting organized crime, the Czech Republic is largely a transit country
 for traffickers in women. A credible NGO that tracks this issue has concluded that
 the country is increasingly becoming a destination for many prostitutes from farther
 east. In February the police broke up a ring of traffickers in Kiadno. Several hun-
 dred women and gIrls annually are smuggled into Western Europe and North Amer.
 ica through the Czech Republic and forced to work as prostitutes. According to the
 same NGO, the trade in women is growing.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's welfare through programs
 for health care, compulsory education, and basic nutrition. Some Romani chidren
 do not receive these benefits for a variety of reasons, and the Government's largely
 bureaucratic and administrative approach has not adequately addressed the dis-
 advantages faced by Roma in many municipalities. Some segments of the Romani
 community prefer to limit as much as possible their contacts with the majority soci-
 ety.
 Child abuse and trafficking in children received increased attention in the press
 in 1996. A children's crisis center was founded in 1995 and is 70 percent state sup-
 ported. According to its director, around 1 percent of children are neglected, mis-
 treated, or sexually abused, but only about one-tenth of all cases are registered by
 the police. The increase in the number of reported cases of child abuse appears to
 be the result of an increased awareness of the problem. According to a special envoy
 of the U.N. Human Rights Commission who visited in 1996, there is no evidence
 of a societal pattern of child abuse.
 
 
 920
 Girls and boys enjoy equal access to health care and education at all levels. The
 Government ceased tabulating educational or other statistics on the basis of eth-
 nicity following the breakup of the Czechoslovak federation in 1993; yet 1991 figures
 show that over 20 percent of the self-identified Romani population in the Czech
 lands had not completed elementary school and that over 95 percent had not com-
 pleted high school. Since a large majority of Roma do not identify themselves as
 such for census-takers, however, such statistics provide only an approximate picture
 of reality. In 1993 the Government instituted a number of year-long programs (so-
 called "zero grades") to prepare disadvantaged youth for their first year in school,
 mostly in areas with hia concentrations of Roma. Participation in the "zero grades"
 is voluntary. Some Romani parents do not send their children to school regularly
 for a variety of reasons, including the expense of boks, supplies, and activities; sub-
 tle or overt discrimination; and sometimes, because of the parents' ambivalent atti-
 tudes toward education.
 According to the Ministry of Education, Romani children make up 60 percent or
 more of pupils placed in "special schools" for those who suffer from mentae or social
 disabilities, although Roma are estimated to comprise only 2 to 3 percent of the pop-
 ulation. Language and cultural barriers frequently impede the integration of
 Romani children into mainstream schools. Moreover, some Romani parents appear
 to prefer that their children attend such schools, where they can be among others
 of the same ethnicity, regardless of their mental abilities.
 During the year, some public discussion took place about lowering the age of
 criminal responsibility. The leader of a far-right political party represented in the
  Pariament called for lowering the criminal age of responsibiity for Romani children
 to zero (see below). There was no change in the relevant legislation by year's end.
 People With Disabiities.-At the beginning of the year, the Government intro-
 duced a new set of eligibility guidelines for disability benefits in an effort to ration-
 alize the system. According to an NGO representing the disabled, under the new
 system as many as 30 percent of former recipients receive either fewer benefits or
 none. Businesses in which 60 percent or more of the employees are disabled qualify
 for special tax breaks, and 41 such companies are members of the union of Czech
 and Moravian producer cooperatives.
 The disabled suffer disproportionately from unemployment, and the physically dis-
 abled have unequal access to education, especially in rural areas. This is less the
 result of government policy than of a lack of barrier-free access to public schools.
 Most buildings and public transportation are inaccessible to those in wheelchairs.
 However, a regulation of the Economic Ministry from 1994 requires architects to en-
 sure adate access for the disabled in new building projects, and this regulation
 is applied in practice. Numerous NGO's are actively working to diminish the dis-
 advantages faced by the disabled. The integration of the disabled into society has
 not been the subject of significant policy or public debate. There is one disabled
 member of Parliament.
 Religious Minorities.-The Jewish community numbers a few thousand. There
 were only isolated incidents of vandalism against Jewish property. In June a Prague
 synagogue that had repeatedly been the target of vandalism was defaced with swas-
 tikas and anti-Semitic graffiti. In February the Federation of Jewish Communities
 protested the publication of a new edition of "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,"
 a notorious anti-Semitic text, despite the inclusion in the new edition of a scholarly
 essay showing the work to be a fabrication. The police confirmed the existence of
 over 20 underground magazines with small circulations propagating fascism, racism,
 and anti-Semitism.
 Religious groups with 10,000 or more adult members may register with the Min-
 istry of Culture. Only registered religions are eligible for state subsidies. Smaller
 groups lack a legal mechanism by which they may own community property (see
 Sction 2.c.). The Jewish community constitutes an exception, since it was recog-
 nized by the State before 1989.
 In March the town council of Teplice voted 26 to 2 to deny a permit for the con-
 struction of a mosque on the grounds that the building could become a center for
 Islamic terrorism. In the same month, the city of Bro gave permission for a mosque
 to be built, but with the stipulation that the building not have a minaret. The small
 Muslim minority is otherwise free to assemble and worship in the manner of its
 choice. Its members can and do issue publications without interference. There is
 also a small Muslim cemetery in Trebic.
 On the anniversary of Kristallnacht, a series of Nazi-inspired mob attacks on Ger-
 man Jews and their property in November 1938, an international crowd of about
 700 people gathered in Kozolupy near Pilsen to attend a concert by skinhead bands.
 Police detained nine participants who made the "Heil Hitler" salute, an offense pun-
 ishable under Czech law, and charged the owner of the venue with supporting and
 
 
 propogating a movement that aims to suppress citizens' rights and freedoms, a
 criminal offense. Police refrained from further intervention at the time of the con-
 cert but an investigation is continuing.
 N'aional/Racial Ethnic Minorities.-After ethnic Slovaks, the most significant
 minority in the Czech Republic by far is the Romani population, officially estimated
 to number approximately 200,000. Roma live tughout the country but are con-
 centrated in the industrial towns of northern Bohemia, where more than 40 years
 ago many eastern Slovak Roma settled or were forced to settle in the homes of Su-
 deten Germans transferred to the West. They suffer disproportionately from pov-
 erty, interethnic violence, illiteracy, and disease. Efforts by foundations and individ-
 uals in the education and health fields to improve their living conditions, espcially
 the conditions of Romani children, have had only minimal impact. There is a Czech-
 language program for Roma on state television and another on state radio. There
 are various publications for Roma, of which all but one are state supported. There
 is also an academic journal of Romani studies with several Rema on the editorial
 board. Romani leaders have had limited success thus far in organizing their local
 communities, which are often riven by conflicting loyalties and where many are pes-
 simistic about improving relations with the majority.
 Roma suffer from serious popular prejudice, as is repeatedly a med by pubic
 opinion polls. In 1996 a survey foundthat 22 percent of respondents would "give
 more room to the akinheads" as a means of resolving the problem of coexistence
 with the Roma; 35 percent were in favor of "concentrating and isolating" the Roma;
 and 45 percent would support "moving the Roma out of the Czech Republic if pos-
 sible." However, a majority of respondents also supported the right of Roma to file
 complaints with international bodies, reserving seats for Romani representatives on
 municipal councils, the "zero grade" program, and efforts to bring more Roma onto
 the police force.
 The International Helsinki Federation and Human Rights Watch criticized the
 Government in 1996 for not curbing skinhead violence against Roma. Racially moti-
 vated violence against Roma, usually by skinheads, has risen sharply in recent
 years. Statistics through October recorded a sixfold increase in the number of re-
 ported incidents over 1994. Local authorities have been unable (or, according to
 some observers, unwilling) to curb this violence. In the last 5 years, over 200 people
 have been charged with racial violence; to date, just under 100 have been convicted.
 In mid-1995 Parliament passed legislation to stiffen the penalties for certain cat-
 egories of racially motivated crime, and the state attorney instructed prosecutors to
 act more vigorously in such cases. Nonetheless, many judges and police officers re-
 main extremely reluctant to ascribe a racial motive to anti-Rema violence, even
 when skinheads are involved.
 In February the district court in Breclav sentenced one skinhead to a 6-year pris-
 on term for the October 1995 attack on the Roma Josef and Jarmila Polak, which
 caused each to suffer a concussion and Josef Polak to lose an eye. The court gave
 the remaining three assailants in the Polak case suspended sentences because of
 their apparent repentance and because they had not reached the age of criminal re-
 sponsibility at the time of the attack.
 Skinheads organized several large gatherings in November, and police were some-
 times effective in containing them. In late November, some 100 skinheads from sev-
 eral countries in the region gathered in Breclav to protest the verdict in the Polak
 case. The same night, police and local authorities in the southern Moravian munici-
 pality of Lanzhot successfully dispersed an estimated 200 skinheads who were at-
 tending a concert and who had begun to shout Fascist slogans. Police closely
 watched and escorted some of over 100 skinheads gathered in Senov in northern
 Moravia when they walked through an area of nearby Havoriv where many Rema
 live.
 In May the high court in Olomouc overturned a lower court's ruling and attrib-
 uted a racial motive to the 1995 skinhead attack on Rem Tibor Berki who died from
 his injuries. One of the assailants had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for mur-
 der and a second to 18 months; in the 1995 trial, the court did not find the attack
 to be racially motivated. Under the new ruling in 1996, the sentences were extended
 by 1 year and 2 months, respectively.
 The investigation continues into the case of three Romani girls who were severely
 beaten by nine skinheads in 1995.
 Witnesses are often afraid to testify in such cases for fear of reprisals. For exam-
 ple, in September and again in December the district court in Pisek again pstponed
 court proceedings in the case of the death of Tibor Danihel, an 18-year-oldorm who
 drowned after a gang of skinheads forced him into the Otava river in Pisek in 1993,
 due to witnesses' unwillingness to testify. In a separate case in Uherske Hradi-te,
 two Remani witnesses caled upon to give testimony in January had to be sum-
 
 
 922
 moned by the police; one witness told the court that he feared for his life if he testi-
 fied.
 The prosecution of racially motivated attacks is often slowed by the general back-
 log of court cases (see Section 1.d.). In other cases, suspects accused of brutal at-
 tacks were released by the courts pending trial. A Brno court released an 18-year-
 old female skinhead who attacked a Romani man with an infant in his arms in May,
 pending a hearing, she then assaulted another woman in September. An Olomouc
 court released a youth who had attacked a foreign student at the local university
 (see below). Overcrowding in some prisons (see Section 1.c.) may contribute to some
 judges' unwillingness to place youths, even violent offenders, in custody.
 Central government officials remain engaged in problems affecting the Romani
 community. Romani representatives met separately with the Ministers of Labor and
 Education to discuss their concerns. The latter meeting was the first ever attended
 by spkespersons for the particularly isolated Viach Roma. In July the leader of a
 far-r gt party delivered a speech on the floor of the Parliament in which he said
 thchildren should be criminally responsible from birth; all other parties'
 deputies left the chamber in a protest against this statement. In November the
 mandate and immunity committee of the Chamber of Deputies fined the offender
 1 month's salary. In 1996 the number of those charged with racially motivated
 crimes continued to rise, and the Attorney General directed state prosecutors to
 seek stiffer sentences for them.
 Roma face discrimination in employment, housing, schools, and the rest of every-
 day life. NGO's estimate that unemp loyment among Roma is as high as 70 percent
 in some areas. Some restaurants, pubs, and other venues throughout the country
 routinely refused service to Roma and posted signs prohibiting their entry. In Marc
 a small political party forced a Breclav businessman to resign as its candidate for
 the parliamentary elections after he put up a sign in his hotel refusing service to
 Roma. In other cases, local authorities intervened to have offensive signs removed.
 In June the town of Kiadno barred entry to the municipal swimming pool byRoRa
 after an outbreak of hepatitis infected most of the local Romani community. Munici-
 pal health authorities stated that the measure would not be especially effective in
 containing the outbreak. The mayor subsequently proposed a conference that would
 include Roma particiants to discuss interethnic relations; this initiative has been
 received with skepticism by local Roma.
 In August, in the first prominent antidiscrimination case, the Rokycany district
 court found pub owner Ivo Blahout not guilty of discriminating against Romani pa-
 trons despite videotaped evidence and the incriminating testimony of two policemen.
 The pub owner argued both that all the tables in his establishment had been re-
 served on the day of the incident and that he had a right to take reasonable meas-
 ures to protect his property from notoriously unruly customers. The district state
 attorney has appealed the ruling.
 While local Romani leaders tended to focus on racially motivated violence and
 other problems, international and domestic legal and human rights organizations
 continued to criticize the discriminatory impact of the 1992 citizenship law. That
 law, created at the time of the CzechSlovak split, allowed Czchoslovaks living in
 the Czech Republic until the end of December 1993, later extended to June 1994,
 te opt for Czech citizenship under conditions mre favorable than those faced by
 non-Czechoslovaks in the normal naturalization process. Unlike its Slovak counter-
 part, which awarded Slovak citizenship to all former Czechoslovak citizens living
 within its borders regardless of their previous nationality (after 1970, Czechoslovaks
 were required to choose whether they were "Czechs" or "Slovaks," a choice with vir-
 tually no significance at the time), the Czech law posed conditions: "Slovak" appli-
 cants were required to prove they had a clean criminal record over the previous 5
 years and were resident in the Czceh Republic for 2 years. Romani leaders protested
 that these provisions were designed to discriminate against Roma, most of whom
 are of Slovak origin.
 Current "Slovak" applicants for Czech citizenship are required to meet the same
 conditions as all other foreigners except the Czech language requirement, and they
 may request a waiver of the clean criminal record requirement (below). The prac-
 tical result of the citizenship law is that an unknown number of former Czechoslo-
 vaks of "Slovak" nationality resident in the Czech Republic at the time of the split-
 nearly all of them Roma-have found themselves without Czech citizenship. Sme
 failed to meet the law's requirements; others never applied, either out of negligence
 or ignorance of the consequences. The Interior Ministry has never given an official
 estimate of the number of unresolved citizenship cases, but it has indicated that
 several thousand applications are currently pending. The Citizenship Project, an
 NGO which actively helps former Czechoslovaks through the citizenship application
 
 
 923
 process, states that many more have not applied and that only the Government is
 a osition togauge the scope of the problem.
 Inebrar       e UNHCR released a report on the Czech and Slovak citizenship
 laws and the problem of statelessness; in April the Council of Europe (COE) issued
 a reprt on the same laws and their implementation. The UNHCR report noted that
 the placing of onditions such as the clean criminal record requirement on the right
 of former Czechoslovaks to opt for Czech citizenship "is not justified" and "does not
 follow the accepted attern established under general international legal principles."
 The UNHCR aso obsed that the Czech Republic had drawn harsh criticism for
 thus disqualifying from citizenship even long-term and lifelong residents of the
 Czech lands (i.e., those with "a genuine and effective link" with the territory as de-
 scribed in international law). The COE report found that "conformity with European
 legal standards might be doubtfulr with regard to the clean criminal record require-
 ment, noting that this particular requirement could have untoward consequences in
 cases of state succession such as the Czech-Slovak split. Both reports expressed con-
 cern at the number of cases of "de facto statelessness" among Roma. In July Human
 Rights Watch also issued a report on the effects of the citizenship law on Roma. The
 law was further discussed in the COE's Committee of Ministers in June and in the
 Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe Permanent Council in July
 and August.
 In April Parliament amended the citizenship law to enable the Interior Ministry
 to waive the clean criminal record requirement, on an individual basis, for "Slovaks"
 who had been resident in the Czech lands since before the 1993 split. The waiver
 application can be included with the citizenship application. In July the Interior
 Ministry agreed to send letters to all those whose citizenship applications were cur-
 rently pending in which applicants' right to request a waiver was explained. Accord-
 ing to the Government, all who have applied or waivers have been granted them.
 However, relatively few former Czechoslovaks have taken advantage of thin oppor-
 tunity: as of November, the Interior Ministry had granted about 250 waivers.
 Some problems with the application of the law have been addressed. For example,
 in addition to the Interior Ministrys ability to waive the requirement for a clean
 criminal record o   n individual basis, Czech citizenship is now granted upon re-
 lease from Slovak citizenship (thus diminishing the potential for de jure stateless-
 ness), and some fees have been reduced. However, other problems persist. The re-
 quirement for a clean criminal record is interpreted inconsistently and applied even
 to petty crimes. 'Slovak" applicants who have never set foot in Slovakia must still
 obtain an official release from Slovak citizenship. This requirement is also applied
 to school-age children. Rules for certain social subsidies, which only citizens or resi-
 dents may collect, require that all family members be eligible; the labor office in
 Usti Nad Labem suggested to one woman that she divorce her nonresident husband
 so that she and her children could receive benefits. Only legal guardians may apply
 for citizenship for a minor thus directors of children's institutions must first secure
 legal guardianship from the courts before applying for citizenship for their wards.
 At year's end, police continued their investigation into the case of a Karvina dis-
 trict office official who accepted improper payments in 1994, primarily from Rome,
 to expedite citizenship applications. N='s suggest that many applicants were un-
 aware that this was an irregular practice. Karvina officials subsequently revoked
 hundreds of citizenship papers signed by that official, and the applicants were told
 that they had to begin anew the lengthy and expensive process of application for
 citizenship. The official and her immediate superior no longer work at the district
 office, yet many of those whose citizenship was revoked face severe economic hard-
 ship until their cases are resolved. Without citizenship or residency they do not have
 the right to work, to health insurance, or to any or the social benefits enjoyed by
 nearly all citizens and residents.
 Fears that the situation would lead to mass deportations of Roma have thus far
 proven exaggerated. Yet several hundred individuals have been deported to Slovakia
 since the breakup of the federation, generally following an arrest and often without
 regard to long-term family ties in the Czech Republic. According to the police, 144
 persons were deported to Slovakia during the first 6 months of 1996. Police who
 come across formerly Czechoslovak individuals without proper citizenship or resi-
 dency papers have been known to expel them to Slovakia, an action which is within
 their authority. In addition, courts have issued "prohibitions of stay" to over 1,000
 persons of Slovak nationality, of whom an unknown number are Roma.
 Several skinhead attacks were directed aginst nonwhite foreigners, some of them
 foreign students at Palacky University in Olomouc. In January a Pakistani student
 was hospitalized with a concussion and other injuries after being attacked by local
 youth in Olomouc's main train station. Three skinheads were charged; however, de-
 spite the recommendation of the police and the local state attorney, the court re-
 
 
 leased them pending trial. The Olomouc chief of police stepped up patrols and stated
 his intention to take stricter measures to combat extremism. Also in January, the
 Prague 3 district court sentenced 4 youths to prison terms and ordered them to pay
 damages to an Ethiopian man they had attaced, the victim suffered a concussion
 and open fractures of the lower arm and nose. The same court sentenced two other
 youths to conditional prison terms for attacking an Armenian man who managed
 to escape from them without injury. In August four skinheads in Prague mistook
 a Japanese scientist attending a conference for a Vietnamese, beat him, and broke
 his nose; the victim was hospitalized for 8 days. One of the assailants was detained
 and charged with assault. In September a biology professor from Benin was verbally
 assaulted in a tram in Brno and kicked in the face by a masked youth wearing
 spiked boots; the investigator has charged one suspect with racial defamation.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law provides workers with the right to form and
 join unions of their own choice without prior authorization, and the Government re-
 spects this right. The work force was 45 to 50 percent unionized in 1996.
 Most workers are members of unions affiliated with the Czech-Moravian Chamber
 of Trade Unions (CMKOS). CMKOS is a democratically oriented, republic-wide um-
 brella organization for branch unions. It is not affiliated with any political party and
 carefully maintains its independence.
 Workers have the right to strike, except for those whose role in public order or
 public safety is deemed crucial. The law requires that labor disputes be subject first
 to mediation and that strikes take place only after mediation efforts fail. There were
 no major strikes in 1996.
 Unions are free to form or join federations and confederations and affiliate with
 and participate in international bodies. This freedom was fully exercised.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for collec-
 tive bargaining, which is generally carried out by unions and employers on a com-
 pany basis. Scope for collective bargaining is mre limited in the government sector,
 where wages are regulated by law.
 There are 11 free trade zones. Their workers have and practice the same right
 to organize and bargain collectively as other workers in the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or cor-
 pulory labor, and it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code stipulates a mini-
 mum working age of 15 years, although children who have completed courses at spe-
 cial schools (schools for the severely disabled) may work at the age of 14.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government sets minimum wage stand-
 ards. The current minimum  wage is approximately $95 (2,500 crowns) per month.
 The minimum wage provides a sparse standard of living for an individual worker,
 although when combined with allowances available to families with children, pro-
 vides an adequate standard of living for a worker and a family. Retraining efforts,
 carried out by district labor offices, seek to provide labor mobility for those at the
 lower end of the wage scale. Because of a very tight job market in most of the coun-
 try the enforcement of minimum wage standards was not an issue.
 he law mandates a standard workweek of 42  hours. It also requires paid rest
 of at least 30 minutes during the standard 8- to 8 2-hour workday, as well as an-
 nual leave of 3 to 4 weeks. Overtime ordered by the employer may not exceed 150
 hours per year or 8 hours per week as a standard practice. Overtime above this
 limit may be permitted by the local employment office. The Labor Ministry enforces
 standards for working hours, rest periods, and annual leave.
 Government, unions, and employers have agreed to promote worker safety and
 health, but conditions in some sectors of heavy industry are problematical, espe-
 cially those awaitingprivatization. Industrial accident rates are not unusually high.
 The Office of Labor Safety is responsible for enforcement of health and safety stand-
 ards. Workers have the right to refuse work endangering their life or health without
 risk of loss of employment.
