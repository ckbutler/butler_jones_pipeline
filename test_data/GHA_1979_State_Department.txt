 GHANA
 On September 24, 1979, the first democratically elected
 Ghanaian government in nearly eight years was inaugurated.
 The Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) had become
 the governing body following the overthrow of the Supreme
 Military Council (SMC) Government on June 4, 1979. Immediate-
 ly following the overthrow (by junior officers and enlisted
 personnel), the Chairman of the Council, Flight Lieutenant
 Jerry John Rawlings, promised the nation that scheduled
 elections would take place, and that the AFRC would hand over
 power to an elected g6vernment on October 1, 1979, rather
 than July 1 as previously scheduled. The AFRC kept its
 promise and in fact relinquished power one week earlier than
 planned (on September 24). As of December 1979 the Government
 of Ghana consisted of: A directly elected executive president
 and vice-president; an elected parliament; an advisory
 appointive Council of State; and an independent judiciary.
 The president and vice-president are elected for four years
 to begin from the date of inauguration in office. Parliament
 sits for five years from the date of first sitting, and then
 stands dissolved.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Torture or inhuman or degrading punishment is prohibited
 by Ghana's new Constitution. In the past the GOG generally
 refrained, as a policy, from the use of torture. However,
 during the tenure of the AFRC a number of military personnel
 and civilians were arrested and confined while awaiting
 charges. Although not substantiated, there have been reports
 that some persons who were arrested during this period were
 subjected to some forms of torture and brutality.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution now prohibits such treatment. However,
 after the overthrow of the Supreme Military Council in
 June 1979, eight persons were convicted by "Revolutionary
 Courts" and sentenced to death by firing squad. The trials
 were closed to the public, and it is virtually certain that
 the convicted persons were not represented by counsel or
 allowed the right of appeal. The proceedings of the court
 have never been made public as promised by the AFRC. One
 other former official has been sentenced to death by firing
 squad, but he is outside the country. The AFRC also sentenced
 about 50 persons to prison terms varying from five to 100
 years. These sentences, since reviewed by an AFRC reviewing
 authority, have been reduced substantially. The remainder of
 the AFRC-initiated "house cleaning" exercise, which may
 involve the imposition of further prison sentences, will be
 carried out by a constitutionally-established special tribunal.
 The death sentence is still a part of the criminal code, but
 except for the brief period of AFRC rule, has been resorted
 to only twice in Ghana's history as an independent nation.
 Ghana's prisons are overcrowded; food is poor and facilities
 are outdated. Conditions for those arrested during the
 AFRC-led purges were often deplorable.

 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 A preventive detention law, part of the criminal code since
 the Nkrumah regime, is still valid. Except for arrests made
 by the AFRC during the early days of its administration, the
 Act was rarely used during the past year. Prior to handing
 over power to the People's National Party Administration, the
 AFRC granted a general amnesty to several categories of
 persons being held in various prisons without trial. Follow-
 ing that action, the former attorney general stated that no
 other persons were being detained in prisons in contravention
 of the new Constitution's guarantee against arbitrary arrest
 and detention.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary retains a very large degree of independence
 which has been further enhanced by the new Constitution.
 Except for the short-lived AFRC revolutionary court system,
 disbanded since the advent of civilian rule on September 24,
 all trials are open. The court system is overloaded and
 trials are often slow; although the new administration has
 taken remedial steps to speed up judicial procedures.
 President Limann has reaffirmed the independence of the
 Judiciary. He noted, at the swearing-in of the Chief Justice,
 that his administration will "rely heavily on the courts and
 not on guns as our instrument of ensuring that the guilty are
 punished and the innocent freed." The President asked the
 Chief Justice to do all he could to ensure that cases
 brought before the courts are dealt with expeditiously,
 fairly and without fear.
 e.   Invasion of the Home
 Since the brief period of AFRC rule, when many homes were
 searched without warrants, no violations have been reported.
 The 1979 Constitution specifically prohibits invasion of the
 home.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 Income distribution is uneven and health delivery systems and
 other public services are often not available to those on the
 lower end of the socio-economic scale. The new administration
 has promised to give priority attention to these factors,
 including the expansion of agriculture, which will lessen the
 country's reliance on food imports.
 The government-supported Council on Women and Development
 continues as the most active proponent of women's rights,
 concentrating on such issues as cottage industries, health,
 political activities and children's rights. Another recently
 founded group, the Voter's Alliance, seeks to involve more
 women in critical analysis of political issues and stands
 taken by politicians. Trade unions are free to organize and
 bargain without fear of harassment or coercion from government.
 
 
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 In spite of two military governments in 1979, there have been
 no abridgements of these rights. In December 1978, the SMC
 Government lifted a long-time ban on political parties,
 following constant demands by the Ghana Bar Association,
 other professional bodies and prominent citizens such as the
 Catholic Bishop of Accra. While the new Constitution contains
 guarantees for a free press, the press is largely government
 owned. During its last days in office, the AFRC repealed the
 Newspaper Licensing Decree of 1973 -- a controversial law
 widely thought to be used by the Government to limit freedom
 of the press.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There are no restrictions on movement within the country.
 Many internal check points have been removed; they were
 somewhat inhibiting because they provided an opportunity to
 solicit bribes. There is no restriction on emigration or
 foreign travel, except that foreign exchange is still difficult
 for the average Ghanaian traveler to obtain.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Citizens of Ghana are free to participate in the political
 process. The recent elections were free and without influence
 from police or military. Ghana's Electoral Commissioner, a
 justice of the High Court, administered the registration of
 political parties and candidates and supervised the elections
 in an efficient and nonpartisan manner.
 4. Governmental Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 The Department of State is not aware of any requests by
 outside organizations to investigate human rights conditions.
