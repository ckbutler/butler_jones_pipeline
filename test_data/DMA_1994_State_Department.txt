 DOMINICA
 Dominica is a parliamentary democracy and a member of the Commonwealth of
 Nations. The Dominica Freedom Party, led by Prime Minister Eugenia Charles, has
 been in office since 1980, having won reelection in 1985 and 1990 in free and fair
 elections. The Constitution calls for elections at least every 5 years; the next one
 is due by August 1995.
 The Donica Police is the only security force. It is controlled by and responsive
 to the democratically elected overnment.
 Domiica's primarily agraran economy depends on earnings from banana exports
 to the United Kingdom. The banana industry throughout the Windward Islands suf-
 fered a severe downturn in 1993-94, and tropical storm Debbie destroyed 15 percent
 of the island's banana trees in September. The Government is attempting to develop

 its tourist industry, to diversify agricultural production, and to promote exports of
 raw fruits, veetables, and coconut products bath within and outside the region.
 Human rights are generally well respected in Dominica. In one case in which a
 policeman shot a man, the authorities suspended him     pending trial for man-
 slaughter.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings.
 However, during campai gningfor a new chief of the Carb indigenous territory in
 June, a policeman shot and killed a man. The policeman said he was protecting
 himself and others, but witnesses claimed the shooting was unprovoked and
 stemmed from a lingering feud. The authorities reduced the charges to man-
 slaughter, suspended the policeman, and released him on bail pending trial in 1995.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances or politically moti-
 vated abductions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture or other forms orcruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment, and there were no reports of such practices. Overcrowding
 and unsanitary conditions continue to be problems in Dominica's only prison facility.
 The presiding High Court justice toured the prison in October and condemned the
 sanitation and living conditions. An addition to the prison is under construction.
 The prisonprovides work therapy, sports programs, educational opportunities, and
 counseling for inmates.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law requires that police charge per-
 sons with a crime within 24 hours after arrest or detention, or release them from
 custody. This is honored in practice, except in rare cases in which, for example, per-
 sons cannot afford legal counsel.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The law provides for public trial before an inde-
 pendent, impartial court. Criminal defendants are presumed innocent until proven
 guilty, are allowed legal counsel, and have the right to appeal. Courts provide free
 legal counsel to indigents only in capital cases.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary nterference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search, and seizure. The law requires search
 warrants. While there were no official reports of arbitrary government intrusions
 into the private lives of individuals, human rights monitors allege that the authori-
 ties often searched young men with little or no probable cause in drug-related in-
 spections.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for the right of free
 expression, and the Government respects this in practice. The political opposition
 openly criticizes the Government. Dominica's main radio station is state owned but
 offers ample access for citizens to express their views. There is also an independent
 radio station owned by the Catholic Church which broadcasts, although it has not
 yet been granted an official operating license.
 Dominicans also enjoy good access to independent news sources through cable tel-
 evision and radio reception from neighboring islands. The print media consist of two
 private newspapers and political party journals; all publish without censorship or
 government interference.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government respects the
 constitutionally mandated freedoms of association and assembly and does not hinder
 opposition groups from holding political meetings or public demonstrations. Such
 meetings and gatherings were held frequently throughout the year.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for and the Government re-
 spects in practice the right of all citizens to worship freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the authorities respect them in
 practice. The Government may revoke passports if subversion is suspected but has
 not done so in recent times.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Dominica independent since 1978, has a historical tradition of democracy and
 home rule. he Prime Minister and an appointed Cabinet exercise executive power.
 The law provides for elections by secret ballot to be held at least every 5 years, at
 
 
 376
 the discretion of the Prime Minister. Indigenous Carib Indians participate in na-
 tional political life and enjoy the same civil rights accorded other Dominican nation-
 als. Although there are no impediments in law or in fact to the participation of
 women in leadership roles in government or political parties, Dominica has only one
 female Member of Parliament. The dearth of women in politics reflects socio-
 economic prejudices that have relegated women in the eastern Caribbean to tradi-
 tional employment and family roles.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no government restrictions on the formation of local human rights orga-
 nizations although no such groups exist. Several advocacy groups, such as the Asso-
 ciation of Disabled People and a women's and children's se -help organization, oper-
 ate freely and without government interference. There were no requests for inves-
 tigations of human rights abuses from international or regional human rights
 groups during 1994.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution includes provisions against racial and sexual discrimination,
 which the authorities respect in practice.
 Women.-Beyond the general protection of the Constitution, women do not benefit
 from any specific civil rights legislation. There is little open discrimination, yet sex-
 ual harassment and domestic violence cases are common, and there is no family
 court to deal specifically with domestic issues. Both the police and the courts pros-
 ecute cases of rape andsexual assault, but there is no specific recourse for women
 who are abused by their husbands. Women can bring charges against husbands for
 battery, but there are no specific spousal abuse laws.gThe Welfare Department often
 provides assistance to victims of abuse by finding them temporary shelter, providing
 counseling to both parties, or recommending police action. The Welfare Department
 reports all cases of abuse to the police. The courts may issue protective orders, but
 the police do not consistently enforce them.
 Property ownership continues to be deeded to 'heads of households", who are usu-
 ally males. When the husband head of household dies without a will, the wife can-
 not inherit the property or sell it, although she can live in it and pass it to her chil-
 dren. In the civil service, the law establishes fixed pay rates for sp ci ic jobs, what-
 ever the gender of the incumbent. There is no law requiring equal pay for equal
 work for private sector workers.
 Children.-Various laws enumerate children's rights in Dominica. Reported cases
 of child abuse increased from 127 in 1990 to 252 in 1993; the Government has not
 responded with any increase in the number of social workers assigned to handle
 such cases. Although the maximum sentence for sexual molestation (rape, incest) is
 life imprisonment, the normal sentence given is 15 years except in the case of mur-
 der. During 1992 the age of consent to sexual relations was raised from 14 to 16.
 Indigenous People.-There is a significant Carib Indian population in Dominica,
 estimated at 3,000 out of a total population of 72 000. Most live on a 3,700-acre res-
 ervation created in 1903. School, water, and health facilities available on the Carib
 reservation are similar to those available to other rural Dominicans.
 People With Disabilities.-Beyond the general protection of the Constitution, there
 is no specific legislation dealing with the disabled. There is no requirement mandat-
 ing access for those with disabilities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers have the legal right to organize, to
 choose their representatives, and to strike, but unions represent less than 10 per-
 cent of the work force. All unions are independent of the Government. While there
 are no direct ties, members of certain political parties dominate some unions. There
 was a major strike by taxi and bus workers in April 1994. There is no restriction
 on forming labor federations, and unions are affiliated with various international
 labor bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have legally defined
 rights to organize workers and to bargain with employers. Collective bargaining is
 widespread  the nonagricultural sectors of the economy, including the government
 service, and there is also recourse to mediation and arbitration by the Government.
 The law prohibits antiunion discrimination by employers, and judicial and police au-
 thorities enforce union rights. In addition, employers must reinstate workera fired
 for union activities. It is legally compulsory for employers to recognize unions as
 bargaining agents once both parties have followed appropriate procedures. Depart-
 ment of Labour inspectors under the supervision of the Labour Commissioner en-
 
 
 377
 force labor legislation, but the small Labour Inspection Office lacks qualified person-
 nel to carry out its duties.
 Labor regulations and practice governing Dominica's industrial areas and other
 export firms do not differ from those prevailing in the rest of the economy.
 C. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, and it does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum legal age for em-
 ployment is 15 years. Employers generally observe this law without government en-
 forcement.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law sets minimum wages for various cat-
 egories of workers. These were last revised in November 1989. The minimum wage
 rate for most categories of workers is $0.56 (EC$1.50) per hour, but for domestic
 servants it is $0.37 (EC$1.00) per hour if meals are included, and $0.46 (EC$1.25)
 per hour if meals are not included. The minimum wage is not sufficient to provide
 a decent standard of living for a household. However, most workers (including do-
 mestics) earn more than the legislated minimum wage.
 The standard legal workweek is 40 hours in 5 days. The law provides for a mini-
 mum of 2 weeks' paid vacation. The Employment Safety Act provides occupational
 health and safety regulation. Local nongovernmental organizations and one major
 union consider it to be consistent with international standards. The Advisory Com-
 mittee on Safety and Health is an established body but has never met. The rarely
 used enforcement mechanism consists of inspections by the Department of Labour,
 which can and does prescribe specific compliance measures, impose fines, and pros-
 ecute offenders. Workers have to right to remove themselves from unsafe work envi-
 ronments without jeopardy to continued employment.
