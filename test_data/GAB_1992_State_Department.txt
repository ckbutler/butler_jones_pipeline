 GABON
 Although President Omar Bongo has ruled Gabon since 1967, having been re-
 elected three times in uncontested elections, internal pressures beginning in late
 1989 forced him to acquiesce' in sweeping political reforms. In 1991 a new Constitu-
 tion was promulgated, which included provisions for basic freedoms of movement,
 association, and religion and explicitly abolished the old system of one-party rule.
 In 1992 the multiparty Rational Assembly, which resulted from elections held dur-
 ing the last months of 1990, grappled with the many legal ramifications of the new
 order including complex legislative initiatives on newly created constitutional bod-
 ies. The National Assembly did not have real power in the past, but the current leg-
 islature, which includes deputies from nine political parties, exhibited a growing de-
 gree of independence by criticizing the Government and by amending legislation.
 In keeping with the 1991 Constitution and the recommendations of the 1990 Na-
 tional Conference, presidential elections are scheduled for December 1993, when the
 
 
 president's current 7-year term expires. The Constitution limits President Bongo, if
 elected, to one more 5-year term.
 The armed forces are composed of approximately 4,000 Army, Navy, and Air Force
 personnel. Gabon's total military expenditures for 1989, the last year for which the
 U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency conducted a detailed analysis, were
 $140 million. There are no indications that efforts will be made to reduce these ex-
 penditures in the near future. Responsibility for internal security is shared by the
 gendarmerie-a paramilitary force of 2,700-and the national police, consisting of
 2,000 troops, which together maintain law and order in Librvifle, Port Gentil, and
 other provincial capitaIs. Security forces generally showed professionalism and re-
 straint in handling the many political demonstrations and strikes which occurred
 in 1992. However, security forces are believed to use beatings as part of the interro-
 gation process.
 Since independence, Gabon's economic policy has followed a free market orienta-
 tion in which individuals are permitted to associate with others to pursue private
 interests and hold property. Gabon is open to foreign investment and has a stable
 and convertible currenc  aon's relatively high per capita income (4,165 in 1991)
 based largely on oil revenues, belies the underdeveloped nature of the country and
 its economy. Although endowed with petroleum, manganese, uranium, and vast tim-
 ber resources, Gabon has experienced limited agricultural and industrial develop-
 ment and must import most of its food and manufactured goods. Rain forest covers
 85 percent of the country, and approximately half the population lives in rural
 areas. Due to the precipitous fall in revenue from oil exports in the late 1980's and
 an increasing debt load, the Government imposed limited austerity measures to
 meet International Monetary Fund program criteria.
 Gabon took important steps to establish the institutional framework of a
 multiparty democracy in 1992. In the spring, the National Assembly passed ena-
 bling legislation creating a National Communications Council and ado pted a new
 electoral code. However, the Constitutional Court declared elements of the code un-
 constitutional and returned the legislation to the National Assembly for revision.
 Newly established freedoms of speech press and assembly were largely respected
 during 1992 in a highly charged political atmosphere marked by trequent, and
 sometimes violent, political demonstrations and disruptive public sector strikes.
 These gains were marred by a 1-week suspension of the right of assembly in Feb-
 ruary and the death of a striking schoolteacher at the hands of security forces in
 March. Other human rights problems were security forces' mistreatment of illegal
 aliens, prisoners, and detainees, including the death of a suspect while in police cus-
 tody in December.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kiing.-There were no known political
 killings or summary executions in 1992, although two deaths with political over-
 tones resulted from incidents involving security forces. In the first, a striking school-
 teacher died when a policeman fired a rubber bullet, striking her in the neck. The
 results of the Government's investigation were never formally made public, although
 they reportedly blamed the policeman who exceeded his orders in a moment of panic
 andused excessive force.
 In the second incident, an infamous Libreville gangster known as "Fantomas"
 (The Phantom) was arrested by police in December in northern Bitam and subse-
 quently died in custody. "Fantomas" allegedly had links with a an said to be fund-
 edand gunided by elements of the former sole ruling party, the Democratic Party
 of Gabon (PDG). This incident was still under investigation at year's end.
 b. Disappearance.-Ther were no known cases of abductions or disappearances
 ascribed to government security forces or any other group.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Gabonese law and security enforcement offcials use beatings as part of the interro-
 gation process of detainees to obtain confessions. Prisoners are reportedly forced to
 march on their knees over stones; in addition, lawyers who have visited prisons re-
 port hearing the cries of those who are being beaten. The physical cnditons of the
 prisons themselves are harsh. The main facility (Central rson) has insufficient
 .od, inadequate medical facilities, and poor sanitation. However, there were no
 deaths reported as a result of these condit fons. Violence among prisoners also con-
 tinued to  a    pro lcem.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Although Gabonese law, based on French
 jurisprudence, provides procedural protections against arbitrary detention, it does
 allow nretrial eten ton or nto 48 hours. However. security forces frequently dis-
 
 
 94
 regard the procedures concerning arbitrary detention, particularly in security cases,
 by detaining persons indefinitely without char. There is no way of accurately de-
 termining the number of arbitrary detentions during the year, but it is thought to
 be several dozen. No political detainees were known to be held at the end of 1992.
 Exile is not used as a means of political control nor as a sentence for convicted
 criminals. A number of opposition figures, such as Father Mba Abessole, leader of
 the Buchern Party, have returned i~n recent years. The only remaining "exile" is
 Pierre Mambundou, who fled the country and was convicted in absentia for involve-
 ment in one of the coup plots uncovered in late 1989 by Gabonese security forces.
 He resides in Senegal.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The judicial system, modeled on that of the
 French, has several levels. In addition to the normal court system, there is a mili-
 tary tribunal to handle all offenses under military law; a state security court, which
 is a civilian tribunal; and a special criminal court that deals with fraud and embez-
 zlement of  n   by public o icials.
 The regular civilian court is composed of three tiers. The trial court (tribunal de
 premier instance) hears questions of fact and law in civil, commercial ordinary
 criminal, and administrative cases. The succeeding appellate court is divided in two,
 with a separate appeals court for criminal cases. The third and highest tier, the Su-
 p reme Court, has three chambers. The 1991 Constitution transformed what had
 een the fourth chamber into the Constitutional Court, an independent body which
 is devoted to constitutional questions.
 The new Constitutional Court, invested in February 1992, demonstrated early
 that it could act independently of the Government. In its first decision, this new
 body struck down a law passed by the PDG majority in the National Assembly that
 would have diluted the political opposition's access to the public media. Instead, the
 Court laid down rules which provide equal media access for all political parties. In
 September the Constitutional Court set aside several provisions of the new electoral
 code, including requirements for running for public office which went beyond the
 provisions of the 1991 Constitution.
 The right to a fair public trial is provided for in the Constitution and is generally
 respected in criminal cases. Nevertheless, procedural safeguards are lacking, par-
 ticularly in state security and political court trials, where the judiciary remains po-
 tentially vulnerable to intervention by the executive. In these courts, trials are open
 to the public and defendants are represented by counsel, but appeals to the Su-
 preme Court are restricted to raising points of law. The State Security Court is not
 a permanent body and is called into existence only as the Government determines
 to hear political and security cases. It was last convoked in 1990 to hear the coup
 plot cases of 1989/90.
 Recognizing the judiciary's traditional vulnerability to political pressure, the Na-
 tional Assembly in 1992 passed a law aiming at increasing the judiciary's independ-
 ence. This law gives greater autonomy and an improved career path to Gabonese
 judges.
 There are currently no known political prisoners being held in Gabon. The Gabo-
 nese human rights community was active in advocating the pardon of those con-
 victed in the 1985 and 1989/90 coup attempts. In 1991 in response to these clemency
 appeals, President Bongo reduced the sentences of the convicted prisoners and even-
 tually granted them complete pardons. The last of these prisoners was released in
 the spring.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Search
 warrants may legally be obtained after the fact- occasionally, as in the cases of sus-
 pected illegal aliens, they are not obtained at all. There were credible reports during
 1992 that in many cases the homes of those detained were ransacked by security
 forces who confiscated personal effects. The Government also periodically monitors
 both telephone conversations and private correspondence. There have been reports
 of government officials being fired or transferred for membership in opposition par-
 ties.                    .,
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-With the establishment of a multiparty system,
 most restrictions on freedom of speech and press have been eliminated. A half-dozen
 newspapers, including the Government's daily L'Union and a range of rivate
 weekliescirculate freely in Gabon. In 1991 the President encouraged ournalists to
 point out failures of individual government officials or ministries and to highlight
 inefficiency and corruption. Since then, public criticism of the President and govern-
 ment ministers has grown bolder, with leading opposition papers publishing exten-
 sive allegations of financial malfeasance by the President and other government offi-
 cials. The media carry wire service material, mostly Agence France Presse, which
 
 
 gives the public some coverage of world events. Gabon's two state-run television sta-
 tions provide international news through rebroadcasts of French television news.
 There were no instances in 1992 when information from foreign sources was
 banned.
 Opposition leaders complained that the state-controlled media did not provide
 adequate access to opposition parties. The activities of President Bongo, the Govern-
 ment, and the majority PDG in the National Assembly continued to dominate politi-
 cal reporting in the official media. Nonetheless, there was some increase in report-
 ing on opposition political activities, including radio and television interview shows,
 as well as a weekly summary of the independent press in Lunion.
 The constitutionally mandated National Communications Council (NCC) was es-
 tablished in the spring. It is charged with ensuring freedom of speech, equal access
 to the media, and equitable treatment in the press for all political parties and asso-
 ciations. The NCC made a number of public declarations in favor of expanded cov-
 erage of the National Assembly and has promised to defend the rights of journalists.
 It remains to be seen, however, if this body will have a real impact on the exercise
 of press freedoms in Gabon.
 There are no restrictions on academic freedom, but university professors went on
 strike again for a brief period in 1992 for higher salaries and improved working con-
 ditions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Government grants the
 rights of freedom of assembly and association to recognized organizations, including
 74 political associations. Permits and notification of police are required for all out-
 door meetings. The Government generally permits such meetings if they are orga-
 nized by recognized political groups or their ancillary units such as the women's
 youth, and labor movements, cultural and entertainment impresarios, or recognized
 church groups. By law, unauthorized demonstrations are not permitted but are often
 tolerated in practice.
 In February the Minister of Territorial Administration imposed a temporary ban
 on all marches and public meetings. This ban occurred against a backdrop of in-
 creasingly violent demonstrations led by the opposition Bucheron Party in su pport
 of striking primary and secondary schoolteachers. The Minister's decree, illegal
 under the Constitution, was rescinded the following week by President Bongo who
 urged the Government to maintain order in a way consistent with the principles of
 democracy. During a demonstration held in March, a striking schoolteacher was
 killed by a rubber bullet fired by a member of the Gabonese security forces.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The primary faiths are Catholic and Protestant. Muslims
 (including President Bongo) constitute less than 5 percent of the population. There
 are also significant numbers of adherents to traditional religions. There is no state
 religion, and the Constitution provides for religious freedom. Because their activities
 were considered by the Government as fostering disunity, Jehovah's Witnesses and
 several small syncretistic sects were banned in 1970 by a presidential decree, which
 was renewed in 1985. As recently as 1987, the courts sentenced 24 Jehovah's Wit-
 nesses to short or suspended terms for belonging to a banned organization. Foreign
 missionaries engage actively in evangelical and social service activities.
 d. Freedom of movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Movement both of Gabonese citizens and expatriates within the country
 is not formally restricted, but travelers occasionally encounter gndarmerie control
 points where identity cards and other documents are examined. Gabonese citizens
 may return freely to Gabon from abroad. The previous requirement that Gabonese
 citizens must obtain exit permits from the police was rescinded in 1991.
 There are approximately 200,000 non-Gabonese residents in Gabon, many of
 whom are from Equatorial Guinea or Cameroon. Immigration laws and presidential
 decrees promulgated in 1986 imposed requirements for heavy financial guarantees
 on foreign nationals (except French and American) working in Gabon and levied exit
 visa fees for each departure from the country. The gendarmerie periodically detain
 undocumented aliens who are then placed in a holding cam under harsh condi-
 tions. Most of the detainees are released after paying fines ororibes. An increasing
 number of illegal immigrants are being deported to demonstrate the Government's
 commitment to preserving employment preference for Gabonese.
 The deportation of some 10,000 illegal Nigerian immigrants in October, originally
 intended to be conducted in an orderly manner with the cooperation of the Nigerian
 Government, was hastily implemented without due process and with gendarmerie
 forces engaging in a variety of abuses against the Nigerian commumty, some of
 whom were legal residents. Credible reports indicate that in the process the Gabo-
 nese security forces severely beat a number of Nigerians shaved heads, separated
 mothers from children, andseized personal belongings. While some legal Nigerian
 
 
 96
 immigrants who were wrongfully expelled have returned to Gabon, an estimated
 15 000 Nigerians had departed by the end of the year.
 WiThe Government encourages but does not force 'regroupment" (voluntary consoli-
 dation of small rural communities into larger villages along a road) by enhancing
 the delivery of public services such as water, electricity, and schooling in the larger
 villages.
 Gabon issues its own form of refugee identification not the standard document
 issued by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). However, the local
 U.N. Development Program office and the Government are in the process of deter-
 mining the number of refugees in Gabon and are discussing introduction of the
 UNHRC document. As of the end of 1992, these discussions had not concluded, and
 the number of 'refugees" in country was not known.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The 1991 Constitution provides formal guarantees of this right including the
 right to organize and campaign in the political arena. There is a wide range of par-
 ties and a functioning multiparty National Assembly. Under Gabon's nascent par-
 liamentary system, the President names a Prime Minister as Head of Government,
 subject to confirmation by the National Assembly. Since the 1990 National Con-
 ference, there have been four governments, each under the Prime Ministership of
 Casimir Oye-Mba, but with different ministerial rosters.
 The Democratic Party of Gabon (PDG) remains the countrys pricip   political
 party. The PDG's continuing dominance is due to its established strength in organi-
 zation and infrastructure, its close ties with the President, and to the splintering
 and inexperience of the other political parties. There were credible charges of ballot
 rigging by the Government, the PDG, and some opposition parties in the 1990 elec-
 tions. Sme iregularities were also caused by the disorganized election process. In
 the end, the PDG managed to retain a narrow working majority in the National As-
 sembly, with 59 of the 120 seats going to PDG members and 3 seats going to politi-
 cal parties allied to the PDG. Eight opposition parties hold the remaining 58 seats.
 President Bongo has been reelected three times to 7-year terms in uncontested
 elections, most recently in 1986. The 1991 Constitution provides for a limit of two
 5-year presidential terms. The 1990 National Conference determined that for the
 purposes of this new stipulation, the President's current term would be considered
 is irst; thus, he is eligible to stand in 1993 for a final term and is widely ex  cted
 to do so. In sharp contrast to the past however several candidates have already
 indicated that they plan to run against President hongo.
 The presidential elections are slated for December 1993. Local elections, which
 were to have taken place in 1992, have been postponed until 1993 in response to
 opposition demands that the Government hold a new census and redraw electoral
 districts before any new elections are held. A new electoral code was narrowly ap-
 proved in the National Assembly in July, provoking an opposition-sponsored motion
 of no confidence in the Oye-Mba Government which failed. The Constitutional Court
 set aside several provisions of the code in September and returned the legislation
 to the National Assembly for amendment.
 Some Gabonese women have risen to positions of prominence and authority. There
 are five women in the National Assembly. Four government ministries are headed
 by women, and the President of the new Constitutional Court is a distinguished
 woman jurist.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Several local human rights groups operate freely in the country. While their ac-
 tions have thus far beenlimited by inexperience and poor organization, they have
 become increasingly assertive advocates of human and political rights. In 1992 a
 number of these groups expressed concern over the October expulsion of Nigerian
 immigrants from Gabon. They have also issued statements criticizing prison condi-
 tions, treatment of illegal aliens, and the general increase in crime.
 There have been no investigations by international human rights groups in recent
 years, so the Government's attitude towards them is not known. Up to now, it has
 conducted its own investigation of questionable incidents, such as the March death
 of a striking schoolteacher, without outside participation.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The 1991 Constitution forbids discrimination based on national origin, race, gen-
 der, or opinion. Gabon's relative prosperity has enabled the Government to extend
 health and social security benefits to all its people, regardless of tribal affiliation
 or region. There were no ethnic, racial, religious, or social groups that suffered dis-
 
 
 97
 crimination in 1992, though many rural dwellers allege that the central Government
 withholds resources from their portion of the country.
 Also, several thousand Pygmies live according to their own traditions in isolated
 communities, primarily in the southeastern sction of the country. They take little
 part in the political process and generally avoid contact with formal authorities.
 There are no government programs specifically targeted to assist Pygmies, who have
 never been reliably counted.
 Government and party policies are supportive of expanding opportunities for
 women. Urban women are moving increasingly into the professions because of im-
 proed educational opportunities. Although abonese family law restricts the prop-
 erty and other rights of women, there are no legal restrictions on the participation
 of women in politis, and there are increasing numbers of Gabonese women active
 in government, civic organizations, and the prvate sector.
 Despite progress madeinthis area, women are still subject to greater societal con-
 trol than are men. For example, married women are not allowed to leave the coun-
 try without the written permsson of their husbands. In rural Gabon, women still
 fil largely traditional roles bult around family and village (e.g., hauling water,
 tending fields, and other manual labor). The gradual introduction of piped-in water
 and of electricity continues to improve living standards for rural women. Legal
 rights of women are largely governed by tribal tradition though in urban areas,
 women's rights arepatterned on French law.
 According to meical practitioners, violence against women, including wife beat-
 ing, occurs. Media reports treat these incidents as contemptible vestiges of a brutal
 past. Women's groups report that most of the incidents of violence against women
 stem from domestic disputes; these cases ofen end up in court where the husband
 is charged with assault and battery.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Assciaion.-The 1991 Constitution recognizes the riht of citi-
 zens to form associations of all kinds, specifically including trade unions,'"within the
 conditions set by the law.n These conditions are defined pirther in a 1992 law regu-
 lating unions in the public sector, which allows civil servants to form unions and
 bargain collectively while limiting the right to strike of unions in the areas of public
 safety. A revised labor code, still in the legislative process, will formally abolish the
 single-union system now in existence and establish the specific legal conditions for
 the exercise of the constitutional right to form trade unions.
 In 1992 the former monopoly o    f the Gabonese Labor Confederation (COSYGA)
 was abolished and disassociated from the ruling PDG. At leat two new labor fed-
 erations have sprung upto ompete with COSYGA and one, the Gabonese Confed-
 eration of Free Trade Unions (CGSL), was a pprroved as a member of the Inter-
 national Federation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTl   in December. Pending the revi-
 sion of the Labor Code, the Government has extended de facto recognition to the
 CgSL, which operates without sestriction.
 The brief detention of a visiting ICFTU staffer in 1991 is the subject of a com-
 plaint to the International Labor Organization (ILO) whose Committee on Freedom
 of Association was examining the charge in 1992.
 Gabon's labor scene is cGaracterized by a plethora of small, company-based
 unions, formed in the wake of the 1990 NationalConference, that have struck spo-
 radically in pursuit of higher wages and benefits and improved working conditions.
 A highly disruptive strike by teachers in the primary and secondary schools took
 place in 1990 and resumed during the first months of 1992. Teachers returned to
 their classrooms in time to avoid cancelation of the academic year, but their de-
 mands remain partially unsatisfied, and the risk of a renewed strike remained for
 the 1992/93 school year. Workers of the telecommunications monopoly struck in Sep-
 tember, shutting down domestic and international phone service for several days.
 Under Gabonese law, strikes are illegal if they occur before compulsory arbitra-
 tion remedies prescribed under the 1978 Labor Code have been exhausted. The ILO
 Committee ofoExperts again criticized these and other provisions of the existing
 Labor Code in its 1992 report, while noting that revisions to the Cde were under-
 way. The Government has announced its intention to incorporate right-to-strike pre-
 visomns in the new labor code. In practice, strikers have been able to act without
 fear of arrest or reprisal; the September telephone strike took place as negotiations
 were under way, thus technically violating the law but police did not intervene, and
 there were no sanctions taken against striking workers.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-A 1992 law regulating unions
 in the public sector specifically allows civil servants to form unions and bargain col-
 lectively, though it does limit the right to strike of unions in the areas of public safe-
 ty. Unions in each sector of the economy negotiate with management over specific
 
 
 pay scales, working conditions, and benefits applicable to their industry. Agree-
 ments reached between labor and management in each sector also apply to non-
 union and foreign national labor.
 According to the 1978 Labor Code, workers may individually or collectively take
 complaints of Code violations to arbitration and may appeal to labor and national
 courts. Among the changes in the labor law urged by the ILO is a provision protect-
 ing workers against antunion discrimination. There are no export processing zones
 in Gabon.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is prohibited by law
 and is not practiced, although the ILO continued to criticize technical violations of
 the conventions on forced labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-No one below the age of 16 may
 work without the authorization of the Ministries of Labor, Public Health, and Edu-
 cation, all of which rigorously enforce this provision. Such permission is rarely
 granted, and few employees in the modern wage sector are below the age of 18.
 Children at younger ages, however, are involved-in traditional family farm labor in
 rural areas.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The 1978 Labor Code and 1982 General Con-
 vention of Labor govern working conditions and benefits for all sectors. Labor legis-
 lation provides brad protection to workers. Representatives of labor management,
 and government meet annually to agree on minimum wage rates, wiich are deter-
 mined within guidelines provided by the Government. Articles 94 and 95 of the
 Labor Code of 1978 designate an interagency group to study the status of the econ-
 omy and recommend a minimum wage for the coming year to the President, who
 then issues a decree setting the minimum wage, pursuant to Article 88 of the Code.
 The current minimum wage for unskilled labor is sufficient to provide a decent liv-
 ing for workers and their families. Work over 40 hours per week must be com-
 pensated with overtime, and the workweek must include a minimum rest period of
 48 consecutive hours.
 The Labor Code provides for occupational health and safety standards to be estab-
 lished by decrees of the Minister of Health. Adherence to these standards, which
 are generally adapted from the French model, varies greatly and usually reflects
 company policy rather than governmental enforcement efforts. Article 134 of the
 Labor Code assigns enforcement of its health and safety provisions to the Office of
 the Inspector of Labor within the Ministry of Labor, but its efforts are generally in-
 effective.
