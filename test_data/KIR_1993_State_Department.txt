 KIRIBATI
 The nation of Kiribati comprises some 75,000 people occupying 33 small islands
 widely scattered across 3.5 million square kilometers of the centraI Pacific. The pop-
 ulation is primarily Micronesian, with a significant component of Polynesian origin.
 Kiribati gained full independence from the United Kingdom in 1979 and became a
 republic within the Commonwealth of Nations. It has a nationally elected president
 and a legislative assembly with 39 members elected by universal suffrage and 2 ex-
 officio members. Local affairs are handled in a manner similar to that followed in
 New England town meetings.
 The main security apparatus is a police force of about 250 men, responsible to and
 effectively controlled by civilian authority.
 The economy is very small; most people are engaged in subsistence agriculture
 and fishing. The islands' isolation and meager resources, including poor soil and lim-
 ited arable land, severely limit prospects for economic development.
 Kiribati society is egalitarian, democratic, and respectful of human rights. There
 were no reports of specific human rights abuses in 1993, but in the traditional cul-
 ture women have occupied a subordinate role, with limits on their job opportunities.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrujudicial Killing.-There were no politically motivated
 killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no disappearances, and no evidence of people
 beingtabducted, secretly arrested, or clandestinely detained.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although torture and inhuman or degrading punishment or other such treatment
 are forbidden by the Constitution, corporal punishment is permitted under tradi-
 tional mores for criminal acts and other transgressions. On some outer islands, the
 island councils occasionally order strokes with palm fronds to be administered for
 public drunkenness and other minor offenses such as petty thievery.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Constitutional safeguards against arbi-
 trary arrest and detention are observed in practice. There is no exile, internal or
 external.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The right to a fair public trial is assured by law
 and observed in practice. The Constitution provides that an accused person be in-
 formed of the nature of the offense for which he is charged and be provided ade-
 quate time and facilities to prepare a defense. The right to confront witnesses,
 present evidence and appeal convictions is enshrined in law.
 Procedural safeguards are based on English common law. The judiciary is inde-
 pendent and free of governmental interference. Kiribati has no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The pri-
 vacy of the home is protected in law and respected by the Government. There is
 no arbitrary intrusion by the State or political organizations into the private life of
 the individual.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and press is provided for in
 the Constitution and observed in practice. Kiribati's radio station and only news-
 paper are government owned but offer a variety of views. Churches publish news-
 letters and other periodicals. Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Associatic..-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, including the riqht to form or belong to asso-
 ciations for the advancement or protection of a group s interests. There are no sig-
 nificant restrictions in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Complete freedom of religion prevails. There is no state
 or preferred religion. Missionaries are free to seek converts.
 
 
 660
 
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.--Citizens are free to travel within the country and abroad. There are no
 restrictions on repatriation. Kiribati has no refugees or displaced persons.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Government is chosen by the eople in periodic free and open elections. Exec-
 utive authority is exercised by the resident, who is elected by the people for a 4-
 year term. No less than three and no more than four presidential candidates are
 nominated by the elected Legislative Assembly from among its members. Under the
 Constitution, the President is limited to three terms.
 There is no tradition of formally organized parties. However, elections bring about
 coalitions of various interest groups around specific issues. In 1993 the opposition
 groups coalesced into a quasi-political organization under the banner of the
 Maneaba Party.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no restrictions on the formation of local nongovernmental organizations
 that concern themselves with human rights, but to date none has been formed.
 There have been no reported allegations of human rights violations by the Govern-
 ment and no known requests for investigations. Kiribati is not a member of the
 United Nations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, creed, national ori-
 gin, or sex, and this prohibition is observed in practice. Kiribati society, being fun-
 damentally egalitarian, does not have a privileged chiefly class.
 Women.-The traditional culture, in which males are dominant, has been an im-
 pediment to women taking a more active role in the economy. This is slowly chang-
 ing, and more women are finding work in unskilled and semiskilled occupations.
 There are also signs of affirmative action in government hiring and promotions to
 redress this culturally based inequity. Recent examples of affirmative action with
 regard to the advancement of women include the appointment of Makurita Baaro
 as the nation's first female Secretary for Foreign Affairs. Furthermore, the selection
 of recent participants from Kiribati in overseas training programs to the United
 States, Japan, and other countries reflects a firm commitment to the advancement
 of women. Women have full and equal access to education.
 Statistics on the participation of women in the work force and comparative wages
 are unavailable. Women have full rights of ownership and inheritance of property.
 Violence against women does not appear to be a major problem in this isolated,
 rural society. Rape is a crime under the law, and the law is enforced when charges
 are brought to court. To the extent that it exists, wife beating is dealt with infor-
 mally and in a traditional way; frequently communal pressure is brought to bear.
 Children.-If child abuse exists, it is rare and has not become a source of societal
 concern. Within the limited resources of the overnment, adequate expenditures are
 made for child welfare.
 People with Disabilities.-There is no evidence or complaint of discrimination in
 employment, education, or provision of other state services. Accessibility for the dis-
 abled has not been mandated.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Freedom of association is provided for in the Con-
 stitution. Workers are free to organize unions and choose their own representatives.
 Over 90.percent of the work force is occupied in fishing or subsistence farming, but
 the small wage sector has a relatively strong and effective trade union movement.
 The Government does not control or restrict unions. In 1982 the seven trade unions
 registered in Kiribati merged to form the Kiribati Trade Union Congress (KTUC).
 It has approximately 2,500 members, mostly from the public service sector. The
 KTUC is affiliated with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. The
 right to strike is provided for by law. However, strikes are rare, the last one having
 taken place in 1980. This is probably due mainly to the small size of the cash econ-
 omy.
 b. The Right to Organize and Barqain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is pro-
 vided for under the Industrial Relations Code. Government wage setting is the rule
 in the large public sector. The Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Employment
 sets wages after consultations with the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning.
 However, in a few statutory bodies and government-owned companies, employees
 may negotiate wages and other conditions. In the private sector, employees may also
 
 
 661
 negotiate wages with employers. Negotiations are generally nonconfrontational, in
 keeping with Kiribati tradition. There have been no reports of antiunion discrimina-
 tion. However, there are mechanisms for resolving any such complaints. Kiribati has
 noexport processing zones.
 c.Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited under the Constitution and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Kiribati law prohibits the employ-
 ment of children under age 14. Children through age 15 are prohibited from indus-
 trial employment and employment aboard ships. Labor officers from the Ministry of
 Commerce, Industry, and Employment are responsible for enforcement of these laws
 and do a reasonable job, given the rudimentary conditions of the economy and its
 industrial relations system. Children are rarely employed outside the traditional
 economy.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government has taken no concrete action
 to implement longstanding legislation authorizing establishment of minimum wages.
 There is no legislatively prescribed workweek. Government is the major employer
 in the cash economy.
 Employment laws provide rudimentary health and safety standards for the work-
 place. Employers must, for example, provide an ade uate supply of clean water for
 workers and ensure the existence of sanitary toilet acilities. Employers are liable
 for the expenses of workers injured on the job. The Government's ability to enforce
 employment laws is hampered by a lack of qualified enforcement personnel. Women
 may not work at night except under specified circumstances (generally in service
 jobs such as hotel clerks).
 DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA*
 The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) is a dictatorship under the ab-
 solute rule of the Korean Workers' Party (KWP). The KWP exercises power on be-
 half of its leader, General Secretary Kim Il Sung, who is also President of the
 DPRK. Kim f1 Sung, in power for 56 years, has largely turned over day-to-day con-
 trol of the Government and the Korean People's Army to his son, Kim Jong II. The
 younger Kim ranks second in the KWP and, with his father, is the object of a per-
 sonality cult.
 The North Korean regime is repressive and subjects its citizens to rigid controls.
 The regime establishes security ratings for each individual which determine access
 to employment, schools, medical facilities, and certain stores as well as admission
 to the KWP, but this loyalty system appears to have been relaxed somewhat in re-
 cent years. Individual rights is an alien concept that the state leadership perceives
 as potentially subversive to the goals of the State and party.
 The State directs all significant economic activity, and only government super-
 vised labor activity is permitted. The North Korean economy has contracted signifi-
 cantly due to the elimination of Russian/Soviet concessional trade and aid. Economic
 development continues to be hindered by distribution bottlenecks, nonproductive al-
 location of resources, and a poor international credit rating stemming from the
 DPRK's default on much of its foreign debt, as well as by the diversion of as much
 as a quarter of gross national product to military expenditures. From time to time
 in 1993, there were reports of sporadic, small scale civil disturbances in some cities,
 apparently caused by food shortages. Significant amounts of food grain were again
 imported in 1993. The rationing of food, clothing, and energy appeared to continue
 in most parts of the country. The KWP Plenum in December admitted serious eco-
 nomic shortfalls, hut claimed a bumper rice crop had been harvested.
 North Korea continues to deny its citizens the most fundamental human rights.
 Unlike in the previous 2 years, the number of North Koreans allowed to visit the
 United States, other than to attend U.N. affiliated functions, dropped to zero. Amer-
 icans continued to be admitted to North Korea, but this number was also down sig-
 nificantly compared to the number in the previous 2 years.
 Furthermore, the Agreement on Reconciliation, Nonaggression, Cooperation, and
 Exchange Between North and South Korea, signed in December 1991, calls for in-
 *The United States does not have diplomatic relations with the Democratic People's Republic
 of Korea. North Korea does not allow representatives of foreign governments, journalists, or
 other invited visitors the freedom of movement that would enable them to assess human rights
 conditions there. Most of this report, therefore, is based on information obtained over a period
 of time eztending from well before 1993. While limited in detail, the information is nonetheless
 indicative of the human rights situation in North Korea today.
 
 
 662
 creased family exchanges and established a joint committee to discuss implementa-
 tion. After some initial progress in 1992, the committee was unable to meet in 1993,
 and no exchanges have taken place under the Agreement.
 The North Korean Penal Gode is draconian, stipulating capital punishment and
 confiscation of all assets for a wide variety of "crimes against the revolution," includ-
 ing defection, slander of the party or State, and possessing "reactionary" printed
 matter. The regime permits no independent press or associations, and little outside
 information reaches the public except that approved and disseminated by the Gov-
 ernment.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Political prisoners, opponents of Kim
 I Sung and Kim Jong II, repatriated defectors, and others have been summarily ex-
 ecuted. The death penalty is mandatory under Article 52 of the Criminal Law for
 activities "in collusion with imperialists aimed at "suppressing the national-libera-
 tion struggle," and some prisoners are sentenced to death for "ideological diver-
 gence" and other "counterrevolutionary crimes."
 b. Disappearance.-There is no reliable information on disappearances within
 North Korea. There were reports in the 1980's, however, of DPRK involvement in
 the kidnaping abroad of South Koreans, Japanese, and other foreign citizens. The
 Japanese press estimates as many as 20 Japanese may have been kidnaped and are
 being detained in North Korea. The DPRK denies these reports.
 The 1993 Annual Report of Amnesty International (Al) details the case of the
 Shibata family of Japan. Shibata Kozo and his wife Shin Sung Suk, a Korean resi-
 dent of Japan, in 1960 left Japan and resettled in North Korea. Mr. Shibata in 1965
 was reportedly charged with spying and sent to a sanatorium. He apparently is in
 poor health, acording to former detainees, and there has been no word about his
 wife and three children since 1965. Mr. Kim Myong Sed, according to AI, has not
 received any news about his wife, daughter, or other family members still in North
 Korea since he a pp lied for political asylum in Russia in 1992.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There is no information on recent practices, but credib e reports indicate that during
 the 1980's prisoners were routinely tortured or ill-treated, and many prisoners died
 from torture, disease, starvation, or exposure. In some caes executions reportedly
 are carried out at public meetings attended by workers, students, and school chil-
 dren. Executions have also been carried out before assembled inmates at places of
 detention.
 According to AI, whole families, including children, are imprisoned together. "Re-
 education through labor" is common punishment, consisting of forced labor (loging,
 tending crops) under harsh conditions. A small number of people who claim to have
 escaped from North Korean detention camps report that starvation and executions
 are common. In one prison, clothingwas issued only once in a 3-year period. Former
 inmates have produced photographs of an inmate wearing specially designed leg
 irons which permit walking, but make running impossible. Al also reports the exist-
 ence of "punishment cells, too low to permt standing upright and too small for
 lying down flat, where prisoners are kept for up to several weeks for breaking pris-
 on rules.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Little information is available on North
 Korea's criminal justice procedures and practices, and outside observation of its
 legal system has not been permitted.
 Under North Korean law, prisoners may be held for interrogation for a maximum
 of 2 months, but this period may be extended indefinitely. Family members or other
 concerned persons twd it virtually impossible to obtain information on charges
 against detained persons. Judicial review of detentions does not exist in law or in
 practice.
 Defectors claim that North Korea detains about 150,000 political prisoners and
 family members in maximum security camps in remote areas. An October 1992 re-
 port by two former inmates made reference to the severe living conditions in what
 they called "concentration camps." The severe conditions were filmed in the summer
 of 1992 by a Japan NHK television crew when it visited, escorted by local Russian
 authorities, a North Korean-controlled logging camp located in Russia's Maritime
 Province. North Korean officials deny the existence of such gula s or prisons but
 admit the existence of "education centers" for people who "commi t crimes by mis-
 take."
 One credible report lists 12 such prison camps believed to exist in the DPRK. It
 is believed that some former high officials are imprisned in the camps. Visitors to,
 
 
 663
 and any form of communication with, detainees, although once allowed, are now
 said to be prohibited.
 In July 1991 Cho Kap Chae, a North Korean defector who had been a ranking
 official in the DPRK Ministry of Public Security, said that there were two types o1
 detention areas. One consists of closed camps from which prisoners never emerge,
 and where conditions are extremely harsh. In the other, prisoners can be "rehabi i-
 tated," and Cho reported that a prisoner he knew was released after a 3-year deten-
 tion.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The Constitution states that courts are independ-
 ent and that judicial proceedings are to be carried out in strict accordance with the
 law, which contains elaborate procedural guarantees. Article 138 of the Constitution
 states that "cases are heard in public, and the accused is guaranteed the right to
 defense; hearings may be closed to the public as stipulated by law." However, the
 concepts of an independent judiciary and individual rights, as understood in West-
 ern democracies are alien to the DPRK. Also, the Public Security Ministry dis-
 penses with trials in political cases and refers them to the Ministry of State Secu-
 rity for imposition of punishment.
 When trials are held, lawyers are apparently assigned by the Government, and
 reports indicate that defense lawyers are not considered representatives of the ac-
 cused, but rather are independent parties who are expected to help the court by per-
 suading the accused to confess guilt. Some reports note a distinction between politi-
 ca an common criminals and state that the Government affords trials only to the
 latter. North Korea equates "political criminals" with those who criticize the regime.
 Numerous other reports suggest that in the past political offenses included such
 forms of lese majesty as sitting on newspapers bearing Kim 11 Sung's picture.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Citizens
 in all age groups and occupations are subject to indoctrination designed to shape
 and control individual consciousness. This effort is aimed at ensuring reverence or
 Kim II Sung and his family, as well as conformity to the State's ideology and au-
 thority. Multiple security organizations ensure the indoctrination is evident in the
 mass media and is carried out systematically by schools and worker and neighbor-
 hood associations. Koreans with relatives who fled to the south at the time of the
 Korean War appear to be still classified as part of the "hostile class" in the DPRK's
 elaborate loyalty system. Because approximately 10 million families were separated
 by the end of the Korean War, this category encompasses a significant percentage
 of the North Korean population.
 The defector Cho Kap Chae estimated that the "impure" class may comprise 25
 to 30 percent of the population. Members of this class may still be subject to some
 discrimination, although Cho claimed that their treatment has improved greatly in
 recent years.
 The Constitutional stipulation that "citizens are guaranteed the inviolability of
 person and resid te                                  does not reflect reality. The
 Government relies upon an extensive system of informers to identify critics and po-
 tential trouble makers.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution states that "citizens
 have freedoms of speech, press, assembly, association, and demonstration," the re-
 gime permits such activities only in support of government objectives. Other articles
 of the Constitution that require citizens to follow the "Socialis norms of life" and
 to obey a "collective spirit take precedence over individual political or civil liberties.
 The'Government strictly curtails the rights of freedom of expression and associa-
 tion guaranteed under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to
 which North Korea became a party in 1981. Persons criticizing the President or his
 policies are liable to punishment by imprisonment or "corrective labor." One defector
 reported in 1986 that a scientist, whose home was bugged through his radio set, was
 arrested and executed for statements made at home critical ofKim II Sung. In an-
 other case, Al reports that a family, formerly resident in Japan, was sent into inter-
 nal exile because one of them was accused of having made remarks disparaging of
 the Government. They were last reported to be in a "reeducation through labor" cen-
 ter in 1992.
 The Government attempts to control all news that enters and leaves the DPRK.
 The visits of Western journalists are carefully managed. Russian publications that
 have written critically of North Korea have had access restricted, and during 1991
 several had their offices closed. Domestic media censorship is strictly enforced, and
 no deviation from the official government line is tolerated. The regime prohibits lis-
 tening to foreign media broadcasts except by the political elite, and violators are
 subject to severe punishment. Radios and television sets ari built to receive only
 
 
 664
 domestic programming. The Government controls artistic and academic works, and
 visitors report that the primary function of plays, movies, operas, and books is to
 contribute to the cult of personality surrounding "the Great Leader," Kim II Sung,
 and "the Dear Leader," Kim Jong .
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-No public meetings may be
 held without government authorization. There are no known organizations other
 than those created by the Government. The State even prohibits apolitical groups
 such as neighborhood or alumni organizations. Professional associations exist solely
 as another means of government control over the members of these organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides that "citizens have religious
 liberty and the freedom of antireligious propaganda." In reality, the regime firmly
 discourages all organized religious activity except that which serves the interests of
 the State. In recent years, the regime has facilitated the formation of government-
 sponsored religious organizations to advance its foreign policy goals. The DPRK
 claims there are 10,000 Christians who worship in 500 home churches, and the
 Chondogyo Young Friends Party, a government sponsored group based on a native
 Korean religious movement, is still in existence. There are a few Buddhist temples
 where religious activity is permitted, and two Christian churches-one Protestant
 and one Catholic-were built in late 1988. Some visitors attest to the authenticity
 of the church services and to the faith of the several dozen worshipers observed; oth-
 ers say the church activity appears staged.
 Kim II Sung, his family, and his juche (self-reliance) ideology are revered, and the
 cult of the Kim family approaches that of a state religion. The regime seems to be
 seeking a theological basis for melding "Kim Ilsungism  (as it is called by North Ko-
 rean media) and Christianity.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The DPRK regime strictly controls internal travel, requiring a travel
 pass for any movement outside one's home village; these passes are granted only
 for official travel or attendance at a relative's wedding or funeral. Long delays in
 obtaining the necessary permit often result in denial of the right to travel even for
 these limited purposes. Only a very small elite are allowed to have vehicles for per-
 sonal use. The regime tightly controls access to civilian aircraft, trains and buses,
 food and fuel. In Pyongyang, there are no taxi cabs, and there are only a few buses
 and street cars. Most citizens either walk or, when it is operating, ride the subway.
 Most workers are required to live outside Pyongyang and commute to and from
 work on foot, unless mobilized for special government projects when they are trans-
 ported in open trucks.
 Reports, primarily from defectors, indicate that forced resettlement particularly
 for t ose deemed politically unreliable, is common. Permission to reside in, or even
 enter Pyongyang, the capital, is strictly controlled.
 Foreign travel is limited to officials and trusted artists, athletes, and academics.
 The regime does not allow emigration, and only 1,000 or so defectors have succeeded
 in fleeing the country since 1953. The regime retaliates against the relatives of
 those few persons who manage to escape. Involuntarily repatriated defectors have
 been jailed or, in some cases, executed. Al reports that Shin Sook Ja and her two
 daughters were detained in 1986 after her husband, Oh Kil Nam, requested political
 asylum in Denmark. Oh Kil Nam has not been able to contact his family since 1986.
 In 1991, for the first time, a single North Korean citizen was allowed to travel to
 the United States to visit relatives. He was accompanied by a government official
 and returned after 2 weeks. The regime does not allow students to study outside
 of Communist or friendly Third World countries. It tightened controls over DPRK
 students studying abroad when six defected from Eastern Europe in 1989, and in
 1990 called back its students from Eastern Europe and the former U.S.S.R.
 From 1959 to 1982, 93,000 Korean residents of Japan, including 6,637 Japanese
 wives, voluntarily repatriated to North Korea. Despite DPRK assurances that the
 wives, 1,828 of whom still had Japanese citizenship, would be allowed to go home
 to Japan every 2 or 3 years, none is known to have returned to Japan and most
 have never been heard of again. Most of the returnees and their families were
 laced in the "wavering class and generally treated with contempt. As this became
 nown abroad, voluntary repatriation ceased. In recent years, the treatment of Jap-
 anese spouses appears to have improved, possibly because visiting relatives from
 Japan bring in hard currency, which is in short supply in the DPRK, estimated to
 be about $600 million annually.
 Over the past decade, the DPRK has gradually permitted an increasing number
 of overseas Korean residents of Japan, China, North America, and other countries
 to visit their relatives in North Korea. Entry by all foreigners was suspended tempo-
 rarily for brief periods in 1993 because of military alerts or for unexplained reasons.
 Visitors are closely monitored and itineraries are usually fixed, although some visi-
 
 
 665
 
 tors are able to walk freely in the vicinity of their hotels or guest quarters. Prior
 arrangements are necessary for access to apartment buildings, public buildings,
 stores, and similar facilities.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have no right or mechanisms by which they can effect transitions in lead-
 ership or changes in government. The political system is completely dominated by
 Kim I Sung and heir-designate Kim Jong Ii. The legislature, the Supreme People s
 Assembly, which meets only a few days a year, serves only to rubber-stamp resolu-
 tions presented to it by the leadership.
 In an effort to create an appearance of democracy, the DPRK has created several
 "minority parties." Lacking grass roots organizations, they exist only as rosters of
 officials with token representation in the Supreme People's Assembly. Their primary
 purpose appears to be that of promoting government objectives abroad as touring
 parliamentarians. Free elections do not exist in North Korea. Although elections to
 the Supreme People's Assembly and provincial, city, and county assemblies are held
 regularly, in all cases the Government approves only one candidate in each electoral
 district. According to the government-controlled media, over 99 percent of the voters
 turned out to elect 100 percent of the candidates approved by the regime's Korean
 Workers Party or KWP. The vast majority of the KWP's estimated 3 million mem-
 bers (in a population of 22 million) work to implement decrees formulated by the
 party's small elite.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 No organizations within the DPRK are permitted to monitor human rights condi-
 tions or to observe violations of such rights. North Korea does not belong to any
 international human rights organizations, but it has for some years sent observers
 to meetings of the U.N. Human Rights Commission.
 Amnesty International representatives visited the DPRK in 1991 and met officials
 from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Public Security, as well as with judges,
 lawyers, and legal scholars. Subsequently, the DPRK has ignored visit requests by
 the Al, Asia Watch, and other human rights organizations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-The Constitution states that "women hold equal social status and rights
 with men." However, few women have reached high levels of the party or the Gov-
 ernment. Women are represented proportionally in the labor force, with the excep-
 tion of small factories where the work force is predominantly female.
 Neither government policy or traditional social norms condone violence against
 women. The AI has reported that women are detained with their families for politi-
 cal offenses committed by their spouses.
 Children.-Social norms reflect traditional, family-centered values in which chil-
 dren are cherished. All children have access to state-provided education. Visitors to
 Pyongyang report that children are well dressed and at least as well fed as the gen-
 eral population. There are no reports of children begging or of child labor in fac-
 tories. Pyongyang has at least two amusement parks anyone department store for
 use primarily by children. The children of KWP members, disabled veterans, and
 "revolutionary heroes" seem to receive preferential treatment. Children may be de-
 tained with parents deemed guilty of political offenses, according to Al.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-North Korea has a largely homogeneous
 population, except for a small Chinese community and the Japanese spouses of
 ormer Korean residents in Japan. There are no reports of discrimination against
 the Chinese community. Systematic discrimination is unlikely since China is North
 Korea's primary ally and trading partner.
 People with Disabilities.-Traditional social norms condone discrimination against
 the physically handicapped. Handicapped persons, other than war veterans, are re-
 portedly not allowed within the city limits of Pyongyang. According to one credible
 report, authorities check every 2 to 3 years in the capial for persons with deformi-
 ties, including dwarfs, and relocate them to special facilities in the countryside.
 There are no legally mandated provisions for accessibility for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Nongovernmental labor unions do not exist in North
 Korea. The Korean Workers' Party purports to represent the interests of all labor.
 There is a single labor organization, called the General Federation of Trade Unions
 of Korea, which is affiliated with the formerly Soviet-controlled World Federation
 
 
 666
 of Trade Unions. Operating under this umbrella, unions function on the classical So-
 viet model, with responsibility for mobilizing workers behind productivity goals and
 state targets and for providing health education, cultural, and welfare facilities.
 They do not have the right to strike. North Korea is not a member of, but has ob-
 server status with, the International Labor Organization.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers have no right to or-
 ganize or to bargain collectively. Wages are set by government ministiies. The State
 assigns all jobs. ideological purity is as important as professional competence in de-
 ciding who receives a particular job. Factory and farm workers are organized into
 councils which do have an impact upon management decisions.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.--There is no prohibition on the use
 of forced or compulsory labor, and the Government routinely uses military
 conscripts for construction projects. "Reformatory labor" and "reeducation through
 labor" are common sentences for political offenses. Amnesty International reports
 that forced labor, such as logging and tending crops, is common among prisoners.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-No data are available on the mini-
 mum age for employment of children. However, education is universal and manda-
