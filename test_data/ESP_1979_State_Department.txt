 SPAIN
 During the period December 31, 1978 - December 1, 1979,
 the Government of Spain continued to give life and form
 to its commitment to democratic rule and to the protec-
 tion of human rights both at home and abroad. At home,
 a wide range of steps was taken to bring laws and insti-
 tutions into line with the provisions of Spain's demo-
 cratic constitution, which was formally promulgated in
 December 1978. These included overhaul of the legal
 framework of the nation and a major reform of the tax
 system. A natural consequence of the emphasis on
 incremental reform is that many Franco-era laws remain
 on the books, but they are systematically being
 rewritten. On the international front, Spain has
 emerged as a leading proponent of human rights. In
 October 1979, Spain deposited with the Council of
 Europe its ratification of the European Covention on
 Human Rights. The Government of Spain has agreed to
 accept compulsory jurisdiction of the European Court
 of Human Rights in interstate cases.
 It is clear that all elements of Spanish society --
 including the King, all major political parties and the
 Catholic Church -- are committed both in principle and
 practice to the concept and realization of a democratic
 Spain where human rights are fully protected.
 Spain's commitment to human rights has been severely
 tested during the past year by internal terrorism,
 particularly in the form of assassinations of police
 and military officials carried out by Basque extremists
 (ETA) and GRAPO terrorists. Such actions are intended
 to undermine the ability of the central authority to
 govern. The political leadership's dedication to and
 insistence upon democratic norms has had to cut against
 the grain of bureaucratic reflexes acquired over more
 than a generation. The restraint shown by Government
 of Spain authorities in the face of terrorist provoca-
 tion is proof of the government's commitment to legal
 principles and democratic practice.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Article 15 of the Constitution guarantees the right to
 life and to physical and moral integrity. It specifi-
 cally forbids the use of torture. This article is
 respected in practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 
 (658)
 
 
 659
 Inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment are form-
 ally prohibited by Article 15 of the Constitution. The
 death penalty is also abolished except in those cases
 which may be established by military penal law in time
 of war. Law enforcement authorities generally respect
 the law and the rights of the accused. Prison condi-
 tions and treatment of prisoners are good. Prisons are
 clean; health care is adequate; food is satisfactory;
 and prisoners are permitted to receive visits from
 family members and from attorneys of their choice. In
 addition, representatives of the International Red Cross
 have access to detainees. Spain's free press also has
 played an important role by dedicating particular
 attention to the penal system generally and to any
 credible charges of prison abuse. The Government has
 responded quickly to investigate charges of prison
 abuses and to correct those proven to exist. All
 prisoners are treated equally and there is no differen-
 tiation made among types of prisoners.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Article 17 of the Constitution prohibits arbitary arrest
 and imprisonment. It also provides that periods of
 preventive detention cannot exceed 72 hours; that an
 arrested person must be informed of his/her rights
 (including the right to an attorney); and that a de-
 tainee is entitled to explanation of the reason for
 his/her arrest. Such rights and prohibitions, includ-
 ing habeas corpus, are respected in practice by law
 enforcement officials.
 With the release from jail on July 22, 1979 of Albert
 Boadella, Director of the El Joglars Mime Group (who
 was considered by some to have been a "political
 prisoner"), there are no known "prisoners of conscience"
 in Spain. While the ultra-left, particularly in the
 Basque country, tends to label those incarcerated for
 involvement in terrorist activities as "political
 prisoners", these individuals have all been convicted
 of, or are awaiting trial in connection with, crimes
 of violence.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Justice in Spain is rendered in an equitable manner.
 The right to a fair public trial is guaranteed by
 the Constitution (Article 24) and respected in practice.
 The full range of defendants' rights is also provided
 for and protected in practice. The courts are indepen-
 dent of executive and military control, and civilians
 cannot be tried in military courts. Judges are selected
 and promoted in accordance with a strict merit system.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The right to personal and family privacy is guaranteed
 by Article 18 of the Constitution. There continue to
 be isolated instah~ces of invasions of the home, pri-
 marily in the Basque region. Almost all such entries
 
 
 660
 have been carried out in conformity with warrants
 issued in accordance with the anti-terrorism law, and
 there are now very few complaints about such incidents.
 The Government remains committed to preventing inva-
 sions of the home.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education:
 The Government of Spain is committed to meeting the
 basic human needs of its citizens. The Constitution
 specifically guarantees the right to food, shelter,
 health care and education. The average citizen finds
 the basic human needs generally satisfied. However,
 resources are concentrated in areas of greater wealth,
 particularly in the urban centers. Thus there are
 rural sectors where poverty remains a major problem.
 Unemployment in Spain has reached nine percent and
 inflation is in the range of 16-17 percent per year.
 The impact of such problems is cushioned to some
 degree by the traditional strength of the family unit
 and the welfare activities of the Catholic Church.
 Major reforms of the tax system now in place should,
 in the long run; lead to a more equitable distribution
 of income. Property can be privately owned and that
 right is protected by law. Primary education is free
 and basically adequate, although education and medical
 care are best in the major cities. Ninety-seven per-
 cent of the population is literate. Fulfillment of
 vital human needs is not hindered to any significant
 degree by corruption.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 These freedoms are protected by the Constitution and
 respected in practice. There is no censorship of the
 media. Although the two television networks are
 government-owned and run, opposition views are aired.
 Criticism of the government is permitted and journalists
 avail themselves of the right. The press takes great
 pride in its independence. No journalists have been
 intimidated, arrested or newspapers closed. Religion
 may be freely practiced and there is no persecution
 or harassment of any religious group. Freedom to
 assemble is granted to all groups. Similarly, there
 is total freedom of association.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 There are no restrictions on freedom of movement within
 Spain, on foreign travel or emigration.
 
 
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 Spain is a multi-party democratic state. Opposition
 parties function freely and have free access to the
 media at election time. Participation in the politi-
 cal system is open to all Spaniards over 18 years of
 age. No groups are denied citizenship.-
 The status of women is changing. Legally equal to men,
 women participate in most aspects of social, economic
 and political life. Women, who have traditionally
 played a subordinate role in Spain, are becoming more
 assertive, particularly on such issues as divorce and
 abortion. The trend is toward an increasingly active
 and important role for women in the political process.
 Trade unions are permitted and the right to organize,
 strike and bargain collectively are all guaranteed by
 law. The trade union movement is increasingly active.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Interna-
 tional and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 The Government of Spain has voiced no objection to
 outside investigations of the human rights situation
 in Spain.
