 MALI
 Mali is a constitutional democracy. President Alpha Oumar Konare was reelected
 to a second 5-year term in May. The Government held first-round legislative elec-
 tions in April, but the Constitutional Court canceled the results due to poor organi-
 zation of the polling process. The Government subsequently held legislative elections
 in July and August. A collective of 18 opposition parties boycotted both the presi-
 dential and legislative elections, which were administratively flawed but considered
 generally free and without evident fraud. Numerous opposition parties, however, did
 participate. The ruling p arty, the Alliance for Demcracy in Mali (ADEMA), domi-
 nates the newly elected National Assembly, which includes representatives of oppo-
 sition and ADEM-aigned parties. The President reappointed Prime Minister
 Thrabim Boubacar Keita as head of government. The Government named a new cab-
 inet in September that includes opposition and ADEMA-aligned members. The 1995
 peace agreement between the Government and Tuareg and Maur rebel groups re-
 mained in force. The Government continues to exert influence on the judiciary.
 Security forces are composed of the army, air force, Gendarmerie, the National
 Guard, and the police. The army and air force are under the control of the civilian
 Minister of the Armed Forces and Veterans, as are the Gendarmerie and the Na-
 tional Guard. The police are under the Ministry of Territorial Administration and
 Security. The police and gendarmes share responsibility for internal security.
 Mali is a very poor country with a market-based economy. Most of the work force
 is employed in the agcultural sector, particularly farmin  and animal husbandry,
 making the country highly dependent upon adequate rainalfr its economic well-
 being. The principal exports are cotton, livestock, and gold, which are the country's
 leading sources of foreign exchange. There is a very small industrial sector, largely
 based on the manufacture of textiles, beverages, and processed food products. The
 Gross National Product is approximately $270 per capita, which provides most of
 the population with a low standard of living. The Government continues to make
 progress in implementing reforms aimed at modernizing the economy. Nevertheless,
 the country is still beset by economic problems, including a poor infrastructure and
 heavy dependence upon foreign assistance. Social limitations, including a current es-
 timated literacy rate of roughly 20 percent and a high population growth rate, also
 contribute to poverty.
 The Government generally respected constitutional provisions for freedom of
 speech, press, assembly, association, and religion. However, prison conditions are
 poor, and the judicial system's large case backlog results in long periods of pretrial
 detention. The executive branch retains influence over the judiciary. However, dur-
 ing the year, the Constitutional Court demonstrated independence by rejecting sev-
 eral items submitted by the National Assembly pertaining to electoral and adminis-
 trative matters. Election related violence resulted in the deaths of-our persons. So-
 cial and cultural factors continued to sharply limit economic and educational oppor-
 tunities for most women. In September the Government upgraded the former Com-
 mission for the Promotion of Women to become the Ministry for the Promotion of
 Women, Children, and the Family. However, societal violence against women and
 
 
 children, including spousal abuse and female genital mutilation (FGM), is wide-
 spread.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-On May 11, a bomb exploded in a
 crowded Bamako market on the day of the presidential elections, killing a 12-year-
 old vendor and wounding several other persons. On July 20, unidentified person(s)
 shot into a group of people outside a polling station in San on the day of the legisla-
 tive elections, killing two persons and wounding several others. In neither instance
 have the assailants been identified.
 On August 10, a mob beat a police officer to death in Bamako outside an opposi-
 tion party meeting. The police subsequently arrested 10 opposition party officials for
 inciting violence against a police officer and for failing to assist a person in peril.
 The Prosecutor General released the 10 on bail on October 3; further investigation
 is underway. At year's end, the judicial system was reviewing the case to determine
 whether to proceed with a trial.
 In March there were three incidents where mobs attacked four individuals ac-
 cused of using magical powers to reduce the size of male sex organs or make them
 disappear. On March 28, an individual died as a result of a mob beating; two per-
 petrators were subsequently arrested.
 There were no developments in the 1994 deaths of the Swiss Cooperation Mission
 director and his two Malian colleagues, who were killed by an army patrol in
 Niafunke. A government mission of inquiry into their deaths determined that the
 actions were unwarranted and unjustified. However, to date, the Government has
 taken no action to expedite the case, which remains on file at a regional court. In
 March 1996, President Konare offered a public apology, which was accepted by the
 Swiss Government. The latter subsequently resumed its assistance program after a
 year's suspension.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitutionprohibits such practices, and the authorities generally respect
 these provisions. However, in August police officers assaulted a group of journalists
 (see Section 2.a.).
 Prison conditions are poor. Prisons continue to be characterized by overcrowding,
 inadequate medical facilities, and limited food supplies. They remain below mini-
 mum international standards. In Bamako juvenile offenders are usually held in the
 same prison as adult offenders but are kept in separate cells. Women are housed
 in the same prison facility as men but live in a separate compound. In regional pris-
 ons outside the capital, men and women are housed in the same building but in sep-
 arate cells. In these facilities, children share cells with adult prisoners of the same
 sex.
 Several organizations, including the Malian Association of Human Rights, the Ma-
 lian Association of Women Jurists, and other nongovernmental organizations visited
 Srisoners and are working with women and juvenile prisoners to improve their con-
 itions. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) continued to visit
 leading members of the former government.
 A report released by Amnesty International (AI) in December accuses the Govern-
 ment of instances of torture. The Government denied the charges and requested Al
 to visit the country to investigate its claims. The opposition generally agreed with
 the report. There were no media reports of torture during the year.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides that suspects
 must be charged or released within 48 hours and are entitled to counsel. In practice,
 however, detainees are not always charged within the 48-hour period. Moreover, ad-
 ministrative backlogs and insufficient lawyers, judges, and courts often cause
 lengthy delays in bringing people to trial. In extreme cases, individuals have re-
 mained several years in prison before coming to trial. Judicial warrants are required
 for arrest. Local lawyers have estimated that about half of prison inmates are pre-
 trial detainees. Limited rights of bail or the granting of conditional liberty exist,
 particularly for minor crimes and civil matters. On occasion the authorities release
 defendants on their own recognizance.
 In October and November, President Konare pardoned, freed on bail or conditional
 liberty, or dropped charges against 62 opposition officials. On December 8, he com-
 muted death sentences against all 21 individuals under threat of this penalty, in-
 cluding former President Moussa Traore and General Coulibaly. On December 26,
 he pardoned former Minister of Defense, General Mamadou Coulibaly, as a pre-
 Ramadon humanitarian gesture.
 
 
 1207
 Former first lady Mariam Traore and former Customs Commissioner Douah Abra-
 ham Sissoko, who were placed under detention following the fall of the Moussa
 Traorp regime in 1991, remain under detention. In 1997 they were charged with
 "economic crimes," including "abuse of a position of power," and "illicit enrichment."
 Their cases have not come to trial and remain under review by the Civil Chamber
 of Investigation.
 The Government does not practice forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, but the executive branch continues to exert influence over the judicial system.
 The Ministry of Justice appoints judges and supervises both law enforcement and
 judicial functions, and the President heads the Superior Judicial Council, which
 oversees judicial activity. During the July and August electoral period, President
 Konare respected the Court's decisions on electoral law, even though the decisions
 often went against his preferred course of action. During the year, the Constitu-
 tional Court demonstrated its independence by rejectin  several items submitted by
 the National Assembly pertaining to electoral and administrative matters. In Janu-
 ary the Court ruled that citizens of members of the Economic Community of West
 Afria States (ECOWAS) could not vote in Malian elections; the National Assembly
 deputies in multicandidate districts must be elected nationwide by one system--ei-
 ther by majority vote or proportionally; and that independent candidates could run
 in all elections. In September the Court ruled that a simple majority rather than
 a two-thirds majority could adopt ordinary laws; that National Assembly debates
 could not be held in local languages due to the status of French as the nation's offi-
 cial language; and that the National Assembly could not remove deputies from office
 for failure to attend sessions.
 The Supreme Court has both judicial and administrative powers. The Constitution
 established a separate Constitutional Court which oversees issues of constitutional-
 ity and acts as an election arbiter. The Constitution also provides for the convening
 of a High Court of Justice with the power to try senior government officials in cases
 of treason.
 Except in the case of minors, trials are public, and defendants have the right to
 be present and have an attorney of their choice. Defendants are presumed innocent
 and have the right to confront witnesses and to appeal decisions to the Supreme
 Court. Court-appointed attorneys are provided for the indigent without charge. The
 majority of disputes in rural areas are decided by the village chief in consultation
 with the elders. If these decisions are challenged in court, only those found to have
 legal merit are upheld.
 Women and minorities are not discriminated against in courts, but traditional
 practice discriminates against women in inheritance matters.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home, and the Government respects
 this right in practice. Police searches are infrequent and require judicial warrants.
 Security forces do, however, maintain physical and technical surveillance of individ-
 uals and groups believed to be threats to internal security, including surveillance
 of telephone and written correspondence of individuals deemed to be a threat to na-
 tional security.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. There are ap-
 proximately 40 independent newspapers and journals, in French, Arabic, and local
 languages. There are five daily newspapers: three are independent, one is allied
 with the ruling party, and one is government controlled.
 The Government controls one television station and one of many radio stations,
 but all present a wide range of views, including those critical of the Government,
 the President, the Prime Minister, and other politicians.
 Fifteen independent radio stations exist in Bamako, and there are approximately
 40 additional stations throughout the country. Two private television companies re-
 broadcast French, British, South African, and American television programs, includ-
 ing news bulletins. The Government made little progress toward private television
 licensing during the year.
 Laws passed in 1993 regulate the press and provide for substantial penalties, in-
 cluding imprisonment, for slander and for public injury to the Head of State, other
 officials, and foreign diplomats; these laws leave injury undefined and subject to ju-
 dicial interpretation.
 On August 11, police officers assaulted and detained for 2 hours a group of jour-
 nalists attending a press conference at the headquarters of an opposition party in
 
 
 208
 Bamako. Two of the journalists sustained injuries. On the following day, the Gov-
 ernment apologized for the incident; the 40 to 50 police officers involved were for-
 mally reprimanded for their actions. The event occurred 1 day after a mob outside
 an opposition meeting beat a police officer to death.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government generally respects them in practice. On April 16,
 the police prevented the opposition from marching in protest over the mismanaged
 legilative election. While political meetings take p lace openly, in a local decision,
 the Governor of Bamako announced in tod-year that no permits would be issued
 for political rallies during the period prior to the legislative elections due to the fear
 of mob violence. The restriction applied to the remainder of the election campaign
 (May to August) after previous rallies had turned violent. Nonetheless, several oppo-
 sition rallies were held during the period of prohibition; police sometimes used tear
 gas to disperse illegal gatherings. ollowing the election period, permits for rallies
 were issued, including one for a December 28 march and rally held by a collective
 of opposition political parties.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and de-
 clares Mali to be a secular state. The Government does not discriminate on religious
 grounds, and citizens are free to practice their faiths. Although legal restrictions on
 the Baha'i faith still exist, the Government does not enforce them, and Baha'i wor-
 ship freely. The Minister of Territorial Administration and Security can prohibit re-
 ligious publications that he concludes defame another religion, but there were no
 known instances of publications being prohibited.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government gen-
 erally respects them in practice. The Government generally does not restrict inter-
 nal movement, and does not restrict international travel. However, police routinely
 stop and check both citizens and foreigners to restrict the movement of contraband
 and to verify vehicle registrations. Some police and gendarmes use the occasion to
 extort bribes.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting ref-
 ugees. Although Mali has no legislation regarding refugee asylum and resettlement,
 the Government, in practice, provides first asylum for refugees. Those granted refu-
 gee status by the U   CR are permitted to remain, albeit in a legal vacuum due
 to the absence of resettlement legislation. There were no reports of forced return
 of persons to a country where they feared persecution.
 As many as 15,000 Mauritanian refugees remain in Mali, although their status
 has not been formalized because the Government does not recognize them as refu-
 gees. They are being assisted by NGO's and the UNHCR, which is also facilitating
 their voluntary repatriation.
 The Government has cooperated with the UNHCR in repatriating Malian Tuaregs
 from neighboring countries. More than 111,000 refugees have returned spontane-
 ously or with n  CR   assistance. The remaining 33,500 Malian refugees are ex-
 pected to repatriate by early 1998.
 Mali hosts approximately 2,000 Sierra Leonians and Liberians, 1,600 of whom are
 registered with the UNHCR as refugees. The status of the remaining 400, who have
 requested asylum, is yet to be determined.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government and did so for the first time
 in 1992. In May citizens elected President Alpha Oumar Konare to a second 5-year
 term by secret ballot in elections thnt were open to all, well-administered, and free
 of evident fraud and manipulation. Eight candidates competed for the presidency,
 although six asked to withdraw on the day before the election. The Constitutional
 Court refused their request, but permitted their names to be deleted from the an-
 nounced balloting totals.
 The Constitutional Court canceled the results of legislative elections held in April
 due to the poor organization of the polling process. The Government subsequently
 held the elections on July 20 and Augnst 3. A collective of opposition political par-
 ties consisting of 18 opposition parties boycotted both the presidential and the legis-
 lative elections; 17 parties participated in the legislative elections and s won seats
 in the Nation  eball. in e   veral instances, however, opposition candidates ran
 on the same slate as candidates from the majority party, the Alliance for Democracy
 in Mali. ADEMA holds 130 of 147 seats in the National Assembly, with 12 held by
 allied parties and 5 held by opposition parties.
 
 
 209
 
 Under the Constitution, the President is Chief of State and Commander-in-Chief
 of the armed forces and is elected for a term of 5 years with a limit of two terms.
 The President appoints the Prime Minister.
 There are no restrictions on voting, legal or otherwise, for women or minorities.
 However, women are underrepresented in politics. A total of 18 women hold seats
 in the 147-member National Assembly, compared with 3 elected in 1992. Six cabinet
 members are women. Nomadic peoples, including Fulani and Taureg, are rep-
 resented in both the Cabinet and National Assembly. The President of the Assembly
 is Fulani.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights '
 Independent human rights organizations--including the Malian Association for
 Human Rights (AMDH), a- smaller Malian League of Human Rights, and a local
 chapter of Amnesty International--operate openly and without interference from the
 Government. Since 1994 the Government has held an annual Democracy Forum in
 December to -which it invited citizens to voice discontent and grievances against the
 Government publicly in the presence of international human rights observers. The
 events are well attended by local citizens from all walks of life who speak freely.
 International media and human rights observers were present at the forum. The
 ICRC has an office in Bamako and has strengthened its presence in the north by
 opening offices in Timbuktu and Gao.
 Held on December 10, the annual Democracy Forum received live radio and tele-
 vision coverage for its 12-hour session. A panel of international 4urors reviewed 92
 questions on government performance and human rights, questioning government
 ministers on the slowness of the judicial system, insufficient number of judges, and
 poor prison conditions. The .Minister of Justice responded that he had closed the
 Kidal prison, built new prisons, and undertaken a review of the judicial system.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on social origin, color, language,
 sex, or race, and the Government respects these provisions in practice. However, so-
 cial and cultural factors give men a dominant role.
 Women.-Although the Constitution prohibits discrimination based on sex and
 provides for the basic rights of-all persons, violence against women, including wife
 beating, is tolerated and common.
 Women's access to jobs in the professions and government, and to economic and
 educational opportunities has traditionally been limited. Women's groups held a se-
 ries of workshops and seminars that assisted in increasing enrollment of girls in the
 rimary schools. For example a 1995-96 national demographic and health survey
 found that 81 percent of women between the ages of 15 and 49 received no edu-
 cation (compared with 69.3 percent of men). Women comprise 15 percent of the labor
 force. The Government, the major employer, pays women the same as men for simi-
 lar work. Women often live under harsh conditions, especially in the rural areas,
 where they perform hard farm work and do most of the childrearing. Despite legisla-
 tion giving women equal rights regarding property, traditional practice and igno-
 rance of the law prevent women from taking full advantage of this reform. In March
 1996, the Government launched a 4-year national plan of action for the promotion
 of women. The plan, financed by national, regional, and local community budgets,
 seeks to reduce inequalities between men and women in six target areas, including
 education, health, and legal rights. Under the plan there have been several work-
 shops and seminars on relevant issues. On October 30, President Konare presided
 at the .opening of a workshop on women's rights to emphasize his Government's
 commitment to enhancing the status of women.
 There are numerous active women's groups that promote the rights of women and
 children. In September the Government appointed six women to the rank of min-
 ister in the new cabinet (see Section 3). Women have very limited access to legal
 services. They are particularly vulnerable in cases of divorce, child custody, and in-
 heritance rights, as well as in the general protection of civil rights.
 Children.-Although primary education is compulsory through the sixth grade,
 only one in two children receives basic education. Literacy rates among women,
 however, remain low due to a low deree of adherence to this requirement, a lack
 of primary schools, cultural tendencies to place less emphasis on education for
 women, and the fact that most of the population live in rural areas. There is no
 constitutional or legal provision to protect the interests and rights of children, and
 no juvenile court system. However, the Malian Social Services Department inves-
 tigates and intervenes in cases of reported child abuse or neglect.
 
 
 210
 
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is still com-
 mon, especially in rural areas, and is performed on girls at an early age. According
 to the 1995-96 national demographic and health survey, at least 93.7 percent of
 women have undergone this mutilation. The Government has not proposed legisla-
 tion prohibiting FGM. However, it supports educational efforts to eliminate the
 practice through seminars and conferences and provides media access to proponents
 of its elimination. In December 1996, the Government formed a National Action
 Committee to promote the eradication of harmful health practices against women
 and children. The Committee actively engages in information and public awareness
 campaigns, training, promotion of research, legislative reform, and support for
 NGO's with related interest.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no specific legislation protecting the rights of
 the physically or mentally disabled, nor mandating accessibility. The Government
 does not discriminate against the physically disabled in regard to employment, edu-
 cation, and other state services. In October the Government sponsored a month-long
 solidarity campaign to promote the participation of the disabled in society and in-
 creased employment opportunities for the disabled. Given the high unemployment
 rate, however, the physically disabled are often unable to find work.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and the Labor Code specifically
 provide for the freedom of workers to form or join unions and protect freedom of
 association. Only the military, the Gendarmerie, and the National Guard are ex-
 cluded from forming unions. Virtually all salaried employees are organized. Workers
 have established independent unions for teachers, magistrates, health workers, and
 senior civil servants, and most are affiliated with the National Union of Malian
 workers (UNTM) confederation. The UNTM has maintained its autonomy from the
 Government.
 Early this year, the UNTM fragmented following a dispute over leadership. In
 September, however, 9 of the 12 component groups reconstituted the UNTM. Three
 groups remain outside the main body, and continue to dispute the UNTM's direc-
 tion.
 The Constitution provides for the right to strike, although there are restrictions
 in some areas. For example, civil servants and workers in state-owned enterprises
 must give 2 weeks' notice of a planned strike and must enter into negotiations with
 the employer and a third party, usually the Ministry of Labor. The Labor Code pro-
 hibits retribution against strikers, and the Government respects this requirement
 in practice. During the year, post office, teachers, police, and electrical workers
 unions threatened to go on strike. Each subsequently negotiated and signed collec-
 tive bargaining agreements.
 Unions are free to associate with and partici ate in international bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The growth of independent
 unions has led to more direct bargaining between these unions and their employers.
 Wages and salaries, however, for those workers belonging to the UNTM unions are
 set by tripartite negotiations between the Ministry of br, labor unions, and rep-
 resentatives of the federation of employers of the sector to which the wages apply.
 These negotiations usually set the pattern for unions outside the UNTM. The Min-
 istry of Labor acts as a mediator in labor disputes.
 Neither the Constitution nor the Labor Code addresses the question of antiunion
 discrimination, but there have been no reports or complaints of antiunion behavior
 or activities. If the parties cannot come to agreement, the dispute goes to the Labor
 Court for decision.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor. However, a history of de facto slavery in northern salt mining
 communities has been reported. There is a hereditary service relationship between
 members of the Bellah ethnic group and Taureg populations. There are reliable ac-
 counts of incidents of Bellahs voluntarily leaving their Tuareg families and of rejoin-
 ing the households of Tuaregs repatriated from neighboring countries. There were
 no confirmed reports that Bellabs were bought and sold.
 Although there have been no reports of forced or bonded child labor, apprentice-
 ship, often in a family member's or a parent's vocation, begins at an early age, espe-
 cially for children unable to attend school.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Gov-
 ernment adopted a Labor Code in 1996 that has specific policies pertaining to child
 labor. The Labor Code prohibits forced or bonded child labor, and the authorities
 enforce this provision through the use of labor inspectors. Inspectors from the Min-
 
 
 211
 istry of Employment, Public Service, and Labor conduct surprise and complaint-
 based inspections. However, resource limitations restrict the frequency and effec-
 tiveness of oversight by the Labor Inspection Service and the Service operates only
 in the modern sector (see Section 6.c.).
 The Labor Code permits children between the ages of 12 and 14 to work up to
 2 hours per day during school vacations with parental approval. Children between
 -the ages of 14 and 16 may work up to 40 hours per day with the permission of a
 labor inspector, but not during nights, holidays, or Sundays. Children between the
 ages of 16 and 18 may work in jobs that are not physically demanding; males may
 work up to 8 hours per day and females up to 6 hours per day.
 These regulations are often ignored in practice. Moreover, the Labor Code has no
 effect on the vast number of children who work in rural areas, helping with family
 farms and herds, and in the informal sector, e.g., street vending. These children are
 not protected by laws against unjust compensation, excessive hours, or capricious
 discharge.
 Education is free and in principle is open to all, although the majority of students
 leave school by the age of 12. While primary school is compulsory, it is only avail-
 able to one-half of the children. Child labor predominates in the agricultural sector,
 and to a lesser degree in crafts and trades apprenticeships, and cottage industries.
 e, Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code specifies conditions of employ-
 ment, including hours, wages, and social security, but in practice many employers
 either ignore or do not comply completely with the regulations. The national mini-
 mum wage rate, set in 1994, is approximately $40 (cfa 21,000) per month. Workers
 must be paid overtime for additional hours. The minimum wage is supplemented
 by a required package of benefits, including social security and health care. While
 this total package could provide a minimum standard of living for one person,  in
 practice most wage earners support large extended families and must supplement
 their income by some subsistence farming or work in the informal sector.
 The normal legal workweek is 40 hours (45 hours for agricultural employees),
 with a requirement for at least one 24-hour rest period. The Social Security Code
 provides a broad range of legal protection against hazards in the workplace, and
 workers' groups have brought pressure on employers to respect parts of the regula-
 tions, particularly those affecting personal hygiene. With unemployment high, how-
 ever, workers are often reluctant to report violations of occupational safety regula-
 tions. The Labor Inspection Service of the Ministry of Labor oversees these stand-
 ards but limits enforcement to the modern, formal sector. Workers have the right
 to remove themselves from dangerous work situations and request an investigation
 by the Social Security Department, which is responsible for recommending remedial
 action where deemed necessary.
