 ITALY
 Italy is a democratic, multiparty republic with a
 parliamentary system of government. Legislative power is
 invested in the Parliament, which is directly and freely
 elected on the basis of universal adult suffrage. Executive
 authority is concentrated in the Council of Ministers, which
 is currently led by Prime Minister Ciriaco De Mita from the
 Christian Democratic Party. Italy has an independent
 judiciary. The chief of state, the President, is elected by
 Parliament and representatives of Italy's 20 regions.
 Terrorist violence of both the left and right has remained at
 low levels in recent years, due to the effective work of
 police and magistrates and its overwhelming rejection by the
 people as -a whole. Although terrorism has yet to be
 completely overcome, its considerable reduction has freed
 increased law enforcement resources for the struggle against
 organized crime, which remains a serious problem.
 Italy has an industrialized market economy ranking among the
 top 10 in the world in gross national product. It is
 characterized by sizable government ownership in the primary
 industrial sectors and by a dynamic private sector, comprising
 es cially small and medium-sized companies.
 The drafters of Italy's post-World War II Constitution were
 strongly influenced by Roman Catholic, social democratic, and
 labor union traditions. The Constitution contains provisions
 for political and civil rights that are generally observed in
 practice.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Neither government forces nor legal opposition organizations
 engage f n golitically motivated killings.
 Levels of terrorist violence have dropped in recent years. In
 1988 terrorists associated with the so-called Red
 Brigades-Party of Combatant Communists (BR-PCC) claimed
 responsibility for the killing of Christian Democratic Senator
 Roberto Ruffilli in April. In a manifesto discovered after
 the killing, the group declared that Ruffilli had been killed
 because he was one of the masterminds of the De Mita
 Government's program for reforming the Italian State and that
 this program, if successful, would further delay the
 revolution which the BR-PCC was awaiting. In September the
 Carabinieri arrested a group of persons, some of whom are
 suspected of involvement in the Ruffilli murder, and seized
 information on future operations planned by this group. The
 French subsequently arrested a suspected participant in the
 Ruffilli assassination.
 The other major politically motivated killing in 1988 was the
 bombing of the United Services Organization club in Naples on
 April 14. One American and four Italians were killed in this
 bombing. Responsibility for the attack has been claimed by a
 little-known group calling itself the Anti-Imperialist
 Brigades.

 b. Disappearance
 There were no cases of disappearance or kidnapings.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from torture is provided for by law and respected in
 practice. Cruel and degrading punishment is forbidden by law,
 and cases of violations have been rare. There were no
 allegations of ill-treatment of prisoners during 1988.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Police procedures in Italy are carefully controlled by law and
 judicial oversight. Arbitrary arrest is not practiced.
 Anyone detained by the authorities must be charged within 48
 hours. In normal criminal cases, the permitted duration of
 pretrial detention varies according to the gravity of the
 crime. Under reforms passed in 1984, the maximum time that
 any person may be held in pretrial detention, even for the
 most serious crimes, is 5 1/2 years and no more than 2 years
 at each step of the trial and during the long appeals
 process. Lengthy pretrial detention remains a problem in
 Italy. As a safeguard against abuse, "liberty tribunals" are
 empowered to review evidence in cases of persons awaiting
 trial and to decide whether continued detention is warranted.
 Exile as a form of punishment is unknown. With regard to
 forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A fair trial is assured by law and observed in practice in
 almost all cases. Counsel is provided for the accused, free
 of charge, if necessary. Trial procedures are often
 cumbersome, with the result that trials frequently last an
 inordinately long time.
 The judiciary is independent of the executive, and there are
 no political or security courts. All cases may be appealed to
 the highest appellate court, the Court of Cassation. There
 are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The concept of the privacy of the home is legally safeguarded
 and respected by the authorities. Searches and electronic
 monitoring may be carried out only under judicial warrant and
 in carefully defined circumstances.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Free speech and a free press are assured under Italy's
 democratic political system, which allows expression of a wide
 spectrum of political views. Although there is no censorship,
 publications may be seized for violation of obscenity laws or
 for defamation of state institutions. These powers are seldom
 invoked. Government-run radio and television are politicized
 at the administrative level but are open to widely differing
 views. A large number of private radio stations have begun
 broadcasting since the early 1980's to provide competition for
 
 
 1108
 ITALY
 the state-owned broadcasting system. Public and private
 stations air vigorous debate on political and social issues.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Italian citizens freely exercise their right of free assembly,
 which is limited only in cases where national security or
 public safety is endangered. Permits are not required for
 meetings, but organizers of public demonstrations must notify
 the police in advance. Professional and employer associations
 organize and represent their constituencies freely.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Persons are free to profess and practice any religious faith.
 All religions are free to organize and proselytize within the
 limits imposed by the laws governing public order. The
 Government has reached agreements with some religious groups
 to define their rights and standing.
 Italy's relations with the Roman Catholic church are governed
 by a 1984 agreement (Concordat) between the Italian Government
 and the Holy See, ratified in 1985. The agreement, which
 replaced the Concordat of 1929, recognizes the rights and
 place of Catholicism but no longer accords it the status of a
 state religion. The Roman Catholic Church continues
 informally to enjoy special standing in Italy because of the
 presence of the Vatican and because the overwhelming majority
 of Italians are, at least nominally, Roman Catholic. Roman
 Catholic religious instruction is offered in the public
 schools as an optional subject.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Italian citizens may travel freely both within the country and
 abroad. Emigration is unrestricted. Citizens who leave are
 guaranteed the right to return, and the Constitution forbids
 deprivation of citizenship for political reasons. Although it
 does not normally offer permanent resettlement to political
 refugees, Italy has provided temporary haven for many persons
 fleeing persecution who are eventually resettled in third
 countries. There were no cases of forced repatriation of
 political refugees in 19&8.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Italy has a democratic, free parliamentary system. Although
 the Constitution outlaws the Fascist party, a wide range of
 organized and active political parties exists from the far
 left to the far right of the political spectrum. Election
 campaigns are free and open, and voting is by secret ballot.
 The two chambers of Parliament and regional, provincial, and
 municipal councils are elected at regular intervals.
 Opposition groups are active and are frequently able to alter
 or reject government policies.
 In Parliament, 81 of 630 deputies and 20 of 315 senators are
 women. Of five appointed senators for life, one is a woman.
 Women occupy 2 of the 30 ministerial positions.

 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Nongovernmental organizations are free to investigate
 conditions in Italy, attend trials, and publish their findings.
 The Italian Government and nongovernmental human rights
 organizations support human rights around the world. Italy
 participates fully in various international human rights
 organizations. Political parties and religious groups
 participate in activities aimed at promoting respect for human
 rights. Organizations active in human rights affairs include
 Amnesty International, the Official Interministerial CoMmittee
 for the Rights of Man, the Institute of Humanitarian Law, and
 Caritas International. The Government is considering the
 establishment of a committee to monitor the status of human
 rights in Italy. The already existing Interministerial
 Committee is responsible only for monitoring human rights
 abroad.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There is no legal discrimination on the basis of race,
 religion, sex, ethnic background, or political opinion.
 German speakers in the Alto Adige region bordering on Austria
 have claimed for many years that they were discriminated
 against on the basis of language--particularly in legal
 proceedings and in the schools--and a recently enacted package
 of reforms is aimed at providing further protection for them.
 This reform package is currently awaiting approval by the
 Austrian Government, whose consent is a formality, since
 approval by the Italian Parliament has already given the new
 measures the force of law. Italian speakers have complained
 that the new concessions to the German-speaking minority have
 in fact resulted in reverse discrimination. Italian speakers,
 who are a minority in many parts of the region, have claimed
 that they are discriminated against in obtaining housing and
 employment. The gradual out-migration of Italian speakers
 from the area will make the achievement of a balance between
 the two ethnic groups more difficult in the future.
 The condition of women in Italy has improved greatly over the
 past 20 years. Women participate freely in political and
 social life, but, despite legal guarantees, employers continue
 to favor men over women in filling jobs, particularly those
 with prospects for advancement to management.
 In January 1988, women constituted 36.6 percent of the total
 labor force, and their proportion of the total is increasing.
 Most women are employed in the service sector (64 percent of
 employed women), with 24 percent working in industry and 12
 percent in agriculture.
 Only a small percentage of Italian women hold managerial
 positions. They are also poorly represented in the
 professions. Recent statistics are lacJLihg, but in 1981, for
 instance, less than 10 percent of Itarian lawyers were women.
 Women tend to remain in traditional'employment areas, although
 women police officers are beginning to appear in many Italian
 c i t i e s ....
 Up to the early 1960's, employers could legally dismiss a
 woman who married. Since 1963 it has been illegal to dismiss
 
 
 1110
 ITALY
 a female employee within 1 year of her marriage date except
 "for cause." Women enjoy equal rights with men in marriage.
 In the event of divorce, a woman is entitled to a share of the
 survivor's pension and any inheritance in the event of the
 death of her ex-husband. The property of a married couple is
 considered community property unless husband and wife agree to
 keep their property divided. All assets acquired prior to
 marriage are exempt from the community property provision.
 Italy does not have any important national women's rights
 groups independent of political parties or trade unions.
 Section 6 Worker Rights -
 a. The Right of Association
 The Workers' Statute of 1970 provides that "the right to
 establish trade union associations, to join them and to carry
 out union activities is guaranteed to all workers inside their
 places of work." Trade unions are not government controlled,
 and the Constitution fully protects their right to strike,
 which is frequently exercised.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right of workers to organize and bargain collectively is
 protected by the Constitution. Labor-management relations are
 governed by legislation, custom, collective bargaining
 agreements, and labor contracts. A key element of labor-
 management-government cooperation affecting the industrial
 relations climate has been the 1986 agreement on indexing
 wages (scala mobile) to the cost of living every 6 months.
 Approximately 40 per cent of Italian workers are covered by
 collective bargaining agreements. Voluntary, nonbinding
 mediation is provided by the Ministry of Labor and is often
 effective in bringing labor and management together.
 There are no areas of the country, such as export processing
 zones, where union organizations and collective bargaining are
 impeded or discouraged.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Under current legislation, no child under 15 years of age may
 be employed (with some specified exceptions). The Ministry of
 Labor, having consulted with the labor organizations, may, as
 an exception, authorize the employment on specific jobs of
 children over 12 years of age. The minimum age is 15 for men
 employed in dangerous, fatiguing, and unsanitary work, and
 16 for men employed underground; in quarries, mines, and
 tunnels without mechanical vehicles; in weight lifting and
 carrying; in loading and unloading sulphur ovens in Sicily;
 and in occupations harmful to the workers' morale. No worker
 under 18 years may be employed in driving and pulling trucks
 and carriages, or in jobs for the manufacture, handling, and
 salvaging of explosives. No women, regardless of age, are
 permitted to be employed underground, in quarries, mines, or
 tunnels. Only women over 21 are allowed to work in dangerous,
 fatiguing, and unsanitary jobs, on the cleaning and servicing
 of engines, or on moving machinery.

 ITALY
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum work and safety standards are established by law and
 buttressed and extended in collective labor contracts. The
 basic law of 1923 provides for a maximum workweek of 48
 hours--no more than 6 days per week and 8 hours per day. The
 8-hour day may be exceeded for some special categories. Most
 collective labor agreements provide for a 36- to 38-hour
 week. Overtime may not exceed 2 hours per day or an average
 of 12 hours per week.
 There is no minimum wage set under Italian law; basic wages
 and salaries are set forth in collective labor agreements.
 National collective labor agreements contain minimum standards
 to which individual employment agreements must conform. In
 the absence of agreement between the parties, the courts may
 step in to determine fair wages on the basis of practice in
 related activities or related collective agreements.
 Basic health and safety standards and guidelines for
 compensation for on-the-job injury are set forth in an
 extensive body of law and regulations.. In most cases, tihese
 standards are exceeded in collective bargaining agreements.
 Enforcement of health and safety regulations is entrusted to
 labor inspectors, an autonomous group within the Labor
 Ministry who, since 1981, have the same status as judicial
 police officers. Inspectors make periodic visits to companies
 to ensure observance of safety regulations. Violators can be
 fined or even imprisoned. Trade unions also play an important
 role in reporting safety violations to inspectors.
 Despite these enforcement provisions, Italy has experienced a
 rising number of on-the-job accidents, from a total of 769,374
 in 1985 to 812,734 in 1988. Part of the problem is an
 inadequate number of inspectors. Due to high unemployment,
 there is also pressure on workers-to accept unsafe conditions
 as a necessary evil if they are to have a job. There are many
 substandard workplaces in Italy, especially in the south.
