 Brunei is a small, wealthy, Islamic monarchy located on the
 north coast of Borneo. It is predominantly Malay in
 population, although there are substantial Chinese and other
 minorities. Brunei is ahereditary and traditional Sultanate
 that has been ruled by the same family for over 500 years. A
 British protectorate until January 1, 1984, it has been
 internally self-governing since 1959.
 The Constitution promulgated in 1959 provided for the first
 sharing of political power by the Sultan with an advisory
 Council of Ministers. The Constitution, however, permits the
 Sultan to override the decisions of legislative and executive
 bodies in most instances. In elections for a legislative
 council in 19'62, a party opposed to policies of the Sultan won
 a large majority; tensions over policy differences led to an
 armed uprising in December 1962 that was put down by British
 troops. The Sultan then invoked an article in the
 Constitution that allowed him to assume emergency powers for 2
 years. This state of emergency has been renewed every 2 years
 and is still in force. Several persons detained under
 emergency powers following the 1962 uprising remain in custody
 without trial. Although the Constitution is not suspended,
 the state of emergency allows the Sultan great latitude in
 ruling by orders. These orders have in effect suspended
 certain articles of the Constitution.
 The activities of the Royal Armed Forces are devoted to
 protecting the country against external threat and they are
 not involved in maintaining internal security. The police
 force is firmly under the control of the civil authorities,
 and there is no evidence that it resorts to extralegal
 measures in the discharge of its duties.
 Since 1962 there have been no disturbances or agitation in
 Brunei. Economic factors have much to do with the general
 sense of well-being. Brunei has only about 240,000 people,
 but produces about 150,000 barrels of oil per day and slightly
 over 5 million tons of liquefied natural gas per year. It has
 one of the highest per capita gross national products in the
 world. Brunei has no debts, and the nation's financial
 reserves are commonly estimated at between $20 and $30
 billion. Petroleum revenues and interest on invested reserves.,
 allow the Government to provide free medical care, schools,
 and university training to its citizens. A large proportion
 of the Malay population is employed by the Government at
 generous salaries which permit a higher standard of living
 than in surrounding countries. Government employees are
 eligible for low-interest or no-interest loans to purchase
 homes, automobiles, and appliances. The nation 's second
 largest employer, Brunei Shell, provides similar benefits to
 its employees. Brunei has no income tax. There are several
 substantial, low-cost housing plans designed to provide homes
 for the landless. There is a chronic shortage of labor
 throughout the economy, which helps to keep employee wage and
 benefit packages high and makes it relatively easy for women
 to find work in traditionally male occupations.
 There were no major human rights developments during the year;
 human rights remain restricted with regard to arbitrary
 detention, freedoms of speech, press, and association, and the
 right of citizens to change the government.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of politically motivated killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 In late 1988 whipping became mandatory as punishment for
 certain offenses, including rape, assault, extortion, robbery,
 theft, vandalism, and drug-related crimes. Since then,
 occasional sentences of whipping have in fact been handed down
 and carried out. Previously, the penal code allowed for
 whipping, but in practice this punishment was rarely
 administered. There was no other evidence of torture or
 cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution has no provision for habeas corpus. The
 right exists, however, as the Application of Laws Act states
 that the Law of England (1951) applies except where Brunei has
 passed its own law. Under normal circumstances, a magistrate
 must "endorse" a warrant for arrest. On rare occasions,
 warrants are issued without this endorsement.
 The Internal Security Act (ISA) permits the Government to
 detain suspects without trial for renewable 2-year periods.
 Since the abortive rebellion in 1962, the Government has
 occasionally used the ISA to detain persons suspected of
 antigovernment activity.
 The Government acknowledges that five former members of the
 Brunei People's Party (BPP) have been in detention under the
 ISA since 1962 when that party was banned for its role in the
 abortive uprising. Amnesty International (AI) has said it
 believes the five BPP members are being held not for any role
 in the 1962 rebellion, but as a general deterrent to political
 activity. Two former leaders of the Brunei National
 Democratic Party (BNDP) have also been in detention under the
 ISA since February 1988, when that party was dissolved by the
 Government. None of these detainees have been tried or
 convicted of any crime.
 In previous years the Government had announced the release of
 some ISA detainees around the time of the Sultan's birthday on
 July 15. None were announced in 1989.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The legal system in Brunei is derived from the British
 system. Those suspected of common crimes are detained, tried,
 and punished according to the law. Lacking a senior judiciary
 of its own, the Brunei High Court has for its Chief Justice a
 
 
 776
 judge seconded from Hong Kong. There were no known instances
 of interference with the judiciary by the Government in 1989.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Although the Government is empowered by law to intrude into
 the privacy of individual persons, families, or homes, in
 practice it has not been known to do so.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedofs of speech and press, though not restricted by law,
 are not generally exercised. There is no political
 opposition, and hence there have been no challenges which
 might have tested the degree of government tolerance of
 political criticism.
 Brunei's only television station is government owned (two
 Malaysian stations can also be received). It usually avoids
 controversial issues, as do newscasts on the radio stations.
 The single independent weekly newspaper generally avoids
 controversial issues. A second weekly newspaper is published
 by the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom to assemble for political purposes has not been
 seriously tested in recent years. In 1985 the Government
 allowed establishment of the Brunei National Democratic Party
 (BNDP), the first political party since party activity was
 prohibited in 1967. Just before its.first public meeting, the
 Government announced that government employees could not
 attend party meetings, become members of political parties, or
 otherwise engage in organized political debate. In February
 1988, the Government dissolved the BNDP and detained two of
 its leaders, charging that the party's contacts with the
 International Democratic Union were in violation of the
 Societies Act.
 In 1986 the Government approved the establishment of a second
 political party, the Brunei National United-Party (BNUP);
 however, the organizers never announced its formation, and
 nothing further has been heard of it. The Government requires
 the registration of private economic, recreational, or other
 organizations.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the official state religion, but the Constitution
 provides for freedom of worship for other religions. There
 are several Christian churches in the country. There are also
 missionary schools in Brunei.

 BRUN1EI
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on freedom of movement in the
 country for citizens, permanent residents, and expatriates.
 Some restrictions on travel abroad are placed on certain
 expatriates as part of contract obligations to the
 Government. Travel to Communist nations is restricted, and
 travel to China by Brunei's ethnic Chinese citizens and ethnic
 Chinese residents is tightly controlled. Brunei has not been
 willing to accept refugees. In September 1989, a boat with
 approximately 40 refugees from Vietnam was found in Brunei
 waters. The refugees were given food, water, and medical
 attention for about a week while their boat was being
 repaired, at which time they were given provisions and
 required to depart.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 There is no way in which citizens can change their government
 through established democratic processes. Under the
 continuing state of emergency, there are no representative
 bodies at the national or local level and, since the
 dissolution of the BNDP in 1988, no known functioning
 political parties. However, citizens may seek to influence
 government by working through appointed village headmen and
 district officers, who meet regularly with their
 constituents. They may also attempt to effect change by
 petitioning the Sultan directly.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no government or private organizations in Brunei
 which deal specifically with the protection of human rights.
 AI reports it has on several occasions appealed to the Sultan
 for the release of a number of political prisoners, some held
 for many years without trial, but has received no reply. In
 1988 the Government appeared before the United Nations Human
 Rights Commission to answer AI allegations of human rights
 violations relating to ISA detentions. The Government
 acknowledged the detentions, but maintained that they are
 justified in the interest of national security.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Women are denied equal status with men in a number of
 important areas'such as divorce, inheritance, and custody of
 children. While there are no separate pay scales for women
 and men, women in the work force traditionally have been
 concentrated in lower paying clerical and secretarial jobs,
 and have been less likely to find positions offering rapid
 advancement. In recent years, however, employment
 opportunities for women have greatly improved throughout the
 economy, largely because of a chronic labor shortage. A
 growing number of women hold senior level professional
 positions, and the number of female university graduates is
 also increasing. Religious authorities strongly encourage
 Brunei Muslim women to wear the tudong, a traditional head
 covering, and a growing number do so. There is no pressure on
 non-Muslim women to wear the tudong, and few, if any, choose
 to wear it.
 
 
 778
 BRUNEI
 The incidence of domestic violence against women is extremely
 low. Because of the close-knit nature of Bruneian society,
 this kind of behavior would be difficult if not impossible to
 conceal, and would not be tolerated. The criminal penalty for
 a minor d6mestic assault would be 1 to 2 weeks in jail and a
 fine. An assault resulting in serious injury, such as broken
 bones, would be punished by whipping and a longer jail
 sentence. Rape cases are similarly rare.
 The majority of the substantial Chinese minority in Brunei are
 not citizens (those having no claims to other nationalities
 were "British-protected persons" prior to independence and are
 now either stateless permanent or temporary residents).
 Permanent residents cannot own land but usually resolve this
 problerd through 7-year leases, the maximum amount of time for
 lease agreements in Brunei. The process of obtaining
 citizenship in Brunei is long and difficult. In general, the
 Chinese community has prospered in Brunei, and much of the
 country's commercial activity is in Chinese hands. While the
 Chinese have done well economically, many are now reevaluating
 their position in Brunei, especially the prospects of their
 children in a society in which Malay citizens are favored in
 such areas as government employment. Some are emigrating to
 other nations, especially Australia and Canada.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Trade unions are legal in Brunei but must be registered with
 the Government. Signatures of seven members are required for
 registration. There are four registered trade unions, with a
 total membership amounting to less than 5 percent of the work
 force. The Trade Unions Act of 1962 permits the formation of
 trade union federations in Brunei, but forbids affiliation of
 Brunei trade unions with labor organizations outside Brunei.
 Brunei is not a member of the International Labor
 Organization. An individual contract is required between an
 employer and each employee, but trade union activities are not
 illegal and cannot be deemed to violate employee contracts.
 Local legal experts interpret this provision as conferring the
 right to strike. However, there have been no strikes in
 recent memory.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There is no government interference with lawful union
 activity. It is illegal to refuse employment or discriminate
 against an employee for being or not being a member of a trade
 union. While unions are legal and easy to register,
 conditions in Brunei are not conducive to the development of
 trade unions. Wage and benefit packages far exceed those of
 neighboring nations; there is a lack of those kinds of
 industries in which unions have traditionally developed; and
 there is a.long cultural tradition of trying to achieve
 consensus rather than cause confrontation. As a result,
 collective bargaining is limited to only a few industries.
 There are no export-processing zones in Brunei.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is prohibited and it is not practiced.
 
 
 779
 BRUNEI
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Employment of children below the age of 16 is prohibited, and
 below the age of 18 requires parental consent and approval by
 the Labor Commission. Women under 18 may not-work at night or
 on offshore oil platforms. Laws on employment of children are
 effectively enforced.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Labor is in short supply, and market forces allow most
 citizens of Brunei to command high wages. The minimum wage in
 Brunei is approximately $11.35 per day for citizens and
 permanent residents, and approximately $9.80 per day for
 foreigners. There is no special minimum wage for any
 particular industry. Overtime must be paid for work in excess
 of 48 hours, and double time must be paid for work performed
 on legal holidays. Working conditions are subject to
 inspection by the Labor Commission on a routine basis and in
 response to complaints. Brunei's labor regulations are
 effectively enforced by the Labor Department, which is
 empowered to close any place of employment in which health,
 safety, or working conditions are unsatisfactory.
