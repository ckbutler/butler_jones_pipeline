 Fiji's system of parliamentary government, inherited when the country gained
 independence from Great Britain in 1970, was interrupted in 1987 with the installa-
 tion of a military-led regime following two bloodless coups. Fiji returned to elected
 government in 1992, and Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka was re-elected in 1994.
 An independent, multiethnic Constitutional Review Commission presented its
 long-awaited report to the President in September. The 1990 Constitution reflected
 the proindigenous Fijian bias of the two coups; the Constitutional Review Commis-
 sion a report proposes a more representative system. The report aims to encourage
 multiethnic government through heterogeneous electoral districts and a preferential
 voting scheme, while preserving ethnic Fijian veto power over legislation affecting
 interest in land or customs. The proposal, if aprove  would be a major step toward
 an improved political and business climate.
 Ethnicity paya a major role in Fiji's politics, eonomy, and society. Fiji's more
 than 775,000 people constitute a multiracial society in which indigenous Fijians and
 ethnic Indians, in roughly equal numbers, account for 96 percent of the population.
 The rest are Asian and Caucian. Indo-Fijians dominate the commercial sector and
 professions and are well represented in the lower and middle levels of the Govern-
 ment. Ethnic Fijians control the bureaucracies and dominate the military.
 The small but professional Fiji Military Forces (FMF) and a separate police force
 report to and are under the control of the Minister for Home Affairs and, ultimately,
 the President. The Constitutional Review Commission report recommends that the
 army's legal basis be legislative, not constitutional. In 1990 the Government estab-
 lished the Fiji Intelligence Service, with limited statutory powers to search people
 and p rerty, monitor telephones, and access mail correspondence and financial
 records. There continue to be credible reports of human rights abuses by individual
 police officers.
 Sugar and tourism constitute the mainstays of the economy, accounting for almost
 half of the nation's foreign exchange earnings. The Government is promoting light
 manufacturing for export. Due to political uncertainty, private investment as a per-
 centage of gross domestic product dropped from 12 percent in 1987 and was 5 per-
 cent in early 1996.
 
 
 The principal human rights problem remains constitutionally imposed and eth-
 nically based political discrimination, which abridges the right of citizens to change
 their government. The Government and people are seeking to redress this problem
 throudh the constitutional review process. Other human rightsproblems include
 overt bias in land tenure and government policies favoring ethnic Fi ians, occasional
 police brutality, potential constraints on the exercise of freedom of the press, contin-
 ued delays in bringing criminal and civil cases to trial, discrimination and cases of
 violence against women, and instances of abuse of children.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Police sometimes physically abuse detainees; the authorities have punished some of
 the offending officers, but these punishments have not been sufficient to deter all
 police abuses. The Police Department's internal affairs unit investigates complaints
 of police brutality and is working with the Ombudsman's office to ensure impartial
 observers in the investigation of complaints about police conduct.
 Prison authorities strive to meet minimum international standards, within the
 limits of local financial restraints. Prison conditions are Spartan and food and sani-
 tation limited. The Government permits visits to prisons by church groups and fam-
 ily members.
 The law permits corporal punishment as a penalty for criminal acts, but this pro-
 vision is seldom invoked.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Law of Arrest and Detention pro-
 vides that a person may be arrested only if police believe that a breach of the crimi-
 nal law has been or is about to be committed. Arrested persons must be brought
 before a court without "undue delay." This is taken to mean within 24 hours, with
 48 hours as the exception (such as when an arrest is made over the weekend). Rules
 governing detention are designed to ensure fair questioning of suspects. Defendants
 ave the right to a judicial review of the grounds for arrest; in urgent cases defend-
 ants may apply to a judge at any time, whether he is sitting or not. Incommunicado
 and arbitrary detention, bth illegal, did not occur.
 Exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is independent under the Constitu-
 tion and in practice. There were no credible reports in 1996 of courts having been
 influenced by the executive. The 1996 Constitutional Review Commission report rec-
 ommended continuation of an independent judiciary.
 The judicial structure is patterned on the British system. The principal courts are
 the magistrate courts, the High Court, the Court of Appeal, and the Supreme Court.
 There are no special courts; military courts try only members of the armed forces.
 Magistrate courts continue to try the large majority of cases. In addition to its juris-
 diction in serious civil and criminal cases, the High Court is granted special interest
 jurisdiction on behalf of the public and is empowered to review alleged violations
 of individual rights provided by the Constitution.
 Defendants have the right to a public trial and to counsel. Trials in the High
 Court provide for the presence of assessors (citizens randomly selected to represent
 the community); cases in magistrate court do not. In litigation involving lesser com-
 plaints, a public legal advisor assists indigent persons in domestic or family law
 cases. The right of appeal exists but is hampered by continuing delays in the ap-
 peals proces. Bail procedures mean that most defendants do not experience any
 pretrial detention.
 The law sometimes treats women differently from men. In some instances there
 is a presumption of reduced competence and thus reduced responsibility. For exam-
 ple, only women can be charged with infanticide (if a man kills an infant the act
 is treated as murder, a more serious charge). A woman in an infanticide case is pre-
 sumed to have diminished mental capacity, and sentences are reduced or suspended
 accordingly.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-In gen-
 eral, the Government respects the privacy of the home. However, the Intelligence
 Service has powers, within specific operational guidelines, to search people and
 property, access private financial records, and monitor mail and telephones when a
 warrant is issued by the National Security Council. The Intelligence Service does
 conduct surveillance of persons it believes represent a security threat. Some political
 
 
 654
 dissidents believe their telephones and mail are monitored, but they have not pro-
 duced substantiating evidence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech is generally respected. The
 Government at times criticizes the media for its coverage of sensitive issues, par-
 ticularly if the Government perceives the coverage as resulting in a diminution of
 respect for authority.
 Neverheless, political figures and private citizens can and do speak out against
 the Government. Although the Public Order Act and other acts prohibit actions that
 are likely to incite racial antagonism, there were no reported arrests for such public
 statements.
 Legislation pertaining to the press is contained in the Newspaper Registration Act
 (NRA) and the Press Correction Act (PCA). Under the NRA        newspapers must
 be registered with the Government before they can begin publishing. Although the
 Government has never used the PCA, the act gives the Minister of Information sole
 discretionary power to order a newspaper to publish a "correcting statement" if, in
 the Minister's opinion, a false or distorted article has been published. Should the
 newspaper refuse to publish the Minister's correction, it can be taken to court, and
 if found guilty, fined approximately $700 (individual persons convicted under the act
 may be fined approimately $150 or imprisoned for 6 months or both). The PCA al-
 lows the Government to arrest anyone who publishes "malicious" material. This in-
 cludes anything the Government considers faise news that could create or foster
 public alarm or result in "detriment to the public."
 The media operate without prior censorship but with onsiderable self-censorship.
 Newspapers occasionally print editorials critical of the Government but rarely do in-
 vestigative reporting. They widely report statements about the political situation by
 opposition figures and foreign governments. The letters-to-the-editor columns of the
 two daily newspapers also frequently carry political statements from a wide cross
 section of society, including members of the deposed precoup government, which are
 highly critical of the Government, its programs, and the Constitution. Criticism, al-
 beit muted, of the once sacrosanct traditional chiefly system is appearing more fre-
 quently. However, the Government still views comments about individual chiefs
 with disfavor.
 An active local organization, the Fiji Islands Media Association (FIMA), is an affil-
 iate of the regional Pacific Islands News Association (PINA). Both FIMA and PINA
 are pressing for better training and the establishment of codes of ethics for journal-
 ists. In a show of tangible support for strengthening the media, the Government has
 unconditionally provided space for housing the Fiji Journalism Training Institute.
 Fiji's television news production is owned and operated by Fiji One, the only
 noncable television station. Fiji One, in turn is owned by a variety of private indi-
 viduals and interests, and 51 percent by a trust operating on behalf of iis prov-
 cial governments. While academic freedom is respected, the Government has effec-
 tively deterred university employees from participation in domestic politics. Since
 1991 staff members of the Fiji-based University of the South Pacific must take leave
 if they run for public office and must resign from their university positions if elect-
 ed. Senior staff cannot hold office in political parties. Student groups are free to or-
 ganize and do so.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides the
 right to assemble for political purposes, subject to restrictions in the interest of pub-
 lic order. Permits for public gatherings must be obtained from the district officer.
 The Government does not always grant permits for large outdoor political meetings
 or demonstrations, particularly if the police advise of difficulties with the antici-
 pated crowd size or their ability to assure public safety.
 The Government routinely issued permits for rallies organized by political parties,
 religous groups, and groups opposed to government policies.
 All opposition party headquarters operate without government interference. Politi-
 cal organizations operate and issue public statements and did so repeatedly and
 openly throughout the year.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitutional provision of freedom of religion is
 honored in practice. The Government does not restrict foreign clergy and missionary
 activity or other typical activities of religious organizations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not restrict freedom of movement within the
 country or abroad. Occasional detentions at the airport occur, but the courts order
 redress where this is warranted. Citizens are free to emigrate, and an estimated
 40,000 have done so since 1987. The Government does not restrict their return if
 
 
 they choose to do so, and has, in fact, encouraged those who left after the coups to
 return.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the United Nations High Commis-
 sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting rf-
 ugees. However, authorities were reluctant to grant first asylum to two Iranian
 Christians who entered Fiji via Malaysia. Only after receiving assurances from the
 UNHCR that the two would ultimately be moved to a third country did the authori-
 ties permit them to remain.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution ensures political dominance by ethnic Fijians, primarily through
 race-based voting registration and representation in Parliament, thus abridging the
 right of citizens to change their government. The Constitutional Review Commission
 report recommends heterogeneous voting districts and a preferential voting scheme
 on the Australian model. The Government has respected scrupulously the independ-
 ence of the Review Commission.
 The Constitution provides ethnic Fijians with 37 of 70 seats in the elected lower
 house of Parliament, Indo-Fbians are accorded 27 seats, Rotumans (culturally dis-
 tinct Polynesians) 1, and all others 5. In the Senate (an appointed body with essen-
 tially review powers), ethnic Fijians hold 24 of the 34 seats, Rotumans 1, and the
 other groups 9. The Review Commission report proposes that the House of Rep-
 resentatives still total 70, but with 45 seats (64 percent) distributed among 15
 three-member districts of approximately equal population and multiethnic makeup.
 Voters would elect representatives from those districts based on a general registra-
 tion; there would be no ethnic seats. For the short term, however, 25 seats would
 remain allocated on ethnic lines. The Review Commission report also proposes a
 mostly elected senate.
 The Constitution requires that the Prime Minister be an ethnic Fijian; selection
 procedures virtually ensure that the President will also be an ethnic Fijian. The
 President chooses the Prime Minister (who, along with the Cabinet, holds most of
 the executive authority) from among the ethnic Fijian members of the lower house
 on the basis of ability to command majority support within that body.
 The Constitutional Review Comnision strongly endorsed maintaining a bill of
 rights, providing for freedom of speech, assembly, religion, and other universally ac-
 cepted rights and freedoms. The Commission recommended restricting Parliament's
 emergency powers, specifically repeal of a 1990 provision permitting Parliament to
 legislate contrary to the Bill of Rights in an emergency.
 Fiji has about 10 political parties. The ethnic Fijian S VT (or Fijian Political Party)
 forms the core of the parliamentary majority. Two predommantly Indo-Fijian par-
 ties, the National Federation Party (P1  ) and the Fiji Labour Party  LP) are
 joined on the opposition side of the legislature by an ethnic Fijian party (the Fijian
 Association). Two small parties representing primarily Caucasians an Asians, the
 General Electors and General Voters parties, are each represented by a minister in
 the Cabinet.
 The Constitutional Review Commision's proposals will be studied by a select com-
 mittee composed of the variety of parties. This committee will be charged with mak-
 ing recommendations for an act to amend the Constitution," which is to be signed
 into law by July 1997.
 Women in both the Fijian and Indian communities have functioned primarily in
 traditional roles, although some women achieve responsible positions in public serv-
 ice, politics, and business. Two women sit in Parliament; one is a cabinet minister.
 Women can also attain high status in Fiji's traditional chiefly system. The Presi-
 dent's wife is, in her own right, one of Fijis three highest ranking chiefs.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no local groups that focus solely on human rights matters, but the wom-
 en's rights movement, the labor movement, and various political groups (including
 organized political parties) are engaged in promoting human rilts. There are also
 sel     small, not very actve  oreign-based organizations that concentrate on
 human rights causes in Fiji, including the Coalition for Democracy in Fiji (with of-
 fices in New Zealand and Australia) and two United Kingdom-based groups, the
 International Fiji Movement and the Movement for Democracy in Fiji.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, sex, place of origin,
 political opinion, color, religion, or creed, and provides specific affirmative action
 
 
 656
 provisions for those disadvantaged as a result of such discrimination. Enforcement
 of these constitutional provisions is attenuated by the Government's policy of using
 "affirmative action" to advance ethnic Fijians and by traditional mores as to the
 roles and rights of women and children.
 Women.-Women in Fiji are actively addressing the problem of domestic violence.
 Reliable estimates indicate that 10 percent of women have been abused in some
 way, and this abuse is a major focus of the women's movement. Over the last year,
 Fiji police have adopted a no drop" rule, according to which they will prosecute
 cases of domestic violence even when the victim does not wish to press charges.
 There is a small but active women's rights movement, which has pressed for more
 serious punishment for rape convictions. Courts have imposed sentences that vary
 widely but are generally lenient. Women have sought to have all rape cases heard
 in the High Court where sentencing limits are higher.
 Suva, the capital, and Ba, the regional center, have privately funded women's cri-
 sis centers, which offer counseling and assistance to women in cases of rape, domes-
 tic violence, and other problems, such as child support payments. There is, overall,
 a growing awareness of the abuse of women's rights.
 Despite constitutional provisions, the Government practiced a form of sexual dis-
 crimination in the recognition of spousal and offspring rights. For example, spouses
 of female citizens are not automatically granted residence, whereas spouses of male
 citizens are. Children of female ethnic Fijians married to nonethnic Fijians are not
 entitled to registry in the document governing which persons share in income from
 communal ownership of native lands, and which persons who have the right to vote
 as an ethnic Fijian and hold ethnic Fijian-designated seats in Parliament. Men,
 however, confer ethnic Fijian status on their offspring regardless of the mother's
 ethnic background. In a high-profile 1992 court challenge to the registration restric-
 tions, the son of a Chinese father and ethnic Fijian mother won-his appeal to be
 registered as an ethnic Fijian. The long-term effects of the decision on registration
 restrictions and, thus, a woman's right to pass on her ethnic status remain unclear.
 In general, women in the Fijian community are more likely to rise to prominence
 in their own right than are women in the Indo-Fijian community. Women have full
 rights of property ownership and inheritance, and a number have become successful
 entrepreneurs. Women are generally paid less than men, a discrepancy that is espe-
 cially notable in the garment industry. Garment workers, most of whom are female,
 are subject to a special minimum wage considerably lower than that in other sec-
 tors.
 Children.-The Government is committed to childrens' rights and welfare but has
 limited financial resources to carry out the commitment. In addition, the legal sys-
 tem is at times inadequate to protect the rights of children, as children's testimony
 is inadmissable unless corroborated by an adult. Societal changes have undermined
 the traditional village and extended family based social structures-an outgrowth
 of this has been a child abuse problem. The Government in 1993 created a Child
 Welfare Committee to address these problems, but it is likely to remain reluctant
 to become directly involved in what are generally perceived to be "family matters."
 Corporal punishment is widely administered in schools and at home. The Ministry
 of Education has guidelines for the administration of such punishment by principals
 and head teachers. In 1993 one principal was fired for overstepping these guide-
 lines. There is credible information that not all abuses are reported or punished.
 People With Disabilities.-Legal discrimination against physically disabled per-
 sons in employment, education, and the provision of other state services does not
 exist. However, there is no legislation or mandated provision for accessibility for the
 disabled. Several small voluntary organizations promote greater attention to the
 needs of the disabled.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The stated purpose of the 1987 military
 coups was to ensure the political supremacy of the indigenous Fijian people and to
 protect their traditional way of life and communal control of land. To this end, the
 Government initiated a number of constitutional and other measures to ensure eth-
 nic Fijian control of the executive and legislative branches (see Section 3). The Gov-
 ernment also successfully raised the proportion of ethnic Fijians and Rotumans in
 the public service to 50 percent or higher at all levels, but most dramatically at the
 senior level: Indo-Fijians now represent only 10 percent of the highest levels of the
 civil service. As a result, some Indo-Fijians justifiably complain of a "glass ceiling"
 whereby, despite their experience and higher educational achievements, they are
 promoted only to middle management levels of the civil service.
 Control of land is a highly sensitive issue. Ethnic Fijians currently hold,
 communally, about 83 percent of land, the State holds another 8 percent, and only
 the remaining 9 percent is in the hands of nonethnic Fijians. The British colonial
 administration instituted the present land ownership arrangements to protect the
 
 
 657
 interests of the indigenous Fijians whose traditional beliefs, cultural values, and
 self-identity are tied to the land. Most cash crop farmers are Indo-Fijians, who lease
 land from the ethnic Fijian landowners through the Native Land Trust Board. Many
 Indo-Fijians, particularly farmers, believe that the absence of secure land tenure
 discriminates against them. Between 1997 and 2000, most current leases will ex-
 pire. A review of the current land tenure and leasing arrangements is under way,
 with all indications that the Government will make few changes to the existing sys-
 tem. Some landowners are likely to decline to renew leases; the Government has
 acknowledged its responsibility to help relocate displaced Indo-Fijian farmers, al-
 though it has few resources to offer.
 Indo-Fijians are subject to occasional harassment and crime based on race, which
 is compounded by inadequate police protection. There have been no credible allega-
 tions of government involvement in such incidents, which the police have inves-
 tigated, sometimes resulting in arrests.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law protects the right of workers to form and
 join unions, elect their own representatives, publicize their views on labor matters,
 and determine their own policies, and the authorities respect these rights in prac-
 tice. However, the law permits restrictions to be applied in government employment
 and in the interests of defense, public safety, public order, public morality, or public
 health, or to protect the rights and freedoms of other persons. An estimated 20 per-
 cent of the labor force is unionized.
 All unions must register with, but are not controlled by, the Government. The
 only central labor body is the Fiji Trade Union Congress (FTUC), which was closely
 associated with the opposition Fiji Labour Party until mid-1992. It currently takes
 a more independent political stance. The FTUC is free to associate internationally
 and does so. The labor movement is led largely by Indo-Fijians, with ethnic Fijians
 beginning to assume leadership roles. Persons with close ties to the Government
 have organized rival unions primarily for ethnic Fijians; these unions are more ame-
 nable to cooperation with the Government.
 In 1994 Parliament completed a 2-year process of reforming labor legislation by
 amending several acts. The changes include the elimination of a ban on a person
 holding multiple union officer positions and the elimination of restrictions on seek-
 ing international support on labor issues. Although the FTUC thereafter returned
 to participate in the Government's Tripartite Economic Strategies Committee, it
 subsequently suspended its participation pending additional reforms.
 Strikes are legal, except in connection with union recognition disputes. The Gov-
 ernment remains involved in certifying union strike balloting, which can be an
 elaborate process given the distance between some of the island locations. The fail-
 ure of the National Bank of Fiji sparked labor unrest. Furloughed bank employees
 eventually won a settlement package that they, and their union, deemed fair.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law recognizes the right
 to organize and bargain collectively. Employers are required to recognize a union
 if more than half the employees in a workplace have joined it. Recognition is deter-
 mined by union membership rather than by an election. The Government has the
 power to order recalcitrant employers to recognize unions and has done so. Key sec-
 tors of the economy, including sugar and tourism, are heavily organized. Following
 the May 1992 return to accountable government, the Government lifted wage guide-
 lines, and unrestricted collective bargaining on wages is now the norm.
 Wage negotiations are conducted on an individual company or enterprise basis
 rather than on an industrywide basis. A government proposal to introduce such ne-
 gotiations has been supported by employers but opposed by unions.
 The law specifically prohibits antiunion discrimination. In practice, the unions are
 generally successful in preventing discrimination against workers for union activi-
 ties, but the law does not mandate that fired workers be reinstated.
 Export processing zones (EPZ's) are subject to the same law as the rest of the
 country, and unions have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with many
 EPZ firms.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution specifically pro-
 hibits forced labor, and there is no indication that it is practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Children under the age of 12 may
 not be employed in any capacity. 'Children" (under age 15) and 'young persons"
 (ages 15 to 17) may not be employed in industry or work with machinery. Enforce-
 ment by the Ministry for Labour and Industrial Relations generally is effective, ex-
 cept for family members working on family farms or businesses and "self-employed"
 homeless youths. School is not mandatory.
 
 
 658
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage. Certain
 sectors have minimum wages set by the Ministry for Labour and Industrial Rela-
 tions, which effectively enforces them. Minimum wage levels will generally support
 a barely adequate standard of living for a worker and family in all sectors except
 for the garment industry, in which the starting hourly wage, $0.50 (FJ$0.72) for
 learners and $0.65 (FJ$0.94) for others, is based on the assumption that workers
 are young adults or married women living at home and not supporting a household.
 There are no regulations specifying maximum hours of work for adult males.
 Women can do night work in factories and overtime but are prohibited from under-
 ground work in mines. Certain industries, notably transportation and shipping,
 have problems with excessive hours of work. Indo-Fijians, who generally require a
 cash income to survive, are more vulnerable to pressure to work long hours than
 are ethnic Fijians. Many ethnic Fijians can and do return to their villages rather
 than work what they consider excessive hours.
 There are workplace safety regulations, a Workmen's Compensation Act, and an
 accident compensation plan. Awards for workers injured on the job are set by a tri-
 bunal. Government enforcement of safety standards under the direction of the
 Labour Ministry suffers from a lack of trained enforcement personnel, but unions
 do a reasonable job of monitorinF safety standards in organized workplaces. The
 International Labor Organizations (ILO) 1992 recommendations cited the need to
 improve working conditions, particularly in the garment industry. In June the Gov-
 ernment passed legislation to address some of these shortcomings, and the ILO is
 assisting with implementation.
