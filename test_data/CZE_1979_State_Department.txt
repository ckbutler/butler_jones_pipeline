 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 Czechoslovakia is a Central European state governed by a
 Communist regime similar to those in other Warsaw Pact
 states. It has a relatively advanced economy and a
 sophisticated and well-educated populace which has had long
 contact with the main currents of Western European thought
 and tradition. The two main ethnic groups -- the Czechs and
 the Slovaks -- have had a different historical experience
 and development. The accommodation of the interests and
 aspirations of both groups within one country has not always
 been a smooth process. Slovak resentment at the long-
 standing domination of the central government by the more
 numerous Czechs led to the adoption in 1968 of the present
 federal system in which some functions are delegated to
 separate Czech and Slovak governments.
 Although both the Czechs and the Slovaks were long under the
 domination of others, they had a successful experience with
 democracy from the founding of the modern Czechoslovak state
 in 1918 until its destruction by Hitler in 1938. With the
 imposition of. Communist rule in 1948, the people of
 Czechoslovakia have been subjected to an authoritarian
 system of government. The "Prague Spring" of 1968, the
 brief experiment at liberalization which attempted to bring
 "socialism with a human face" to Czechoslovakia, demonstrated
 that the desire for participatory democracy still existed
 among the people and even within the Communist Party. The
 August 1968 invasion by the Soviet Union and other members
 of the Warsaw Pact and the permanent stationing of an
 estimated 70,000 Soviet troops within the country
 demonstrated even more forcefully, however, that the Soviet
 Union is unwilling to tolerate a participatory democracy in
 Czechoslovakia.
 Czechoslovakia is a Communist state and its citizens are
 restricted in their practice of basic civil and political
 freedoms to those activities that take place under laws and
 guidelines approved by the Communist Party. Overt
 opposition to those laws and guidelines in any field,
 including creative activity, is punished. However, the
 threat of punishment and the denial of economic or
 educational opportunity are much more widely used methods of
 control than punishment by arrest and imprisonment. Within
 the strictures of Party and government policies, the
 majority of the Czechoslovak people live relatively
 unharassed lives, but do not actively participate in the
 political and economic decision-making of the country.
 Attempts to enlarge the area of popular debate on
 Czechoslovak Government policies in recent years have been
 countered. Charter 77, a movement with members drawn from
 intellectuals, students, and a few workers which aims to
 persuade the Czechoslovak Government to abide by its own
 laws and international commitments, has been unable, during
 the nearly three years since its founding, to convince an
 insecure government of the legitimacy of its activities.
 Rather, the government has periodically arrested, tried, and
 sentenced leading members of the movement to prison terms on
 charges of anti-state activities. The first Charter trial
 took place in 1977 and the most recent in October 1979.

 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 The integrity of the person is guaranteed by the constitution.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There are reports of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment
 of dissidents. Some persons released by the police after
 questioning about political offenses have reported that
 while detained they were taken from the police station and
 beaten. Others have reported that they were beaten on the
 street under circumstances which lead them to believe that
 the actions were performed by police officials. There have
 been no reports of perpetrators of such actions being
 arrested and tried. Prisoners also report that prison
 conditions are sometimes deliberately substandard -- for
 example, cells are small and unheated -- and that they
 receive administrative punishments in prison -- reductions
 in pay, and limitations on their free time and bathing and
 exercise periods -- far failing to meet unrealistically high
 work standards. The diet in prisons is widely reported to
 be deficient, sometimes requiring persons to undergo special
 medical treatment upon release. Amnesty International has
 reported inadequate medical care in the cases of several
 political prisoners. Access to prisoners by immediate
 family members is limited to four hours per year and
 touching is not permitted. These conditions apply
 especially to political offenders, as contrasted with those
 convicted of ordinary crimes, and more to recidivists than
 to first-time offenders. In-practice, effective redress for
 cruel and degrading treatment does not appear possible.
 c.   Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 The number of political prisoners in Czechoslovakia is
 estimated at approximately 100.  This figure is imprecise
 at best, however, since the Government does not recognize
 prisoners of conscience as a special category. Political
 defendants are convicted on the basis of sweeping charges,
 such as "damaging the interests of the Republic." Detained
 persons can be held for up to 96 hours without charges;
 pretrial detention can be for up to two months, but the
 prosecutor can extend the period at his discretion. There
 are no effective safeguards for defendants against these
 procedures.
 d.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are by law public, and the accused is given the right
 to counsel, informed of the charges, and entitled to present
 a defense. In practice, however, there are significant
 restrictions on these legal guarantees. Public access to
 trials of persons charged with political offenses is usually
 controlled by filling the courtroom with persons loyal to
 the regime. The accused has limited access to counsel, and
 a police officer is often present to monitor the meetings
 between a defendant and lawyer. Lawyers have been known to
 have charges brought against them for too vigorous a defense
 of political opponents of the government. Defendants do
 exercise the right of defense and are occasionally successful
 in efforts to have the charges dismissed or downgraded
 either at the original trial or on appeal. The courts have
 limited independence since judges can be removed by either
 the Federal Assembly or by the National Councils of the
 Czech or Slovak Republics. Civilians are not normally tried
 by military courts.

 e.   InvasiOn of the Home
 The Czechoslovak constitution guarantees the inviolability
 of the home. A search warrant is required from the prosecutor
 unless there is not time to obtain one. In practice, there
 are widespread reports of house searches without warrants.
 The homes of dissidents are often closely watched by the
 police in order to curtail access by Western journalists and
 other dissidents.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education:
 Czechoslovakia provides the basic needs of food, shelter,
 health care and primary education for its people. There are
 deficiencies of supplies or difficulties in distribution,
 but these are attributable more to economic constraints or
 management deficiencies than to deliberate neglect of human
 needs. There is also a pension system which provides a
 minimum income; in addition some retirees are allowed to
 supplement their permanent income by working. There are
 reports that items in scarce supply, such as some
 foodstuffs, certain items of clothing, and apartments in
 desirable locations, can be obtained through payment of
 bribes or by other corrupt practices.
 Education is compulsory to 15 years of age and adequate for
 almost all school-age children. Secondary and university
 education are free, but there are many reports that the
 selection of students for courses and schools leading to
 more desirable careers is based on their parents' political
 standing. Access to higher education thus appears to be an
 instrument of control over a large segment of the population.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of speech and press are guaranteed in the
 Czechoslovak Constitution provided the exercise of these
 freedoms is "...consistent with the interests of the working
 people..." Freedom of assembly is also allowed in order for
 citizens "...to take an active part in the administration of
 the state and in the economic and cultural development of
 the country." In practice, however, these freedoms do not
 exist. Individuals may not publicly express views contrary
 to the "principles of a socialist state," criticise the
 Czechoslovak Communist Party or the government's decisions
 and leaders, or hold public meetings without permission from
 the police. The press is directly controlled by the state
 and operates under the direct supervision of the Party.
 Freedom of association is also closely controlled in
 practice. Czechoslovak citizens must have government
 permission to meet legally with foreign officials. Printing
 and reproduction devices, other than typewriters, are
 controlled by the Ministry of the Interior, and it is
 illegal for an individual to possess one. Reproduction of
 printed materials is limited to eleven typewritten copies.
 Freedom of religious belief and freedom to practice religion
 are guaranteed by the Constitution. The state rigorously
 regulates religious activity, however. All clergy are paid
 by the state and require a state license in order to
 
 
 581
 practice. Religious education, proselytizing, and the
 education of new clergy are carefully limited. Nominally,
 about 11 million Czechoslovaks are Catholics and just over
 one million are Protestants. Some priests and much of the
 senior Catholic clergy have joined a pro-government
 organization, Pacem in Terris. As demonstrated by the
 arrests of several Catholic priests and lay workers in the
 fall of 1979 for distributing samizdat (self-published)
 religious literature, those who stray beyond narrowly
 defined boundaries are subject to punishment. The Jewish
 community, numbering several thousand, has central religious
 organizations financially supported by the Government.
 There are synogogues and prayer houses and a Jewish museum.
 There are no Jewish schools or rabbinical seminaries.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Freedom of movement within Czechoslovakia is not normally
 hindered. Travel in some areas near the borders or in the
 vicinity of military installations is proscribed. Foreign
 travel to other Communist countries (except Yugoslavia, the
 Soviet Union, and Cuba) is unhindered, but travel to Western
 countries is restricted since travelers must obtain
 permission and, unless visiting close relatives, a hard
 currency authorization. In practice, travelers to the West
 usually must leave some members of the immediate family at
 home to ensure their return. These restrictions are relaxed
 for retirees. Obtaining permission to emigrate is a long
 and ardous process, especially for persons in political
 opposition to the Government. Applicants must endure long
 waits and may occasionally suffer reprisals such as demotion
 or loss of job after applying. There are no special
 barriers to persons emigrating to join their spouses.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Czechoslovakia is a Communist state in which all significant
 decisions regarding the government, the economy, and society
 are made exclusively by the leadership of the Communist
 Party. Meaningful participation in the political process is
 enjoyed only by members of the Party, and within the Party
 only by a very limited number of leaders. Ordinary
 citizens, especially those who are not Party members, have
 no role in the process of selecting their leaders or in
 making important political or economic decisions. Certain
 other political parties are permitted to organize and even
 to publish their own newspapers, but under very carefully
 circumscribed and supervised conditions.
 There is little evidence of meaningful public discussion of
 social, political, or economic issues. In general, the
 people only learn about final decisions of the Party and the
 government. The government has reacted to the attempts to
 broaden the political process by arrest and imprisonment.
 Women are equal under the law. About 48 percent of
 Czechoslovak women are in the work force. Most of them have
 lower paying, less skilled jobs. There are small numbers of
 women in the professions and in higher-ranking Party,
 government and management positions. Equal pay for equal
 work is practiced in almost all cases. There are
 inconsistencies in the responsibilities women are asked to
 assume, however. At the same time they are being encouraged
 to join the work force, they are also offered incentives to
 have children and are generally expected to do most of the
 housework and child care.
 
 
 582
 The trade union movement is organized under the guidance of
 the Communist Party, as provided for in the Constitution.
 Worker membership is obligatory. Strikes, collective
 bargaining and lobbying are not permitted. Workers are
 expected to carry out directives to fulfill the economic
 plan and have little influence over production. In some
 cases, workers have been able to bring about changes in
 their working conditions. The right and duty to work are
 guaranteed in the Constitution. In practice, persons who
 hold political views differing from the government have
 found it difficult to retain the positions for which they
 were trained and have been forced into menial jobs such as
 window-washers, stokers, and street cleaners. The threat of
 economic deprivation is used a a method of political
 control.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights:
 Czechoslovakia has signed the Final Act of the Conference on
 Security and Cooperation in Europe. The Czechoslovak
 Government has reacted strongly to concern about human
 rights violations in Czechoslovakia by other governments or
 non-governmental institutions. It frequently delays or
 refuses visas to members of international human rights
 organizations.. In several instances representatives from
 these organizations have been detained or expelled during
 visits to Czechoslovakia. The Czechoslovak Government's
 stated reason for reacting with such high sensitivity to
 outside investigation is that it considers these matters to
 be internal issues.
