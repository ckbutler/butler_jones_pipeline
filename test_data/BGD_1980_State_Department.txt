 BANGLADESH
 Bangladesh is in one of the world's most impoverished and
 densely populated regions. Born in a bloody war of indepen-
 dence, Bangladesh suffered in its early.years from serious
 economic problems exacerbated by an untrained and ineffective
 bureaucracy and by political difficulties that included near
 anarchy and pervasive corruption.
 President Ziaur Rahman (Zia) came to power as martial
 law-administrator in 1975, at the end of series of coups.
 Since .then there have been modest but broad-based improve-
 ments in the quality of public administration, in the
 -economy, and in public order. In the 1978 national elec-
 tions, Zia was elected president by a 77 percent majority.
 President Zia's party won more than two-thirds of the
 seats in the 1979 parliamentary elections; opposition
 parties secured the remainder.
 In November 1979, the-state of emergency and martial
 law (imposed in 1975) was lifted, and fundamental rights
 -guaranteed by the.constitution were restored. The Special
 --Powers Act of 1974 remains in effect, however. It allows
 the government-to detain any person indefinitely for having
 done, or to prevent him from doing, any "prejudicial act,"
 although with certain safeguards. A prejudicial act is
 defined as anything that the government considers contrary
 to the political or economic interests, safety, or security
 of Bangladesh, including anything that will "cause fear or
 alarm to the public or to any section of the public." The
 act further provides for: a degree of press control;
 the banning of all "associations or unions" pursuing a
 political purpose in the name of any religiQn; the suspension
 for up-to six months of the activities of any association
 the government believes may act in a manner prejudicial to
 the maintenance of law and order; and the establishment of
 special tribunals to try violators of the act.
 The number of political prisoners declined during the past
 year (press reports claim 2100 released during first nine
 months of 1980), and a number of prominent opposition poli-
 ticians were among those released.
 Freedom of speech and association is respected, political
 parties carry on their activities with minimal restriction,
 and a large measure of press freedom exists. Although
 its efforts are limited by inadequate resources, the
 government emphasizes agricultural and rural development --
 rather than urban industrial growth -- to improve the lot of
 the predominantly rural masses.
 Reflecting a trend established over the past few years,
 1980 was a year of continued gradual improvement in respect
 for and protection afforded to human rights in Bangladesh.

 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Article 35 of the constitution states that "no person shall
 be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading
 punishment or treatment." No information has come to light
 on the use of torture in Bangladesh in 1980.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 As noted above, such practices are forbidden by the
 constitution. Police officials who engage in torture, coerce
 or intimidate citizens, or otherwise abuse police powers are
 subject to prosecution under the criminal laws.
 Prisoners are divided by the court into Classes I, II, and
 III on the basis of such factors as occupation, educational
 level and economic class. Standards of meals and accommoda-
 tions vary according to the class of the prisoner. Released
 prisoners have complained of inadequate nutrition and
 medical attention. Prisoners are allowed family visits and
 access to attorneys. Women prisoners are treated no differently
 from men and are accommodated separately. There is no
 differentiation on the basis of religion or race. A jail
 reform commission issued its final report in November 1980.
 Its interim recommendations have not yet been made public.
 Bangladesh prisons are overcrowded,,largely as a result of
 congestion in the court system. In early 1980 there were
 24,505 prisoners in a prison system designed to accommodate
 only 16,381 people. Over 70 percent of prison inmates were
 "under-trial" prisoners -- i.e., prisoners awaiting
 disposition of their cases by the courts. In an effort to
 alleviate congestion, the government announced in 1980 the
 appointments of 48 additional judges and enacted legislation
 increasing the authority of magistrates.
 Summary executions are not practiced in Bangladesh. Punish-
 ments administered for criminal convictions are fines,
 imprisonment, imprisonment at hard labor, and the death
 penalty. The Home Minister informed parliament in May 1980
 that the government has executed 424 persons in accordance
 with court sentences delivered since 1976.
 c. Disappearances
 No evidence has surfaced of persons being abducted, secretly
 arrested, or held in clandestine detention by authorities of
 the present government, or by elements condoned by the
 government.
 
 
 950
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 During the first nine months of 1980, the press reported the
 freeing of over 2,100 prisoners. Most prominent political
 figures who remained in jail were released, including former
 President Khondakar Mushtaq Ahmed, two prominent leaders
 of the major opposition party (Awami League), and three top
 leaders of the largest radical party. In the spring,
 the government detained 39 leaders of the Communist Party of
 Bangladesh (CPB) under the Special Powers Act. All but one
 of the CPB leaders were released after periods of detention
 ranging up to 18 weeks. The Secretary General, against whom
 the government opened a sedition case for advocating "Afghan-
 style revolution," remains under detention.
 Preventive detention continues under the Special Powers Act.
 Detainees gain some protection against arbitrary treatment
 by provisions that require a magistrate's sanction of
 detention for more than 24 hours, central government approval
 beyond 30 days detention, and review of cases by persons
 qualified to be judges. As of December 19, 419 persons were
 in detention under the Special Powers Act. A foodgrains
 supply ordinance, promulgated in July 1979 in response to
 drought-induced food shortages, also authorizes preventive
 detention for up to three months for hoarding. Few, if any,
 persons have been detained under that ordinance.
 The government has often described as "political
 prisoners" all those detained under emergency legislation
 (today primarily the Special Powers Act), despite the range
 of grounds for detention (e.g., smuggling, black marketeering)
 As of September 1980, 409 persons were in detention under
 the Special Powers Act. However, it is estimated that the
 number of persons being held for political activities (often
 politically motivated violence) or views is not more than
 30.
 Habeas corpus is established in Bangladeshi law. Over the
 past few years, habeas corpus petitions have resulted in the
 release of a substantial number of persons imprisoned under
 preventive detention laws. They are used less frequently to
 obtain release of "under-trial" prisoners.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Martial law courts ceased to exist after the 1979 withdrawal
 of martial law. Most cases now come before the civil courts,
 while special tribunals established under the Special Powers
 Act continue to try offenses such as sabotage, subversion,
 and blackmarketeering. Judges in special tribunals are
 drawn from civil courts, defendants enjoy the same rights as
 those under trial in civil courts, and judgments can be
 appealed. However, persons convicted by the now-defunct
 martial law courts do not have the right of appeal. This
 procedure caused considerable human rights concerns following
 the executions in June 1980 of four persons convicted of
 treason under martial law.
 
 
 951
 In the civil courts, defendants are guaranteed fair and
 public trials by the constitution. Defendants are
 entitled to counsel; lawyers have free access to defendants
 and experience little difficulty in holding private consul-
 tations with them. There have been no reported incidents
 of harassment of defense counsels by the government.
 Defendants are made aware of the charges against them and
 they and their lawyers may inform themselves of the
 evidence upon which charges are based.
 A 1975 amendment to the constitution, which transferred
 "control and discipline of persons employed in the judicial
 service and magistrates" from the Supreme Court to the
 President, remains in effect. However, the courts operate
 with little interference from the executive branch; the
 high court has challenged the executive in a number of cases.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Bangladeshi authorities do not engage in arbitrary in-
 vasion of the home. A judicial warrant is required
 before authorities may enter a home, and courts require that
 there be reasonable basis of suspicion of involvement in a
 crime before issuing such a warrant.
 2. Government    Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 The economic situation and some cultural restraints obstruct
 solutions to many problems the government must address in
 order to fulfill basic economic rights. According to most
 indicators in a recent World Bank report, Bangladesh ranks
 among the world's poorest countries, with a per capita
 annual income slightly over $100. The population density is
 over 1600 persons per square mile, and the annual population
 growth rate is estimated at 2.8 percent. Bangladesh's
 agricultural sector (approximately 55 percent of the GDP and
 70 percent of the labor force) is subject to widely varying
 climatic conditions and natural disasters. Factors such as
 level delta land, heavy rainfall, and a semi-tropical
 location have created conditions favoring an agricultural
 economy. The two major crops are jute and rice. Most
 rainfall occurs during the July-September monsoon season,
 and farming methods and crops are in such delicate balance
 that a few weeks variation in rainfall patterns can change a
 subsistence margin into famine. Small average farm size
 (about 2 acres) and fragmented holdings are obstacles to
 productivity.
 The small industry and service sectors, primarily based on
 agriculture (jute, fertilizer and textiles), offer good
 development prospects as a whole. Private land ownership
 was not seriously questioned, even by the more socialist-
 oriented government of the early 1970s. The present
 
 
 952
 government has taken steps to promote private ownership
 and has released some government-owned lands to the
 private sector.
 The issue of rural land ownership and tenancy remains
 intractable; although one half of the rural population
 remains effectively landless, existing land holdings are
 already small and fragmented. In September 1980, the
 government announced that it would study agrarian reform,
 including tenancy and rural unemployment, and invited the
 participation of opposition parties. The Prime Minister
 offered a working paper, and proposals have been forth-
 coming from opposition groups. The results of this
 dialogue are yet to be made public.
 There are no accurate measurements of unemployment and
 under-employment, but a conservative estimate puts 30 per-
 cent of the work force in these categories. The industry
 and service sectors are small and therefore reduce the
 government's ability to make quick and significant improve-
 ments in employment levels and conditions. The major
 industries also function under difficult international and
 local conditions. For example, the government-owned textile
 industry is under strong pressure to improve and expand
 production while maintaining low prices to accommodate a
 poor population. The industrial labor force is one of the
 few segments of the economy that has not experienced a
 declining real standard of living over the past few years.
 The government has not yet found solutions to the problems
 of rural workers. Landless peasants are the first to suffer
 from vagaries of climate and natural disasters.  In its
 industrialization program, the government provides special
 incentives -- customs and tax advantages, financing facili-
 ties, and land -- to locate industry in underdeveloped rural
 areas. However, lack of trained personnel, poor transporta-
 tion and communications, and the market advantages of the
 cities have discouraged industries from locating there.
 The president has declared that women should be given a full
 role in the ebonomic progress of Bangladesh. Both the
 constitution and the new five year plan provide for an equal
 role for women and establish quotas to meet this objective.
 In September 1980, the cabinet recommended that:
 -- Women fill all primary school teaching vacancies, 80 per-
 cent of secondary school teacbing vacancies, and 33 percent
 of the teaching vacancies at government colleges;
 -- Women fill 50 percent of all posts of clerks, assistants,
 typists and steno-typists in government, and that they fill
 all posts as telephone operators and receptionists. (These
 positions now are held almost exclusively by men in Bang-
 ladesh);
 -- 30 percent of slots in medical colleges; 25 percent in
 para-medical institutions, 20 percent of junior executive
 positions in nationalized enterprises, and 10 percent of
 all other suitable openings in nationalized industry be
 reserved for women.
 
 
 953
 Although intellectuals speak of the heavy social cost of
 excluding women from the economic and political mainstream,
 present convictions and underlying social barriers circum-
 scribing the status of women are strongly held and show few
 signs of weakening. Ninety percent of Bangladeshi women
 live in rural areas. Early marriage, high fertility rates,
 and long hours of labor leave little time for non-family
 interests. Traditions lock rural women into a network
 of social limitations that restrict their ability to move in
 public. The social system places women under the protection
 and care of male relatives. The government has a Minister
 for Women's Affairs who is a strong advocate of the economic
 emanicipation of women. The quotas for women even within
 her own ministry barely have begun to be filled.
 The right to a standard of living adequate for health and
 well-being is not yet within the capability of the govern-
 ment to guarantee until and unless basic problems of popula-
 tion and agricultural production are overcome. The per
 capita nutritional intake in Bangladesh is 1,870 calories
 per day, far below the United Nations Food and Agriculture
 Organization's recommended minimum of 2,332. The govern-
 ment's goals in its current five year plan are for the
 crude birth rate to fall from the present ratio of 43.25
 per 1000 to 31.56 by 1984-85.
 The government has committed about 8 percent of its total
 expenditures to education. Further, it has emphasized
 vocational and post-secondary education for a portion of
 its population, rather than basic education for the masses.
 The government has established programs to train a literacy
 corps and is attempting to manufacture and assemble the
 necessary teaching kits. The total adult literacy rate is
 just over 20 percent; the female literacy rate is about 12
 percent.
 3. Respect for Civil Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These rights are provided for in articles 27 through 41 of the
 constitution. Freedom of speech and assembly were restored
 in 1978-79. Political parties and other groups now organize
 public meetings and freely express their views in these
 meetings.
 In 1979, the government amended the Printing Press and
 Publications Act, which permitted several long-banned
 newspapers to resume publication. The press enjoys rela-
 tively greater freedom today than it has had in some years.
 Many privately owned papers, including Bangladesh's leading
 daily, criticize the government freely. There are no
 documented instances of journalists being intimidated during
 1980.
 Laws remain which give the government broad powers to
 control the press. The Special Powers Act prohibits the
 publication of a "prejudicial report," i.e., "any report
 that will prejudice the safety of the public or do damage to
 the state or its relations with any friendly power."
 
 
 954
 Pre-censorship of certain types of news articles is provided
 for by the Act. Although these powers have not been used in
 recent years, their existence, as well as the government's
 control of newsprint and substantial public sector adver-
 tisings, have caused some editors to exercise self-censor-
 ship on some particularly sensitive subjects.
 The government also is empowered to ban foreign and domestic
 books and magazines. The government invokes these powers
 rarely -- i.e., when it fears a publication will incite
 "hatred and violence" between religious communities. There
 was one such proscription during 1980. There are no reports
 of interference with academic inquiry in the natural or
 social sciences.
 Nearly 100 percent of industrial labor is organized, and
 "worker participation committees" are required for firms
 without unions. The government's new labor policy, enacted
 in May 1980, excludes wages and fringe benefits from the
 collective bargaining process in nationalized industries
 (85 percent of the industrial sector). The new policy
 establishes a limited right to strike, but only for "non-
 essential industries." The policy allows a 30-day strike,
 although the government may intervene at any time to end it
 if it judges that the strike is harming local or national
 interest. While wages for nationalized industries are
 determined officially by a wage commission, it has become
 acceptable for unions to circumvent this restriction by
 bargaining over such matters as job classification. Most
 union leaders regard the government's new labor policy as no
 great gain.
 President Zia and other senior officials reiterate the
 government's determination to ensure equal treatment and
 respect for the rights of religious minorities. However,
 Bangladesh's Hindu minority (approximately 13 percent of the
 population) generally occupies a lower economic and educa-
 tional status than that of the Muslim majority. This
 situation is more the result of emigration in past years of
 the more prosperous and educated members of this community
 than of significant discrimination. Some minorities,
 principally Hindus, have encountered serious difficulties
 in retaining their properties as a result of Bangladesh's
 vested property laws. These laws -- which provide
 that property belonging to a person who left Bangladesh
 between 1965 and 1971 shall be managed by the government
 -- have been misused by unscrupulous officials to divest
 minorities of their property. In August, President Zia
 announced the formation of several special committees
 to look into the problems of minorities, including those
 posed by the vested property laws.
 An insurgent movement exists among the approximately
 500,000 tribal people who inhabit the Chittagong Hill Tracts
 District of Bangladesh. Their principal grievances are the
 government's tendency to claim ownership of land which
 the indigenous people regard as tribal property, and the
 movement of plains Bengalis into the Hill Tracts. These
 grievances were aggravated in 1979 by a government program
 of resettling Bengalis in the Hill Tracts. Violence broke
 
 
 955
 Out in March 1980 among tribal people, Bengali migrants
 and Bangladesh army units, resulting in the deaths of
 25 to 300 people and the charge that government forces had
 massacred tribal people. The government is trying to insure
 that troops engaged in counter-insurgency act in a disci-
 plined manner. Meanwhile, while attempting to contain the
 insurgency by force of arms, the government has responded
 to the grievances of the tribal people by cancelling the
 resettlement program, by seeking negotiated solutions to
 other tribal problems, and by increasing the number of
 development projects in the district. In late 1980,
 however, there was credible evidence that the government had
 changed its policy and was preparing to resume the resettle-
 ment program.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Bangladeshi citizens are free to move within the country.
 Under the Special Powers Act, the government has designated
 "protected areas" from which all non-residents may be banned.
 Bangladeshis regarded as "loyal citizens" are free to visit
 or emigrate abroad, subject to foreign exchange controls
 and, for civil servants, the granting of non-objection
 certificates. Intending emigrants face no official harass-
 ment.
 Except in rare cases, the right to repatriation is observed
 in Bangladesh, and repatriates are treated no differently
 than other citizens. In July 1980, a former official
 who had lived abroad for the last few years, attempted to
 return to Bangladesh. He was detained at Dacca airport and
 required to leave the country, together with others in his
 party. In response to a petition challenging the validity
 of this action, the High Court in September ordered the Home
 Ministry to show cause why this former official's exclusion
 should not be declared void and unlawful.
 The government does not subject women to different rules for
 internal or foreign travel, emigration or repatriation.
 The government has no stated policy on refugee and asylum
 matters. However,' in two instances in recent years, the
 government has provided temporary asylum and maintenance to
 sizeable groups of refugees until they could be repatriated
 safely and voluntarily. In 1978, approximately 200,000
 refugees entered Bangladesh from Burma and were maintained
 in camps (with substantial assistance from the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other donors),
 until their voluntary repatriation to Burma was completed in
 late 1979. In June 1979, some 20,000 persons fled into
 Bangladesh after communal disturbances in West Bengal, India.
 They were allowed to remain in camps established and main-
 tained by the government and local voluntary organizations
 until they could safely return home two weeks later.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Participation in the political system is open to all Bangladeshi
 citizens. The people of Bangladesh chose their governing
 bodies through Union Council (township) elections in early
 
 
 956
 1978, a Presidential election in mid-1978, and par-
 liamentary elections in early 1979. These three elec-
 tions were generally considered to have been free and fair,
 despite some allegations of fraud. Voter turnout was about
 53 percent in the presidential election and 50 percent in
 the parliamentary election. In 1980 the government began
 establishing village governments, whose members are elected
 by "consensus" (i.e., town meeting).
 Since the lifting of the application of martial law to poli-
 tical activities in 1978, there have been no restrictions
 on the activities of political parties. Some fifty parties
 are active, thirteen are represented in parliament. Politi-
 cal parties hold rallies, processions and demonstrations
 without restriction. Their leaders express themselves freely
 in public and in the press, although access to state-owned
 radio and TV is limited. The only current restriction is
 a 1978 ordinance which outlaws parties "affiliated with,
 or funded by, foreign parties or governments and parties
 which maintain secret or underground organizations." In
 addition, the Special Powers Act gives the government
 authority to prohibit the formation of "subversive asso-
 ciations," whenever "there is a danger that the Association
 may act in a manner, or be used for purposes, prejudicial to
 the maintenance of public order." This act also authorizes
 the government to prohibit the formation of associations
 based on any religion which pursues a political purpose.
 The constitution provides for equal rights for women in all
 spheres of public life. Thirty seats in parliament are
 reserved for and occupied by women, and women hold a few
 senior government positions, including two cabinet posts.
 President Zia frequently publicizes his support for equal
 rights and opportunities for women. In Bangladesh's tradi-
 tional culture, however, women play a secondary role to men
 and are seen infrequently in public.
 A significant problem of statelessness is that of the
 Biharis, a non-Bengali, Urdu-speaking Muslim minority. The
 members of this community (or their ancestors) migrated
 to what is now Bangladesh from Bihar and other states of
 India at the time of partition in 1947. After the 1971
 breakup of Pakistan, a majority of the members of this
 community asked to be "repatriated" to Pakistan. The
 Bangladesh government regards these persons as having
 forfeited their citizenship by opting for repatriation to
 Pakistan, but the Government of Pakistan does not acknow-
 ledge their claim to Pakistani citizenship.
 In 1977, Pakistan agreed to accept the remainder of those
 Biharis who had been cleared for repatriation to Pakistan
 but who had not been transferred when the airlift ended in
 1974. The renewed repatriation program commenced in June
 1979 and continued until late in the year; under the renewed
 program over 9,000 Biharis were transported to Pakistan.
 Approximately 250,000 more Biharis have applied for repa-
 triation, but Pakistan has not agreed to accept them. The
 matter remains under negotiation between the two governments.
 
 
 957,
 Mostly housed in camps, members of the Bihari community
 are free to come and go at will, to seek employment and
 to conduct other normal activities. A major difficulty
 some Biharis face is the loss of their properties as a
 result of laws confiscating Pakistani holdings. As a
 result of a 1976 ordinance barring access to the courts
 in abandoned property cases, few Biharis have been able
 to recover their properties.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violation
 of Human Rights.
 The Bangladesh government has allowed independent outside
 investigations of alleged human rights violations. Amnesty
 International representatives last visited Bangladesh in
 1977; there are no other documented visits since that date.
 A number of international non-governmental human rights
 organizations, including Amnesty International, the Inter-
 national League for Human Rights, and the International
 Commission of Jurists are represented in Bangladesh.
 A number of organizations based in Bangladesh (as well as
 individual lawyers) are active in defending and promoting
 human rights. For the Inost part, they do so through publi-
 city campaigns designed to inform people of their rights,
 through provision of legal aid to the poor, and through
 challenges in the courts to government rules and actions.
 One of Bangladesh's senior judges sits on a subcommission
 of the United Nations Human Rights Commission.
