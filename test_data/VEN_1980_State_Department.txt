 VENEZUELA
 In twenty-two years of uninterrupted democratic experience,
 Venezuela has developed into a free and pluralistic society
 with the resiliency to adapt to enormous social changes,
 including a doubling of the population and massive migra-
 tion to the cities which has transformed an essentially
 rural nation into one that is nearly 80 percent urban.
 Until the late 1960's, the country also had a serious
 guerrilla problem. Venezuela has repeatedly demonstrated
 its ability to effect a peaceful transfer of power between
 opposing political parties, and electoral politics is
 the accepted norm at all levels of the society. Conten-
 tiousness has been accommodated with the institutionaliza-
 tion of democracy, and Venezuela maintains a clear commit-
 ment to human rights and a good record in practice.
 One of the most active promoters of democracy and human
 rights in the hemisphere, Venezuela has strongly welcomed
 international initiatives on human rights.  It was an
 active supporter of the return to democracy in Peru and
 Ecuador, as well as of the aborted democratic effort
 in Bolivia. Venezuelan assistance programs are largely
 directed toward alleviating the economic problems of
 the oil poor democracies in the region.
 The Venezuelan enjoys a high degree of individual liberty.
 His rights are protected by a judiciary which enforces
 habeas corpus, a free press with a history of attention
 to possible human rights abuses, and an open political
 system which features constant competition for public
 attention on social issues.
 Successive democratic governments have pursued effective
 policies to co-opt politically motivated advocates of
 violence into the legitimate political process. They
 have done this with such success over the years that
 the president of Venezuela's third largest party is a
 former guerrilla who accepted the proffered opportunity
 to renounce violence for legitimate politics. President
 Luis Herrera Campins' amnesty program was the culmination
 of this process. Prominent former guerrilla leaders
 who had been imprisoned or living underground accepted
 the amnesty offer, although a few have rejected it.
 with the implementation of this amnesty, foreign observers,
 such as the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, have concluded
 that former political activists remaining in jail have
 been found guilty of criminal offenses and are not poli-
 tical prisoners or prisoners of conscience.
 Venezuela is South America's largest petroleum producer,
 and oil wealth accounts for a per capita gross national
 product (GNP) of approximately $3600. Nationalized oil
 and other industries, although administered like private
 enterprises, place a substantial proportion of national
 resources under direct or indirect government control,
 and an estimated one fourth of national employment is
 in government or autonomous government enterprises.
 Despite relatively high employment, income distribution
 patterns are unfavorable at the lower end of the economic
 scale. Approximately 70 percent of the work force has
 only primary education or less. Much remains to be done
 before the poorer sections of society have economic op-
 portunities that match their political liberties.

 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Article 60 Section 3 of the 1961 constitution states
 that "no one may be held incommunicado nor subject to
 torture nor to other proceedings which cause physical
 or moral suffering. Any physical or moral attack inflicted
 on a person subjected to restriction of his liberty is
 punishable." Constitutional guarantees of the integrity
 of the person are enforced, and torture is not practiced.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 The Venezuelan constitution provides that "no law may
 establish the death penalty nor any authority to carry
 it out." It also limits prison sentences to a maximum
 of thirty years, regardless of the offense. Laws prohibit-
 ing cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment generally
 are respected, with occasional exceptions reported in
 cases involving persons accused of guerrilla activities.
 Venezuela's respect for rights of asylum was reaffirmed
 in September 1980 when two adults and a child sought
 asylum in the Mexican Embassy. Although the adults were
 accused of bank robbery and involvement in the death
 of a policeman, safe conduct was granted for them to
 leave the country. The minister of the interior, stating
 that there was no political persecution in Venezuela,
 affirmed that persons seeking asylum would be granted
 safe passage. While the asylees had alleged a police
 "campaign of terror tactics, including threats, torture,
 kidnappings and assassinations", there has been no evidence
 to substantiate their allegations. Although the police
 have been known to be heavy-handed in dealing with cri-
 minals, abuse of police authority is not acceptable to
 the government, the press, or the general public. Prison
 conditions are spartan but adequate, except when utilities
 services fail. An acute water shortage led to a prison
 riot in late 1979, which was followed by upgrading of
 the facility. Women offenders, especially those with
 children, are rarely imprisoned because of a desire not
 to remove them from family responsibilities.
 c.   Disappearances
 Occasional "disappearances" have been reported, and several
 cases have been the subject of Amnesty International
 "urgent action" reports since late 1978. One of these
 cases was resolved when the "disappeared" reappeared
 in prison several weeks after an Amnesty International
 appeal. Disappearances do not represent government policy,
 but agencies charged with countering guerrilla activity
 are slow to respond to inquiries about missing persons
 allegedly detained as a result of anti-guerrilla opera-
 tions. Enforcement of official accountability is effective
 in the civilian courts, but limited in the case of those
 offenses subject to military jurisdiction (i.e. crimes
 against the security of the state) because the attorney
 general does not have jurisdiction over the military
 justice system.
 
 
 555
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Amnesty International noted in its "disappearance" case
 sheet (June 18, 1980) that it has no information that
 prisoners of conscience are being held in Venezuela.
 The government maintains that all persons detained or
 imprisoned have been either convicted or formally charged
 with specified criminal acts. Habeas corpus is an estab-
 lished practice, and arrested persons cannot legally
 be held more than eight days by any one arresting authority
 without formal charges being lodged against them. Delays
 beyond that legal limit normally reflect the bureaucratic
 process rather than arbitrary detention.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Venezuelan law and practice provide for fair trials and
 the assumption of innocence until proven guilty beyond
 reasonable doubt. Rules of evidence are extremely strict,
 and convictions are not easy to obtain. A law passed
 in April 1980 provides for supervised parole, rather
 than imprisonment, of persons either convicted of crimes
 or detained pending trial for crimes whose prescribed
 penalties are five years imprisonment or less. While
 implementation will take some time, the intent is to
 reduce the prison population and eventually to offer
 probation as an alternative to those facing detention
 for less serious crimes. Except in the case of civilians
 tried by military courts for subversive or terrorist
 acts, the civilian judiciary exercises complete jurisdic-
 tion independent of other authority. Charges in both
 civilian and military courts must be for specific criminal
 offenses. The initial decision as to whether prosecution
 should be under the military code is made'by the military
 prosecutor. However, an appeal can be made to the attorney
 general by a defendent regarding the military court's
 right of jurisdiction in the individual case. Military
 justice provides for full access to the court by the
 accused and his lawyers, but third party access to the
 proceedings is left to the judge's discretion. Because
 there is no enforceable limit on the amount of time that
 the state can take in preparing a military court case,
 some prisoners accused of crimes falling within military
 jurisdiction have been held for long periods without
 trial. Appeals of convictions can be made to the supreme
 court. However, the amnesty granted by. the Herrera govern-
 ment has reduced the numbers of civilians (estimated
 at approximately 180 in 1979 by Amnesty International)
 being held under military justice.
 f.   Invasion of the Home
 Article 62 of the Venezuelan constitution provides that
 "the home is inviolable." Court warrants are required
 for an official to enter a private residence. Legal
 safeguards against arbitrary invasion of the home are
 respected in practice.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 .and Education
 Venezuela is a major oil producer with a relatively small
 population, making it a rich country in terms of gross
 domestic product (GDP) per capita: about $3,600 in 1979
 
 
 556
 using the official population figure of 13.4 million.
 In addition to a traditionally high population growth
 rate (over 3 percent), Venezuela has become a pole of
 attraction for immigrant labor, much of which is in
 the country illegally. The true total population is
 unknown, but the minister of the interior recently esti-
 mated it to be 17 million. On this basis, GDP per capita
 is about $2,900. Over forty percent of the total popu-
 lation is under 15 years old.
 Venezuela experienced very high economic growth rates
 in the years following the 1973-74 oil price boom, as
 sharply increased oil revenues were invested in heavy
 industry and other projects. This expansion put some
 serious strains on the economy, however. In early 1979
 a new administration took office on a platform of returning
 the government budget and balance of payments accounts
 to equilibrium, cutting foreign borrowing, and phasing
 down government intervention in the economy by reducing
 tariffs and subsidies. The result has been a period
 of much slower growth (reported by the central bank to
 be 0.7 percent for 1979) and rising prices. The elimina-
 tion of many price controls in the fall of 1979 caused
 the Caracas consumer price index to increase by 24 percent
 over the 12 months ending in June 1980 (the figures for
 food and clothing are 39 percent and 47 percent respec-
 tively). Annual rates of increase for the first 6 months
 of 1980 have been somewhat lower. Problems in effecting
 the change to more market-oriented policies have also
 led to sporadic temporary shortages of some foods in
 1980. However, $372 million has been entered in the
 1981 budget for food subsidies.
 The official unemployment figure for the first half of
 1979 is 5.2 percent, and most observers believe it has
 increased substantially since then, though current figures
 are unavailable. Legal protection for labor is very
 substantial, particularly with regard to dismissals.
 The Venezuelan economy is characterized by a chronic
 labor shortage in many areas, with high rates of labor
 turnover and absenteeism, which reduce productivity.
 Underemployment is common in the public sector.
 Economic policy, particularly the use of oil resources
 for the best interest of the nation, figures high on
 the agenda of public debate. President Luis Herrera
 Campins has made the improvement of public services,
 provision of more adequate housing, and reduction of
 "marginality" (referring to the poor living conditions
 of as much as 40 percent of the urban population living
 in areas of substandard housing) a top priority for his
 term of office. While progress so far has been limited,
 ambitious plans have been announced in the housing area
 (600,000 units over 5 years) and the sixth 5-year plan,
 expected to be completed at the end of 1980, should provide
 detailed targets for other areas.
 Venezuelan life expectancy is now over 65 years, with
 infant mortality 36 per 1000. The government places
 high importance on improving child nutrition levels and
 has designated a Minister of State for Intelligence Develop-
 ment to explore programs for expanding the learning capa-
 city of the nation's children. About 23 percent of the
 central government 1980 budget is devoted to education
 and related areas. 84 percent of the population age
 15 and over is literate. Another 12 percent of the budget
 
 
 557
 is devoted to health and social security. In contrast,
 only 6.5 percent of the budget (nine percent of the 1981
 budget) is devoted to military spending. There is one
 doctor for every 890 people and 3.6 hospital beds for
 1000 inhabitants. Hospital maintenance and the quality
 of nursing care are areas where improvements are needed,
 and this is widely recognized in the government.
 About 76 percent of the Venezuelan population lives in
 urban areas, and only 15 percent of the work force is
 engaged in agricultural occupations. Data on conditions
 in rural areas are not very good, but the standard of
 living there is no doubt significantly lower than in
 the cities. There has been heavy migration to urban
 areas in the last 10 years, and much farm labor is provided
 by illegal immigrants from Colombia. Average family
 monthly income is 50 percent less than that in urban
 areas, and the rate of illiteracy is higher (36 percent)
 than for the country as a whole. Venezuelan government
 policy gives high priority to providing resources to
 the agricultural sector (nine percent of the 1981 budget)
 in order to increase food self-sufficiency. Support
 prices for key foods are, for example, much higher than
 world market levels. Many farmers complain about problems
 in obtaining adequate credit.
 According to the government's household sample survey,
 average monthly Venezuelan household income in the first
 half of 1979 was $674 per month, and 30 percent of house-
 holds receive more than this. A large proportion of
 the population (perhaps over half) considers itself to
 be "middle class." The number of private motor vehicles
 (1.3 million or one for every ten people) testifies to
 a fairly broad distribution of purchasing power.  (Wealthy
 families frequently have several cars, however.) Gasoline
 prices are maintained at 1973 levels and are an important
 subsidy to the population. The dollar/bolivar exchange
 rate puts foreign travel within the reach of many families.
 Most government revenues come directly from the petroleum
 sector, and taxes, other than import duties, are relatively
 low, as are the prices of many public services.
 The Venezuelan constitution prohibits discrimination
 on the basis of sex, and women are accorded the same
 political rights in law as men, as well as "special pro-
 tection" in the workplace. While traditional practice
 has been that the woman's role is in the home, the rapid
 pace of modernization and social change has brought about
 moves toward greater equality and a continuing reexamina-
 tion of the role and rights of women. The Venezuelan
 cabinet includes a Minister of State for Women's Affairs,
 and educated women are increasingly becoming prominent
 professionally. They are prominent in the judiciary
 and often serve as public prosecutors, perhaps in part
 because male lawyers are not attracted by relatively
 low paying government jobs. In general, the government
 is setting a standard in employing increasing numbers
 of women at professional levels.
 Women are still underrepresented in political and economic
 life, although middle-level positions are opening up.
 The female blue collar labor force is also growing, but
 cultural bias and discrimination in employment remains.
 In general, women's wages are lower than those of men
 for the same work. While these differences persist,
 
 
 558
 the trend is toward greater equality of opportunity in
 the workplace.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The four freedoms are guaranteed in the constitution
 and practiced in daily life. The media is free, vociferous
 and often highly critical of government. Government
 tolerance for criticism is quite high, but there are
 government-media tensions and occasional confrontations.
 During the past year, charges of slander were pressed
 against one journalist who accused an official of bribe
 taking. The charges were subsequently dropped after
 a barrage of media criticism. A similar barrage of cri-
 ticism followed the 34-hour suspension of broadcasting
 by a local TV station for showing a documentary deemed
 by the government to be unsuitable for general audiences
 (according to a decree defining audience suitability
 viewing hours). There have been no subsequent disciplinary
 actions against TV stations. Restrictions of media free-
 doms are rare, have some legal basis, are very controver-
 sial, and normally result in the restoration of balance
 in favor of media freedom following a campaign of media
 support for an aggrieved party. Censorship and interfer-
 ence in the cultural and academic fields is not practiced.
 Association and assembly for any lawful purpose is not
 subject to harassment or limitation. Labor is the "object
 of special protection" under Article 85 of the constitution,
 and labor unions are free, independent and powerful,
 as demonstrated by their successful effort in obtaining
 an across the board legislated wage hike effective January
 1, 1980. Collective bargaining is well established.
 Most firms in the modern industrial sector and many state
 institutions have collective contracts with their employees,
 and contracts signed for a substantial part of a given
 industry are extended legally to all workers in that
 industry. Labor's extensive legal rights are respected
 in practice, and workers are protected in their rights
 to strike and against unjustified dismissals. There
 is no state or otherwise favored religion. While the
 population is overwhelmingly Catholic, there is no dis-
 crimination against practicioners of other religions,
 and adherence to a particular faith does not confer ad-
 vantage or disadvantage.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on freedom of movement, either
 within Venezuela or abroad. Venezuelans may emigrate
 without restriction, but few do so, and there is also
 freedom to repatriate without prejudice. Recovery of
 nationality requires a residence period of two years
 for Venezuelan-born repatriates. Venezuela's immigration
 policies have been liberal, and indeed, estimates of
 the number of aliens living in Venezuela range as high
 as one quarter of the population. In an effort to solve
 the undocumented alien problem, the government of Venezuela
 has offered residence documents, without prejudice, to
 employed illegal aliens registering with the authorities
 prior to the end of the year. As of mid-September, ap-
 proximately 100,000 illegal aliens have been granted
 
 
 559
 legal residence status. Venezuela traditionally has
 been a haven for political and other refugees from the
 hemisphere and from Europe, but reliable statistics here,
 too, are lacking.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Venezuela is a multi-party democracy with full citizen
 participation. Elections for president, a bicameral
 congress, and municipal councils are held every five
 years, with voter turnout approximating 90 percent.
 Two parties, Social Christian (COPEI) and Social Democratic
 (Accion Democratica), have had presidents elected and
 held a majority or plurality of the seats in the congress
 during Venezuela's 22 years of uninterrupted democracy.
 A proliferation of minor parties, some of which were
 formerly guerrilla organizations accorded legitimate
 status in connection with amnesty policies, operate freely.
 Amnesty has been encouraged and practiced.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The government has advocated the creation of a United
 Nations mechanism for the monitoring of human rights
 violations and favors the investigation of alleged human
 rights abuses. Venezuela is a signatory to the September
 1980 Riobamba "Charter of Conduct" which states that
 joint acti6n to protect human rights does not violate
 the principle of non-intervention. Domestically, the
 fiscal general (attorney general) is charged with the
 investigation of human rights violations in cases under
 civil court jurisdiction.
 An Amnesty International office operates freely in Caracas,
 as does the Latin American Foundation for Human Rights
 and Social Development. The press is a major monitor
 of alleged human rights violations in Venezuela, and
 it does not hesitate to accord such allegations head-
 line treatment. Tensions that are aroused by such allega-
 tions normally are resolved on the basis that freedom
 of the press prevails.
 The government of Venezuela has received an Amnesty Inter-
 national representative to discuss allegations of human
 rights violations in Venezuela, and there appears to
 be no barrier to discussion with other groups. Additional-
 ly, Venezuela strongly supports the United Nations and
 Inter-American Human Rights Commission and other groups
 and takes pride in its good human rights record.
