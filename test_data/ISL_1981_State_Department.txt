 ICELAND
 Iceland is a democratic state with the oldest elected
 parliament in the world, the Althing, which first met in
 930. Democratic traditions and ideals are deeply rooted,
 and there is broad legal and social support for human
 rights. Elections to the Althing are held at least every
 four years, and the president of the republic is popularly
 elected every four-years as well. The presidential election
 of 1980 was particularly interesting because Iceland elected
 the first woman chief of state ever chosen by popular
 election anywhere in the world. Many factors contributed to
 this result, but it was evident that for some people the
 choice of a woman was a statement of belief in the equality
 of women and in their ability to participate fully in the
 nation's public affairs.
 Internationally, Iceland is a strong defender of individual
 human rights. During 1981, the campaign of the Icelandic
 president of the International Chess Federation, Fridrik
 Olafsson, to obtain the release of the family of Victor
 Korchnoi from the-Soviet Union received wide and vigorous
 support from Icelanders of all political persuasions.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person,
 Including Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. There have been no allegations of torture in
 Iceland.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 Physical punishment is not practiced. Prisons and jails are
 modern and clean; health care and diet are excellent. All
 prisoners are treated the same except that those convicted
 of serious crimes are subjected to somewhat stricter
 security precautions. There is no discrimination by social
 class, race, sex or religion. There are no problems
 regarding family or attorney visits. There have been no
 executions in Iceland in modern history.
 c. Disappearances
 There have been no allegations of people disappearing
 because of official or quasi-official actions. Secret
 arrests, clandestine detention and quasi-official security
 forces are unknown in Iceland.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaranteed
 by law and respected in practice. There is a form of habeas
 corpus; anyone detained must be brought before a judge
 within 24 hours and charged or released. There is no
 preventive detention, and there are no political prisoners.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair public trial is guaranteed. The courts are under the
 minister of justice for administrative purposes but are
 independent of political control, and there are no military
 or other special courts. Defeqdftte are entitled to legal
 counsel and the state will pay -the fees if the defendant.
 cannot. Defendants may ape a to the supreme court. In
 practice this often feiult.lan aeAtexcea being mqdified in
 the defendant's favor.              -
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by law and
 respected in practice. Judicial warrants are required
 except in cases of hot pursuit. There have been no
 allegations of illegal entry or other violations of the home.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includingt
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 These freedoms are guaranteed by law and are in effect.
 Printed materials are not censored except for restrictions
 on some hard-core pornography. Films are normally
 distributed without restriction, but scenes of extreme
 violence and sexual perversion may be deleted. The
 government makes no attempt to restrict journalistic or
 academic inquiry. With the help of financial backing from
 political parties, Iceland has a large number of newspapers
 for its small population. These are entirely free of
 government control and, in fact, are subsidized equally by
 the government, which is required by law to place its
 advertisements in all of Iceland's six national daily
 papers. Limits on criticism of the government and.the
 political parties by the press are unknown. Radio and
 television broadcasting are state-owned and operated. Radio
 and television journalists are supposed to be non-partisan
 and to maintain standards of professional ethics. They are
 supervised by public boards representing the four major
 political parties, as well as other interests. There are no
 restrictions on public meetings except general regulations
 for public safety for outdoor meetings. Unions, scientific
 bodies and professional associations operate freely.
 The Lutheran Church is established in the constitution and
 is the nominal faith of the vast majority of Icelanders.
 Other faiths practice freely and without restriction.
 Religion is not a factor in civil, economic, or political
 status.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There is freedom of movement, foreign travel and
 emigration. The only practical obstacle to foreign travel
 is a limit on the amount of money travelers may take
 abroad. Many people find this an inconvenience, but it does
 not seriously impede their business or vacation travel.
 
 
 806
 There are no restrictions on voluntary repatriation. There
 are no refugees from Iceland, and forcible repatriation is
 unknown. Icelanders may emigrate freely, with no
 discrimination or harassment. There is no discrimination
 against women or other groups in such matters.
 In modern history, Iceland has received two groups of
 refugees. Following the Hungarian revolt of 1956, fifty
 Hungarian refugees settled in Iceland. A few of these
 eventually moved on for their own reasons, but the majority
 stayed and are completely integrated into Icelandic
 society. In 1979, Iceland accepted thirty-four Vietnamese
 refugees. They were received and settled with great care,
 including comprehensive health care, vocational and language
 training, and public housing. Many of the Vietnamese are
 now working and attending school. Iceland has undertaken to
 accept twenty additional Vietnamese refugees, mainly
 relatives of those in the first group.
 Iceland is a signatory of the 1951 Convention on Refugees.
 The first political asyluk case in Icelandic history
 occurred in 1980 and was handled in accord with the
 convention. In the meantime, the Soviet national concerned
 has been granted temporary permission to remain and has
 taken a job on a farm. A French national, who had deserted
 from the French army, subsequently went to Iceland and
 claimed political asylum.. He was denied asylum and returned
 in December 1980 under a Nordic accord stipulating that the
 disposition of a case of a person entering the Nordic area
 illegally remains under the jurisdiction of the coun'try
 through which the person enters the area.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Civil and political liberties in Iceland are fully
 respected. The labor movement, a dominant social and
 political force within the country, acts to protect the
 rights of all workers, a policy backed by advanced and
 comprehensive public welfare legislation.
 Democratic processes exist at all levels, assuring the
 freedom to participate in the political process. The issue
 of democracy within the unions occasionally surfaces in
 Icelandic political debate. Allegations are heard that
 small cliques perpetuate themselves in power, safe from
 effective challenge. As Icelandic unions are highly
 politicized with all of the major parties, ranging from the
 leftist People's Alliance to the conservative Independence
 Party, in leadership positions, these allegations are
 normally used for partisan purposess no solid evidence has
 ever surfaced to suggest that the democratic processes
 within the unions cannot be fully utilized by any group that
 chooses to do so.
 Women are legally equal to men. They may participate freely
 in social, economic and political life. Women tend to
 remain in traditional roles, however. They comprise
 approximately 30 percent of the work force and are active in
 every aspect of'Icelandic political, economic, and cultural
 life. As noted above, the president of Iceland is a woman.
 
 
 807
 Political, professional, economic, and public interest
 groups of all kinds exist and are encouraged by the
 government. Many of these advocate issues or philosophies
 which may be in opposition to a particular government or
 political party. There are a few extremist groups on the
 political fringes. They are small, non-violent, and
 tolerated by the public and the government. There are no
 significant problems regarding nationality, citizenship or
 statelessness.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 No requests have been made for outside investigation of the
 human rights situation in Iceland. There are several human
 rights organizations active in Iceland, including Amnesty
 International, and groups monitoring compliance with the
 Helsinki Final Act and dissident activities in the Soviet
 Union and Eastern Europe. These groups focus almost all
 their attention and resources on problems in foreign
 countries. There is also some effort to improve further the
 participation by disadvantaged groups, such as the mentally
 and physically handicapped, in Iceland's social welfare
 programs. There are also feminist organizations which work
 for women's rights and particularly for greater
 participation by women in:the political process and economic
 and social organizations. These groups are encouraged and
 supported by the government and the political parties.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 National policy stresses full employment and provision of
 decent social services, education and housing. Education
 through the university level is free. There are extensive
 programs to encourage private ownership of homes and to
 provide a comprehensive system of medical and dental care,
 as well as necessary social services, for the entire
 population. A social welfare state on the Scandinavian
 pattern, Iceland has comprehensive programs of old age and
 disability pensions, unemployment compensation, sickness
 ,insurance, and child and family care. Infant mortality is
 only 7.7 per 1000 births. Economic, health and social
 standards are among the best in the world, on a par with the
 Scandinavian countries and the middle class in the United
 States, with life expectancy at birth 73.4 years for males
 and 79.3 years for females. There is virtually no poverty,
 illiteracy or unemployment. The per capita income is
 approximately $12,100. Women enjoy full equality, political
 rights, and complete employment opportunities. Although
 many Icelandic women remain in the traditional roles common
 to Western Europe and North America, there are no legal
 constraints.
