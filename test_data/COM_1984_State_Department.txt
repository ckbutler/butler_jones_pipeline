 THE COMOROS*
 The Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros is a federation
 of three small islands of the Comoran archipelago, which lies
 at the northern entrance to the Mozambique channel. The
 Republic lays claim as well to the fourth island of the
 archipelago, Mayotte, which at the time of independence in
 1975 voted to remain with France. A Constitution adopted by
 popular referendum in 1978 established a federal system with
 elected governors for each island and an elected presidency.
 President Ahmed Abdallah Abderemane unilaterally declared the
 archipelago's independence from France in 1975, after 90
 years of colonial tutelage. Overthrown in late 1975, he was
 returned to power in 1978 following the mercenary-led ouster
 of the repressive, xenophobic regime -of Ali Soilih. Abdallah
 was reelected unopposed in 1984, but the election was
 boycotted by the opposition. In recent years constitutional
 amendments have strengthened his position, notably in the
 appointment of governors and in the establishment of a single
 legal political party, the United Progress Party.
 A 25-30 man mercenary force continues to train and lead the
 Presidential Guard, the best-equipped and prepared security
 force in the islands. French technical assistance is
 provided to the small Comoran armed forces and the
 gendarmerie. Each island administration also has a local
 police force.
 Agriculture remains the basis of economic activity, but with
 a population of 450,000 that will double by the year 2000,
 the Comoros are rapidly approaching full utilization of their
 arable land. Exports of copra, vanilla, essence of
 ylang-ylang, and cloves do not begin to cover the cost of
 necessary imports. There are no industries, inadequate port
 facilities, and a limited highway and communications
 infrastructure. The Comoros are part of the francophone
 Africa monetary zone and depend heavily on France for
 budgetary support and technical assistance.
 Products of a conservative Islamic society, Comoran leaders
 do not recognize the full range of civil and political
 liberties. Village notables and religious leaders dominate
 local politics while three major families, of which the
 President's is one, control the lion's share of the
 import-export business. Farming on small landholdings,
 subsistence fishing, and petty commerce make up the daily
 activity of most of the population.
 The Comoros have only a rudimentary institutional framework.
 Outside the major towns, traditional village life guides all
 social conduct. Comoran justice is casually administered.
 The legal system is a mixture of Islamic law and an inherited

 French legal code. A new consolidated code is slowly being
 drafted. Most disputes are settled by village notables or by
 a civil court of first instance.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings in 1984.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance in 1984.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The federal Constitution guarantees the liberty and security
 of each individual. Penal discipline is very lax. Prisoners
 are released daily for prayers and work. Families provide
 them with their regular meals.
 There were reports in 1983 of some beatings of political
 detainees, but none in 1984 (see section 4).
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Although about 20 officials associated with the Ali Soilih
 regime were held without trial from 1978-80, 14 of these were
 tried in 1980 and received sentences from life imprisonment to
 6 months' incarceration. According to the Government, the
 remaining detainees have since been released. This has not
 been confirmed by independent sources. Several opponents of
 Abdallah's administration, members of a French-based
 coalition, were detained in early 1984. They have reportedly
 been released without trial, although this has not been
 confirmed. In early November 1984, seven individuals were
 arrested and charged with plotting the armed overthrow of the
 Government. As of December 31, they had not been brought to
 trial.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for the equality of all citizens
 before the law and the right of all accused to defense. The
 judiciary is independent and trials are public. The present
 penal code was inherited from the French colonial period and
 is being revised. Most disputes are settled under traditional
 law by village notables. Other civil cases are brought to the
 courts of first instance on each of the three islands.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for the inviolability of home and
 property. There were no known cases of arbitrary interference
 with privacy in 1984.

 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Constitution guarantees freedom of expression, of
 thought, and of conscience, the only local news medium is the
 government-controlled radio station, which is self-censoring
 when covering domestic events. No independent local news
 publications exist, but there are a few clandestine tracts
 critical of the regime. The Comoros have no print media,
 although the Government plans to begin a weekly newspaper in
 early 1985. Foreign journals and newspapers are readily
 available, as are books from abroad. Comorans discuss and
 criticize their Government and its leading personalities in
 private.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 While the Constitution states thab freedom of association and
 freedom to form unions are guaranteed, as well as the right to
 strike, in practice these rights are limited. The only legal
 political activity allowed is within the United Progress
 Party. However, social occasions, such as the lavish,
 traditional Comoran wedding feasts, are scenes of intense
 political maneuvering. There were no reports of public
 gatherings being forbidden in 1984. Although the right to
 strike is guaranteed, the wage labor force is small and unions
 are not effectively organized. The scarcity of jobs is also a
 real restraint on labor complaints. In the public sector, the
 Government broke a teachers' strike in 1982 by hiring new
 teachers. Hospital workers reportedly struck in late 1983 to
 claim unpaid wages, and many Government civil servants engaged
 in slowdowns and stoppages for the same reason. Unrest
 appeared to ease considerably in 1984 with regular payment of
 wages.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The large majority of the population (86 percent) is Muslim,
 and, according to the Constitution, Islam is the 'wellspring
 of the principles and rules which guide the state and its
 institutions." However, most aspects of freedom of religion
 and the right to practice openly non-Islamic faiths are
 guaranteed and respected in practice. There are established
 churches for Protestants and Catholics. While Christian
 missionaries work in local hospitals and schools, they are not
 allowed to proselytize openly.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on freedom of movement in and out of
 the Comoros for either citizens or foreigners. Travel within
 the Comoros is also unrestricted for citizens and foreigners.
 There is an exile community that opposes the Government, but
 no exiles who returned to the Comoros in 1984 are known to
 have been subjected to reprisal by the Government.

 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 President Abdallah has dominated the Comoran Government since
 his return to power in 1978 and, unopposed, was overwhelmingly
 reelected to a second term as President in September 1984. A
 member of the French-based opposition to Abdallah reportedly
 attempted to get his name on the ballot but was disqualified
 on technical grounds. There were also unverified charges of
 electoral fraud during the presidential election, and
 non-Comoran observers have stated that the announced
 percentage of eligible voters participating conflicted with
 their own observations of low turnout in some areas. However,
 most observers of the Comoran political scene believe that
 Abdallah would have won the election under any circumstances,
 although with somewhat less than 99 percent.
 Abdallah commands the personal loyalty of the Presidential
 Guard, the most formidable security force in the country. His
 position is buttressed both by tradition and by his own
 personal wealth. He also appoints ministers and governors.
 Leading figures of the Government and the society vie for
 influence and the eventual mantle of the Presidency. At the
 legislative level, there are 38 members in the National
 Assembly. Within the one-party structure, the 1982 elections
 were freely contested and seats won without massive majorities
 (60 percent is considered a strong mandate). Most contests
 went into second-round voting and the legislature acquired
 several new members.
 A referendum on the status of Mayotte scheduled for 1984 was
 postponed by the French Government. No new date was set. In
 1977, 96 percent of the voters in Mayotte opted in favor of
 remaining with France.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Comoros permitted a visit from Amnesty International in
 1981, but there is no recent information on human rights
 investigations. In its 1984. report (covering 1983) Amnesty
 International said its principal concerns were the short-term
 detention or imprisonment of suspected political opponents of
 the Government and the beating or ill-treatment of political
 detainees, some of whom, Amnesty International said, may have
 been prisoners of conscience. Freedom House rates the Comoros
 "partly free.*
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The Comoros are a small, poor, traditional island society.
 The constitutional deference to Islam is but a formalization
 of the deeply held commitment of most Comorans to an Islamic
 world view. This commitment, reinforced by two and one-half
 wretched years of experience with a radical socialist regime
 under Ali Soilih, has set Comorans in stern opposition to
 socialist options. This is particularly true of the older
 generation, which once again controls wealth and wields
 influence. The Comoran commitment to a free society is
 
 
 COMOROS
 essentially a traditional Islamic one of an open market place,
 tolerance for other religions, and equality of Muslims before
 Allah. At the same time, the society retains many aspects of
 its feudal origins, including an established traditional
 hierarchy whose authority is based on inheritance, age, and
 wealth or religious leadership.
 Within Comoran society, men have a dominant role. At
 traditional ceremonies and social gatherings the sexes are
 separated. Yet women are neither veiled nor limited to minor
 civil service posts with the Government. The Constitution
 provides for the equality of citizens regardless of race, sex,
 or religion, and suffrage is universal, although the opinions
 of husbands and fathers exercise a formidable influence over
 women's voting habits. Women have the right to participate in
 the political process, but tradition has so far discouraged
 the exercise of that right.
 economic prospects for the Comoros are dim. The population
 of 450,006 ie growing at a rate of 2.9 percent per year and
 most arable land is already being cultivated. There are no
 evident prospects for industrialization. As a result of the
 significant efforts made in education since the mid-1970's,
 the primary school. enrollment radio in 1980 for males was
 116.5 per cent and 86.5 percent for females. The number of
 secondary school graduates has doubled in the past few years.
 However, there are few jobs-for these graduates.
 Markets for the Comoros' tropical cash crops are fragile and
 dwindling. The per capita GNP of $339 (1982 stati-stic) is
 likely to decrease in real terms as export levels stagnate and
 population grows. An abundance of tropical fruits and fish
 keeps the population from serious malnutrition. Calorie
 levels are 93 percent (1977 statistic) of requirements. Major
 food commodities such as rice must be imported. Long-term
 international help in the form of food aid and technical
 assistance for crop diversification seems necessary in the
 foreseeable future for the Comoros. The leadership is hoping
 that new technical training programs will prepare youth for
 off-island jobs.
