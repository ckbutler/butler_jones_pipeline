 LUXEMBOURG
 Luxembourg is a constitutional monarchy with a democratic parliamentary form
 of government. The role of the Grand Duke is mainly ceremonial and administra-
 tive. The Prime Minister is the leader of the dominant party in the popularly elected
 Parliament. The Council of State, whose members are appointed by the Grand
 Duke, serves as an advisory body to the Parliament. The judiciary is an independent
 branch.
 The Government effectively controls the security apparatus, which consists of po-
 lice and gendarmerie.
 Luxembourg has a prosperous market economy with active industrial and services
 sectors. Its standard of living and level of social benefits are high.
 The Constitution and laws provide for the full range of human rights, and the
 Government respects these rights in practice.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Rilling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture and other cruel punishment, and the authorities respect
 these provisions. Officials immediately investigated the sole allegation of police mis-
 treatment and took disciplinary action. Also in 1994, two police officers were con-
 victed of mistreating a resident foreigner in 1993; they were given suspended sen-
 tences and required topay fines.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law stipulates that judicial warrants
 are required for arrests except in cases of hot pursuit. Within 24 hours of arrest
 the police must lodge charges and bring the suspect before a judge. Suspects are
 not held incommunicado.They are given immediate access to an attorney, at gov-
 ernment expense for indigents. The presiding judge may order release on bail.
 Exile is never imposed.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The independent judiciary is headed by the Su-
 preme Court, whose members are appointed by the Grand Duke. Defendants are
 presumed innocent. They have the right to public trial, and are free to cross-exam-
 ine witnesses and to present evidence. Either the defendant or the prosecutor can
 appeal a ruling-, appeal results in a completely new judicial procedure, with the pos-
 sibility that a sentence may be increased or decreased.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 provides for the right to privacy, and the authorities respect this. Police must obtain
 a judicial warrant in order to enter a private residence, to monitor private cor-
 respondence, or to conduct electronic surveillance.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for freedom of speech and
 press, and the Government does not restrict this freedom. Print media are privately
 owned. The privately owned national radio and television company has exclusive tel-
 evision broadcasting rights within the country. A new permit system allows estab-
 lishment of other private radio stations. Radio and television broadcasts from neigh-
 boring countries are freely available.
 Academic freedom is fully respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for freedom
 of peaceful assembly and association. The authorities routinely and unconditionally
 grant permits for public demonstrations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government does not hamper exercise of this freedom. There is no state religion,
 but the State pays salaries of Roman Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish clergy, and
 several local governments maintain sectarian religious facilities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens have full freedom of domestic and foreign travel, emigration,
 and repatriation.
 The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and
 other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees, and does not expel those
 having a valid claim to refugee status. It has taken no action against the more than
 200 people from the former Yugoslavia remaining in Luxembourg after the Govern-
 ment denied them temporary asylum.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Luxembourg is a multiparty democracy. Suffrage is universal for citizens aged 18
 and above, and balloting is secret. National parliamentary elections are held every
 5 years.
 Women are active in political life. There are 7 women in Parliament (including
 its President), 2 in the Cabinet, and 3 in the European Parliament, and the mayors
 of several major municipalities, including the capital, are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government does not restrict the activities of domestic or international
 human rights groups.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex. Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits racial, sexual, or social discrimination, and the Government en-
 forces these provisions. Blatant societal discrimination occurs only rarely.
 Women.-Women enjoy the same proerty rights as men. In the absence of a
 prenuptial agreement, property is equally divided upon dissolution of a marriage.
 The law mandates equal ay for equal work. To date there have been no work-
 related discrimination suits. While the number of working women remains relatively
 low, the percentage of women who work has more than doubled over the past two
 decades, and increasing numbers of women hold prominent positions in medicine
 law, journalism, and other professions, as well as in public service. Latest official
 data indicate that from 1970 to 1991, the percentage of women aged 30 working out-
 side the home rose from 28 percent to 58 percent, while for women aged 40, the
 rate increased from 21 percent to almost 53 percent.
 Violence against women is not widespread, and neither society nor the Govern-
 ment is tolerant of it. The Government prosecutes persons accused of violence
 against spouses or other women, but cases are rare. Several women's rights groups
 aid battered women.
 Children.-Child abuse does not appear to be widespread, and laws against child
 abuse are enforced. The Association for the Prevention of Child Abuse, a govern-
 ment organization created in 1984, estimates there may be some 200 cases a year.
 The Association works closely with other social service organizations and maintains
 a hot-line for victims or witnesses.
 National IRacial/Ethnic Minorities.-Although foreigners constitute over 30 per-
 cent of the total population, antiforeigner incidents are infrequent and rarely in-
 volve violence. Resident "skinheads" and neo-Nazis are few. In August the police
 rapidly dispersed and deported over 150 neo-Nazis from surrounding countries who
 attempted to stage racist demonstrations in Luxembourg.
 People With Disabilities.-National legislation does not directly mandate acces-
 siblity for the disabled, but the Government pays subsidies to builders to construct
 "disabled-friendlf structures. Despite government incentives, only a modest propor-
 tion of buildings and public transportation have been modified to accommodate peo-
 ple with disabilities.
 The Government helps disabled persons obtain employment and professional edu-
 cation. By law, businesses and enterprises with at least 25 employees must fill a
 quota for hiring disabled workers, and must pay them prevailing wages. The quota
 is fixed according to the total number of employees, and employers who do not fulfill
 them are subject to sizable monthly fines. There have been no known complaints
 of noncompliance.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-All workers have the right to associate freely and
 choose their representatives. About 65 percent of the labor force is unionized. Mem-
 bership is not mandatory. Unions operate free of governmental interference. The
 two largest labor federations are linked to, but organized independently of, major
 political parties. The law prohibits discrimination against strikes and strike leaders,
 and a labor tribunal deals with complaints on these matters.
 All workers have the right to strike except for government workers providing es-
 sential services such as police, armed forces, and hospital personnel. However,
 strikes are rare; none occurred in 1994.
 Unions maintain unrestricted contact with international bodies.
 b. The Riqht to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for and pro-
 tects collective bargaining, which is conducted in periodic negotiations between cen-
 tralized organizations of unions and employers. Enterprises having 15 or more em-
 ployees must have worker representatives to conduct collective bargaining. Enter-
 prises with over 150 employees must form joint works councils composed of equal
 numbers of management and employee representatives. In enterprises with more
 than 1,000 employees, one-third of the membership of the supervisory boards of di-
 rectors must be employees' representatives.
 The law provides for adjudication of employment-related complaints, and it au-
 thorizes labor tribunals to deal with them. A tribunal can impose a fine on an em-
 ployer found guilty of antiunion discrimination, but it cannot require the employer
 to reinstate a worker fired for union activities.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-he law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, and neither occurs.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law prohibits employment of
 children under age 15, and requires children to remain in school until age 16. Ap-
 
 
 886
 prentices who are 15 or 16 years old must attend school in addition to their job
 training. Adolescent workers under age 18 receive additional legal protection, in-
 cluding limits on overtime and the number of hours that can be worked continu-
 ously. The Ministries of Labor and of Education effectively monitor the enforcement
 of national child-labor and education laws.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The law provides for minimum wage rates at
 levels that vary according to the worker's age and number of dependents. The mini-
 mum for a single worker over age 17 is a pproximately $7.49 per hour (238.81 Lux-
 embourg francs). Supporting a f amiy is dicult on the minimum wage, but most
 employees earn more   an  e minimunm.
 National legislation mandates a workweek of 40 hours. Premium pay is required
 for overtime or unusual hours. Employment on Sunday is prohibited except in con-
 tinuous-process industries (steel, glass, and chemicals) and for certain maintenance
 and security personnel. Employment on Sunday must be voluntary and compensated
 at double the normal wage; and the employee must be given compensatory time off
 on another day, equal to the number of-nours worked on Sunday. The law requires
 rest breaks for shift workers, and limits all workers to a maximum of 10 hours per
 day including overtime. All workers receive at least 5 weeks of paid vacation yearly,
 in addition to paid holidays.
 The law mandates a safe working environment. An effective inspection system
 provides severe penalties for infractions. The Labor Inspectorate of the Ministry of
 Labor, and the Accident Insurance Agency of the Social Security Ministry, effec-
 tively carry out their inspections.
 No laws or regulations specifically guarantee workers the right to remove them-
 selves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to continued employment,
 but every worker has the right to ask the Labor Inspectorate to make a determina-
 tion, and the Inspectorate usually does so expeditiously.
