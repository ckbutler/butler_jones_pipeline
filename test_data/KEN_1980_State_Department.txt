 KENYA
 Kenya is in practice, a one-party state. There is no legal
 prohibition against additional parties, and political
 activity takes place within wide tolerances, including
 multiple candidacies that in the last national parliamentary
 election resulted in the defeat of 60 percent of the incum-
 bents.
 Chapter five of the Kenya constitution, subtitled "Protec-
 tion of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms of the Individual,*
 enunciates in 17 sections substantial protection for funda-
 mental rights and liberties. The judicial system is inde-
 pendent and, for the most part, impartial. President Daniel
 arap Moi, who succeeded President Kenyatta upon the latter's
 death in August 197M, acceded to power in accordance with
 the constitution. In December 1978, President Moi released
 all 16 political prisoners detained by the Kenyatta govern-
 ment. He renewed the Public Security Act, however, under
 which political prisoners can be detained. National
 elections have occurred in an orderly fashion (1963, 1966,
 1969, 1974, 1979) during Kenya's almost.17 years of inde-
 pendence. Elections are regarded as a renewal (or with-
 drawal) of the popular mandate to govern, and the results
 have been respected by the government. In November 1979,
 President Moi was elected to a five-year term as president.
 Ten individuals were barred from running for parliament for
 political reasons. Thirty-one candidates for parliament
 challenged the election results for their districts in
 court; five challenges have been successful, and a small
 number of petitions remained to be heard at the end of 1980.
 In 1980 the government formally deregistered the civil
 servants' union, the country's second largest union, because
 of its alleged political activities.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is not practiced in Kenya. It is specifically
 forbidden under Section 74 of the Kenyan constitution.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Legal safeguards, including Section 74 of the constitu-
 tion, exist against cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
 punishment, although prison conditions are often poor.
 In March 1980, the Attorney General's office issued a
 directive authorizing police to shoot suspected criminals on
 sight. Members of parliament and the press questioned
 the propriety of the directive and three months later
 it was rescinded.
 No summary executions have taken place in independent
 Kenya. Persons detained under the Public Security Act
 in the past frequently were denied both written and face-
 to-face contact with family members. In many instances,
 they were denied reading matter except the Bible, denied
 adequate lighting in their cells, and were held in isola-
 tion. Discriminatory treatment of non-political prisoners,
 male or female, has not been reported.

 In October 1979 para-military police units brutalized
 certain ethnic elements in northwest Kenya, killing
 several people, in a sweep for weapons. Although the
 government initially denied the incident's occurrence, it
 subsequently conducted an investigation which confirmed the
 allegations of several eyewitnesses and corrective measures
 were taken. The tribespeople in question lead a pastoral
 existence, traditionally have kept weapons for self-defense
 and raiding purposes, and were reluctant to surrender
 them. Such incidents are not commonplace in Kenya.
 c. Disappearances
 There is no evidence that secret arrests, abductions
 or other examples of officially sanctioned disappearances
 have occurred under President Moi's government.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The Public Security Act of 1960 was revised to its
 present form in 1978. It is an omnibus bill and includes
 subsidiary legislation and regulations which apply to
 five broad categories:
 A) Northwest province and contiguous districts;
 B) armed forces;
 C) control of movement;
 D) Meru; and
 E) detained and restricted persons.
 The Act states that its provisions and subsidiary legisla-
 tion supercede "any such law" with which it might be
 inconsistent (Section 7(3)), but also provides in
 Section 3(3) that regulations promulgated under the Act
 shall not be: I) inconsistent with or in contravention
 of Section 72 of the constitution (which protects the
 right of personal liberty) or Section 82 of the constitu-
 tion (which provides protection from discrimination), or
 any other provision of the constitution, or II) purport
 to amend, modify or suspend the operation of, any written
 law other than regulations made under the Act.
 The above provisos notwithstanding, in practice the Act
 supercedes constitutional safeguards since it empowers
 the state to undertake actions in a wide range of circum-
 stances to control the activities of individuals and
 groups normally regarded as lawful, without recourse to
 the judiciary or any other authority.
 Political detention is permitted under the Act, which
 however provides certain procedural protections.
 Detainees must be informed of the reasons for their
 detention within five days of arrest, and they have the
 right to have their cases reviewed every six months by a
 special tribunal. The tribunal is appointed by the
 President, meets in camera, and the government is not
 bound to comply with its findings. The incidence of
 politically motivated arrests under these provisions
 since independence has been low. President Moi released
 the 16 political prisoners in detention on December 12,
 1978. No politically motivated detentions have occurred
 under his government. The government nevertheless
 has discouraged institutions it controls from assisting
 the efforts of three former detainees to obtain employment.
 
 
 130
 Habeas corpus exists in practice. Except for the Public
 Security Act, Kenyan law does not provide for preventive
 detention per se. If police authorities suspect that an
 individual may pose a danger to the public safety,
 however, they may request from a magistrate a writ to
 arrest and detain the individual, outlining the reason
 and the proposed period of detention. There have been no
 reports that such extraordinary requests ever have been
 lodged. In normal criminal cases, a suspect can be held
 without charge legally for no longer than 24 hours.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial is respected in Kenya,
 except for detention oases lodged under the Public Security
 Act. In such cases the authority of the regular courts
 is limited to ensuring compliance with the procedural pro-
 visions of the Act which are detailed above in Section
 I(d). Kenyan law provides that a defendant has the right
 to private counsel of his choosing. Only in the case of
 a capital offense is the government obliged to provide
 counsel to the accused. The judiciary acts independently
 of other branches of government and civilians are tried in
 civil courts. Defendants may appeal civil court verdicts
 to the high court. Military courts adjudicate cases under
 military law which affects armed forces personnel exclusively.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The generally high standards of impartiality of the Kenya
 courts have been paralleled by respect for due process
 on the part of Kenyan authorities. As a consequence,
 the sanctity of the home and.other guarantees of English
 common law are respected in Kenya. Police or other offi-
 cials ordinarily are required to obtain a magistrate's
 warrant before entering a private residence.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 Economic Assessment
 While the government is committed strongly to improving
 standards of living, health and educationt economic
 performance in the past five years has not been good,
 with per capita gross domestic product growth averaging
 less than .5 percent. World economic conditions and
 local factors, both short and long term, have begun to
 undermine performance. A population growth rate of four
 percent raises very serious doubts about the ability of
 the economy to provide even small increases in per capita
 income, let alone significant increases in health stand-
 ards and education for children now being born.
 The government, strongly supportive of the right to own
 property, actively assisted the acquisition of agricultural
 land by smallholders. Smallholders account for 75 percent
 of total agricultural output, 70 percent of the total
 employment in the economy. Following independence in 1963 a
 series of land transfer schemes (including the reallocation
 of about 3.5 million acres) was enacted and Kenyan agricul-
 ture underwent a major transition as Africans moved into
 the former "white highlands" and smallholders grew crops
 once restricted to European production.
 
 
 131
 Kenyan law attempts to insure just conditions and remunera-
 tion for work. All wage and salary earners are covered by
 the minimum wage provisions of the Employment Act. There
 are four separate minimum wages: for agriculture; for the
 two major cities (Mombasa and Nairobi); for other urban
 areas; and for all other areas of employment. These rates
 were revised in May 1980 to offset partially the local rate
 of inflation.
 Of the 972,000 permanent wage and salary earners in 1979,
 about 30 percent were in the two major cities and, there-
 fore, received the highest wages (about 25 percent were
 employed in agriculture which pays the lowest wages).
 Casual labor is estimated between 10 and 25 percent of the
 work force depending on the season and level of economic
 activity. It is particularly prevalent in agriculture and
 construction.
 All wage agreements are subject to guidelines issued
 periodically by the Ministry of Finance. The latest
 guidelines, issued on February 15, 1979, limit wage in-
 creases to one-half of the increase in the cost of living
 since the time of the previous agreement or past two years.
 This increase must be divided annually over the life of the
 agreement. Union leaders have often objected publicly to
 the continuation of the wage guidelines and this issue was
 recently raised in parliament. The Minister of Labor told
 the press in late 1980 that a revised incomes and wages
 policy was being prepared. All collective agreements must
 be approved by the industrial court before they become
 effective.
 All permanent workers in enterprises employing at least
 seven persons may be organized in trade unions, though
 civil servants are not represented by any union. About 75
 percent (700,000) of all employees in the country work in
 such enterprises. Of these, some 350,000 pay voluntary dues
 contributions to trade unions. Unions actually represent a
 greater number in collective bargaining. As there are no
 union shop arrangements, workers who do not belong to
 unions are covered by collective arrangements for their
 enterprise or industry. The total number of agreements in
 force is not known, but almost every sector of the economy
 is covered by a collective agreement, including the major
 agricultural activities: coffee, tea, sugar and sisal.
 Agreements are almost always of two-year duration.
 If there is a dispute under the agreement or in nego-
 tiating a new agreement, it is referred to the Ministry
 of Labor for conciliation or mediation. Some 811 dis-
 putes were declared in 1979. When mediation fails, the
 final recourse is to voluntary arbitration by the indus-
 trial court. The court has never heard more than 100
 cases in any one year. (In 1979 it registered 85 cases.)
 Its decisions are final and binding on both parties.
 Strikes are permitted only if the Ministry of Labor has
 not taken action within 21 days of the declaration of a
 dispute to have it resolved. In actual practice almost
 all strikes that occur are illegal. In 1979 there were
 54 strikes involving 13,487 workers with 33,083 man days
 lost. This was an increase in time lost of about 65
 percent over the previous year. Although the Minister
 of Labor on occasion has threatened to punish strike
 
 
 132
 leaders under provisions of the Trade Disputes Act, in
 1980 no leaders have been brought to court. Some workers,
 however, have been dismissed for engaging in strikes.
 Approximately 86 percent of Kenya's 15.8 million population
 lives in the rural areas and an estimated 46 percent of them
 live below the poverty level. While there is considerable
 variation within geographic regions, there are clear
 differences in the average welfare levels among provinces
 and eco-zones. In two provinces, Western and Nyanza, over
 50 percent of the rural population lives below the poverty
 line. The rural poor include some smallholder farmers,
 pastoralists, the landless, and large-farm squatters; the
 urban poor include the unemployed and casual laborers.
 While the poor have been identified by the statistical
 convenience of income levels, poverty is measured by rela-
 tive access to basic services; levels of health, nutrition,
 and education; and possession of basic material goods.
 Forty-five percent of Kenya's total 8.6 million small-
 holders account for 20 percent of total smallholder
 income. The typical poor smallholder has 2.1 hectares
 but 45 percent hold less than one hectare. Smallholder
 households are generally not self-sufficient in food
 production; only 40 per cent of the food they consume is
 home grown. The typical smallholding is managed either
 by the wife or jointly by wife and husband with women
 providing about 75 percent of total on-farm labor.
 Pastoralists are concentrated in Rift Valley Province
 (45 percent), North-eastern Province (20 percent) and
 Eastern Province (24 percent). The life of the pastoral
 groups is regulated by seasonal changes in the availabil-
 ity of water and grazing. Efforts by the government to
 provide education, health care, and other services have
 been aimed at introducing some degree of settlement. let
 when water and pasture seem more abundant elsewhere,
 nomadic pastoralists have moved on, leaving schools and
 dispensaries behind.
 The rural landless generally live in and around smaller
 rural settlements and 12 percent of landless households
 are employed in the informal sector activities (small
 scale services, sale, production), 36 percent as un-
 skilled workers and 52 percent as casual agricultural
 labor. While their incomes often exceed the poor small-
 holder's income, the uncertainties and income variations
 encountered by the landless make it difficult to provide
 for a minimum standard of living.
 Since independence Kenya has made steady progress in the
 health areas, with life expectancy rising from 22.5 years in
 1960 to 51.2 years for males and 55.8 years for females in
 1977. The infant mortality rate fell from 159 per thousand
 in 1960 to 119 in 1969 and to 83 in 1977. In the past,
 however, the government focused health expenditures on
 high cost curative facilities such as hospitals, health
 centers and dispensaries. In rural areas these facilities
 serve only 25 to 30 percent of the population, often drawing
 people from no more than an eight kilometer radius. Commun-
 ity-based health systems which integrate health, nutrition,
 maternal-child care and family planning are only now in the
 first stages of pilot implementation. The health budget
 
 
 133
 already is committed heavily to the recurrent cost of these
 static facilities.
 Kenyans have a strong commitment to education. The following
 data is illustrative:
 Total school enrollment as percent of population in age
 group - Primary: (ages 5-14, 1976); Total 77.2 percent;
 male 82.3 percent; female 72.0 percent. Secondary: (15-19,
 1976); Total 20.2 percent; male 25.2 percent; female 15.1
 percent. Post-secondary: (20-24, 1973); Total .9 percent;
 male 1.7 percent; female .1 percent.
 Although Kenya remains a patriarchal society, women are
 actively involved in the major productive sectors of the
 economy. Nearly all adult rural women engage in farming
 activities on their own smallholdings and produce much of
 the food that their families consume. Women's domestic work
 consists of such arduous and time-consuming tasks as
 firewood collection and hauling water, as well as meal
 preparation and child care.
 Since 1971 the government has attempted to enhance the
 integration of rural women into national development
 by strengthening rural women's groups, by establishing
 a women's bureau in the Ministry of Housing and Social
 Services and by increasing the number of women extension
 agents. At agricultural training facilities such as
 Egerton College, the government reserves a percentage
 of placements for women. As important as these steps
 are, they fall far short of an all-encompassing strategy
 and program. The percentage of females entering primary
 schools increased from 33 percent of total primary school
 enrollments in 1961 to 47 percent in 1978. For secondary
 schools, however, female enrollment only increased from
 33 percent of total enrollments in 1961 to 36 percent in
 1978. At the university level, only 2.2 percent of the
 students are female. Women have never held more than
 five elected parliamentary seats (out of 158 seats) and
 in the latest elections won only four seats.
 Women have been brought increasingly into the agricultural
 cash economy but they are at the same time still burdened
 with traditional responsibilities. The most important
 recent phenomenon for women in rural areas, however, has
 been the massive out-migration of males, particularly
 from western Kenya and the arid and semi-arid lands.
 With the males taking urban wage employment, the women
 are being left with virtually the entire responsibility
 for agricultural production. Incremental increases in
 agricultural production, particularly on the smallhold-
 ings, is therefore crucially tied to the government's
 ability to provide production services and incentives to
 the women farmers.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Freedom of conscience (including freedom of religion),
 freedom of expression and freedom of assembly and associa-
 tion are enunciated in Sections 78, 79 and 80 of the Kenyan
 constitution. Freedom of expression and communication in
 
 
 134
 Kenya, however, can be restricted under various sections
 of the penal code and restrictions were applied in 1980.
 The existence and past use of detention laws inhibit
 public exchange of views on sensitive political subjects.
 Because of past violation of members' immunity, National
 Assembly debates of public issues are usually non-
 controversial.
 The government discourages both students and faculty
 from political activism. One faculty member underwent
 24 hours of police questioning because of his published
 political statements. In August 1980, the Hoi government
 formally deregistered the university staff association,
 a professional body, because of its alleged involvement
 in politics.
 Although there is no formal censorship of the press,
 government guidelines are issued on politically sensitive
 issues and usually are observed by the media. In late
 1980 the Moi government briefly detained two Kenyan
 journalists and subjected them to questioning about
 articles they had written and the identity of their
 sources. One of the journalists was required to surrender
 his notes and submit to a warrantless police search of
 his residence and office. In one instance in the fall of
 1980, the government used economic pressure to attempt to
 restrict a journal's discussion of politically sensitive
 internal issues. Kenya's press, nonetheless, is active
 and assertive in reporting and commenting on internal
 developments. There is no formal censorship of published
 works in Kenya but publishers discourage authors from
 submitting for publication works which may spark politi-
 cal controversy. Even in cases where books, plays or
 other works have become politically sensitive, the pub-
 lications have remained available for sale to the public.
 In one past instance, however, a novelist whose works
 criticized the elite was detained under the provisions
 of the Public Security Act. Thus, formal censorship
 of publications is exercised, if at all, ex post facto.
 A 30-member film censorship board operates out of the
 Attorney General's office and must approve all films
 to be shown in Kenya. A 10-member television censorship
 board based in the office of the President has established
 precepts incorporating nationalist and developmental goals
 which govern what can or cannot be shown on television.
 Freedoms of assembly and association are limited by the
 Public Order and Police Act which gives local adminis-
 trative authorities and police wide powers to control
 public meetings. It is an offense to convene an un-
 licensed meeting. With these powers, the government can
 and does on occasion, prevent political meetings. Under
 the Societies Act, the government can refuse to register
 any society which it believes may pursue activities
 harmful tO public security. This denial of registry,
 combined with the restrictions of the Public Order and
 Police Act, effectively can prevent an organization from
 operating. A former opposition political party, the now
 defunct Kenya People's Union (KPU), remains proscribed
 under this Act. The government used the same powers to
 ban the Jehovah's Witnesses in 1973, but later revoked
 the ban when threatened with a court test of the
 constitutionality of the Societies Act. Kenya has
 
 
 135
 a relatively free trade union movement but strikes are
 almost always illegal. In August 1980, the government
 formally deregistered the union forKenyan civil servants,
 the country's second largest trade union, because of its
 alleged political activities.
 There is full freedom of religion in Kenya.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Under presidential detention power, individuals may be
 restricted in their movements within the country, but
 this power has not been used in recent years. Women and
 other groups are not subjected to separate rules in
 matters of internal or foreign travel, emigration or
 repatriation. The right of voluntary repatriation is
 respected. The government is sympathetic towards refu-
 gees. While the urban unemployment rate is high, Kenya
 has accepted more than 4,000 refugees. About 1,000 of
 these are Ethiopians; 1,000 are Rwandans; and 500 are
 Ugandans. Most refugees in Kenya have status as "accepted
 asylum seekers" which means they report periodically to
 the immigration department. Refugees may hold jobs,
 attend school, own property and obtain international
 travel documentation after a security check. Financial
 assistance for living expenses, education and/or estab-
 lishing businesses may be provided by the United Nations
 High Commission for Refugees under certain circumstances.
 The government also has agreed to provide a tract of farming
 land in Coast Province for about 150 refugee families, and
 some Kenyans.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Kenya has only one political party, the Kenya African
 National Union (KANU), although there is no law against
 the formation of others. The government has substantial
 powers to restrict political activity. One political
 party was banned in 1969. Ten individuals, including five
 ex-KPU leaders and a political detainee released in December
 1978, were banned from running in Kenya's November 8, 1979,
 parliamentary elections. Two other detainees released in
 December 1978 were allowed to stand for parliament and
 several persons banned from standing for parliament in 1979
 were politically active in 1980. Those who wish to stand
 for election must be life members of KANU. Refusal to grant
 life membershp occasionally has been used to preclude
 individuals from standing for political office. Political
 activity within the KANU framework is vigorous, however, and
 about 750 candidates representing a wide range of political
 views contested 158 elected seats of the National Assembly.
 Parliamentary elections in 1969, 1974 and 1979 each saw the
 defeat of over 50 percent of the incumbents. Kenyan society
 is patriarchal, and attitudes toward the role of women
 reflect traditional values. Sexual discrimination is not
 government policy. The stated policy is equality of oppor-
 tunity for all, without regard to race, sex, ethnic origin,
 creed or political opinion. Few women hold positions of
 authority. Four women are members of parliament, and one
 assistant minister is female.
 
 
 136
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Kenyatta government barred entry into Kenya of journal-
 ists who were critical of the former President and his
 family. In the past, former Attorney General (now Home and
 Constitutional Affairs Minister) Charles Njonjo has criti-
 cized such non-governmental bodies as Amnesty Interna-
 tional and questioned their right to pass judgment on the
 internal policy of sovereign states. The Moi government has
 encouraged the efforts to draft an African human rights
 charter.
