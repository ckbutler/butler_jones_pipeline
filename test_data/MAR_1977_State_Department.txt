 MOROCCO
 Morocco is a constitutional monarchy ruled by King Hassan II,
 who assumed the throne in 1961, succeeding his father. Demo-
 cratic institutions have been strengthened in the past
 year, with the lifting of press censorship and the comple-
 tion of phased national elections for a new parliament.
 The King's new government includes leaders of opposition
 parties.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 A number of prisoners arrested during the period of civil
 disturbances that followed the 1971 and 1972 coup attempts
 were brought to trial in 1976-77, and alleged during their
 trials that they had been tortured during interrogation.
 From observation of these trials and from other sources,
 Amnesty International concluded in an October 1977 report
 that 14 persons had died from torture during detention
 before the trials, and that others had been disabled. The
 sources of much of this information are political opponents
 of King Hassan with an interest in discrediting his govern-
 ment, and we have no means to authenticate the allegations.
 Nevertheless, we believe that serious abuses probably did
 occur during the domestic unrest of the early 1970's. Our
 assessment is that such abuses have subsequently been
 curbed, and that the only malpractices that continue are
 harsh interrogation methods resorted to from time to time
 by lower-level law enforcement authorities. We do not
 believe these malpractices are condoned by Moroccan govern-
 ment leaders.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Prisons are old and overcrowded, but the Government is
 seeking to improve them. In 1973-74 approximately 30
 persons were tried and executed for high treason; no
 persons have been executed for crimes against the state
 since 1974. The Government does not resort to exile as a
 punishment, but some political dissidents are in self-
 imposed exile.

 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Until the 1976-77 trials, many of the prisoners implicated
 in the 1973 disturbances had been held for prolonged
 periods, some throughout the intervening years. Sentences
 at these trials were severe, but periodic amnesties have
 been granted; 38 previously sentenced prisoners were
 released in November 1977.
 In the spring of 1977, a number of Moroccans were arrested
 on charges of taking part in leftist clandestine and
 subversive activities involving seven French aid technicians.
 Some of these new detentions may have been intended to dis-
 courage disruptive activities during the June 3 elections.
 we do not have a firm basis for estimating how many were
 detained, or how many are still being held; 20 were
 released in early December.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Some persons caught in the act or directly implicated in
 the 1971 attempt against the life of the King were summarily
 executed. Persons detained for anti-government activities
 since 1971 have been tried in open court. A representa-
 tive of Amnesty International who attended the 1976 trials
 expressed his satisfaction with their conduct. On the
 other hand, the Amnesty International report alleged that
 at the 1977 trials the defendants' right to testify, to
 be informed of the charges against them, and to receive
 unimpeded representation by counsel were not respected.
 Responding to the report in a press release on November 21,
 1977, the Moroccan Ministry of Justice argued that restric-
 tions were necessary because both defendants and lawyers
 had violated court procedure by attempting to create disorder
 and confusion. The U.S. had no observers at these trials.
 e. Invasdion of the Home
 There are no known incidents of intrusions into private
 homes by officials without observance of legal safeguards
 protecting individuals from arbitrary searches.

 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 Morocco addresses these problems through multi-year develop-
 ment plans. The 1972-77 Five-Year-Plan assigned 30 per-
 cent of government spending to education and social
 programs and 16 percent to agriculture; both levels
 represent significant increases over prior years. Further
 increases in these areas are expected in the upcoming
 1978-82 Plan. The government pursues its social objectives
 through such measures as redistribution of state-owned
 land, subsidies and liberal credit for farmers, social
 services and low-cost housing, and special programs
 benefitting the rural poor. While performance has not
 matched stated intentions, particularly in agriculture,
 government plans reflect a commitment to equitable growth
 and the fulfillment of basic human needs.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 These freedoms are all guaranteed under the 1972 Constitu-
 tion. Criticism in the media of the administration, social
 conditions, and all institutions except the monarchy is
 commonplace. The Government tolerates various political
 and religious tendencies. During the 1976-77 electoral
 campaign all parties were allowed to speak and to hold
 meetings. Harassment of the opposition was rare.
 Morocco has a unique history of religious tolerance. Large
 numbers of Moroccan Jews voluntarily left the country after
 the 1967 Arab-Israel war. About 18,000 remain in the
 country and the government is urging others to return.
 Moroccans take pride in their confederation of trade unions,
 one of the oldest labor movements in Africa. It has
 effectively represented the economic interests of the
 working class since independence.
 
 
 Discrimination against women is prohibited by law.
 French educational traditions have opened some doors
 to Moroccan women. Nevertheless, this partial liberali-
 zation is limited for the most part to urban areas,
 while the role of women in the predominantly rural
 environment remains restricted as it has been over the
 centuries.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Freedom of movement is unrestricted throughout Morocco.
 Foreign travel for political reasons was sometimes restricted
 in years past, it is not now restricted to our knowledge.
 There do not appear to be any restrictions on emigration.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Morocco's political environment provides considerable
 opportunity for participation of diverse groups in the
 political process. Suffrage is universal and includes
 women. Early last year, before the June national elec-
 tions, the King appointed leaders of the major opposi-
 tion parties as Cabinet ministers without portfolio.
 The election results were disputed in some cases, but
 are broadly representative of the electorate.. In addition
 to the political independents who constitute a majority,
 there are four political parties represented in the
 current parliament, including a left-socialist party and
 a communist party. Despite some disaatisfaction with the
 conduct of the elections, the opposition parties intend
 to continue to participate in the Parliamentary system
 to promote furtper evolution toward true political pluralism.
 Opposition leaders have been awarded an equitable share
 of vice presidencies and committee chairmanships in the
 new parliament. Likewise, the reogranized Cabinet appointed
 by the King in mid-autumn includes 12 opposition leaders
 in the 32 posts filled.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Viola-
 tions of Human Rights
 There have been no known incidents of Moroccan refusal to
 permit outside groups to enter the country to investigate
 alleged human rights violations. Indeed, Amnesty
 
 
 390
 International and other civil and human rights groups
 have been permitted to send observers to trials. These
 observers have been received by officials of the Moroccan
 Government. On January 13, 1977, the new Minister of
 Justice publicly invited Amnesty International or any
 other humanitarian organization to send impartial observers
 to visit Moroccan courts and prisons.
