 SWITZERLAND
 In Switzerland, which has centuries-old democratic traditions,
 the rule of law, individual freedom and human rights are
 cherished and fostered. The Swiss constitution guarantees
 basic human rights. Swiss social and political institutions
 are well developed, and the Swiss enjoy a high standard of
 living. The federal structure of partially-autonomous cantons
 and the wide linguistic and religious diversity of Switzerland
 have produced a system of consensus which, although sometimes
 slow to assimilate social trends, assures that decisions
 affecting Swiss citizens are broadly based. Cantonal
 involvement in human rights matters is direct but circumscribed
 in federal legislation and constitutional guarantees which
 provide that defendants have a right to appeal to the federal
 level if they believe their constitutional rights or due
 process have been violated in the cantonal courts. Switzerland's
 excellent human rights record has been further enhanced by its
 role as home to a number of worldwide organizations concerned with
 humanitarian affairs and its generous assistance to refugees.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Freedom from torture is guaranteed under Article 65 of the
 constitution and is respected in practice.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in practice.
 The Swiss constitution prohibits corporal punishment.
 c. Disappearances
 There have been no allegations of persons being abducted,
 secretly arrested, or held in clandestine detention.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Habeas corpus does not exist in Switzerland in the same form
 as in common law countries; however, freedom from arbitrary
 arrest and imprisonment is guaranteed by law. Arrest must
 be by warrant and the accused must be brought before a magistrate
 for hearing within 24 hours. The magistrate, in turn, can
 order only limited confinement while the case is referred to a
 grand jury. The grand jury has authority to set bail or order
 detention. A prisoner may not be held in Switzerland on
 investigative detention without appropriate warrants being
 issued.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There have been no allegations of denial of fair, public trial
 in Switzerland. The court system is an independent branch of
 the government, and fair, public trials are guaranteed by the
 Swiss constitution.

 f. Invasion of the Home
 Freedom from invasion of the home is guaranteed by law
 and respected in practice. A magistrate's warrant is required
 in order to enter a private residence, and there have been no,
 allegations of violations of the home by the Swiss authorities.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 The Swiss government is committed to seeing that the vital
 needs of the Swiss community are fulfilled, a commitment
 shared by the cantons, voluntary organizations and private
 industry, all of which are important in providing for the
 welfare of the Swiss. Wealth is reasonably distributed,
 unemployment is negligible, and health services are superior.
 Education is free through the university level. Citizens
 have the right to own property, but there are prohibitions
 against acquisition of property by foreigners in some areas.
 Although large numbers of foreign workers, many of whom had
 spent years in Switzerland, were obliged to leave the country
 when their jobs were lost during the recession of the late
 1970's, Swiss policy now aims at gradually integrating the
 resident foreign worker into Swiss social services programs.
 Parliament has before it a draft law which would liberalize
 the conditions for attaining permanent residence in Switzerland.
 Cantonal laws are being revised generally to improve protection
 of individual rights and to harmonize local laws among the
 26 cantonal jurisdictions. A revision to the law on asylum
 has been proposed to improve the standing of refugees and
 integrate them more fully into Swiss society by providing
 eligibility for social services programs.
 Women, granted the federal franchise in 1971, have made
 -great progress over the past eight years in achieving equal
 status with men in public life. A recent report by the
 Federal Commission on Women's Affairs concluded, however, that
 women are still under-represented in business and public
 occupations.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 Switzerland has no restrictions on political expression or
 association except those placed on groups considered a potential
 threat to the Confederation. No such groups are currently
 designated. The constitution guarantees freedom of the press.
 Rights of linguistic minorities are respected.
 Switzerland is a country of absolute religious tolerance. Free-
 doms of creed and conscience are guaranteed by the constitution,
 and there are constitutional guarantees to prevent domination
 of people by religious groups. The constitutional requirement
 for universal military service by Swiss men provides no exemption
 for reason of conscience. Concern is expressed by some Swiss,
 as well as by Amnesty International, at the number of convictions
 for refusal to accept induction (391 in 1979), and the European
 
 
 886
 Human Rights Commission recently heard a case on this subject. It
 found that due process is observed in such cases and did not
 criticize Swiss practice.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Constitutional guarantees assure freedom of movement within
 Switzerland, foreign travel, and emigration and repatriation.
 About 30,000 refugees currently are settled in Switzerland.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Switzerland has a highly developed constitutional democracy.
 Federal legislative power is vested in a bicameral legislature
 elected by universal suffrage. Although Swiss women have
 the federal franchise, women in three small cantons have not
 yet been granted full voting rights for local issues. Labor
 has full freedom to organize.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 There have been no requests during the postwar period for
 outside investigations of the human rights situation in
 Switzerland.
