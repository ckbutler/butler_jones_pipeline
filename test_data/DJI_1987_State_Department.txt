 DJIBOUTI
 Djibouti is a constitutional republic with a one-party
 political system. Occupying a small, arid land at the
 southern tip of the Red Sea, Djib6uti's 330,000-400,000 people
 have been ruled sincd independence from France in 1977 by
 President Hassan-Gouled Aptidon, who was reelected in April
 1987. President Hassan Gouled's Rassemblement Populaire Pour
 le Progress (RPP) has been Djibouti's only legal political
 party since the 1981 election year when the Government
 outlawed the Mouvement Populaire Djiboutien (MPD). An
 overseas opposition party, the Mouvement National Djiboutien
 Pour 1' Instauration de la Democratie (MNDID), led by a former
 government official, has minimal influence in Djibouti.
 Political life in Djibouti is a subtle and unequal contest
 between two major ethnic groups, the predominant Issa and the
 sizable minority Afar. An Arab minority, mostly Yemeni, are
 prominent in commerce but not in politics. Although Djibouti
 has had only one president since independence, it is accepted
 that the presidency is and will be reserved for an Issa and
 the prime minister for an Afar. The president, who wields the
 significant executive power, appoints the prime minister.
 Cabinet positions are divided among Issas and Afars. In
 practice, real authority in the civil service and the armed
 forces is in Issa hands.
 Djibouti's armed forces have a total strength of about 3,500,
 primarily ground forces, but with a small naval force and a
 one-plane (transport) air force. France guarantees Djibouti's
 external security under a 1977 agreement. France also
 maintains a garrison of about 3,800 military and naval
 personnel in Djibouti.
 Djibouti's narrowly based formal economy is centered on
 services for an expatriate community of about 10,000 and
 operation of the seaport, the airport, and the Djibouti-Addis
 Ababa railroad. While some large enterprises are state owned,
 free enterprise is encouraged, and there is private ownership
 of both property and capital. Lack of economic growth has
 been aggravated since independence by the recurrence of
 drought and the influx of tens of thousands of immigrants
 (legal and illegal) fleeing war, drought, famine, and
 repressive political and economic conditions in Ethiopia and
 Somalia. Even with international assistance led by the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Djibouti has
 been hard pressed to absorb refugees into an economy also
 coping with illegal economic migrants.
 There was little change in the human rights situation in
 Djibouti in 1987 in terms of government policy. A Djiboutian
 who does not oppose the Government or the party is generally
 free to-pursue his life and livelihood without government
 interference. However, a number of abuses occurred in
 connection with Djibouti's continuing efforts to return
 illegal aliens to their own countries.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of government-inspired political
 killings during 1987.

 DJIBOUTI
 The March 18, 1987, terrorist bombing at the outdoor Cafe
 L'Historil killed 12 persons (5 French citizens, 4 Germans,
 and 3 Djiboutians) and maimed or wounded some 40 others. The
 Tunisian national charged with the crime is being held while
 legal investigation of the incident moves toward trial. All
 seven lawyers of Djibouti's bar have been appointed defense
 counsel.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no allegations of disappearance of persons for
 political reasons.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There are occasional allegations of cruel, inhuman, or
 degrading treatment or punishment, such as the beating of
 prisoners. There were no substantiated cases of such
 practices in 1987.
 While prison conditions are barely adequate, prisoners may be
 visited by their families and lawyers. Medical care is also
 available to prisoners. Public health personnel oversee
 prison conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Still in an early stage of development, Djibouti's legal
 system is a hybrid of Djiboutian legislation and executive
 decree, French Napoleonic codified law, Koranic (Islamic)
 religious law, and the traditional law of the indigenous
 nomadic peoples. Crimes committed in urban areas are dealt
 with according to French criminal law and judicial practice.
 Other questions coming before the law, and offenses in
 Djibouti's sparsely populated hinterland, may be disposed of
 according to Islamic law or ethnic traditions.
 Suspected wrongdoers can be arrested after a warrant is issued
 by a judge. By government decree, a person may be held no
 more than 48 hours without being charged formally by an
 examining magistrate. A judge may release the accused on bail
 or personal recognizance, or order the accused jailed pending
 the court's verdict. A detainee must be told of his right to
 legal counsel.
 There is no forced labor in Djibouti.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Proceedings in civil court, criminal court, and the special
 state security court are open to family members and lawyers of
 those involved but are not open to the general public. The
 judiciary remains generally independent of influence, from the
 Government or the party in criminal matters but susceptible to
 influence in political cases.
 A historic Afar leader in Djibouti's independence movement now
 living overseas, Aden Robleh Awaleh, faces life imprisonment
 in Djibouti after trial and conviction in absentia on charges
 related to a politically motivated bombing and other criminal
 charges. Aden Robleh Awaleh now heads an overseas opposition
 party, the DNDID. Party followers were arrested in Djibouti
 shortly before the April 1987 presidential election for
 
 
 DJIBOUTI
 was established in 1987. A number of Christian missionaries
 proselytize freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Withili the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Djiboutians travel freely both inside and outside Djibouti.
 Passports are generally available to all Djiboutians. There
 are no currency controls.
 Djibouti's borders are porous. Pastoralists who eke out a
 living from this dry and arid terrain pass freely back and
 forth across the borders in pursuit of pasture and water for
 their herds.
 Over the last decade, tens of thousands of persons have
 entered Djibouti in flight from war, famine, political
 oppression, and deteriorating economies in neighboring
 Ethiopia and Somalia. There are approximately 13,000 refugees
 registered with the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR) in Djibouti. By government decree (although
 difficult to enforce), all refugees are required to live in a
 refugee camp at Dikhil, in Djibouti's harsh interior.
 However, many registered refugees continue to live in and near
 Djibouti city. During the 8 years of its existence at Dikhil,
 the refugee center has developed into an economically
 functioning village in some respects more active than the old
 town itself. Both the international community under UNHCR
 coordination and the Government provide services to the
 refugees at Dikhil.
 Refugees who want to return to Ethiopia voluntarily may
 register to do so with the UNHCR. After a long hiatus due to
 drought in Ethiopia, actual voluntary repatriations resumed on
 December 8, 1986. As of September 1987, 3,397 Ethiopians had
 been repatriated voluntarily under UNHCR auspices.
 In addition to UNHCR-registered refugees, there are thousands
 of persons in Djibouti whom the Government considers illegal
 aliens. Responsible estimates of their number range as high
 as 20,000. The Government charges that these illegal aliens
 take jobs away from Djiboutians and are an unreasonable burden
 on an economy with an unemployment rate estimated at 50-70
 percent. During the Government's program to control illegal
 aliens who do not qualify as refugees, abuses have occurred.
 On December 20, 1986, five undocumented aliens (all
 Ethiopians), living in Djibouti illegally, died of suffocation
 while being returned against their wishes to Ethiopia in a
 railroad boxcar. The Government quickly expressed public
 regret ovev the deaths and promised an investigation and
 appropriate measures to prevent similar accidents. At the
 same time, the Government reaffirmed that deportation of
 illegal aliens was legal and in order.
 Late in May 1987, eight Somali students, who had applied to
 the UNHCR for protection as refugees, were returned to Somalia
 by Djiboutian security personnel before the UNHCR could
 determine whether they qualified for refugee status.
 Also in late May 1987, about 70 persons at the Dikhil refugee
 camp who had been refused refugee status threatened a hunger
 strike and reportedly burned a refugee camp tent and a
 Djiboutian flag. The Djiboutian gendarmerie responded to the
 violence by rounding up and immediately deporting 103 persons.
 It was later ascertained that among the 103 persons were
 
 
 86
 DJIBOUTI
 distributing leaflets supporting Robleh for president. Those
 arrested were quickly released without charge.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In the past, there have been occasional reports of violation
 of a government decree that bars police entry into private
 homes without the resident's consent or without a legal order
 except in such extraordinary circumstances as preservation of
 public order. However, there were no reports of violations of
 rights of privacy, family, home, or correspondence during 1987.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Outside the one-party structure, Djiboutians generally do not
 enjoy the freedom of political public speech. However, there
 is little if any official interference in private speech,
 including political speech.
 Djibouti's radio and television stations and one newspaper
 (French-language weekly) are all government owned and
 operated. Government policy is to coordinate all official
 dissemination of information, ostensibly in the interest of
 national development. The news media occasionally look at
 shortcomings, inefficiencies, and even corruption within the
 government bureaucracy, but the Government itself is free from
 criticism. The media usually shy away from coverage of
 violence, crime, and ethnic strife. There have been
 occasional confiscations of foreign publications which contain
 commentary critical of the Government, though none occurred in
 1987.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public meetings require government-issued permits, which may
 be refused for security reasons. No political meetings are
 permitted outside the framework of the one legal political
 party. With that important exception, Djiboutians are allowed
 to associate freely. Social, religious, cultural, and
 commercial associations are free from government interference.
 Labor's right to organize and to strike is legally recognized
 but severely restricted in practice. Workers are free either
 to join or not to join a union as they choose, and only a
 small fraction of Djiboutian workers are union members.
 Djibouti's sole national labor federation, the Union Generale
 de Travailleurs Djiboutiens (UGTD), is government organized
 and controlled. The Government exerts some control over
 labor, especially through UGTD-affiliated unions which
 represent workers at most large enterprises. Labor action is
 generally restricted to temporary work stoppages as ad hoc
 protests against dismissals or working conditions. Individual
 unions are free to maintain relations internationally with
 other labor organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is enjoyed by members of all faiths.
 Although more than 95 percent of the population is Muslim,
 Djibouti is officially a secular republic. There are several
 Christian churches in Djibouti, and-a Coptic Christian church
 
 
 87
 DJIBOUTI
 was established in 1987. A number of Christian missionaries
 proselytize freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Djiboutians travel freely both inside and outside Djibouti.
 Passports are generally available to all Djiboutians. There
 are no currency controls.
 Djibouti's borders are porous. Pastoralists who eke out a
 living from this dry and arid terrain pass freely back and
 forth across the borders in pursuit of pasture and water for
 their herds.
 Over the last decade tens of thousands of persons have entered
 Djibouti in flight from war, famine, political oppression, and
 deteriorating economies in neighboring Ethiopia and Somalia.
 There are approximately 13,000 refugees registered with the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in
 Djibouti. By government decree (although difficult to
 enforce), all refugees are required to live in a refugee camp
 at Dikhil, in Djibouti's harsh interior. However, many
 registered refugees continue to live in and near Djibouti
 city. During the 8 years of its existence at Dikhil, the
 refugee center has developed into an economically functioning
 village in some respects more active than the old town
 itself. Both the international community under UNHCR
 coordination and the Government provide services to the
 refugees at Dikhil.
 Refugees who want to return to Ethiopia voluntarily may
 register to do so with the UNHCR. After a long hiatus due to
 drought in Ethiopia, actual voluntary repatriations resumed on
 December 8, i986. As of September 1987, 3,397 Ethiopians had
 been repatriated voluntarily under UNHCR auspices.
 In addition to UNHCR-registered refugees, there are thousands
 of persons in Djibouti whom the Government considers illegal
 aliens. Responsible estimates of their number range as high
 as 20,000. The Government charges that these illegal aliens
 take jobs away from Djiboutians and are an unreasonable burden
 on an economy with an unemployment rate estimated at 50-70
 percent. During the Government's program to control illegal
 aliens who do not qualify as refugees, abuses have occurred.

 camp who had been refused refugee status threatened a hunger
 strike and reportedly burned a refugee camp tent and a
 Djiboutian flag. The Djiboutian gendarmerie responded to the
 violence by rounding up and immediately deporting 103 persons.
 It was later ascertained that among the 103 persons were
 
 
 DJIBOUTI
 8 persons to whom the UNHCR had granted refugee status. The
 UNHCR later reported that the registered refugees who had been
 improperly deported had subsequently returned to Djibouti
 safely.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Djibouti is a one-party state. The Issa-dominated RPP has
 been the only lawful political party since the 1981 outlawing
 of the Afar-dominated MPD following election-year violence.
 The party chooses all candidates for election to the presidency
 and the 65-member National Assembly, as it did most recently
 before the national elections held in April 1987. Although
 citizens are encouraged to vote, party control of the political
 process is such that Djiboutians have no democratic, nonviolent
 way to change their government.
 All of Djibouti's ethnic groups have generally been
 represented in the ruling cabinet, but a disproportionate
 share of the real power is held by the Issas in the civil
 service, the armed forces, and the RPP. Ethnic and
 extended-family relationships are said to be more important
 than individual qualifications in filling senior civilian and
 military positions.
 Within the one-party system, the April 1987 presidential and
 parliamentary elections were peaceful, with 87 percent of the
 almost 101,000 registered voters casting their ballots. As
 noted, some party followers of the overseas-based Afar leader
 Aden Robleh Awaleh were temporarily detained prior to the
 election for distributing leaflets supporting Robleh for
 president.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no private human rights organizations in Djibouti.
 The Government's relations with the UNHCR, responsible only
 for the protection of internationally recognized refugees, are
 good. There were no known instances of the Government
 ignoring queries on human rights during 1987.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The predominant status of the Issa in the civil service, the
 military, and the ruling political party probably amounts to
 de facto discrimination against the Afar based on ethnicity
 and language.
 Women in Djibouti have equal status with men under the
 French-inspired codified law and generally enjoy higher public
 status than do women in some Islamic countries in the region.
 Women are active in small trade, and many women are employed
 in offices and retail stores. However, no women hold senior
 positions in either the Government or the sole political
 party. Nomadic traditions of genital mutilation of young
 girls (particularly excision and infibulation) are practiced
 widely without government interference.

 DJIBOUTI
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Djibouti has long suffered high.unemployment. Although
 government policy strongly favors'the employment of
 Djiboutians, expatriates hold about 20 percent of the
 positions in the formal sector and an even more
 disproportionate share of the higher-paying positions.
 Djibouti's labor laws and regulations, taken over from French
 law at independence, guarantee a worker in the formal sector
 wages and working conditions superior to those in countries
 with similar-economic bases. In addition to high wages, a
 worker enjoys employer-funded social security, medical, and
 retirement benefits. A 50-year-old worker with 15 years of
 employment may retire at 80 percent of his salary. The
 minimum working age is 18. A 40-hour work week is standard.
 Many Djiboutians, refugees, and illegal aliens work in the
 significant informal sector in which their employment is not
 reported to the'Government (in violation of Djiboutian labor
 law and regulation). This informal sector includes small
 trade; petty street vending of cigarettes, postcards, and the
 like; and domestic work.
