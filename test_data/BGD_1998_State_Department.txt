 BANGLADESH
 Bangladesh is a parliamentary democracy, with broad powers exercised by the
 Prime Minister. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed is the leader of the Awami
 League, which came to power in 1996 in national elections deemed to be free and
 fair by international observers. There is an active political opposition.- Violence is
 a pervasive feature of politics, including political campaigns and elections, and elec-
 tions frequently are marred by violence and rigging. The major opposition political
 parties frequently boycott or otherwise absent themselves from Parliament, making
 it a less effective deliberative body. The Awami League government has been ac-
 cused of abusing its majority powers. The judiciary displays a high degree of inde-
 pendence at appellate levels; however, lower judicial officers fall under the execu-
 tive, and are reluctant to challenge government decisions.
 The Home Affairs Ministry controls the police and paramilitary forces, which bear
 primary responsibility for maintaining internal security. There is widespread cor-
 ruption and lack of discipline among the police, effectively reducing control- over
 them by civilian authorities. Police officers committed a number of serious human
 rights abuses.
 Bangladesh is a very poor country. Annual per capita income is less than $300,
 and more than one-third of the country's estimated 126 million people live in pov-
 erty. Seventy percent of the work force is involved in agriculture, which accounts
 for one-third of gross domestic product (GDP). The economy is market-based, but the
 Government plays a significant role in the industrial sector. The industrial sector
 is growing, based largely on the manufacture of garments, textiles, :rerolled steel,
 cement, and jute. A small wealthy elite controls much of the private economy, but
 there is an emerging middle class. Discovery of potentially large gas reserves has
 attracted foreign investors. In recent-years, the relative importance of foreign aid
 has diminished vis-A-vis increased earnings from exports and remittances from
 workers overseas. Efforts to reform the economy have been hampered by endemic
 corruption, political turmoil, and the opposition of public sector enterprises, govern-
 ment bureaucrats, and other vested interests. Nevertheless, the economic growth
 rate during the last fiscal year was above 5 percent. The worst flooding during the
 20th century occurred in 1998. The floods lasted for 3 months, -and covered two-
 thirds of the country. Flooding affected all sectors of the economy; the agriculture,
 infrastructure, and microfinance sectors were the hardest hit.
 The Government's human rights record changed little from the previous year; the
 Government continued to restrict or deny many fundamental rights, and failed to
 prevent or punish abuses committed by others. Police committed extrajudicial
 killings, and some persons died in police custody under suspicious circumstances.
 Police routinely use- torture and other forms of abuse while interrogating suspects.
 The Government rarely convicts and punishes those responsible for torture or un-
 lawful deaths. Prison conditions are poor. The Government continued to use the
 Special Powers Act (SPA) and Section 54 of the Criminal Code, which allow for arbi-
 trary arrest and preventive detention, to harass political opponents and other citi-
 zens by detaining them without formal charges. However, government statistics in-
 dicated a sharp decrease in the number of persons detained under these provisions.

 A large case backlog slows the judicial process, and lengthy pretrial detention is a
 problem. The Government sometimes infringes on citizen's privacy rights. Journal-
 ists practice some self-censorship. The Government limits freedom of assembly. Soci-
 etal discrimination against women, the disabled, indigenous people, and religious
 minorities is a problem. Violence against women, trafficking in women and children
 for prostitution, and bonded labor remain serious problems. The Government contin-
 ues to limit some worker rights. A 1995 agreement has resulted in the elimination
 of approximately 95 percent of child labor in the garment sector, the main export
 industry. Child labor and abuse of child workers are widespread and serious prob-
 lems. Vigilante justice resulted in numerous killings.
 On October 5, the Government acceded to the International Covenant on Eco-
 nomic, Social, and Cultural Rights and the Convention Against Torture and Other
 Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.
 The 1997 Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) peace accord has been in effect for I year,
 and has ended 25 years of insurgency in the CHT. While the situation in the CHT
 was peaceful at year's end, implementation of the peace accord has been slow.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Police committed a number of
 extrajudicial killings. In some instances where there was evidence of police culpabil-
 ity for such killings, the authorities took action. For example, on July 23 the police
 arrested university student Shamim Reza Rubel on a weapons charge. He was re-
 leased 5 hours later and admitted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital, where he died
 from injuries sustained while in custody. No weapons were ever found. After public
 criticism, authorities arrested 6 policemen in connection with Rubel's death. The
 Government also appointed a judge to investigate the incident and to recommend
 measures to prevent a recurrence. Authorities eventually charged 13 persons, in-
 cluding 12 police officers, in the case (see also Section 1.c.). However, most abuses
 go unpunished, and the resulting climate of impunity remains a serious obstacle to
 ending police abuse and extrajudicial killings.
 Security forces sometimes used unwarranted lethal force in responding to dem-
 onstrations. On July 27, police fired upon demonstrators protesting efforts to evict
 squatters from government-owned land in Satkhira. Police killed one woman and
 wounded several others. The Prime Minister described the shooting as "inhuman"
 and promised that those responsible would be punished. However, no one had been
 charged in the incident by year's end.
 According to government figures, six persons died in police custody (also see Sec-
 tion 1.c.). Arun Chakroborty, who was detained for alleged robbery, died on January
 23 when he fell from the roof of a five-story building. Police claimed that he fell
 while attempting to escape. Human rights organizations that investigated the case
 noted that Chakroborty had some injuries consistent with torture, and concluded
 that police were responsible for his death. According to press reports, police in
 Khulna arrested Harun Sheikh on February 4. Police in the Rupsha police station,
 including senior officers, beat him. On February 6, a court refused to give the police
 a remand order for Harun and ordered that he be given proper medical treatment.
 Harun died that evening. Relatives filed a petition case alleging murder with the
 magistrates' court naming the Officer-in-Charge and Assistant Subinspector, but no
 investigation is known to have occurred.
 Poor prison conditions contributed to the deaths of a number of inmates (see Sec-
 tion 1.c.).
 There were no developments in ascertaining responsibility for the deaths that oc-
 curred after the police fired into the crowd at the end of an opposition rally in
 Chittagong in November 1997. The Government promised a judicial inquiry into the
 incident, but no inquiry is known to have occurred. Five persons, including one po-
 liceman, were killed in the incident.
 On November 8, 15 of the defendants on trial for the 1975 killing of then-Presi-
 dent Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (father of current Prime Minister Sheik Hasina
 Wajed) and several of his family members were convicted and sentenced to death.
 Four individuals were acquitted. Fourteen of the defendants were tried in absentia.
 At year's end, the convictions of the defendants present in Bangladesh were pending
 appeal to the High Court (see also Section i.e.).
 Violence, often resulting in killings, is a pervasive element in Bangladeshi politics
 (see Section 3). Demonstrators from major political parties, and within political par-
 ties, often clash with police during rallies and demonstrations. The Awami League
 and opposition parties used armed violence and intimidation to disrupt their oppo-
 nents gatherings and rallies, and some deaths occurred. Opposition parties also
 
 
 1862
 
 used armed violence or threats of violence to enforce general strikes (see Section
 2.b.). The violence perpetrated by both sides resulted in at least 12 deaths and hun-
 dreds of injuries: In one case, three persons were killed in violent exchanges be-
 tween opposition party activists and government supporters during a general strike
 on Aprl 15. Approximately 100 persons reportedly were injured (see Section 2.b.).
 A half-day general strike on May 6 called by the opposition to protest Chittagong
 Hill Tracts legislation resulted in armed clashes that caused 50 injuries.
 Violence is also endemic between the student political wings of the major national
 parties. On April 24, the student wing of the ruling Awami League seized control
 of all 10 campus dormitories at Dhaka University by violently taking over the 3
 buildings that had been under the control of the major opposition party's student
 wing. During gunfire .exchanges, one leader of the Awami League student wing was
 killed and 20 persons were injured. Police did not intervene during the violence, but
 later arrested 73 opposition student activists. The violence between student groups
 on university campuses spread to universities in Chittagong and Jahangirnagar
 during April, as well.
 Vigilante violence by private citizens is a common problem. On January 21, villag-
 ers near Chittagong attacked and lynched five men who allegedly were taking
 money from passing trucks. On September 17, a mob in Chittagong lynched three
 men who allegedly were engaged in robberies. On December 12, villagers near
 Jessore hacked 11 men to death; the men had allegedly be~n extorting money and
 had just killed one person. Human rights groups and press reports indicate that vig-
 ilante violence against women who are accused of having committed moral offenses
 is common, particularly in rural areas, and is sometimes led by religious leaders.
 In Noakhali village in May, local arbitrators gave a 14-year-old girl who had been
 raped 101 lashes. She died 6 days later. Some persons were arrested in the incident,
 but observers stated that the real culprits had not been charged (see Section 5).
 In 1995 the Government charged former president Hossain Mohammad Ershad
 with ordering the 1981 murder of the alleged assassin of President Ziaur Rahman.
 Ershad was granted bail in 1997 and later allowed to travel abroad. The murder
 case is not being pursued actively by the Government. Ershad was already serving
 a 20-year sentence for corruption. In 1996 Subinoy Chakma, a tribal peace activist
 in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), was killed at his home in Rangamati. His kill-
 ing remained unsolved at year's end but was believed to have been committed by
 the Shanti Bahini, a tribal insurgent group, which opposed Subinoy's efforts to pro-
 mote better relations between tribals and Bengalis in the CHT (see Section 5).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 There were no developments in the 1996 disappearance of Kalpana Chakma, cen-
 tral organizing secretary of the Hill Women's Federation, an organization of tribal
 people in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. In 1996 the Government formed an investiga-
 tive committee that has yet to issue any findings.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment;
 however, police routinely employ physical and psychological torture and other abuse
 during arrests and interrogations. Torture may consist of threats, beatings and, oc-
 casionally, the use of electric shock. The Government rarely convicts or punishes
 those responsible for torture, and a climate of impunity allows such police abuses
 to continue. After several Dhaka policemen were arrested in July for allegedly beat-
 ing a college student to death in custody (see Section L.a.), the deputy commissioner
 of the Dhaka police detective branch publicly defended the use of physical coercion
 against suspects, saying that the practice was necessary in order to obtain informa-
 tion. On April 24, a youth arrested by Dhaka police was admitted later that day
 to a-hospital intensive care unit in an unconscious state. Police claimed that he had
 been beaten by vigilantes prior to his arrest, but credible sources found the injuries
 consistent with torture and not with a mob beating. The youth later was released
 on bail, but suffered permanent physical and neurological injuries. On July 16, the
 officer in charge of a pQlice station in Sirajganj arrested a nongovernmental organi-
 zation (NGO) official without a warrant and tortured him. He was later released.
 No action was taken against the police in either incident.
 Rape of female -detainees in police custody has been a problem, although there
 were no reports of specific incidents during the year. Police also rape women who
 are not in custody. According to press reports, from January to September police of-
 ficers were implicated in 16 rape cases; however, women's rights activists estimate
 that the real number is several times higher. After a 5-year-old girl was raped in
 the Dhaka court building, police arrested a civilian and charged him with the crime.
 However, women's groups and the Dhaka Bar Association maintained that a police-
 man was responsible. The High Court later suspended proceedings against the man
 arrested while it considered a Bar Association request for a judicial inquiry into the
 
 
 1863
 
 rape. In addition, women held in police "safe custody" because they report that they
 have been raped or are involved in family disputes, usually endure poor conditions,
 and sometimes are raped or otherwise abused.
 In November police used tear gas to disrupt a peaceful opposition rally (see Sec-
 tion 2.b.).
 There was credible evidence that police permitted a cabinet minister's son and
 other family members and friends to beat three detainees on January 20 in a Dhaka
 police holding cell. Earlier that day, one of the detainees had been in a minor traffic
 accident with another of the minister's sons. The two other detainees had intervened
 when the minister's son attacked the first detainee at the scene of the accident. The
 police were holding the detainees under the Special Powers Act (see Section 1.d.)
 or alleged terrorist activities. The detainees were held until March 1. An internal
 police investigation of the incident was announced, but no results ever were re-
 ported, nor was any known action taken against those involved.
 Supporters of both the ruling party and the opposition sometimes inflict inhuman
 treatment on their opponents. For example, according to credible sources, activists
 of the ruling party's student wing chopped off the hands of at least three opposition
 student leaders. Despite witnesses to the incidents, no arrests have been made.
 On November 9, 10, and 11, the opposition called a general strike. On November
 9, three persons were killed and more than 100 were injured in clashes between
 government and opposition supporters in Dhaka (also see Section 2.b.).
 In rural areas, human rights groups and press reports indicate that vigilantism
 against women for perceived moral transgressions is common, and may include
 humiliating, painful punishments. In a village near Manikganj in October, local ar-
 bitrators gave a woman and her husband 101 lashes and had their heads shaved.
 The woman had offended some persons in the village by divorcing her first husband,
 who demanded a dowry, and then remarrying. The couple later committed suicide
 (see Section 5).
 Prison conditions are very poor. Official figures indicated that 123 persons had
 died in prison as of November. According to credible sources, poor conditions were
 at least a contributing factor to many of these deaths. Most prisons are overcrowded
 and lack adequate facilities. The current prison population of almost 50,000 is
 slightly more than twice the official prison capacity. In May a judicial report indi-
 cated that nearly 6,000 prisoners were being held in the Dhaka central jail, but that
 the intended capacity was only 2,190. The report also noted the poor physical condi-
 tion of the jail and unhygienic food preparation. The families of three persons ar-
 rested in October in connection with the killing of senior Awami League leaders in
 the Dhaka central jail in 1975 expressed concern about prison conditions and inad-
 equate medical care given to the detainees. The detainees were transferred to a pris-
 on cell in a hospital on December 15. The treatment of prisoners in the jails is not
 equal. There are three classes of cells: A, B, and C. Common criminals and low-level
 political workers generally are held in C cells, which often have dirt floors, no fur-
 nishings, and poor quality food. The use of restraining devices on prisoners in these
 cells is common. Conditions in B and A cells are markedly better; A cells are re-
 served for prominent prisoners.
 Government-appointed committees of prominent private citizens in each prison lo-
 cality monitor prisons monthly, but do not release their findings. District judges also
 visit prisons monthly, but rarely disclose their findings. However, in general the
 Government does not permit prison visits by independent human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Government continued to arrest and
 to detain persons arbitrarily, as well as to use national security legislation (the Spe-
 cial Powers Act) to detain citizens without formal charges or specific complaints
 being filed against them.
 'The Constitution states that each person arrested shall be informed of the
 grounds for detention, provided access to a lawyer of his choice, brought before a
 magistrate within 24 hours, and freed unless the magistrate authorizes continued
 detention. However, the Constitution specifically allows preventive detention, with
 specified safeguards, outside these requirements. In practice, authorities frequently
 violate these constitutional provisions even in non-preventive detention cases.
 Under Section 54 of the Criminal Code, individuals may be detained for suspicion
 of criminal activity without an order from a magistrate or a warrant. Some persons
 initially detained under Section 54 subsequently are charged with a crime, while
 others are released without any charge. According to official figures, at least 1,400
 persons were detained under Section 54 in Dhaka in the first 3 months of the year.
 The Home Minister acknowledged to journalists in July that Section 54 is abused
 by police.
 The Government sometimes uses Section 54 to harass and to intimidate the politi-
 cal opposition and their families. For example, on June 7, Jamaluddin Quader
 
 
 1864
 
 Chowdhury, a businessman who is the younger brother of two opposition Members
 of Parliament (M.P.s), was detained for subversive activities under Section 54. He
 was released without charge after 5 days. In addition, police commonly detain oppo-
 sition activists prior to general strikes without citing any legal authority, holding
 them until the event is over.
 The police on occasion detain persons for personal vengeance. For example, in
 January police detained a person -who was involved in'a minor traffic accident with
 a cabinet minister's son, along with two witnesses, and allowed another of the min-
 ister's sons and other family members and friends to beat the three detainees (see
 Section 1.c.).
 The Government continues to use the Special Powers Act (SPA) to detain citizens
 without formal charges or specific complaints being filed against them. Under the
 SPA, the Government or a district magistrate may order anyone detained for 30
 days to prevent the commission of an act likely "to prejudice the security of the
 country' Other offenses subject to the. SPA include smuggling, black market activ-
 ity, or hoarding. The Government (or magistrate) must inform the detainee of the
 grounds for detention within 15 days, and the Government must approve the
 groundszfor detention within 30 days or release the detainee. In practice, detainees
 sometimes are held for longer periods without the Government stating the grounds
 for the detention or formally approving it. Detainees may appeal their detention,
 and the Government may grant early reease.
 After 4 months, an advisory board composed of two persons who have been, or
 are qualified to be, high court judges, and one civil servant examines the cases of
 detainees. If the Government adequately defends its detention order, the detainee
 remains imprisoned; if not, the detainee is released. Appellate courts sometimes
 order authorities to release SPA detainees after finding that the Government is un-
 able to justify the detention. If the defendant in an SPA case is able to present his
 case before the High Court in Dhaka, the High Court generally rules in favor of the
 defendant. Typically, the Court finds that the Government is unable to "show
 cause". However, many defendants are either too poor or, because of strict detention,
 are unable to obtain legal counsel. Without legal counsel or funds, they are unable
 to move the case beyond the magistrate level. The magistrates, unlike the High
 Court judges, are not independent. They are subject to the administrative controls
 of the Law Ministry and are less likely to dismiss a case. As a result, defendants
 in many SPA cases languish in detention without the case moving to trial. Detain-
 ees are allowed to consult with lawyers, although usually not until a charge is fied.
 They are not entitled to be represented by a lawyer before an advisory board. De-
 tainees may receive visitors, and incommunicado detention generally is not prac-
 ticed. However, the Government has held incommunicado some prominent pris-
 oners, although there were no known cases of incommunicado detention during the
 year.
 There is a system of bail for criminal offenses. Bail is granted commonly for both
 violent and nonviolent crimes. Persons arrested under the Women and Children Re-
 pression Prevention Act, which provides special procedures for persons accused of
 olence against women and children, cannot be granted bail during an initial inves-
 tigation period of up to 90 days. If bail is not granted, the law does not specify a
 time limit on ,pretrial detention.
 A major, problem with the court system is the overwhelming backlog of cases,
 which produces long pretrial delays. According to the Government, almost 600,000
 cases were pending in criminal and civil courts in November, and approximately
 37,000 persons, or 71 percent of the country's prison population, were awaiting trial
 or under trial. Government sources report that the period between detention and
 trial averages 6 months, but press and human rights groups report some instances
 of pretrial detention lasting several years: Trials often are characterized by lengthy
 adjournmnents. In one case, Younus All from Mymensingh district was detained for
 robbery in 1988, but authorities have yet to present a case. In another case, M.
 Khairuzzaman was held for more than 2 year without formal charges. He was
 originally detained in August 1996 for alleged involvement in the 1975 murder of
 PresidentSheikh Mujibur Rahmnan. The High Court dismissed those charges in No-
 vember 1996, due to its finding that Khairuzzaman was in India at the time of the
 killings. The High Court subsequently refused twice to grant bail to Khairuzzaman
 because the Government was investigating him for his alleged involvement in the
 November 1975 murder of four senior Awami League officials in the Dhaka central
 jail. Charges against Khairuzzaman in the jail killings case were filed in October.
 The SPA is criticized routinely by opposition parties as a tool used by the Govern-
 ment against its opponents. The Government cites a significant reduction in the
 number of persons held under the SPA as evidence that it is minimizing use of the
 act. According to the Government, 885 persons were under SPA detention in July,
 
 
 1865
 
 a decrease from approximately 2,000 persons under SPA detention 1 year earlier.
 The authorities detained 2,949 persons under the SPA from the beginning of the
 year through the end of September, and released 3,151 detainees during the same
 period. There are credible reports from human rights monitors and political activists
 that the Awami League Government uses the SPA as a tool to harass and to intimi-
 date political opponents. For example, opposition politicians Anwar Zahid and
 Shaiful Alain Prodhan were under SPA detention from October 20 to December 10,
 when they were granted bail. The Government contended that the two participated
 in meetings at the official residence of the leader of the parliamentary opposition,
 during which plans to sabotage the national power grid were discussed. Most opposi-
 tion activists detained under the SPA ultimately are released without charges being
 brought against them.
 The Government sometimes uses serial detentions to prevent the release of politi-
 cal activists, a process aided by the reluctance of magistrates to grant bail in such
 cases. Opposition student leader Ahmed Pintu was arrested under Section 54 of the
 Criminal 'Procedure Code on April 15. After a magistrate refused to grant bail, the
 High Court ruled against the detention and ordered Pintu's release. Pintu then was
 arrested again on other charges, and the magistrate refused to grant bail. The High
 Court ordered bail once more. He was finally released on July 10.
 Opposition parties accuse the Government of filing thousands of false criminal
 charges against their leaders and activists. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party, the
 main opposition party, alleges that false criminal cases have been brought against
 dozens of its Members of Parliament, and against thousands of its party workers
 and supporters. However, verification of these claims was not available. It can be
 difficult to identify those cases in which charges are politically motivated; in some
 instances criminal charges may apply to the actions of activists. Therefore, it is dif-
 ficult to estimate the total number of detentions for political reasons, and even oppo-
 sition sources do not cite a specific number. Because of crowded court dockets and
 magistrates who are reluctant to challenge the Government, the judicial system
 does not deal effectively with criminal cases that may be political in origin. There
 is no independent body with the authority and ability to monitor detentions, or to
 prevent, to detect, or to publicize cases of political harassment. Most such detentions
 appear to be for short periods, such as several days or weeks. Defendants in most
 cases receive bail, but dismissal of wrongful charges or acquittal may take years.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary. However, under a longstanding "temporary' provision of the Constitution,
 some subordinate courts remain part of the executive and are subject to its influ-
 ence. The higher levels of the judiciary display a significant degree of independence
 and often rule against the Government in criminal, civil, and even politically con-
 troversial cases. However, lower level courts are more susceptible to pressure from
 the executive branch. There also is corruption within the legal process, especially
 at lower levels.
 The court system has two levels: The lower courts and the Supreme Court. Both
 hear civil and criminal cases. The lower courts consist of magistrates, who are part
 of the administrative branch of government, and session and district judges, who
 belong to the judicial branch. The Supreme Court is divided into two Sections, the
 High Court and the Appellate Court. The High Court hears original cases and re-
 views cases from the lower courts. The Appellate Court has jurisdiction to hear ap-
 peals of judgments, decrees, orders, or sentences of the High Court. Rulings of the
 Appellate Court are binding on all other courts.
 Trials are public. The law provides the accused with the right to be represented
 by counsel, to review accusatory material, to call witnesses, and to appeal verdicts.
 State-funded defense attorneys are rarely provided, and there are few legal aid pro-
 grams to offer financial assistance. In rural areas, individuals often do not receive
 legal representation. In urban areas, legal counsel is generally available if individ-
 uals can afford the expense. Trials conducted under the Special Powers Act and the
 Women and Children Repression Prevention Act are similar to normal trials, but
 are tried without the lengthy adjournments typical in other cases.
 Persons may be tried in absentia, although this is rarely done. On November 8,
 15 of the 19 defendants tried for the 1975 killing of then-President Sheikh Mujibur
 Rahman (father of current Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed) and several of his
 family members were convicted and sentenced to death, and 4 persons were acquit-
 ted (see Section L.a.). Fourteen of the defendants were tried in absentia, and 12 of
 them were convicted. At year's end, all 15 death sentences were awaiting automatic
 review by the High Court, and the 5 defendants then present in the country had
 filed appeals. There is no automatic right to a retrial if a person convicted in
 absentia later returns. Absent defendants may be represented by state-appointed
 
 
 1866
 counsel (as was done in the Sheikh Mujibur case), but may not choose their own
 attorneys, and, if convicted, may not file appeals until they return to the country.
 A major problem of the court system is the overwhelming backlog of cases. Accord-
 ing to the Government, almost 600,000 cases were pendng in criminal and civil
 courts in November, and a pproximately 37,000 persons, or 71 percent of the total
 prison population, were in detention awaiting trial or under trial (see Section 1.d.).
 These conditions, and the corruption encountered in the judicial process, effectively
 prevent many persons from obtaining a fair trial or justice.
 Citizens' ability to obtain due process is undermined by corruption in the judici-
 ary. Small sums must be paid to a number of court officials in order for a civil suit
 to be filed. While these may appear to be processing fees, they are more in the na-
 ture of bribes; they are not established by statute or regulation, are paid to officials
 personally, and there is no accountability for failure to discharge duties paid for. De-
 fendants sometimes can pay to avoid being served with a notice or suit. According
 to one inde endent sample survey conducted by Transparency International, more
 than half op persons involved in court cases paid bribes to court officials. Because
 of the difficulty accessing the courts and because litigation is time consuming, alter-
 nate dispute resolution by traditional village leaders is popular in rural commu-
 nities.
 The Government states that it holds no political prisoners, but the opposition
 Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and human rights monitors claim that many
 opposition activists have been arrested and convicted under criminal charges as a
 pretext for their political activities. It is not clear how many political prisoners actu-
 ally are being held (see Section 1.d.).
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 requires authorities to obtain a judicial warrant before entering a home. However,
 according to human rights monitors, police rarely obtain warrants, and officers vio-
 lating the procedure are not punished. In addition, the Special Powers Act (SPA)
 permits searches without a warrant.
 The police Special Branch, National Security Intelligence, and the Directorate
 General of Forces Intelligence employ informers and conduct surveillance of citizens,
 particularly those perceived to be political opponents of the Government. Human
 rights activists, foreign NGO's, and journalists report occasional harassment by
 these security organizations.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech,
 expression, and the press, subject to "reasonable restrictions" in the interest of secu-
 rity, friendly relations with foreign states, public order, decency and morality, or to
 prohibit defamation or incitement to an offense. With some exceptions, the Govern-
 ment generally respects these rights. Citizens freely express criticism of the Govern-
 ment.
 The press, numbering hundreds of daily and weekly publications, is a forum for
 a wide range of views. While most publications support the overall policies of the
 Government, many newspapers report critically on government policies and activi-
 ties, including those of the Prime Minister. In addition to an official government-
 owned wire service, there are two major privately owned wire services, both of
 which are affiliated with international wire services.
 Newspaper ownership and content are not subject to direct government restric-
 tion. However, if the Government chooses, it can influence journalists through finan-
 cial means. Government-sponsored advertising and allocations of newsprint im-
 ported at a favorable tariff rate are central to many newspapers' financial viability.
 The Government states that newsprint allocations are provided solely on the basis
 of circulation figures. HoweVer, newspapers that cannot obtain enough government
 newsprint to meet their needs must buy it on the open market at higher prices.
 Many papers do so. There were no reports of newspapers unable to publish due to
 lack of newsprint. Commercial organizations also often are reluctant to advertise in
 newspapers critical of the Government, fearing unspecified governmental or bureau-
 cratic retaliation.
 Several sources have reported that the State Minister for Information established
 an office at Bangladesh Television (BTV) to monitor or edit news items. The Govern-
 ment denies this allegation, claiming that the office at BTV was renovated to be
 used as a VIP waiting room.
 Attacks on journalists and efforts to intimidate them by government officials, po-
 litical party activists, and others, occasionally occur. Virtually all print journalists
 practice self-censorship to some degree, and are reluctant to criticize politically in-
 fluential personalities in both the Government and the opposition. Many journalists
 cite fear of possible harassment, retaliation, or physical harm as a reason to avoid
 
 
 1867
 
 sensitive stories. Only one newspaper, an English-language weekly, published a
 story describing an incident in January in which there was credible information that
 a cabinet minister's son beat three youths (see Section 1.c.). In February the Gov-
 ernment filed sedition charges against the editors and publisher of a newspaper,
 which published a story alleging that the Government was attempting to make the
 country's defense system complementary to India's system. The High Court granted
 the accused bail, and the case remains pending. On A pril 20, three journalists were
 arrested for allegedly leaking questions from school exams. They were charged
 under the Official Secrecy Act of 1980, which usually is used to arrest spies, trai-
 tors, and similar criminals. The journalists maintained that they published the
 questions, but did so to expose the corruption of officials who sold the questions
 prior to the exams. On May 26, the office of Dainik Manab Zamin, a newspaper pub-
 lished in Dhaka, was ransacked by a group allegedly belonging to the youth wing
 of the Jatiya Party. The newspaper had published a story that the attackers felt
 contained derogatory personal allegations against General Hossain Ershad, the
 leader of the Jatiya Party. In August the editor of a newspaper was shot to death
 in Jessore; authorities blamed a banned extremist party that objected to critical sto-
 ries published about the group. The Committee to Protect Journalism suspects that
 the editor, Saifl Alam MakIl, may have been killed to prevent the resumption of
 reporting on political corruption, gang activity, and human rights abuses. On Au-
 gust 10, two journalists in Dhaka received death threats from a high-ranking leader
 of the Chattra League, the student wing of ruling party, after they published stories
 about the terrorist activities of the Chattra League at Dhaka University. They later
 received apologies from the Chattra League and assurances of protection from the
 University.
 Feminist author Taslina Nasreen, whose writings and statements provoked death
 threats from some Islamic groups in 1993 and 1994, left the country for Europe in
 1994. The Government has taken no action against those who issued death threats
 against her, even though such threats violate the law. On September 15, Nasreen
 returned to the country and immediately went into hiding. Following her return,
 there were a number of small demonstrations by Islamic groups calling for her ar-
 rest and punishment by death. The Government provided protection for Nasreen
 from possible threats. Despite this, in early November, the leader of the Chittagong
 branch of the Jamaat-i-Islami, the largest Islamic party, personally offered a reward
 for information as to her whereabouts. The central Jamaat office in Dhaka stated
 that the Jamaat did not approve of the reward offer. Following Nasreen's return,
 a judge issued a warrant for her arrest pursuant to a case filed by a private citizen
 in 1994. The warrant was never executed, and on November 22 Nasreen requested
 and received anticipatory bail from the High Court.
 The Government owns and controls radio and television, which do not provide bal-
 anced coverage of the news. The activities of the Prime Minister occupy the bulk
 of primetime news bulletins on both television and radio, followed by the activities
 of members of the Cabinet. Opposition party news gets little coverage. In its 1996
 election manifesto, the Awami League called for the privatization of the state-con-
 trolled media. Upon taking power, the Government set up a committee to rec-
 ommend measures for authorizing private radio and television broadcasts. The com-
 mittee submitted a report to the Government in 1997, but the report has not been
 released to the public, and no changes in the existing framework have been an-
 nounced. The Minister of Information termed some of the committee's recommenda-
 tions "unrealistic." The Ministry of Information has solicited and received bids from
 parties interested in establishing private television and radio stations. While the
 tender terms have not been disclosed publicly, news reports state that private sta-
 tions would be required to carry in full current government electronic news bul-
 letins. The Government granted a license in principle to a proposed private tele-
 vision station, but a contract and conditions were not finalized. The Government
 does not restrict access to foreign radio or satellite television news. There are no
 restrictions on the installation of satellite dishes.
 Foreign publications are subject to review and censorship. When enforced, censor-
 ship most often is used in cases of immodest or obscene photographs, perceived mis-
 representation or defamation of Islam, and objectionable comments about national
 leaders. The Government blocked distribution of the late February issue of an In-
 dian fortnightly on the grounds that it contained "objectionable" comments about
 late President Sheikh Mujibur Rabman's role in Bangladesh's 1952 language move-
 ment. Distribution of the periodical was allowed after a more favorable article was
 substituted and the magazine issued a disclaimer that stated that the article in
 question was published in the absence of its editor.
 A government Film Censor Board reviews local and foreign films, and may censor
 or ban them on the grounds of state security, law and order, religious sentiment,
 
 
 1868
 
 obscenity, foreign relations, defamation, or plagiarism. The Film Censor Board
 banned the release and showing of "Ammajan', a film made in Bangladesh, despite
 adjustments made according to suggestions from censors. The film depicts the ac-
 tions taken by the son of a raped woman against her attackers, who had escaped
 trial for the crime.
 Academic freedom generally is respected by the Government. Teachers and stu-
 dents at all levels are free to pursue academic assignments except on extremely sen-
 sitive religious and political topics.
 The situation on public university campuses remains volatile, seriously inhibiting
 the ability of students to receive university educations and of teachers to teach.
 Armed clashes between rival student groups resulted in closures of universities or
 colleges in Rangpur, Rangamati, and Patuakhali, and of the Islamic University, on
 several occasions in 1998. In 1997 the vice-chancellors of Rajshahi and Islamic Uni-
 versities appointed by the- previous BNP government were forced by the student
 fronts of the ruling Awami League and the Jamaat-i-Islami to resign. In April the
 Awami League student wing violently took over 3 dormitories from the BNP student
 wing at Dhaka University, giving it control of all 10 campus dorms. The violence
 resulted in the death of 1 person and the injury of 20 others (see Section L.a.). Vio-
 lence between student political factions has little to do with ideological differences,
 and more to do with extortion rackets based on physical control of dormitories and
 student concessions by nonstudent party activists. Physical control over the dor-
 mitories results in access to funds from the universities and from students through
 "protection rings". The result of widespread campus violence is that, on average, it
 takes 6 years or more to earn a 4-year degree.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly, subject to restrictions in the interest of public order and public
 health; however, the Government limits this right on occasion. The Government
 sometimes prohibits rallies for security reasons, but many independent observers
 believe that such explanations are usually a pretext.
 The Government occasionally charges individuals who conduct unauthorized dem-
 onstrations. In June five opposition leaders, including three Members of Parliament,
 were charged with obstructing vehicular movement and chanting provocative slo-
 gans against the Government after a protest against the new national budget. The
 High Court granted the individuals anticipatory bail, and the case remains pending.
 In June the Government announced that it would not interfere with an opposition
 motorcade from Dhaka to the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) to protest the CHT
 peace accord signed in December 1997. Nevertheless, credible eyewitness reports
 stated that the police stood by as ruling party activists commandeered and disabled
 vehicles in order to barricade the highway that the motorcade was to use. Three rul-
 ing party Members of Parliament were photographed, atop the barricade. The police
 removed the obstruction 18 hours after it had been put in place, and after 9 hours
 of delay for the opposition motorcade. The Government asserted that the opposition
 was responsible for the incident. The Government began an investigation against
 several opposition party members, but never filed charges.
 Severa opposition-called general strikes took place during the year at the na-
 tional or local levels. These, strikes are enforced by party activists through threat-
 ened or actual violence toward strikebreakers. Those who are opposed or neutral to
 the strike are coerced into observing prohibitions against vehicular transport and
 normal operation of businesses. Both opposition and ruling party activists mount
 processions during general strikes. Police rarely interfere with ruling party proces-
 sions on such occasions; police and ruling party activists often work in tandem -to
 disrupt and to discourage opposition processions. On April 15, a general strike was
 called by the BNP to protest 4 bills on the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Threepersons
 were killed and 100 were injured. On May 6, the BNP called another general strike
 to protest the passage of the bills. During the strike, 50 persons were injured in
 clashes between opposing activists and police, and 133 were arrested. On November
 7, a group of ruling party activists caused disturbances at an opposition rally at a
 park in central Dhaka. Police then broke up the rally, firing a volley of tear gas
 shells that landed on the dais near the leader of the parliamentary opposition. Sub-
 sequently, a riot broke out in which one ruling party activist was killed. On Novem-
 ber 9, the opposition called a 60-hour nonstop general strike. At least 6 persons died
 and at least 350 were injured during the strike, which ended November 11. The po-
 lice detained 700 persons in connection with the strike. On December 2, opposition
 leader Begum Khaleda Zia held a peaceful 8-hour hunger strike in Dhaka.
 The Constitution provides for the right of every citizen to form associations, sub-
 ject to "reasonable restrictions" in the interest of morality or public order, and in
 general the Government respects thi  right. Individuals are free to join private
 groups, but a local magistrate must approve public meetings.
 
 
 1869
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution establishes Islam as the state religion
 but also stipulates the right to practice the religion of one's choice, and the Govern-
 ment respects this provision in practice. Approximately 87 percent of the population
 is Muslim. Some members of the Hindu, Christian, and Buddhist minorities con-
 tinue to perceive and experience discrimination toward them from the Muslim ma-
 jority (see Section 5).
 The law permits citizens to proselytize. However, strong social resistance to con-
 version from Islam means that most missionary efforts by non-Muslims are aimed
 at Hindus and tribal groups. The Government allows various religions to establish
 places of worship, to train clergy, to travel for religious purposes, and to maintain
 links with co-religionists abroad. Foreign missionaries may work in the country, but
 their right to proselytize is not protected by the Constitution. Some missionaries
 face problems in obtaining visas.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens are able to move freely within the country. Citizens are free
 to travel abroad and to emigrate. The right of repatriation generally is observed.
 In February the last group of tribal refugees returned to the Chittagong Hill
 Tracts region from camps in India. This completed a process initiated in 1997 of re-
 patriating more than 60,000 refugees who had fled the internecine violence of
 tribals and Bengali settlers in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. The repatriations were
 part of the peace agreement between the Government and tribal leaders signed in
 December 1997 (see Section 5).
 The law does not include provisions for granting refugee/asylee status in accord-
 ance with the provisions of the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Sta-
 tus of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. The Government generally coo erates with
 the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and oter humani-
 tarian organizations in assisting refugees. The law does not provide for first asylum
 or resettlement of asylum seekers. However, in practice, the Government does grant
 temporary asylum to individual asylum seekers whom the UNHCR has interviewed
 and recognized as refugees, on a case-by-case basis. At the request of the UNHCR,
 the Government has allowed about 200 asylum seekers, mostly from Somalia and
 Iran, to remain in Bangladesh for several years until they can arrange their reset-
 tlement in another country.
 Approximately 240,000 Bihari Muslims live in various camps around the country;
 they have remained in the country since 1971 awaiting settlement in Pakistan.
 Biharis are non-Bengali Muslims who emigrated to -what was formerly East Paki-
 stan during the 1947 partition of British India. Most supported Pakistan during
 Bangladesh's 1971 war of independence. They later declined to accept Bangladesh
 citizenship and asked to be repatriated to Pakistan. The Government of Pakistan
 historically has been reluctant to accept the Biharis. During a visit to Dhaka in Jan-
 uary, the Pakistani Prime Minister announced that Pakistan would be willing to as-
 sist in their repatriation, but no repatriation occurred during the year.
 Approximately 250,000 Rohingya refugees (Muslims from the northern Burmese
 state of Arakan) crossed into southeastern Bangladesh in late 1991 and 1992 fleeing
 repression. Since 1992, approximately- 238,000 Rohingyas have repatriated volun-
 tarily to Burma, leaving 22,000 in two camps administered by the Government in
 cooperation with the UNHCR. After blocking further repatriation since August
 1997, Burma allowed repatriation to resume in November, albeit at a very slow rate.
 The UNHCR hoped to accelerate the repatriation, and urged the Government to
 allow any refugees who cannot return to Burma to be granted resettlement in Ban-
 gladesh, at least until conditions in Burma improved. The Government has insisted
 that all Rohingya refugees eventually must return to Burma. From July 1997 to Oc-
 tober, persistent law and order problems plagued the camps, with one camp effec-
 tively under the control of militant refugees opposed to any repatriation efforts, even
 on a voluntary basis. On February 28, a hunger strike was started in Kutupalang
 camp. Organizers claimed that the strike was to protest the death of a refugee in
 the camp due to torture, but neutral observers said that the man died of a heart
 attack and that the strike was an attempt to obstruct repatriation. As in previous
 hunger strikes, protest organizers did not allow even pregnant and nursing women
 and malnourished children to receive supplemental food. In March camp authorities
 responded to the growing law and order problems and-the food boycott by arresting
 some refugees alleged to be involved in criminal activities. The police action resulted
 in the injury of some refugee bystanders and damage to shelters, but the food boy-
 cott was ended. On October 21, authorities retook full control of the camp. Press
 reports indicated that the police entered the Nayapara camp to quell clashes be-
 tween refugee groups in the camp. There were conflicting reports of how many per-
 sons were injured in the incident, with estimates ranging from 30 to 100 injuries.
 Some reports indicated that refugees had been pressured to volunteer for repatri-
 
 
 1870
 ation, but UNHCR officials worked with the Government to ensure that procedures
 for verifying the voluntariness of repatriation applications were followed.
 Several thousand more Rohingyas arrived during the year, but recent arrivals
 avoided the camps and attempted to settle in. the southeastern areas of the country.
 The Government effectively denied first asylum to new arrivals it encountered by
 categorizing them as illegal economic migrants, turning back as many as possible
 at the border, and denying the UNHCR official access to those who did enter the
 country successfully.
 In July 1997, -the Government forcibly repatriated approximately 400 Rohingya
 refugees to Burma, including 67 children sent back without their parents. This vio-
 lated its agreement with the UNHCR and Burma to adhere to strict voluntariness
 in the repatriation program. These refugees had been cleared by the Burmese Gov-
 ernment as Burmese nationals. However, the individuals were not willing at that
 time to return to Burma. Some of the refugees indicated that they feared persecu-
 tion in Burma. The Government apparently was anxious to meet the August 1997
 deadline that the Burmese Government had set for repatriations.
 Section 3. Respect'for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Bangladesh is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy in which elections by secret
 ballot are held on the basis of universal suffrage. Members of Parliament are elected
 at least every 5 years. The Parliament has 300 elected members, with 30 additional
 seats for women, who are chosen by Parliament. Under a 1996 constitutional
 amendment, general parliamentary elections are presided over by a caretaker gov-
 einment, led by the most recently retired Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Do-
 mestic and international observers deemed the last general election, held in June
 1996, to be generally free and fair. The high voter turnout of 75 percent set a new
 record for the country.
 Nevertheless, elections in Bangladesh often are marred by violence, intimidation
 of voters, and vote rigging. The Government and activists of major political parties
 frequently use violence and harassment against political opponents, practices that
 intensify in the period prior to elections. Two Parliamentary by-elections during the
 year fit this pattern. Independent observers witnessed voter intimidation and other
 irregularities, particularly by rulingparty activists. However, observers concluded
 that these excesses probably did not alter the outcome in either election. During the
 year, the Government briefly erected barbed-wire barricades around the area of the
 home  of opposition leader Khaleda Zia, allegedly for reasons of traffic maintenance.
 The idea of evicting Zia from her home also was raised in Parliament after the gen-
 eral strike of November 9 to November 11 -(see Section 2.b.). Political activists, at
 the local and national levels, also reportedly engage in extortion from businesses
 and individuals.
 Under constitutional amendments enacted in 1991, Bangladesh changed from a
 presidential system to a parliament-led system. The changes stipulated that a Mem-
 ber of Parliament who resigns from his party or votes against it in Parliament auto-
 matically loses his seat. In practice, this provision solidifies the control of Par-
 liament by the Government and the Prime Minister. The lack of democracy within
 the political parties that have formed governments since 1991 has resulted in a con-
 centration of political power in the office of the Prime Minister. In practice, the
 Prime Minister usually decides on major governmental policies with little or no in-
 volvement by Parliament. Parliamenfs effectiveness as a deliberative body is fur-
 ther undermined by the country's narrow, partisan politics. However, parliamentary
 standing committees on government ministries, which were formed in 1998, are
 headed by Members of Parliament rather than the ministers concerned, increasing
 the committees' effectiveness in overseeing government -work.
 In addition to the 30 parliamentary seats reserved for women (whose occupants
 are chosen by Parliament), women are free to contest any seat in Parliament. Seven
 women were elected in their own right in the 1996 national elections. Seats are not
 specifically reserved for other minority groups, such as tribal people. However, tribal
 people have some parliamentary representation; eight members from minority
 groups won seats in the last elections.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government generally permits human rights groups to conduct their activi-
 ties. A wide variety of groups publish reports, hold press conferences, and issue ap-
 peals to the Government with regard to specific cases. While human rights groups
 often are sharply critical of the Government, irrespective of the ruling, party, they
 frequently practice self-censorship. During-the year, the Government shared some
 
 
 1871
 drafts of human rights related legislation with nongovernmental organizations
 (NGO's), and took their views into account. However, the Government continues to
 refuse to register the Bangladesh Section of Amnesty International, which since
 1990 has applied several times for registration under the Societies Registration Act.
 Without this registration, a voluntary organization cannot receive funding from
 abroad. Observers attribute the situation to resentment of criticism of the Govern-
 ment's human rights record by Amnesty International.
 The Government is sensitive to international opinion regarding human rights
 issues. However, the Government has been open to dialog with international organi-
 zations and foreign diplomatic missions regarding issues such as the detention of
 opposition leaders, the proposed National Human Rights Commission, and traffick-
 ing in women and children.
 The Government has put pressure on individual human rights advocates in the
 past. Such pressure has included long delays in issuing re-entry visas. Missionaries
 who advocate human rights have faced similar problems.
 Human rights organizations also report that the Government sometimes puts
 pressure on them, usually in the form of harassment by government intelligence
 agencies, and threats from activists of the ruling party (see Section 1.f1). One major
 attack on human rights activists was reported during the year. On December 7, a
 rally organized by a local umbrella NGO activist group in Brahmanbaria was bro-
 ken up violently. Local religious leaders had denounced the rally as un-Islamic, and
 mobs attacked government and NGO offices, injuring more than 100 persons. Credi-
 ble reports indicate that police did little to prevent the attacks.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that "all citizens are equal before the law and are entitled
 to equal protection by the law." In practice, the Government does not enforce strong-
 ly laws aimed at eliminating discrimination. In this context, women, children, mi-
 nority groups, and the disabled often confront social and economic disadvantages.
 Women.-Violence against women is difficult to quantify because of unreliable sta-
 tistics, but wife beating appears to be widespread. A growing awareness of the prob-
 lem is fostered by the Government, the media, and women's rights organizations.
 Much of the violence against women is related to disputes over dowries. According
 to one human rights group, there were 80 dowry-related killings in 1998. Human
 rights groups and press reports indicate that incidents of vigilantism against
 women-sometimes led by religious leaders-are common occurrences, particularly
 in rural areas. These include humiliating, painful punishments, such as the whip-
 ping of women accused of moral offenses. Few perpetrators of such extrajudicial
 punishments are prosecuted. In Noakhali village in May, local arbitrators gave a 14-
 year-old girl who had been raped 101 lashes. She died 6 days later. Some persons
 were arrested in the incident, but observers stated that the real culprits had not
 been charged. In a village near Manikganj in October, local arbitrators gave a
 woman and her husband 101 lashes, and had their heads shaved. The woman had
 offended some persons in the village by divorcing her first husband, who demanded
 a dowry, and then remarrying. The couple later committed suicide.
 The law prohibits rape and physical spousal abuse, but it makes no specific provi-
 sion for spousal rape as a crime. The Government sometimes holds women who file
 rape complaints in "safe custody," usually in prison. "Safe custody" frequently re-
 sults in further abuses against victims, discouraging the filing of complaints by
 other women. In May there was a public outcry after a newspaper published a pho-
 tograph of a woman in safe custody who had been shackled to her hospital bed. The
 Government has enacted laws specifically prohibiting certain forms of discrimina-
 tion against women, including the Anti-Dowry Prohibition Act of 1980, the Cruelty
 to Women Law of 1983, and the Women and Children Repression Prevention Act
 of 1995. However, enforcement of these laws is weak, especially in rural areas, and
 the Government seldom prosecutes those cases that are filed.
 There is extensive trafficking in women and children for prostitution within Ban-
 ladesh and to other countries in Asia. The number of women and children traf-
 cked is unknown; human rights monitors estimate that several thousand women
 and children are victims of trafficking each year. Most trafficked persons are lured
 by promises of good jobs or marriage, and some are forced into involuntary servitude
 outside of the country. The law provides severe penalties for trafficking, but few per-
 petrators ever are punished. Human rights monitors also credibly report that police
 and local government officials often either ignore trafficking in women and children
 for prostitution or actually profit from it (see Section 6.c.). The Government reported
 that 408 persons had been prosecuted for trafficking as of November. Exact num-
 bers are difficult to obtain as charges against traffickers are usually for lesser
 
 
 1872
 
 crimes, such as crossing borders without proper documents. The Government has
 expressed concern about the problem and has worked with U.N. agencies and NGO's
 to seek ways to combat it. Trafficking and awareness of trafficking are increasing,
 and it receives frequent press coverage. The Coalition Against Trafficking in Women
 in Bangladesh sponsored a regional conference on trafficking in women, which was
 held in Dhaka from June 26 to June 29.
 Women remain in a subordinate position in society. The Government has not
 acted effectively to protect their basic freedoms. Literacy rates are approximately 26
 percent for women, compared to 49 percent for men. In recent years female school
 enrollment has improved. Approximately 50 percent of primary and secondary
 school students-are, female. Women are often unaware of their rights because of con-
 tinued high illiteracy rates and unequal educational opportunities, and strong social
 stigmas and lack of economic means to obtain legal assistance frequently keep
 women from seeking redress in the courts. Many NGO's operate programs to raise
 women's awareness of their rights and to encourage and assist them in exercising
 those rights.
 Under the 1961 Muslim Family Ordinance, female heirs receive less inheritance
 than male heirs do, and wives are more restricted in divorce rights. Men are per-
 mitted to :have up to four wives, although this right rarely is exercised. Laws pro-
 vide some protection for women against arbitrary divorce and the taking of addi-
 tional wives by husbands without the first wife's consent, but the protections gen-
 erally a pply only to registered marriages. Marriages in rural areas often are not reg-
 istered because of ignorance of the law.
 In a setback for divorced women, in December the Supreme Court overturned a
 verdict entitling a divorced wife to alimony from her former husband until her re-
 marriage or death. The ruling restored a law requiring a Muslim husband to pay
 his ex-wife alimony for only 3-months.
 Employment opportunities have been stronger for women than for men in the last
 decade, which is to a large extent due to the growth of the export garment industry
 in Dhaka and Chittagong. Eighty percent of the 1.4 million garment sector workers
 are women. Programs extending -credit to large numbers of rural women also have
 contributed to greater economic power for them. However, women still occupy only
 a small fraction of other wage-earning jobs, and hold fewer than 5 percent of govern-
 ment jobs. The Governments policy to include more women in government jobs has
 had limited effect.
 Children.-The Government, undertakes programs in the areas of primary edu-
 cation, health, and nutrition. Many of these efforts are supplemented by local and
 foreign NGO's. While much remains to be done, these joint efforts have allowed
 Bangladesh to make significant progress in improving health, nutrition, and edu-
 cation. One local NGO, for exam le, provides primary education to more than I mil-
 lion children. The Government made universal primary education between the ages
 of 6 and 10 years mandatory in 1991, but statedthat it lacked the resources to fully
 implement the law. According to Education Ministry figures, approximately 86 per-
 cent of the children between the ages of 5 and 10 years are enrolled in school, in-
 cluding 84 percent of girls. Attendance rates drop steadily with age, and only about
 half of all children complete grade 5. To reach the maximum number -of children
 with limited facilities, most schools have two shifts. As a result, most children spend
 a scant 3 hours per day in the classroom.- The Government provides incentives for
 rural female children between the ages of 12 and 16 to remain in school. These in-
 centives have ben effective in increasing the number of girls in school.
 Because of widespread poverty, many children are compelled to work at a very
 young age. This frequently results in abuse of children, mainly through mistreat-
 ment by employers during domestic service (children who work in domestic service
 may work in conditions that resemble servitude; see Section 6.c.) and prostitution;
 this labor-related child abuse occurs commonly at all levels of society and through-
 out the country (see Section 6.d.).
 Reports from human rights monitors indicate that child abandonment, kidnaping,
 and trafficking for labor bondage. and prostitution continue to be serious and wide-
 spread problems. There is extensive trafficking of both women and children, pri-
 marily to the Middle East, India, Pakistan, and Southeast Asia, and also within the
 country. Much of this trafficking is for prostitution. The United Nations Children's
 Fund (UNICEF) has estimated that there are about 10,000 child prostitutes in Ban-
 gladesh. Other estimates have been as high as 29,000. Prostitution is legal, but only
 for those over 18 years of age with government certification. However, this mini-
 mum   age requirement commonly is ignored by authorities,-A and is easily cir-
 cumvented by false statements of age.- Procurers of minors rarely are prosecuted,
 and large numbers of-child prostitutes work in government-sanctioned brothels. The
 law stipulates a maximum sentence, of life imprisonment for persons found guilty
 
 
 1873
 of forcing a child into prostitution. However, human rights monitors report that po-
 lice and local government officials often either ignore trafficking- of children and
 women for prostitution, or actually profit from it.
 People With Disabilities.-The law provides for equal treatment and freedom from
 discrimination for the disabled, however, in practice, the disabled face social and
 economic discrimination. The Government has not enacted specific legislation or oth-
 erwise mandated accessibility for the disabled. Facilities for treating the mentally
 ill or the retarded are inadequate. Unless a family has money to provide personal-
 ized service, a mentally ill person can find little treatment in the country.
 Indigenous People.-Tribal people have had a marginal ability to influence deci-
 sions concerning the use of their lands. The 1997 Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT)
 peace accord has been in effect for 1 year, and has ended 25 years of insurgency
 in the CHT. While the situation in theCHT was peaceful at year's end, implementa-
 tion of the peace accord has been slow. There has been disagreement over the mem-
 bership of the local governing bodies provided for under the accord, and as a result
 the local and district councils had not been inaugurated by year's end. The land
 commission that is to deal with land disputes between tribals and Bengali settlers
 had not been established by year's end. Tribal leaders also have expressed dis-
 appointment at the lack of progress in providing assistance to tribals that left the
 area during the insurgency.
 Until 1985 the Government regularly allotted land in the CHT to Bengali settlers,
 including land which was claimed by indigenous people under traditional concepts
 of land ownership. This led to the displacement of many tribal groups, such as the
 Chakmas and Marmas. Bengali inhabitants in the CHT increased from 3 percent
 of the region's population in 1947 to approximately 50 percent of the area's popu-
 lation of 1 million in 1997. In response to the Government's action, the Shanti-
 Bahini, a tribal group, had waged a low-level conflict in the CHT from the early
 1970's until the signing of a peace agreement with the Government in December
 1997. During the periods of violence, all those involved-indigenous tribes, settlers,
 and security forces-accused each other of human rights violations. The terms of the
 1997 pact provided for a strong local government, consisting of mostly tribal rep-
 resentatives, including the chairperson; reduction of the military presence in the
 CHT region; and a substantial compensation package for displaced tribal families.
 Implementation of the pact proceeded in 1998, and the Government introduced and
 passed several bills related to the local government. In February the last group of
 tribal refugees returned to the CHT from camps in the neighboring Indian state of
 Tripura, completing the repatriation of over 60,000 refugees. However, some tribal
 leaders criticized the Government for implementing the agreement too slowly and
 for the lack of progress in providing assistance to the returned tribals.
 Tribal people in other areas also have reported problems of loss of land to Bengali
 Muslims through questionable legal practices and other means. The Garos, of the
 Modhupur forest region in north central Bangladesh, continue to face problems in
 maintaining their cultural traditions and livelihoods in the face of deforestation and
 encroachment by surrounding Bengali communities. The pressure on the Garo com-
 munity has resulted in greater migration to urban areas and to the Indian state of
 Meghalaya, threatening the existence of an already small community estimated at
 only 16,000. The Government had indicated in 1995 that it would establish a na-
 tional park of 400 acres in the Mymensingh district. Part of the land would be taken
 from the Garo tribals. Action still is pending on that proposal. The Government has
 not ruled out moving the tribals from the land.
 Religious Minorities.-Hindus, Christians, and Buddhists make up about 13 per-
 cent of the population. Although the Government is secular, religion exerts a power-
 ful influence on politics, and the Government is sensitive to the Muslim conscious-
 ness of the majority of its citizens. However, the Jamaat-i-Islami, the country's larg-
 est Islamic political party, went from 18 seats in Parliament after the 1991 elec-
 tions, to 3 after the 1996 elections.
 Islamic extremists occasionally attacked women, religious minorities, and develop-
 ment workers. The Government sometimes has failed to criticize, to investigate, and
 to prosecute perpetrators of these attacks. However, the Government responded
 quickly after an April 28 attack on a Catholic school in Dhaka. The attack by an
 irate crowd of Muslims occurred after the school won a favorable court decision in
 a property dispute with a neighboring mosque. The crowd ransacked the school and
 attacked four churches in Dhaka. During the attack, 40 to 50 persons, including 3
 policemen, reportedly were injured. Immediately after the attack began, the Home
 Ministry dispatched additional police to the site and sought to mediate the issue,
 but their efforts were ineffective in halting the violence.

 Religious minorities are in practice disadvantaged in such areas as access to gov-
 ernment jobs and political office. Selection boards in the government services are
 often without minority group representation.
 Many Hindus have been unable to recover landholdings lost because of discrimi-
 nation in the application of the law, especially the Vested Property Act. Property
 ownership, particularly among Hindus,,has been a contentious issue since independ-
 ence in 1971, when many Hindus lost land holdings because of anti-Hindu discrimi-
 nation in the application of the law. Prior to its 1996 election victory, the Awami
 League promised to repeal the Vested Property Act, the law used to deprive Hindus
 of their property. However, the Government has so far taken no action. There have
 been in past years cases of violence directed against the religious minority commu-
 nities that also have resulted in the loss of property. The last such major incidents
 occurred in 1992, although there were also some minor incidents of this type during
 the period surrounding the 1996 elections.. Such intercommunal violence has report-
 edly caused some members of religious minorities to depart the country.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right to join unions
 and-with government approval-the right to form a union. Approximately 1.8 mil-
 lion of the country's 5 million workers in the formal sector belong to unions (the
 total work force is approximately 58 million). There is a large unreported informal
 sector, for which no reliable labor statistics exist.
 For a union to obtain and maintain its registration, 30 percent workplace partici-
 pation is required. Moreover, would-be unionists technically are forbidden to engage
 in many activities prior to registration. Labor activists have protested that this re-
 qurment severely restricts worker's freedom to organize. The International Labor
 Organization (ILO) has requested the Government to amend the 30 percent provi-
 sion on the grounds that it restricts workers' freedom to organize. The ILO also has
 requested the Government to amend legislative provisions that bar registration of
 a union comprising workers from different workplaces owned by different employers.
 About 15 percent of the approximately 5,450 labor unions are affiliated with 23 offi-
 cially registered National Trade Union (NTU) centers. There are also several unreg-
 istered NTUs.
 With the exception of Workers in the railway, postal; telegraph, and telephone de-
 partments, civil servants, police, and military personnel are forbidden to join unions.
 Civil servants forbidden to join unions, such as teachers and nurses, have formed
 associations that perform functions similar to labor unions, i.e., providing for mem-
 bers' welfare, offering legal services, and airing grievances. However, collective bar-
 gaining is prohibited. Some workers have formed unregistered unions, particularly
 university employees and workers in the construction and transport (both public
 and private) industries. The Government banned trade union activity in the Ban-
 gladesh Bank, the, country's central bank, in January. The ban followed an incident
 in which some labor unionists affiliated with the ruling party's trade union as-
 saulted a senior bank official,, after Which there were clashes between members of
 rival unions.
 There are no legal restrictions on political activities by labor unions, although the
 calling of nationwide general strikes or transportation blockades by unions is consid-
 ered a criminal rather than a political act and thus forbidden.
 While unions are not paft of the government structure, they are highly politicized,
 and are strongest in state-owned enterprises. Virtually all the NTU centers are af-
 iliated with political parties, inciuding one with the ruling Awami League. Some
 unions are militant and engage in intimidation and vandalism. Illegal blockades of
 public transportation routes by strikers occurred frequently during the year. Pitched
 batties between members of rival labor unions occur regularly. Fighting often is over
 the control of rackets or extortion payoffs and typically involves knives,- guns, and
 homemade bombs.
 Workers are eligible formembership on their union's executive staff, the size of
 which is set by law in proportion to the number of union members. The Registrar
 of Trade Unions may cancel registration of a union with the concurrence of the
 Labor Court, but no such actions were known to have been taken in 1998. -
 The right to strike is not recognized specifically in the law, but strikes are a com-
 mon form of protest. General strikes are standard tools of political opposition groups
 and are used to pressure the Government to meet political demands. There were no
 labor-related national strikes in 1998. Workers at Chittagong port, the country's
 major harbor, conducted several industrial actions to protest a proposed privately
 run port facility. Some employees organized in professional associations or unregis-
 tered unions also went on strike during 1998. University teachers struck for short
 periods over pay and benefits, as well as the continuing problem of campus violence.
 
 
 1875
 
 Wildcat strikes are illegal but occur frequently, with varying government responses.
 Wildcat strikes in the transportation sector are particularly common.
 The Essential Services Ordinance permits the Government to bar strikes for 3
 months in any sector that it declares essential. This ban, generally obeyed, so far
 has been applied to national airline pilots, water supply workers, shipping employ-
 ees, and electricity supply workers. The ban tends to be renewed every 3 months.
 The Government is empowered to prohibit a strike or lockout at any time before or
 after the strike or lockout begins and to refer the dispute to the Labor Court. Mech-
 anisms for conciliation, arbitration, and labor court dispute resolution were estab-
 lished under the Industrial Relations Ordinance of 1969. Workers have the right to
 strike in the event of a failure to settle. If a strike lasts 30 days or longer, the Gov-
 ernment.may prohibit the strike and refer the dispute to the Labor Court for adju-
 dication. This has not happened since 1993.
 'There are provisions in the Industrial Relations Ordinance for the immunity of
 registered unions or union officers from civil liability. Enforcement of these provi-
 sions is uneven. In past illegal work actions, such as transportation blockades, po-
 lice have arrested union members under the Special Powers Act or regular criminal
 codes.
 There are no restrictions on affiliation with international labor organizations, and
 unions and federations maintain a variety of such links. Trade unionists are re-
 q ured to obtain government clearance to travel to International Labor Organization
 (ILO) meetings, but no clearances were reported denied in 1998.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is legal
 only for private sector-workers, on the condition that they are- represented by unions
 legally- registered as collective bargaining agents by the Registrar of Trade Unions.
 Collective bargaining occurs on occasion in large private enterprises such as phar-
 maceuticals, jute, or textiles but, because of high unemployment, workers may fore-
 go collective bargaining out of concerns over job security. Collective bargaining gen-
 erally does not occur in small private enterprises.
 Public sector-workers' pay levels and other benefits are set by the National Pay
 and Wages Commission, whose recommendations are binding and may not be dis-
 puted except on the issue of implementation.
 Under the Industrial Relations Ordinance, there is considerable leeway for dis-
 crimination against union members and organizers by employers. For example, the
 Ordinance allows the arbitrary transfer of workers suspected of union activities or
 termination -with payment of-mandatory severance benefits (2 weeks' salary). There
 are - credible reports that employers routinely engage in antiunion discrimination
 and harassment,-including physical attack, especially in the garment industry. In
 practice, private sector employers usually discourage any union activity, sometimes
 working in collaboration with local police. The Registrar of Trade Unions rules on
 discrimination complaints. In a number of cases, the Labor Court has ordered the
 reinstatement of workers fired for union activities. However, the Labor Court's over-
 all effectiveness is hampered by a serious case backlog, and there also have been
 allegations that some of its deliberations have been corrupted by employers.
 The law prohibits professional and industry-based unions in the two export proc-
 essing zones (EPZ's). A small number of workers in the EPZ's have skirted prohibi-
 tions on forming unions by setting up associations. The Government has not imple-
 -mented a 1992 government promise to end labor law restrictions on freedom of asso-
 ciation and formation of unions by 1997. In addition to.the prohibition on unions,
 no collective bargaining takes place in the EPZ's. Approximately 50,000 persons are
 employed in EPZ's, primarily in the textile and apparel, electronics component, and
 leather industries.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, including that performed by children; however, the Govern-
 ment does not enforce this prohibition effectively. The Factories Act and Shops and
 Establishments Act, both passed in 1965, set up inspection mechanisms to enforce
 laws against enforced labor. These laws are not rigorously enforced, partly because
 resources for enforcement are few. There is no large-scale bonded or forced labor..
 However, some domestic servants, including many children, work in conditions that
 resemble servitude and may suffer physical abuse, sometimes resulting in death.
 There is extensive trafficking in both women and children, mainly for purposes of
 prostitution, although in some instances for labor servitude outside Bangladesh (see
 Section 5).
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 prohibits labor by children, including forced or bonded labor. However, such prac-
 tices occur (see Section 6.c.). There is no law that uniformly prohibits the employ-
 ment of childrenand child labor is a serious problem. Some laws prohibit labor by
 children in certain sectors. The Factories -Act of 1965 bars children under the age
 
 
 1876
 
 of 14 from working in factories. This law also stipulates that children and adoles-
 cents are allowed to work only a maximum 5-hour day and only between the hours
 of 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. The Shops and-Establishments Act of 1965 prohibits the em-
 ployment of children younger than 12 in commercial workplaces. The Employment
 of Children Act.of 1938 prohibits the employment of children under 15 in the rail-
 ways or in goods handling within ports.
 - Coverage and tenforcement, of these rules is inadequate. Because of widespread
 poverty, many children begin to work at a very young age. According to a 1996 labor
 force survey by the Government, the country has, 6.3 million working children be-
 tween the ages of 5 and 14 years, who work for compensation and are not enrolled
 in school. Also, children often-work side by side with other family members in small-
 scale and subsistence agriculture. UNICEF and ILO surveys indicate that, of chil-
 dren 6 to 17 years of age, 21 percent of boys and 4 percent of girls are working in
 p aid employment. Children drive rickshaws,,break bricks at construction sites, carry
 fruit,. vegetables, and dry goods for shoppers at markets, work at tea stalls, and
 work as beachcombers in the shrimp industry. Children routinely perform domestic
 work. Cases of children being physically abused and occasionally killed by heads of
 household where they work are reported in the press. The Constitution prohibits
 forced or compulsory labor, including that performed-by children, however, the Gov-
 ernment does not enforce this prohibition effectively (some children work in condi-
 tions that, resemble labor servitude; see Section 6.c.). Some children are trafficked
 domestically or overseas, often for prostitution; and, child prostitution is a serious
 problem (see Section 5).Under-the law, every child must attend school through the
 figrade, or age '10 years. However, the Government continues to maintain that
 it does not yet have the resources to implement'this law effectively.  -
 Protracted negotiations led to the July 1995 signing of a Memorandum of Under-
 standing (MOU) between the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters
 Association (BGMEA), UNICEF, and the ILO to eliminate child labor in the gar-
 ment sector. Under the MOU, the garment sector was to become child labor free by
 October 31, 1996, with former- child laborers enrolled in, UNICEF-sponsored schools
 and follow-up inspections of factories by ILO-managed inspection teams. The chil-
 dren receive a small monthly stipend while attending school to help replace their
 lost income. Under the MOU, more than 4,000 -former child laborers were enrolled
 in more than 300 UNICEF schools during 1998. In December the BGMEA an-
 nounced that it would provide stipends to children over the age of 14 who graduated
 from child labor MOU schools in November. The stipend is to continue until these
 children are absorbed into the BGMEA's "earn -and learn" program. By year's end,
 violations of the ban- ont child-labor in the garment export sector had declined to
 about 3 percent of factories inspected. According to ILO inspectors, most violating
 factories had one or two child laborers, and only about 1 percent of the factories had
 more than this number. However, a BGMEA arbitration commite' tasked with im-
 posing fines on violating factories functions slowly. The number of children working
 in nonexport, or nonfactory garment production, is unknown.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is n6 national minimum wage. Instead,
 the wage commission, which convenes every several years, sets wages and benefits
 industry by industry. In most cases, private sector employers ignore this wage struc-
 ture. The average monthly wage i sufficient to provide an individual with a mini-
 mal standard of living, but is not sufficient to provide a- decent-standard of living
 for a worker and family.       '   '   --        - I
 The law sets a standard 48-hour workweek with-1 day off mandated. A 60-hour
 workweek, inclusive of a 'maximum 12- hours of- overtime, is allowed. The law is
 poorly enforced in industries such as hosiery and ready-made garments.
 The Factories Act of 1965 nominally sets occupational health and safety stand-
 ards. The law is comprehensive but largely is ignored by employers. Workers may
 resort to legal action for enforcement-of the law's provisions, 'but few cases actually
 are prosecuted. Enforcement by the Labor Ministry's industrial inspectors is weak-
 Due to, a high unemployment rate and inadequate enforcement of the-laivs, workers
 -demanding correction of dangerous working conditions or refusing to paitcipate in
 perceived dangerous activities risk losing their'jobs.
