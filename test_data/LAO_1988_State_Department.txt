 LAOS
 The Lao People's Democratic Republic (LPDR) is a totalitarian,
 one-party, Communist state. The Lao People's Revolutionary
 Party (LPRP) is the source of all political authority in the
 country, and the party's leadership imposes broad and
 arbitrary controls on the population of 3.8 million people.
 The LPRP came to power in 1975 after a protracted civil war
 during which it received strong support from North Vietnam.
 Vietnam continues to exert great influence over Laos, codified
 in a 25-year Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation signed in
 1977. The number of Vietnamese troops and advisors in Laos,
 however, has been reduced beginning in late 1987. Of the
 original 40,000 to 50,000 troops stationed in Laos under the
 terms of the treaty, that total has been reduced by at least
 half and possibly more. The U.S.S.R is also very influential
 in Laos; it is the largest contributor of economic and
 military assistance. Soviet concepts of perestroika
 (restructuring) have begun to be accepted in Laos, although
 the LPRP is seeking its own Lao formulation for its highly
 underdeveloped conditions.
 Established 13 years ago, the LPDR still has no constitution
 and no published code of law. In 1988 there was a start in
 this direction with the holding of the first local and
 provincial elections. All candidates were approved by the
 LPRP. National elections are scheduled for March 26 1989 with
 the subsequent convening of a National Assembly to endorse a
 government-drafted constitution.
 The LPDR is one of the poorest countries in the world, with
 daunting economic development tasks in nearly all fields. The
 Government's harsh policies, particularly in its first 5
 years, combined with difficult economic conditions in general,
 drove some 325,000 Lao into exile. Among those refugees were
 most of the educated elite. Economic reforms introduced in
 late 1986 and accelerated visibly in 1988, designed in part to
 increase domestic and foreign private investment, have
 recently begun to have some effect with a wider variety and
 greater abundance of consumer goods in the markets. However,
 the standard of living remains extremely low,
 While the human rights situation may have improved marginally
 in 1988, the people enjoy few human rights. There are severe
 limitations on the freedoms of speech and press, on freedom of
 assembly and association, and on freedom of movement.  The
 state security apparatus continued to be the principal
 violator. However, travel restrictions between provinces
 appeared to have been eased somewhat in 1988 as part of the
 economic reform program. Also, reeducation camps, which have
 been the regime's preferred method of inducing obedience,
 continued to decline in population, and an undetermined number
 have been closed. Some former camp prisoners have been
 permitted to obtain passports and exit visas and have been
 able to travel overseas. In general, information on human
 rights violations in Laos continued to be difficult to collect
 and verify.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There have been reports that Lao government and Vietnamese
 patrols have fatally shot persons fleeing from Laos as well as
 those entering the country illegally. In those instances in
 which the LPDR confirms such incidents, it generally claims
 that the persons were smugglers or suspected members of the
 Lao resistance.
 An unknown number of people are killed annually in combined
 Lao/Vietnamese military operations against resistance forces.
 Many of the insurgents appear to be former Royal Lao Army
 troops and Hmong tribesmen. Both sides are reported to use
 brutal tactics, with the antigovernment forces attempting
 assassination and ambush of Lao, Vietnamese, and other
 Communist military and civilian personnel. There are also
 recurrent reports of attacks by bandit groups in isolated or
 interior areas on vehicles bearing government officials and on
 civilian buses. Official policy calls for the execution of
 resistance leaders, but no such executions were reported in
 1988.
 There were reports in July 1988 that a group of Hmong were
 pushed back from Thailand when they tried to leave Laos
 illegally; no casualties were reported on this occasion.
 Casualties from a similar incident involving more than 30
 Hmong did occur in November 1987. The Government has denied
 responsibility for the latter incident, but it did not permit
 international observers to visit the area, on the grounds that
 both access and security are difficult.
 b. Disappearance
 No disappearances were reported in 1988.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 A relatively small number of "reeducation" prisoners continue
 to be held in harsh conditions, but recent details are not
 available.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Government continues to maintain reeducation camps, or
 "seminar camps," in which persons who served the previous
 government, or who have offended the current one, are
 imprisoned. Accurate figures for camp populations are not
 available, but rough estimdtes are that between 1,000 to 1,500
 persons are still detained. In 1988 government officials
 claimed, as they have previously, that nearly all soldiers and
 officials sent to the camps in 1975-76 had been released and
 that very few remained. The accuracy of that statement cannot
 be verified. There are accounts, however, that groups of camp
 detainees were released in 1988. One group of approximately
 300 was reportedly released in September 1988, for instance,
 and in 1988, as in 1987, the release of some categories of
 detainees appeared to be more regular.
 
 
 857
 LAOS
 Since 1979 conditions in most of the camps reportedly have
 improved, and a number of the camps have been reported closed.
 Most detainees now live in a kind of internal exile in
 isolated provincial areas with severe restrictions on their
 freedom of movement. Many reportedly have been assigned to
 collective farms or construction units inside their former
 camps. Some are on probation or cannot obtain necessary
 travel documents. Others who have lost property and families
 are reported to have remained in areas near the camps to begin
 new lives.
 Those accused of hostility to the regime or of what the
 Government calls "socially undesirable habits," such as
 prostitution, drug abuse, idleness, and "wrong- thought," are
 sent to "rehabilitation" centers, usually without trial. Most
 of these persons have been allowed to return to their homes
 after periods ranging from a few months to several years of
 hard labor, political indoctrination, and admission of guilt.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 No code of law exists in Laos. The courts are not
 independent, and there is no guarantee of due process. The
 Government has promulgated interim rules and regulations for
 the arrest and trial of those accused of specific crimes,
 including armed resistance to the Government. Although the
 regulations allow an accused person ta make a statement
 presenting his side of the case, they provide no real
 opportunity for the accused to defend himself and do not
 permit bail or use of a freely chosen attorney. Rather, the
 Government has issued instructions on how to investigate,
 prosecute, and punish wrongdoers. These instructions are
 applied capriciously and inconsistently. People can be
 arrested on the unsupported accusations of others and detained
 while the accusations are being investigated, without being
 informed of the charges or of the identities of the persons
 making the accusations. Investigations often.take a long time
 unless family members and friends take a strong interest in
 the case. Government officials and their families easily can
 influence the judgments reached. There is some provision for
 appeal, although important political cases tried by "people's
 courts" are without an appeals process. Death sentences must
 be approved by the Council of Ministers. Lao regulations call
 for judgment to be given in public. This generally amounts to
 a public announcement of the sentence and not a true public
 trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Search and seizure are authorized by the security bureaus
 themselves rather than by an impartial judicial authority, and
 government regulations, which are not always followed, provide
 little protection for the persons affected. International and
 domestic mail is selectively opened on a routine basis. Mail
 from China and non-Communist countries is particularly
 suspect. Telephone calls frequently are monitored. Privately
 owned land may not be sold but may be inherited. Inheritances
 cannot be passed on to relatives who have left the country as
 refugees and acquired another nationality.
 
 
 858
 LAOS
 The Government makes no attempt to stop Lao from listening to
 foreign radio stations such as the Voice of America, nor from
 setting up antennas to bring in Thai television from across
 the Mekong River. The state security apparatus monitors
 family life extensively through a system of neighborhood
 wardens and informers.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Public expression of opposition to the Government is not
 permitted, and persons who indulge in such activity have been
 jailed. Newspapers and the state radio are subservient to the
 LPRP and to the Government, reflecting only their views.
 Ordinary Lao citizens may not import foreign newsmagazines or
 books; censorship is strict. Academic freedom does not exist.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government controls all meetings and, except for
 religious, athletic, and communal events, organizes them.
 Individuals do not have the right to join together to promote
 nonregime-sponsored activities nor to protest government
 policies. All associations--such as those for youth, women,
 workers, and a "peace organization"--are officially authorized
 to exercise government control and disseminate government
 policy. All professional groups are organized by the party,
 and their leadership is ordinarily drawn from party ranks.
 Lao associations are permitted to maintain relations with
 like-minded politically acceptable organizations in other
 countries, particularly those in Communist countries.
 Ordinary Lao citizens are permitted association or contact
 with foreigners only in unusual circumstances, usually
 involving their work.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Nearly all Lao are Buddhists or, in the case of most highland
 groups, animists. In official statements, the Government has
 recognized the right of the people to free exercise of
 religious belief as well as the contributions religion can
 make to the development of the country.
 Many Lao believe, however, that the Government is engaged in a
 long-term effort to subvert the role of religion because it
 considers the maintenance of temples and the activities of
 monks nonproductive and because it objects to an active group
 with an independent system of beliefs. This effort includes
 carefully controlling the education of young monks and
 compelling the Buddhist clergy to propagate elements of
 Marxist-Leninist doctrine. Further, since 1975, the
 Government has periodically taken over Buddhist and Christian
 places of worship for use as government schools, offices, and
 fire and police stations, as well as for political
 indoctrination centers and warehouses. Nonetheless, since the
 Third Party Congress in 1982, the Government has eased its
 stand on Buddhism. While it has not, so far as is known,
 contributed to the restoration of temples and religious
 institutions, it has not opposed efforts of the faithful to do
 so.
 
 
 859
 LAOS
 Monks remain the only social group still entitled to special
 honorific terms of address, which even high party and
 government officials continue to use. Buddhist clergy are
 prominently featured at important state and party functions.
 Religious festivals are permitted to take place without
 hindrance. The Government has not objected to young people
 entering into religious orders for short periods.
 Links may be maintained with coreligionists and religious
 associations in other countries only in cases approved by the
 Government, usually involving other Communist countries. Most
 traditional links to Thai Buddhists have been severed.
 Missionaries are not formally banned from entering Laos to
 proselytize, but in most cases they are denied permission.
 Many top party officials still participate in religious
 ceremonies, but members of the military are forbidden even to
 have Buddhist funerals.
 Roman Catholics and Protestants are permitted to worship, but
 the activities of their churches are closely monitored.
 Vatican officials visited Laos in 1987 to meet with the Bishop
 of Vientiane, as well as with local church and government
 officials. Attendance at Christian services continues to
 require discretion, although less so in 1988 than in 1987.
 The Government tries through the media and other means to
 persuade highland minority groups to abandon their
 "old-fashioned" animist beliefs.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Lao citizens must obtain permission from the authorities for
 all internal travel of any distance and in all cases when
 crossing provincial boundaries. Non-Lao residents in
 Vientiane must obtain permission to travel outside it.
 Permission is now easier to obtain than before, but is by no
 means automatic. Government officials have cited threats of
 "disorders" created by "reactionary elements" as the reason
 for the restrictions.
 Foreign travel is permitted for officials, students in
 government-approved programs, and some others who have access
 to foreign exchange. Few Lao are permitted to study or train
 in non-Communist countries, even at their own expense, but the
 number has been increasing. Exit visas, which are required,
 are not easy to obtain, but restrictions have been eased over
 the past 2 years. For pensioners, the elderly in general, and
 those with hard currency, it seems less difficult to obtain
 exit visas than in the past, and the number of travelers to
 the West and to the United States has increased sharply,
 although the absolute numbers are still small. Border
 crossing permits are available for those with business in
 Thailand. The number of permits increased in 1988 in keeping
 with the opening of additional border trade locations and the
 reduction in the number of items restricted by the Thai
 Government for trade with Laos. The permits are not, however,
 granted automatically and may be denied arbitrarily.
 Legal emigration is rarely authorized for ethnic Lao. To
 guard against emigration, those permitted to travel must often
 leave their families behind as a guarantee of their return.
 Since 1975 over 325,000 Lao have registered as refugees in
 Thailand. An unknown number have crossed the border and
 simply settled with relatives or kindred ethnic groups.
 
 
 860
 LAOS
 Some of those fleeing are fired upon and killed by border
 patrols as they attempt to cross the Mekong River. Government
 authorities have imprisoned many Lao seeking to leave the
 country illegally.
 The Lao and Thai Governments have agreed to take back, on a
 case-by-case basis, those of their respective citizens who
 have illegally crossed into the other country and now wish to
 return home. Since May 1980, when agreement was reached with
 Thailand and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 (UNHCR) on a voluntary repatriation program, over 3,100 Lao
 have voluntarily returned to Laos under the auspices of the
 UNHCR. Those accepted for return receive several days of
 political indoctrination and then are released to return to
 their homes, where they are placed under the control of
 village authorities. The UNHCR provides basic necessities for
 the returnees and monitors their treatment and living
 conditions thereafter. There appears to be no official
 harassment or maltreatment of these voluntary returnees, and
 UNHCR officials have not been prevented from visiting them.
 In addition, perhaps as many as 10,000 persons have
 repatriated themselves without official involvement.
 The Lao Government has also agreed in principle to take back
 Lao in Thailand whom the Thai have determined do not meet the
 requirements for refugee status. Procedures for the return of
 these "screened-out" Lao were worked out between the two
 countries in late 1986, and since that time a total of 44 have
 returned.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government.
 Laos is ruled by a small elite of the LPRP, the sole party.
 There is neither freedom to participate in politics outside
 the party nor popular choice of policies or officials. The
 first public elections held by this government occurred this
 year. Voters throughout Laos cast ballots for their district
 representatives on June 26. Under the electoral regulations
 published in April, voting was mandatory and, while all
 candidates did not have to be members of the LPRP, the
 winners, with rare exceptions, were. While no other party was
 permitted to organize, there were more LPRP candidates than
 seats. The same set of rules were applied in the
 provincial-level elections held November 20, and reportedly
 will be applied in the national-level elections scheduled for
 March 26, 1989.
 A large number of women were elected in the June district-level
 elections (just over 10 percent in the capital).
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Laos generally does not cooperate with private international
 organizations interested in human rights. However, it does
 occasionally permit visits by officials of international
 humanitarian organizations if the purpose of the visit is not
 specifically related to allegations of human rights violations.
 
 
 861
 LAOS
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Approximately half of the population in Laos are ethnic Lao,
 also called "lowland Lao;" 20 percent are tribal Thai; 15
 percent are Phoutheung (or Kha); and another 15 percent are
 other highland groups (Hmong, Yao, and others). The
 Government is attempting to integrate these groups through
 voluntary programs and to overcome traditional antagonism
 between lowland Lao and minority groups.
 The Hmong are split on clan lines. During the years of
 insurgency, many were strongly anti-Communist; others sided
 with the Communist Pathet Lao and the Vietnamese. The
 Government is repressive toward all groups that fought against
 it, especially those continuing to resist its authority by
 force. The Hmong tried to defend some of their tribal areas
 after 1915, and some continue to support anti-LPDR resistance
 groups. Vietnamese and Lao armed forces conduct military
 operations against the minority-based resistance groups in the
 north and the resistance forces from lowland Lao groups,
 mainly in southern Laos.
 The Government wants to resettle in the lowlands some ethnic
 minorities who now inhabit mountainous areas. After
 resettlement they would be under closer government control and
 engage in settled agricultural production rather than present
 slash-and-burn techniques. For this purpose, the Government
 has reportedly relied on a voluntary program based on material
 inducements.
 The situation for local ethnic Chinese has been marked by
 government suspicion and surveillance in the period after 1979
 when Sino-Lao relations deteriorated seriously. Relations
 have improved, however, and were normalized in 1988. A
 majority of the Chinese community departed in the post-1975
 period, largely for economic reasons. Those who remain have
 maintained government-approved Chinese schools in Vientiane
 and Savannakhet and Chinese associations in several provincial
 capitals.
 Traditionally, women in Lao society have been subservient to
 men and often discouraged from obtaining an education. Today,
 the active, government-controlled Lao Women's Federation has
 as one of its stated goals the achievement of rights for women
 equal to those of men. The Government claims that a higher
 percentage of women make up the school population now than
 before 1975, and that women are being encouraged to assume a
 greater role in economic and state-controlled political
 activity.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The number of workers in the wage economy is extremely small,
 overwhelmingly state employed, and very poorly paid. Labor
 laws do not exist. Labor unions exist but are small and have
 no right to strike. All unions are controlled by the
 Federation of Lao Trade Unions, which in turn is controlled by
 the LPRP. The Federation is a member of the World Federation
 of Trade Unions; Laos is a member of the International Labor
 Organization (ILO), sends delegations to ILO meetings, and
 receives some technical assistance from that organization.
 
 
 862
 LAOS
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Unions play no discernible role in ameliorating the abysmally
 low salaries and wages, for instance, of public employees, the
 largest single category of employment. Under the recently
 published foreign investment code, some worker rights are
 guaranteed, such as the right to have job responsibilities
 defined, to be paid for that job and not another, to be paid
 more for overtime, and for overtime to be approved by the Lao
 authorities as well as the investor, whether Lao or foreign.
 How these regulations will be observed in practice is not yet
 known. There are no economic incentive zones or special
 industries where labor standards differ from those elsewhere
 in the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no general pattern of forced labor in Laos.
 Prisoners in "reeducation" camps, or in prison camps (the
 former for "ideological" crimes, the latter for "economic" or
 "social" offenses) are expected to do hard labor. In
 addition, there are reports that some of these prisoners, when
 released, are restricted to the general area of the camp
 (always in rugged and mountainous terrain) and there expected
 to work on state enterprises.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 There is no minimum age for employment of children.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Workplace conditions are not systematically exploitative, but
 they sometimes fail to protect workers adequately against
 sickness or accident. There is no specific system of laws or
 regulations relating to worker safety. Working hours do not
 exceed 48 hours a week, except during urgent roadbuilding or
 construction projects. It is unclear whether such urgent
 labor is compulsory. Wages are low, particularly in the state
 sector and are, in fact, not sufficient to live on unless
 supplemented by other sources of income. Some, but not all,
 workers receive paid vacations of 2 weeks.
