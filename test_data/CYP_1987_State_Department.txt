 CYPRUS
 Cyprus has been divided since the Turkish military
 intervention of 1974, an event which followed a coup d'etat
 directed from Greece. Since that time, the southern part of
 the country has been under the control of the Government of
 the Republic of Cyprus, and the northern part under an
 autonomous Turkish Cypriot administration supported by the
 presence of Turkish troops. In 1983 this administration
 proclaimed itself the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus,"
 which has been recognized only by Turkey. It held a
 constitutional referendum and presidential and legislative
 elections in 1985.
 The internal political systems of the Republic of Cyprus and
 the Turkish Cypriot administration are democratic, based on
 free elections, and provide for basic human rights to their
 populations in theory and practice.
 Both Cypriot economies are founded on the free enterprise
 system, with stress on private initiative and the right to own
 property. The relatively prospering economy in the south is
 based on manufacturing, trade, tourism and services,
 construction, and agriculture. The economy in the Turkish
 Cypriot area, which is closely linked to that of Turkey, is
 heavily based on agriculture and suffers from high inflation,
 low investment, and significant underemployment. In the past,
 the Turkish Cypriot economy provided a large role for state
 enterprises, but efforts are now under way to orient the
 economy toward greater private sector participation.
 The conflict between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities
 during the 1963-74 period, the Turkish intervention in 1974,
 and the continuing presence of Turkish troops in the north
 have led to charges of human rights violations. These events
 resulted in the uprooting of Greek Cypriots and Turkish
 Cypriots from the northern and southern parts of the island
 respectively, and the loss of lives, homes, and livelihoods.
 Greek Cypriots point to these displacements, the continuing
 Turkish troop presence, the disappearance of Greek Cypriots as
 a result of the 1974 events, and the Turkish Cypriot
 unwillingness to allow Greek Cypriot resettlement and travel
 in the north as the fundamental human rights questions in
 Cyprus today. In contrast, Turkish Cypriots assert that the
 1974 Turkish intervention was legal and necessary to save
 their community from destruction. They point to the physical
 and economic isolation of the Turkish Cypriot population
 living in enclaves from 1963 to 1974 and the disappearance of
 Turkish Cypriots during the same period. They maintain that
 they had been disenfranchised de facto, and that the
 subsequent regrouping of the two communities in separate parts
 of the island was necessary for their security.
 In August 1984, the United Nations Secretary General launched
 a renewed initiative to achieve a just and lasting resolution
 of the Cyprus problem. In his latest report to the U.N.
 Security Council, the Secretary General noted that an impasse
 has developed in the negotiations. At present, according to
 that report, the two Cypriot sides are unable to agree on the
 process for continuing negotiations. The Secretary General's
 efforts to overcome this impasse and to resume the negotiating
 process continued throughout 1987.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of persons abducted, secretly arrested,
 or held in clandestine detention during 1987. However, the
 issue of persons missing during the 1963-74 period remains a
 source of dispute between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish
 Cypriot communities. The tripartite Committee on Missing
 Persons established under the auspices of the U.N. Secretary
 General in 1981 continued its investigations into this issue
 during 1987.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Both the Cyprus Constitution and the basic document governing
 the Turkish Cypriot community specifically prohibit torture.
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment is provided for by law and respected in practice in
 both communities. Adequate health care is provided in prison
 and detention facilities, and diet is considered normal.
 Family members may visit those in detention. After
 sentencing, prisoners may be visited once a month, or more
 frequently when humanitarian needs exist. Attorneys may visit
 prisoners freely.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Freedom trom arbitrary arrest and detention is provided for by
 law and iespected in practic6 by the Government of Cyprus and
 Turkish Cypriot authorities. Preventive detention is not
 legally authorized, nor has it been reported in practice. No
 one may be held for more than 3 days for investigation of a
 crime without referral of the case to the courts for extension
 of the period of detention. Most periods of investigative
 detention do not exceed 8 to 10 days before formal charges are
 filed. No instances of exile or of forced or compulsory labor
 were reported.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In both parts of Cyprus, fair public trial is provided for by
 law and exists in practice. The judiciary is independent of
 executive or military control. Defendants have the right to
 be present at their trial, to be represented by counsel (at
 government expense for those who cannot afford one), to
 confront witnesses, and to present evidence in their own
 defense. Cases are generally tried before a judge or panel of
 judges, although a request for a jury trial is usually
 granted. There are no special courts to deal with security or
 political offenses. Civilians are not tried by military
 courts. There are no political prisoners in Cyprus.

 CYPRUS
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Both the Cyprus Constitution and the basic document governing
 the Turkish Cypriot community provide protection for the
 individual against arbitrary interference. A judicial warrant
 is required, for example, for a police official to enter a
 private residence. Abuses of privacy run counter to the
 democratic traditions of both communities. However, Turkish
 Cypriots complain that mail coming through the Republic of
 Cyprus postal system is often delayed, opened, or not
 delivered.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These rights are provided for by law and are widely and freely
 practiced throughout the island. The press is free and
 represents the entire political spectrum. There is no press
 censorship, but the authorities control radio and television.
 Legislation was passed by the Republic of Cyprus in 1986
 giving each party represented in Parliament a seat on the
 board controlling the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation. In
 addition, the proliferation of party and independent
 newspapers in both communities enables ideas and arguments to
 circulate freely.
 Opposition papers frequently criticize the authorities. A
 prominent politician in the Turkish Cypriot area, however,
 faces seditious libel charges over an editorial he wrote in
 1985 criticizing the chief executive of the Turkish Cypriot
 administration. Preliminary motions in the case have been
 entered, but it has not yet dome to trial.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The freedom to associate, organize, and hold meetings is
 provided for in law and respected in practice.
 Trade unions and confederations, both non-Communist and
 Communist, are free to organize on both sides of the
 cease-fire line which divides the two communities. Over 80
 percent of Greek Cypriot workers and 50 percent of Turkish
 Cypriot workers belong to independent trade unions.- In both
 communities, trade unions freely and regularly take stands on
 .publicpolicy issues affectingworkers. Most unions are -
 affiliated with either the International Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions Qg the World Federation of Trade Unions. Labor
 authorities are required by law to mediate disputes in cases
 which cannot be solved through normal collective bargaining.
 All Cypriot workers have the right to strike and occasionally
 do so. In general, however, strikes are rare and usually of
 short duration. Both the Government of Cyprus and the Turkish
 Cypriot authorities have the power to curtail strikes in what
 are deemed to be essential services. The Government of Cyprus
 used this power once in 1987 in relation to striking bank
 workers.
 Unions in both parts of Cyprus freely take part in
 international meetings. The Government of Cyprus has taken a
 particularly active role in the International Labor
 Organization. Labor unions, more than most other
 organizations on Cyprus, attempt to maintain contact and
 cooperation across the dividing line.

 CYPRUS
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is respected in Cyprus. In the south, the
 vast majority of the population-is Greek Orthodox, in the
 north, Sunni-Muslim. The Greek Orthodox Church in the south
 has the character of a state institution. Missionaries are
 allowed to proselytize in both communities.
 Although members of the Latin, Maronite, and Armenian
 minorities cannot serve in the Greek Cypriot National Guard,
 this exemption is based on ethnic rather than religious
 considerations and is generally welcomed by the minorities
 themselves.
 Approximately 100 Turkish Cypriots still live in the south of
 the island, and are allowed to practice their religion
 freely. In the north, non-Muslims include approximately 700
 Greek Cypriots, over 300 Christian Maronites, and some foreign
 residents, all of whom are free to practice their religion.
 There is,--however, a pending court case concerning an ancient
 and valuable crucifix which was removed from the main Maronite
 Church in-the north.' Following press reports that the cross
 had disappeared, the Turkish Cypriot authorities found it
 hidden in the home of a Maronite monk. Two monks were
 subsequently arrested and accused of planning to smuggle the
 cross to the south. The Turkish Cypriot authorities consider
 the cross an art treasure of north Cyprus, the export of which
 is illegal. No decision has been made yet on whether to
 prosecute the case. It has however, led to charges in the
 Greek Cypriot press of religious discrimination against
 Christians in the nbrth.
 d. ..-Frkedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Turkish Cypriots and.Greek Cypriots enjoy'general freedom of
 movement within their respective areas. Turkish Cypriot
 authorities regulate  travel into or out of the Turkish Cypriot
 area. They bar Greeks and Greek Cypriots from entering the
 north and Turkish Cypriots from visiting the south, except
 when traveling for humanitarian, medical, or other special
 reasons. The applications of Greek Cypriot residents of
 enclaves to visit the south ave usually'granted, but the
 applicants must return within a designated period or risk
 losing- th-eir, right to return, along with their property,
 foreignets',coming from the south must obtain permission to
 enter the north. At the same time, the Government of Cyprus
 bars the tntry into the Greek Cypriot-controlled area of
 foreigners who arrive at Turkish Cypriot ports. Those who
 enter through the south wishing to stay overnight in the north
 are discouraged from doing so by the Government.'
 The right to travel abroad-and to emigrate is observed,
 although individuals facing military service or legal action
 in either part of Cyprus may not be allowed to travel.
 Turkish Cypriots have difficulty in traveling to some
 countries because their travel documents,. issued by the
 Turkish Cypriot authorities, are not widely recognized.
 Citizens may repatriate freely.
 Refugees who come to Cyprus from Eastern Europe are normally
 sent to third countries as soon as arrangements for their
 resettlement can be made.

 CYPRUS
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Both the Government of Cyprus and the administration of the
 Turkish Cypriot community are democratically elected. In
 their lively multiparty political systems, parties compete
 actively and without restriction for popular support.
 Suffrage is universal, and elections are by secret ballot.
 Elections for the office of President of the Republic of
 Cyprus are held every 5 years, and elections for the House of
 Representatives every 5 years or less. In the north, the
 chief executive of the Turkish Cypriot administration is
 elected every 5 years, and the legislative body every 5 years
 or less. Greek.Cypriots and Maronites living in the north,
 the latter having chosen before 1960 to be regarded as members
 of the Greek Cypriot community, do not participate in Turkish
 Cypriot elections but elect their own village officials. They
 are eligible to vote in Greek Cypriot elections but must make
 their way to the south in order to exercise that right.
 Women are by custom less-active in politics than men in both
 north and south. There are no women members of Parliament in
 the north and only one in the south; there currently are no
 women of ministerial rank in the north. In 1986 local
 elections in the south, however, 31 out of 228 city council
 seats went to women. A woman serves as Attorney General in
 the Government of Cyprus, and the Government named a woman to
 the bench for the first time in 1986. Two women currently
 serve as under secretaries in the Turkish Cypriot
 administration. There are two female judges serving in the
 Turkish Cypriot administration, the first of whom was
 appointed in 1981.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The question of human rights in Cyprus is closely connected to
 the political differences that divide the two communities. In
 1986 a group of Greek Cypriots announced thd formation of a
 "Committee for the Restoration of Human Rights Throughout
 Cyprus." This committee ascribes the problem of human rights
 on the island to the 1974 Turkish military intervention and
 the continued presence of Turkish troops in the north. The
 Turkish Cypriot Human Rights committee, in turn, denounces the
 Greek Cypriot charges, stating that Turkish troops have been
 present to protect Turkish Cypriot human rights. Such
 exchanges continued in 1987.
 Cyprus participates actively in the work of the U.N. Human
 Rights Commission (UNHRC). For several years, the question of
 human rights inCyprus relating to the events of 1974 has been
 on the UNHRC's agenda. In March 1987, the UNHRC passed a
 resolution on Cyprus supported by the Government of the
 Republic of Cyprus. The United States voted against the
 'resolution on the grounds that it would not advance the
 efforts of the U.N. Secretary General to achieve a just and
 lasting settlement through his good offices mission and that
 it did not address the work of the Committee on Missing
 Persons. The Republic of Cyprus also has applied to have the
 question of human rights in Cyprus placed on the agenda of the
 European Commission on Human Rights. In addition, the
 Government of Cyprus repeatedly has raised in international
 forums the question of missing persons unaccounted for since
 
 
 880
 CYPRUS
 1974. Representatives of international human rights
 organizations have open access to both the south and the north.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 There have been persistent complaints that the approximately
 700 Greek Cypriots and 300 Christian Maronites in the north
 suffer discrimination concerning housing, water supply,
 education, and freedom of movement. There also have been
 allegations that a few recent instances of violent crimes
 committed against members of these groups were evidence of
 systematic harassment of the Greek Cypriot and Maronite
 communities remaining in the north. The Turkish Cypriot
 authorities, however, maintain that these were simply isolated
 criminal acts which are being properly dealt with by the
 police. The United Nations Force in Cyprus monitors the
 welfare of the Greek Cypriots and Maronites in the north, as
 well as that of the Turkish Cypriots in the south.
 Throughout Cyprus, women generally have the same legal status
 as men. In the north, legal provisions exist requiring equal
 pay for men and women performing the same job. In the south,
 government workers receive equal pay for equal work, but no
 such regulations apply to the private sector. Local custom
 also has inhibited the full participation of women in public
 life. Politics, for example, traditionally has been a male
 preserve in Cyprus. Through changing attitudes, however,
 women are gaining increasing political and social mobility.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The Cypriot Constitution provides that "every person has the
 right to a decent existence." The basic document governing
 the Turkish Cypriot community contains similar language.
 There is extensive legislation guaranteeing acceptable
 conditions for workers with respect to minimum wages, hours of
 work, and occupational safety and health. The minimum age for
 the employment of children in an "industrial undertaking" is
 set at age 14. These laws are enforced throughout Cyprus.
