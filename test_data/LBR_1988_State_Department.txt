 LIBERIA
 The Liberian Constitution provides for a U.S.-style system of
 democratic government and guaranteed rights and freedoms for
 the individual. In practice, the legacy of recent military
 rule and the tradition of strong executive authority continue
 to prevent fulfillment of that ideal. Samuel K. Doe, who
 headed the military government which ruled from 1980 until the
 establishment of the second republic in January 1986, became
 President after elections in which his claim of a narrow
 victory was widely believed to have been a fabrication. He
 and his ruling party, the National Democratic Party of Liberia
 (NDPL), dominate Liberian political life. Three opposition
 parties are recognized and permitted to function. Of these,
 one participates in electoral politics and two continue to
 boycott the Government and legislature to protest the 1985
 elections.
 While Liberia is now ruled by a civilian government, the army
 continues to be a bulwark of the current administration.
 Liberia's armed forces number about 7,000 and are engaged
 mainly in guarding border crossings and fulfilling certain
 internal security functions. The lack of military discipline,
 especially among poorly paid enlisted men, has resulted in
 some petty harassment of civilians. A small police force
 assists the armed forces in maintaining domestic order.
 President Doe has a personal bodyguard-militia, the Executive
 Mansion Guard, which includes the Special Antiterrorist Unit
 (SATU).
 Liberia's mixed economy is based primarily on traditional
 agriculture and exports of iron ore, rubber, and timber. It
 continues to suffer from foreign exchange shortages, widespread
 corruption, a crushing debt burden, and govdrnmental
 mismanagement. Nonetheless, in 1988 indications emerged that
 the long economic decline may have bottomed out, and some
 sectors, such as rubber, were expanding. Seventeen U.S.
 government-funded financial experts were assigned to positions
 within the Government with operational responsibility to
 improve management of government finances. Although this
 project met with some successes, it was terminated at the end
 of the year due to continuing dissatisfaction about the level
 of extra-budgetary revenues and expenditures.
 The trend towards improved human rights observance since the
 resumption of civilian rule in 1986 was set back in 1988 by
 several adverse developments. The independent press has grown
 bolder in its reporting and editorial content, but the
 Government countered in April by detaining several journalists
 and by suspending two independent newspapers and one party
 newsletter for articles critical of the Government. Political
 parties have been allowed to operate and propogate their views
 publicly. The ruling NDPL engaged opposition parties in
 discussions on possible power-sharing, but it did not give
 ground on a key issue in the political dialog--restructuring
 the Elections Commission (now controlled by President Doe's
 life-time appointees) which oversees the voting process.
 Within the military, better discipline has led to a decrease
 in incidents of harassment of civilians. The Government's
 response to two new coup attempts was relatively restrained
 (there were no outbursts of officially tolerated violence as
 in November 1985). However, several of the alleged
 conspirators, including Nicholas Podier, former Vice Head of
 State, died under unexplained circumstances while in
 government custody. Others detained in 1988, including
 
 
 178
 LIBERIA
 William Kpoleh, former presidential candidate of the defunct
 Liberian Unification Party, and two American citizens, were
 held for weeks without charge and without access to legal
 counsel. Events leading to the trial of Kpoleh and nine
 others raised serious questions about the administration of
 justice and executive branch willingness to respect the
 independence of the judiciary. The NDPL-controlled
 legislature, which has shown signs of assertiveness in
 reviewing appointments and international agreements,
 acquiesced, almost without debate, in an amendment to drop the
 constitutional limitation on two terms for the Presidency.
 The Government also hit at the right of association by banning
 all student organizations and continuing restrictions on
 worker rights to unionize.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 In two separate incidents in 1988, persons linked with alleged
 coup attempts against the Government died under questionable
 circumstances. In March the leader of an alleged plot to
 assassinate President Doe and overthrow the Government died in
 a fall from the sixth-floor balcony of the executive mansion,
 reportedly while being interrogated regarding his role in the
 plot. The Government reported the death as a suicide. In
 July the Government announced that a group of 11 foreign-based
 dissidents, led by Nicholas Podier, former Vice Head of State,
 had infiltrated the country and been intercepted by security
 forces in Nimba County. The Government claimed that several,
 including Podier, were killed in a firefight, but it is
 generally believed that they had been captured and summarily
 executed. Three of the infiltrators, including two Americans,
 were charged with treason. They were released in November
 after writing a letter to President Doe apologizing for their
 involvement with Podier.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There were no reports of officially conducted torture in
 1988. However, brutality by police and other security
 officials during the arrest and questioning of individuals is
 fairly common, and there have been no evident government
 efforts to halt this practice. In July Liberian security
 personnel reportedly beat and confiscated the property of
 several dozen Sierra Leonean nationals resident in Monrovia,
 many of whom were later deported for immigration violations.
 The beatings and deportations occurred following an altercation
 in a Monrovia bar frequented by Sierra Leoneans which resulted
 in the death of a Liberian soldier. The Sierra Leonean
 Government formally protested the mistreatment of its citizens
 at the hands of Liberian authorities.
 Prison conditions, which have been bad for decades, did not
 improve in 1988. Cells are often small and without light or
 ventilation. Food, exercise opportunities, and sanitary
 facilities are grossly inadequate. The maximum security
 
 
 179
 LIBERIA
 prison at Belle Yella in remote Lofa County is notorious for
 its brutal regimen. There have been unconfirmed allegations
 of deaths in recent years at Belle Yella due to starvation,
 lack of medical treatment, and mistreatment by prison guards.
 Because most of the prisoners are held incommunicado, these
 allegations cannot be confirmed. Several recent detainees at
 the Barclay Training Center (BTC) post stockade in Monrovia,
 which is located in the middle of a military facility, have
 described appalling sanitary conditions at the prison,
 including cells befouled through lack of proper sanitary
 facilities. Although the Constitution states that civilians
 may not be confined in any military facility, this provision
 is frequently ignored.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Although police are supposed to have a warrant for arrests,
 and persons should be charged or released within 48 hours,
 these constitutional provisions are frequently ignored in
 practice, particularly in cases involving alleged security
 threats or violations. In March 10 persons arrested in
 connection with an alleged assassination/coup plot were held
 for 2 weeks before being charged with treason. From April
 through August they were held at the BTC post stockade without
 access to family or legal counsel. Five journalists accused
 of publishing articles to which the Government took exception
 were detained without formal charge for several days in April.
 In July the Government detained at least five persons for
 alleged involvement in the Podier "invasion." Three, including
 two American citizens who were allegedly captured with Podier,
 were held for 7 weeks before being charged with treason. Two
 others, said to be assisting the Government in its
 investigation, remain in custody. A Liberian, who is
 reportedly related to a prominent political exile, was
 questioned and detained shortly after returning to Liberia.
 carrying a large sum .of money. He was later transferred to
 Belle Yella prison, where he is still being held without
 charge. The Government has disregarded two separate legal
 writs filed by his lawyers asking that the judiciary rule on
 the legality of his detention.
 In many cases, prolonged detention of persons without charge
 occurs as a result of judicial inefficiency and administrative
 neglect. Reports surface from time to time that many of those
 in Liberian prisons have been "forgotten" by the judicial
 system and continue to remain in prison although they have
 never been tried.
 Charges of short-term detention as a means of harassment were
 raised in the. case of former Chief Justice Chea Cheapoo,
 cocounsel for a number of treason defendants, when he was
 arrested shortly before he was to appear in court for a
 pretrial hearing. He was not allowed to participate in the
 hearings but was released shortly thereafter.
 In March the Justice Minister provoked a brief national debate
 over the legal rights of detained persons when he called for
 an amendment to the Constitution to restrict due process. A
 constitutional amendment was subsequently proposed in the
 legislature to restrict the right of habeas corpus in certain
 circumstances. The legislature adjourned in July without
 taking action on the bill.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.

 LIBERIA
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Liberia's civilian court system is based on Anglo-American
 jurisprudence and features similar judicial bodies, with the
 Supreme Court at its apex. The Constitution provides for
 public trials and states that there shall be no interference
 with the lawyer-client relationship. Nonetheless, the judicial
 system is often subject to manipulation, and reports of
 financial or political pressure on the courts are common.
 Despite constitutional provisions for separation of powers,
 the judiciary has a history of not challenging the wishes of
 the executive. Court orders are not always implemented by
 executive agencies. For example, in June prison authorities
 ignored a court order to transfer from a military to a civilian
 prison the 10 persons arrested in connection with the abortive
 March coup plot. When summoned to show cause for disregarding
 the court's order, the Justice and Defense Ministers
 successfully persuaded the court that the BTC post stockade is
 not a military facility, although they pledged to allow the
 defendants' lawyers and relatives access to the post stockade.
 One month later, when it became evident that authorities at
 the post stockade had not allowed such access, the court once
 again ordered the defendants transferred. This second order
 was executed-
 Persons have the right to legal counsel and to bail in
 noncapital offenses. When the accused is unable to secure his
 own lawyer, the court is required to provide legal services,
 although a lack of resources limits this practice to those
 accused of "serious" offenses. Litigants have the right to
 appeal. Traditional courts, presided over by tribal chiefs,
 are not bound by common law or conventional judicial
 principles; they apply customary and unwritten law to domestic
 and land disputes as well as petty crimes. These decisions
 may be reviewed in the statutory court system or appealed to a
 hierarchy of chiefs. Administrative review by the Ministry of
 Internal Affairs and, in some cases-, a final review by the
 President, may follow. Allegations of corruption and
 incompetence in the traditional courts are common--
 There were no known political prisoners in Liberia in 1988.
 However, among those arrested and tried in connection with the
 abortive March coup plot were William Gabriel Kpoleh, former
 standard-bearer of the now-defunct Liberian Unification Party,
 and Cephar Mabande, the former party's legal counsel. In a
 trial lasting 2 months, Kpoleh and the nine others received
 10-year sentences in October. The trial was open to the
 public, covered well in the- media, and the defendants, assisted
 by legal counsel, were able to make lengthy- statements in
 their behalf. However, the pretrial and trial handling point
 up many flaws in the Liberian justice system, e.g., prolonged
 detention without charge and without legal or family access
 for many months, executive branch defiance of court orders,
 detention of civilians in military facilities, and jury
 irregularities. At the end of 1988, the case was under appeal
 to the Supreme Court.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Although the political and military leadership demonstrated a
 heightened sensitivity to problems arising out of military
 indiscipline, military harassment and intimidation of civilians
 remained a continuing problem, reflecting a general lack of
 professionalism among poorly paid enlisted men. This surfaced
 
 
 181
 LIBERIA
 in random shakedowns of civilians and arbitrary interrogations
 which, in some instances, resulted in violence. In January a
 soldier killed a latrine worker in Monrovia following a petty
 dispute. In June five soldiers injured two civilians in a
 land dispute. The persons responsible for these two incidents
 were promptly identified and action taken against them. The
 soldier responsible for killing the latrine worker was
 discharged and turned over to competent civilian authorities
 for prosecution, but by the end of the year it was unclear
 whether charges had been filed against him. The soldiers who
 wounded the civilians were disciplined by military
 authorities--all were given 1 month at hard labor, and one was
 reduced in rank and ordered to pay medical expenses for the
 victims.
 Interference by civil and military authorities in the lives of
 ordinary citizens occurs on a wider scale in rural areas,
 where these local officials wield considerable power over
 day-to-day activities of people and proper police and judicial
 procedures are less likely to be followed.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and the Press
 The Constitution includes provisions for freedom of expression,
 including freedom of speech and of the press, but also
 stipulates that persons be held "fully responsible for the
 abuse" of this right. Decree 88a, passed by the military
 government in 1984, declares the spread of "rumors, lies, and
 disinformation" to be a felony. Although this decree is
 widely believed to be unconstitutional, it has not been
 revoked or challenged in court and is therefore technically
 still in force. Gove&rnment authorities have not invoked the
 decree in the past 4 years, and no one has ever been convicted
 of a violation of it.
 The Liberian press is lively, and, despite some degree of
 self-censorship, opposition viewpoints are presented, even on
 government radio and television. All media refrain from
 direct attacks on the President and certain other senior
 government officials. As many as seven independent newspapers
 appeared in Monrovia in 1988, though seldom did more than five
 publish on any given day. The one government-controlled
 newspaper appears irregularly.
 Although the last few yearp have witnessed a general
 improvement in the quantity and breadth of discourse on
 national issues, this trend suffered some significant
 reversals in 1988. In February the Government suspended
 publication of one party newsletter after it reprinted
 articles from an exile publication originating in the United
 States calling for "mass action" to undermine the current
 Government. Following what the Government considered to be
 critical reporting on the coup attempt in March, the
 Government put economic pressure on several independent
 newspapers by shutting off their utilities and discontinuing
 government advertising. In April the Government suspended the
 independent newspapers The Sun Times and Footprints Today.
 The Sun Times had published information concerning the arrest
 of a person bearing arms and explosives and an unrelated story
 concerning the replacement of the commander of the Special
 Antiterrorist Unit (SATU), and had refused to reveal its
 sources for these stories when questioned by the Government
 about them. Footprints Today had printed a letter to the
 
 
 182
 LIBERIA
 editor by an author using a pseudonym accusing the Government
 of a variety of human rights violations. Five journalists
 from the two newspapers were detained and held without charge
 for several days in connection with the offending articles,
 and one of the journalists was dragged down a flight of
 stairs. The remaining independent press staged a 1-week
 "press blackout" to protest the newspaper suspensions and the
 Government's harassment. The two suspended newspapers have
 not been authorized to resume publication.
 The Press Union of Liberia (PUL) has spoken out publicly
 against the newspaper suspensions and other perceived
 government restrictions on journalists. For example, in July
 the PUL lodged a protest with the Government after security
 officials threatened one of its members when he refused to
 divulge the source of a news story. The PUL also continued to
 call for the revocation of Decree 88a as an undue restriction
 on freedom of speech and to object to mandatory official
 accreditation of journalists as a form of prior restraint. In
 October, after months of negotiations, the Government agreed
 to involve the PUL in the accreditation process, although it
 reserved to itself the right to accredit government-employed
 journalists.
 No foreign publications are officially banned. The magazine
 West Africa discontinued official sales in Liberia late in
 1985 after government officials confiscated incoming
 consignments of the publication reporting on the aborted
 November 1985 coup attempt. Individual copies, however,
 continue to circulate widely. The Minister of Information,
 Emanuel Bowier, announced in June that a Washington Post
 African correspondent would be denied press accreditation in
 the future, accusing him of biased reporting on Liberia.
 The government-controlled Liberianr Broadcasting System runs
 the only television station in Liberia and two radio stations
 which give priority to government news. The Government's
 rural communication network offers a combination of news,
 entertainment, and development information to otherwise
 isolated areas. Several religiously affiliated, polit-ically
 independent radio stations operate and report critically on
 local events, though their news programs are occasionally
 subject to government scrutiny. In April the Minister of
 Information, apparently disturbed by foreign news reports
 critical of Liberia, prohibited all radio stations from
 relaying or rebroadcasting British Broadcasting Corporation
 (BBC) and Voice of America programs over local airwaves.
 Since few Liberians own shortwave radios, this action cut off
 most Liberians from their only means of hearing unfiltered
 international news reports. Although the prohibition was
 later lifted for privately run stations, the official radio no
 longer relays the BBC's popular "Focus On Africa" news
 program. During the same time period, the official television
 station also temporarily restricted its use of U.S.-origin
 news programs supplied by the United States Information
 Agency's Worldnet.
 Academic freedom is limited. In August the Acting Secretary
 General of the opposition Liberia Action Party was dismissed
 from his position as associate professor at the University of
 Liberia after the university administration decreed that his
 partisan political activities were incompatible with his
 academic responsibilities. The dismissal came after the
 professor had joined other prominent Liberians in challenging
 the contention of a fellow professor, the principal speaker at
 
 
 183
 LIBERIA
 an official National Day ceremony, that multiparty government
 was contrary to African tradition.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The constitutional right to peaceful assembly and association
 is observed more often in urban areas than in rural areas. In
 1988 opposition groups conducted meetings and other
 organizational activities in the Monrovia area without
 interference from the Government. However, government
 authorities in the countryside often prohibit opposition
 groups from holding meetings within their jurisdictions. The
 superintendent of Lofa County banned all student political
 activities in his county in early 1988, and the Superintendent
 of Margibi County stated in July that political meetings held
 in his county must meet with his prior approval.
 Permits must be acquired for public marches and demonstrations;
 however, no political party or other group attempted to
 organize any significant demonstrations in 1988. A 1986
 Supreme Court ruling barred joint rallies and meetings of the
 collective opposition. Nonetheless, leaders of the various
 political groupings meet on an informal basis without
 government interference.
 The ruling NDPL party maintains a task force, composed of
 several hundred young men, which opposition parties claim
 exists for the sole purpose of harassing and intimidating
 political opponents. After a number of violent confrontations
 with opposition members in recent years, the NDPL task force
 kept a low profile in 1987-88 and was not implicated in any
 significant incidents. Gabriel Swope, a Methodist minister,
 claimed that he was abducted, beaten, and held for 5 hours by
 unidentified persons in June. However, a subsequent
 investigation by the Methodist Church in Liberia revealed no
 evidence that Swope had been abducted as claimed. The Church
 subsequently placed Swope on a mandatory 2-year leave of
 absence.
 Although there is no formal policy requiring government
 employees to join the NDPL, they are sometimes pressured to
 become members. The Government is initiating a check-off
 system for party dues to be deducted from civil servants'
 paychecks. Civil servants who are members of opposition
 parties are sometimes asked to resign their party, membership
 if they wish to keep their jobs.
 In late August, President Doe issued Executive Decree Number
 Two which banned all student political organizations, including
 the Liberian National Student Union. The move came in the
 wake of numerous incidents of student unrest throughout the
 country, including one in which soldiers shot at demonstrators,
 killing one school employee and wounding two students. Eleven
 student leaders at the University of Liberia who signed a
 leaflet protesting the ban were expelled from the university
 and charged with disorderly conduct for allegedly fomenting
 student unrest. The University administration later suspended
 14 more students, whom it described as ringleaders of the
 student protests against the ban. In mid-September the
 Government detained 21 students for questioning regarding an
 unexplained explosion on the university campus. The students
 were arrested in a church while meeting with national church
 leaders who had volunteered to mediate the students* dispute
 with the Government. Most of the 21 students were released
 
 
 184
 LIBERIA
 shortly after arrest, but 9 of them were held for 2 weeks,
 without charge, before being released.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution states that freedom of religion is a
 fundamental right of all Liberian citizens. There are no
 restrictions on the practice of religion in Liberia. No
 religion has preference over any other, and there is no
 established state religion.. Christianity, brought by
 19th-century settlers and spread through the interior by
 missionaries, has long been the religion of the political and
 economic elite. The majority of the rural population continues
 to practice traditional religions. Approximately 25 percent
 of the population is Muslim. The Liberian Council of Churches,
 an organization comprising most of the Christian denominations
 in Liberia, occasionally plays a prominent role in national
 affairs.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution provides every person the right to move
 freely throughout Liberia and to leave or enter the country at
 any time. Domestic movement is still impeded by a network of
 internal checkpoints. The number of such checkpoints was
 decreased sharply in late 1987 but rose again following the
 alleged coup plots in March and July. Police and military
 personnel at these checkpoints routinely search vehicles and
 often solicit bribes from passengers.
 Exit visas are required for all Liberians leaving the country.
 These are routinely issued after applicants demonstrate that
 they have paid outstanding taxes and utility bills. The
 Government has denied a passport to a prominent Liberian
 dissident living in the United States, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf.
 Otherwise, there were no reported restrictions on the foreign
 travel of Liberians in 1988.
 Refugees are not forced to return to the countries from which
 they have fled. In a few cases in recent years, however, the
 Government sought to deport refugees who became involved
 locally in political activities.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Despite universal suffrage and constitutional guarantees of
 free and fair ele_.tions, Liberian citizens are not free in
 practice to change their government democratically. The
 Liberian Government is structured along the lines of the
 American model, with three separate but equal branches of
 government, including a bicameral legislature. In practice,
 the executive branch, and the President in particular, has a
 disproportionate share of power. Furthermore, many officials
 from the former military government, which also was headed by
 President Doe, still hold positions of authority in the
 current civilian Government.
 The legislature (Senate 26 seats, House of Representatives 62
 seats) is still subject to inordinate executive influence.
 For example, in 1988 the legislature revived a Liberian
 
 
 185
 LIBERIA
 tradition of proclaiming the President's birthday as a
 national holiday, with celebrations to be hosted by a
 different county each year. To fund the 1988 celebrations,
 1 month's pay was deducted from the salary of each of the host
 county's employees. However, the legislature has shown a
 willingness to assert its constitutional prerogatives in some
 cases. In 1988 the Senate subjected several presidential
 nominees to intensive questioning, in some cases demanding
 personal financial records, and rejected the nomination of one
 county commissioner. Several major bills sponsored by the
 administration were pigeonholed by the legislature, including
 one which would have restricted the right of habeas corpus.
 The Senate has also established a recognized role in reviewing
 international agreements. Members of both Houses actively
 pursue constituents' interests with officials of the executive
 branch. Opposition parties continue to boycott the
 legislature; however, a group of legislators, elected in 1985
 on opposition tickets but taking seats as independents, has
 formed a caucus and functions as an informal opposition party.
 The Constitution provides for an Elections Commission to
 monitor all political activities in the country. The
 elections law empowers the Commission to certify parties,
 conduct all elections, and count election ballots. The five
 commission members are appointed by the Executive for life and
 are former members of the ruling NDPL. Citing the widespread
 fraud that occurred during the 1985 elections, the opposition
 has called for an independent vote-counting mechanism. No
 elections for public office were due in Liberia in 1988;
 national elections are next scheduled for 1991.
 In July the legislature passed legislation to remove the
 provisions of the Constitution limiting the President to two
 terms in office. The measure must now be ratified in a
 national referendum to be held sometime after July 1989. The
 three opposition parties publicly criticized the legislature
 for passing the amendment without public debate and indicated
 that they will oppose its adoption.
 The Constitution prohibits creation of a one-party state.
 Four political parties are officially recognized by-the
 Elections Commission--the NDPL, the United Peoples Party
 (UPP), the Liberia Action Party, and the Unity Party. The
 level of activity of the three opposition parties varies, but
 in the last 2 years each has held conventions or other large
 party gatherings, published party newsletters, and expressed
 its views freely in the press and at public forums. Since the
 disputed election of October 1985, only the UPP has
 participated in electoral politics.
 Women hold high positions in the Cabinet (Minister of Health
 and Social Welfare, and of Posts and Telecommunications), in
 the legislature (one seat in the Senate, four in the House),
 in the parties, and in the judiciary.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In recent years the Government has permitted representatives
 of various organizations, including Amnesty International (AI)
 and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), to
 visit Liberia to investigate alleged human rights violations.
 It did not, however, as far as is known, respond to inquiries
 in 1988 from AI, the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, and
 
 
 186
 LIBERIA
 the National Press Club of Washington concerning various human
 rights developments in the country.
 Although no Liberian organizations currently exist for the
 express purpose of monitoring human rights developments, the
 Press Union of Liberia and the Liberian Council of Churches
 have spoken out actively on human rights issues in recent
 years. The Liberian Red Cross routinely visits prison
 facilities, mostly in the Monrovia area, and in 1988 was
 permitted for the first time in recent memory to carry medical
 and sanitary supplies to the isolated maximum security prison
 at Belle Yella.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution states that "only persons who are Negroes or
 of Negro descent" shall qualify by birth or naturalization to
 be citizens of Liberia. The Constitution further states that
 only Liberian citizens can own real property. These provisions
 discriminate against many nonblack residents who were born in
 Liberia and consider it their home. Otherwise, there is no
 officially sanctioned discrimination on the basis of race,
 sex, religion, language, or social status. However, members
 of President Doe's Krahn ethnic group hold a disproportionate
 share of high posts in the Government and military and are
 widely believed to be given preference in competing for lower
 level jobs.
 The status of women varies by region. In urban areas and
 along the coast, women can inherit land and property. In
 interior areas, where traditional ties are stronger, a woman
 is normally considered the property of her husband and his
 clan and is not usually entitled to inherit from her husband.
 In newly urban areas, many women are subject to both customary
 and statutory legal systems. Female circumcision is widely
 practiced by those Liberians who follow traditional religions.
 Women in Liberia are active in the professions throughout the
 modern economy but remain underrepresented in most jobs in the
 wage economy. The death under suspicious circumstances of a
 well-known Liberian woman in 1988 focused attention on police
 failure to investigate properly rapes, which are not commonly
 prosecuted in Liberia. The death also prompted public
 discussion of sexual harassment on the job, societal acceptance
 of rape, and the role of women in Liberian society generally.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The Constitution guarantees workers the right to associate in
 trade unions. Over 20 labor unions are registered with the
 Ministry of Labor, representing roughly 15 percent of the
 monetary sector work force. Ten national unions are members
 of the Liberian Federation of Labor Unions (LFLU), an affiliate
 of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 Although organized labor has not historically had great
 influence in national politics, in recent years it has begun
 to assert itself on issues affecting workers' interests.
 In 1987, for example, several labor unions joined with the
 opposition political parties in lobbying against a bill which
 would have enjoined civil servants from membership in
 political parties. The legislature has not yet taken final
 action on the bill. Labor unions are constitutionally
 prohibited from participation in party politics.
 
 
 LIBERIA
 The Labor Ministry began an investigation into LFLU's May
 elections when some labor leaders disputed the results, but
 the National Labor Court ordered an end to the investigation,
 noting that complaints about the elections must first be filed
 with the LFLU Executive Board, and then with the National
 Labor Court. The Labor Ministry appealed this ruling, but no
 decision had been rendered by the end of 1988.
 PRC (People's Redemption Council) Decree 12 outlawing strikes
 and any other type of labor unrest is still in effect and is
 enforced. In January a special Presidential Commission
 recommended that the Government suspend the entire leadership
 of the Bong Mine Workers Union for instigating an illegal
 strike in December 1987. Although the Government did not take
 direct action against the union leaders, the union's own shop
 stewards suspended the union leaders from office for alleged
 maladministration. Many observers saw the hand of the
 Government behind the shop stewards' action. In July the
 Government ordered that the suspended union officials also be
 suspended from their company jobs pending the resolution of a
 court case brought against them by the shop stewards. Most
 Bong mine workers went on strike but returned to work after 9
 days in the face of a presidential deadline to resume work or
 be dismissed.
 The International Labor Orgaization (ILO) Committee of Experts
 has noted discrepancies between various provisions of Liberian
 legislation and ILO conventions. The Committee has urged the
 Government to adopt the new labor code now before the Liberian
 legislature, which would repeal many of the objectionable
 provisions.
 At present, the Government does not recognize the right of
 civil servants or employees of public corporations to unionize
 or to strike. Many such employees, including teachers and
 port workers, are represented by employee associations which,
 unlike unions, have no authority to bargain collectively.
 These associations represent worker interests with government
 or management.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 With the exception of civil servants and employees of public
 corporations, all workers have the right to organize and
 bargain collectively. There were no reports of direct
 government interference in union organizing activities in
 1988. The Government promotes union/management negotiations
 and sometimes provides mediation for disputes arising out of
 such negotiations. An export processing zone operates in the
 area of the Monrovia free port. Workers and employees there
 are subject to the same labor laws as those employed in the
 rest of the economy.
 The ILO Committee of Experts has noted that current labor
 legislation provides insufficient guarantees against antiunion
 discrimination.
 c. Prohibition'of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution prohibits forced labor, and the practice is
 firmly condemned by the Government. The ILO Committee of
 Experts has raised questions about the effective enforcement
 of the prohibition of forced labor, particularly on rural
 community development projects, and the measures taken to
 eliminate it. In a broader context, the Government has

 LIBERIA
 indicated that the draft labor law will provide for penal
 sanctions in cases of illegal exaction of forced or compulsory
 labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The law prohibits employment of children under the age of 16
 during school hours. Enforcement is difficult, though, since
 many children are engaged in subsistence farming and only a
 minority ever attend school.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Labor Law provides for a minimum wage, paid leave,
 severance benefits, and safety standards. The minimum wage
 for agricultural workers is $2 per day. Industrial workers
 generally receive three or four times this amount. The
 minimum wages would not, alone, be sufficient to provide a
 decent standard of living for a worker and his family, but
 many families supplement their earnings through some
 subsistence farming, multiple wage earners, and/or support
 through an extended family system. The maximum hours of work
 which an employer can require are 8 hours per day or 48 hours
 per week. Safety standards are not rigorously enforced. A
 new national pension scheme was implemented in 1988 in which
 most workers and employers will be required to participate.
