 KENYA
 Kenya has been a single-party state since 1982. The
 President, Daniel arap Moi, exercises firm control over both
 the Government and the party, the Kenyan African National
 Union (KANU). Since the attempted August 1, 1982, coup, KANU
 has become a more powerful vehicle for political maneuvering
 and persuasion, especially following the recent 'purge' of
 longstanding KANU members alleged to have been disloyal to the
 Government or presidency. To date 17 people have been
 expelled from the party (15 during 1984), making-them
 ineligible for public office. President Moi has also directed
 that effective January 1, 1985, all Kenyan civil servants must
 be party members. Within the evolving one-party system, there
 is still considerable competition for parliamentary seats. In
 the September 1983 elections, over 900 candidates competed for
 258 seats.
 The President also consolidated political power in 1984, in
 part through his balancing of ethnic groupings. The lengthy
 judicial hearing into the alleged wrongdoing of former
 Constitutional Affairs Minister Charles Njonjo, himself a
 Kikuyu, has had the effect of accentuating the Kikuyu-versus-
 non-Kikuyu split. Njonjo was removed from office in 1983 and
 accused of acts of treason against the Government, bribery,
 corruption, consorting with 'enemy powers,* and exhibiting
 personal disloyalty to the President. The published findings
 of the commission of inquiry listed a number of acts for which
 Njonjo might have been jailed. However, on December 12,
 Kenya's National Day, President Moi issued a full pardon to
 Njonjo, although the defendant had never been convicted of any
 crime.
 In 1984, Kenyan security and military forces became involved
 in several major border incidents. In February 1984
 Government troops allegedly killed several hundred ethnic
 Somali tribesmen while attempting to restore order in the
 turbulent Northeast Province. The Government publicly
 acknowledged its error although it maintains only 57 people
 were killed. Kenyan troops also supported Ugandan forces
 against Pokot and Karamajong warriors in eastern Uganda in
 March and April 1984.
 Kenya's fragile economy is experiencing a series of difficult
 problems: the most serious drought in its history; steadily
 rising unemployment (400,000 job seekers after at best 20,000
 new jobs each year); a population rapidly expanding at over
 4 percent a year; and inefficient public corporations which
 control prices and distribution of major commodities.
 Moreover, a trend towards disinvestment may be emerging. At
 year's end the number of U.S. firms represented in Nairobi was
 approximately 125, down from 130 in 1983. Weak sales
 prospects in Kenya and East Africa regionally appear to be the
 principal reason for the declining foreign presence and
 investment.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Kenya does not sanction or practice unlawful or arbitrary
 deprivation of life and there were no reports of political
 killings in 1984.
 
 
 164
 KENYA
 b. Disappearance
 The Government does not sanction or practice secret arrests,
 abductions, or other types of disappearances. However, the
 authorities have not been able to prevent the frequently
 reported kidnapping of Ugandan refugees by Ugandan
 intelligence operatives in Nairobi. Apparently, most of these
 abducted persons are forced to return to Uganda, where they
 are jailed without trial. In April 1984, the United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) called the matter to
 the attention of senior Kenyan officials, but still reports of
 incidents continued throughout 1984.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is specifically forbidden under the Kenyan
 Constitution, and allegations that Kenyan authorities use
 torture are usually investigated. However, actions by
 security forces in the Northeast Province in February 1984
 resulted in extensive killings. Responding to fighting
 between Degodia tribesmen over water rights, the army and
 police used excessive force in reestablishing order and
 reportedly, in the process, subjected tribesmen to
 humiliation and torture. The Government admitted that some
 officials "had exceeded their instructions' and subsequently
 dismissed the Provincial Commissioner. A report of the
 investigation has not been published, but the Government
 claimed there were 57 deaths, not the hundreds first
 reported. In 1982, the Government utilized, for the first
 time since President Moi assumed office in 1978, the
 Preservation of Public Security Act, which includes
 regulations superseding constitutional safeguards. Por
 example, persons formally detained under the provisions of the
 Act are held in solitary confinement, where they are allowed
 almost no contact with the outside world, including their
 attorneys or families. Amnesty International in its 1984
 report expressed concern over poor prison conditions and
 treatment of detainees.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Preservation of Public Security Act empowers the state to
 undertake, without reference to the judiciary, detenticn
 without trial for an unlimited period, or other actions to
 control the activities of individuals which would otherwise be
 regarded as lawful. Since resuming the practice of detention
 in 1982, the Government has formally detained or restricted 13
 persons under the Act. Ten were released in 1984. Many other
 Kenyans have been held without being formally detained or
 charged. Current detainees include a journalist and Kenya's
 former deputy director of intelligence.
 Aside from the unprecedented circumstances created by the
 attempted coup in August 1982, however, habeas corpus has
 generally been available in Kenya. Kenyan law requires that
 persons charged with crimes be brought biweekly before
 judicial authorities in public court to ensure that
 investigations are carried out in a timely manner and that
 prisoners are not mistreated. Approximately 5,000 prisoners,
 jailed for minor offenses, were released by presidential
 pardon in 1984.

 KENYA
 e. Denial of Pair Public Trial
 The judiciary usually exhibits considerable independence but,
 in cases involving detention under the Preservation of Public
 Security Act, its authority is limited to ensuring compliance
 with procedural provisions only. Aside from public security
 detention cases, the right to a fair public trial is usually
 observed in Kenya. Civilians are tried in civilian courts
 and, in all cases, verdicts may be appealed to the Kenyan high
 court.
 Military personnel are tried by military courts and verdicts
 may be appealed. Most sentences meted out as a result of the
 August 1982 coup attempt either have been reduced or
 suspended. No executiond of persons allegedly involved in the
 coup attempt have been carried out. An Amnesty International
 observer attended three of the six student trials in 1983 and
 reported that the proceedings appeared to have been conducted
 in accordance with internationally recognized standards. More
 than 60 university students had been arrested in August 1982
 following the coup attempt; all but six were granted
 presidential clemency in February 1983.
 The major judicial event in 1984 was the inquiry into the
 official conduct of the former Minister of Constitutional
 Affairs, Charles Njonjo, a leading Kikuyu and former close
 associate of the President. Njonjo was removed from office in
 1983 and accused of treason and corruption. After many months
 and 109 judicial review sessions, amid much publicity, the
 judicial inquiry ended soon after Njonjo took the witness
 stand in his own defense. Despite a commission of inquiry
 finding that Njonjo had committed jailable offenses, he was
 not brought to trial, and on December 12 he was given a full
 presidential pardon.
 Members of the press regularly attend and report on court
 proceedings whether civilian or military, as in the Njonjo
 case and the proceedings after the August 1982 coup attempt.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The sanctity of the home is generally respected in Kenya, but
 security officials sometimes do conduct unwarranted or illegal
 searches to seize allegedly stolen property or apprehend
 suspected criminals.
 Correspondence with prisoners is monitored, censored, and
 frequently not delivered. Security officials are invariably
 present when prisoners or detainees consult with family
 members or attorneys. Reportedly, security forces
 occasionally employ surveillance techniques and electronic
 invasion of the home.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and the press are proclaimed in the
 Constitution. In practice, however, these freedoms can be,
 and have been, narrowly interpreted by Kenyan authorities
 (e.g., during the 1983 election campaign candidates were
 prohibited from discussing the Charles Njonjo "traitor affair"
 in public). The existence and use of the detention provisions
 
 
 166
 KENYA
 of the Preservation of Public Security Act inhibit public
 exchange of views on political subjects. Kenya has no formal
 censorship of the local press, but government pressure has in
 the past been brought to bear on journalists and publications
 which stray too far from the government line. Official party
 daily newspapers in English and Kiswahili were established in
 1983, thus tacitly reducing the leeway available to other
 publications in discussing public issues.
 The September 19, 1984, issue of the London Financial Times,
 which included a supplement on Kenya, was not permitted into
 the country, probably because the Government did not concur
 with items appearing in the publication.
 The Government also discourages students and faculty from
 political activism. However, three university lecturers,
 formally detained prior to the August 1, 1982 coup attempt,
 were released from custody in 1984. Kenya's institutions of
 higher education were closed immediately following the coup
 attempt and were reopened only on October 3, 1983.
 Kenya has a 30-member film censorship board under the auspices
 of the Ministry of Culture and Social Services. The board
 must approve all films shown in Kenya, but a wide variety of
 uncut foreign films is regularly available. A 10-member
 television censorship board has established precepts which
 govern what can be shown on television.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although the Kenyan Constitution formally sanctions freedom of
 assembly and association, these rights are sometimes limited
 by the Public Order and Police Act, which gives local
 administrative authorities wide powers to control public
 gatherings. It is an offense to convene an unlicensed
 meeting, and politicians known to be at odds with central
 authorities have been investigated for violations of this
 statute. Nonetheless, licenses for public meetings are rarely
 denied, and then usually on the grounds that the proposed
 meeting might generate civil disorder. The Government
 occasionally has prevented political, religious, and social
 meetings under the Societies Act.
 Forced membership in political organizations is not
 practiced. Candidates for public office, however, must be
 members of the party. According to a recent presidential
 directive, all civil servants must also be party members
 effective January 1985.
 Kenya has a relatively free trade union movement. Its single
 trade union confederation, the Central Organization of Trade
 Unions, is affiliated with the Ghana-based, continent-wide,
 Organization of African Trade Union Unity. Complex labor
 legislation renders virtually all strikes illegal. Strikes
 are permitted only if the Ministry of Labor has not taken
 action within 21 days after the formal declaration of a
 dispute to have it resolved. The only major strike in the
 past decade occurred in February 1984, when Nairobi's 8,000
 woodworkers went on a one-week strike, which was quickly
 mediated by the Ministry of Labor. Wildcat strikes of no more
 than a day or two in length are quite common. Most disputes,
 bowever, are settled by the parties concerned. Kenya's
 dispute mechanism is centered in the Industrial Relations
 Court, founded in 1964.   All Kenyan wage earners are subject
 
 
 167
 KENYA
 to Government regulations limiting wage increases.
 Nevertheless, some unions have had notable success in
 obtaining salary adjustments for union members by filing
 litigation before the Industrial Court. Some unions have also
 obtained significant additional worker benefits, such as
 expanded health insurance coverage and increased housing
 allowances. All collective agreements must be approved by the
 Industrial Court before they can take effect. The Court has
 since become the model for several other such labor courts in
 Africa. Although the Court's case load has risen
 significantly over the years, it still dispenses justice
 quickly and fairly.
 In August 1980, the Government formally disbanded the Kenyan
 Civil Servants Union (at that time Kenya's largest union)
 because of its alleged political activities. The Public
 Service International has continued to press for a genuine
 civil servants' union, given Kenya's membership in the
 International Labor Organization and its having signed the
 Convention on the Right to Organize and Collective
 Bargaining. In December 1984, President Moi announced that a
 civil servants association could be formed, but under
 government guidelines.
 All permanent workers in private enterprise of at least seven
 persons may be organized into trade unions. Approximately
 three-quarters of all such enterprise employees are unionized,
 and about half (300,000) pay voluntary union dues. Unions
 actually represent a greater number in collective bargaining
 because non-union workers are covered by collective agreements
 negotiated for their enterprise. Agreements are usually of
 two years' duration. A few professional voluntary
 organizations, such as the Law Society of Kenya (i.e., the
 Kenyan bar association), exist, but such associations do not
 conduct themselves as trade unions.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 A wide range of religious freedoms exists in Kenya, and
 freedom of worship is protected by the Constitution. However,
 the Government has often criticized church officials for
 meddling in politics and can refuse to register any religious
 society or group which it believes may pursue activities
 harmful to public security. The Church of Jesus Christ of
 Latter-Day Saints (Mormons) has been trying without success to
 obtain registration under the Societies Act for the past three
 years. The Government has not registered any churches during
 that period, but it has not interfered with Mormon meetings.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Preservation of Public Security Act provides for the legal
 restriction of movement within Kenya of persons considered to
 be a danger to public security. Between October 1982 and
 October 1983, Oginga Odinga, former Vice President and a
 leading politician known for his outspoken opposition to the
 central Government, was restricted (first to his city, and
 then to his home) under this Act.
 Following the August 1, 1982, coup attempt, the Kenyan
 Government expanded bureaucratic requirements necessary for
 travel abroad. These additional hurdles have had a negative
 
 40-387 0 - 85 - 12
 
 
 168
 KENYA
 impact upon study and research opportunities abroad for Kenyan
 university students and faculty. Kenya does not, however,
 formally prohibit emigration of its nationals. Kenyan
 citizens may not travel to the Republic of South Africa.
 Although Kenya suffers from high and increasing unemployment,
 it continues to accept refugees. During 1984, Kenya's
 official refugee population increased by approximately 25
 percent to about 7,400 documented resident refugees. Of
 these, over 90 percent are Ethiopian, Ugandan, or Rwandan. In
 addition to those individuals who obtained official refugee
 status, between 3,000 and 10,000 additional persons have taken
 refuge in Kenya unofficially. The Government continues to
 work with the Nairobi office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR). Kenya also generally respects the right of
 voluntary repatriation, although there have been lengthy
 delays in granting repatriation permits to foreign-owned
 businesses.
 In addition to the problem of controlling cross-border
 abductions of Ugandans (see I b), a significant blot appeared
 on Kenya's otherwise good refugee record in the autumn of
 1983, when the Governments of Kenya and Tanzania forcibly
 repatriated some two dozen of their respective nationals who
 nad settled in each other's country as political refugees.
 Many ot the individuals had been recognized as refugees by
 both governments and the UNHCR. The exchange was viewed by
 some foreign governments and by the UNHCR as a violation of
 refugee rights and agreements. UNHCR officials made
 representations to the Kenyan and Tanzanian Governments.
 Subsequently, Kenyan officials indicated that such enforced
 repatriations would not occur again.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Chief of State, President Moi, supported by a small group
 of advisors, controls all aspects of policy-making and has
 increasingly consolidated political power, especially since
 the attempted coup of August 1, 1982. Kenya became a de jure
 one-party state on June 9, 1982, and, even though a wide range
 of candidates and views is generally permitted, elections have
 not been immune to Government manipulation. However, within
 the one-party system, campaigns and balloting are ordinarily
 conducted in a generally free, fair, and peaceful manner. The
 number of candidates for a particular public office is
 frequently a half dozen or more, and in the September 16,
 1983, general elections up to 15 candidates ran for a single
 parliamentary seat. Of the 995 persons who applied for KANU
 party clearance to run for Parliament, 992 were permitted to
 stand. Of these, roughly 700 ultimately had their names
 placed on the ballot.
 The Kenyan Government encourages but does not coerce the
 electorate to vote. Turnout has generally averaged between 60
 and 70 percent of the eligible electorate, but it fell to just
 42 percent in 1983.
 Incumbents are frequently voted out of office in Kenya. Since
 Kenya's independence in 1963, as many as 50 percent of the
 country's sitting parliamentarians have been defeated during a
 single election. Last year, the Kenyan electorate rejected
 approximately 35 percent of Kenya's incumbent
 
 
 169
 KENYA
 parliamentarians, including 5 ministers and 18 assistant
 ministers. It should be noted, however, that in Kenya's
 post-independence history neither the President nor the Vice
 President has ever faced an opposing candidate.
 President Moi has expanded tribal representation in the
 Government and legislature. Members of all ethnic groups are
 permitted to contest for office, and Kenya has one white
 Parliamentarian who was reelected in a constituency that is 99
 percent black African, despite the presence of several black
 African candidates on the ballot. Ten different tribes hold
 cabinet portfolios in the Government, including the first
 ethnic Somali ever appointed to ministerial rank in Kenya.
 Twenty tribes are represented among the 43 assistant ministers
 in the Government. The largest tribe, the Kikuyu (21 per cent
 of Kenya's 19.4 million), however, now claims that it is
 underrepresented in the political process.
 Only i female candidate was elected to Kenya's National
 Assembly in 1983, although several others contested, and
 President Moi appointed 2 women to Kenya's National Assembly
 in 1983 as nominated members (the Kenyan Constitution provides
 for 12 such presidential appointments). In addition, over 20
 female candidates were elected to municipal office.
 The range of permissible discussion of, and opposition to,
 government policies has been fairly broad within the National
 Assembly. However, discussion is increasingly focused on such
 subjects as rural development, as the Government reacts to
 limit parliamentary criticism of national policies. The
 formal detention in August 1982 of Koigi wa Wamwere, a sitting
 Member of Parliament who was openly and repeatedly critical of
 major government policies, exemplifies government sanction
 against critics. Wamwere was among the four prisoners
 released on December 12, 1984, who had been detained under the
 Preservation of Public Security Act.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government of Kenya is sensitive to criticism of human
 rights conditions. Various human rights organizations,
 including Amnesty International, have conducted extensive
 letter-writing campaigns to the Government with respect to
 Kenya's resort to the use of formal detention. Although the
 Government released five persons held under the Public
 Security Act in October 1983 and an additional four in 1984,
 Government officials have emphatically rejected the notion
 that foreign pressure had anything to do with their decision.
 President Moi has specifically and publicly criticized Amnesty
 International for "meddling' in Kenyan internal affairs.
 Although there are several Kenyan organizations which address
 certain aspects of human rights issues, there is no group
 which focuses exclusively on human rights concerns in Kenya.
 Kenya has neither signed nor ratified the Organization of
 African Unity's human rights charter which was adopted at the
 Organization's July 1981 summit in Nairobi.
 Freedom House rates Kenya 'partly free.'
 
 
 170
 KENYA
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Kenya has one of the most dynamic and successful economies in
 Africa with a highly developed private sector and, in most
 years, food self-sufficiency. The Kenyan Government has taken
 action to improve the country's health care, education, and
 standard of living, but recent economic difficulties,
 including an unprecedented drought, have retarded progress in
 these areas. Because of the food crisis, Kenya must import a
 record 1.5 million tons of grain before the end of 1985. Real
 per capita growth of gross national product ($391.50 in 1982)
 has been virtually stagnant over the last several years.
 Kenya's economic problems are exacerbated by an annual
 population growth rate of 4.2 percent--the highest in the
 world. The Government is stressing both the importance of the
 private sector and of increasing agricultural output. Yet its
 continued reliance on inefficient public corporations, which
 control major commodity prices and distribution, is an
 obstacle to achieving these goals.
 About one-quarter of Kenya's regular wage earner labor force
 works in agriculture, the sector paying the lowest wages.
 Significantly, however, only 1 million people (out of the 7.4
 million estimated to be in Kenya's workforce) are in the
 formal sector, i.e., the wage economy. Kenya's workforce in
 the year 2000 will number approximately 14.6 million, putting
 even greater strain on the country's society and economy.
 Approximately 85 percent of Kenya's 19.4 million people live
 in rural areas, and 10 percent of the urban population and 55
 percent of the rural population were estimated in 1978 to live
 below the poverty level. Western and Nyanza Provinces contain
 the largest numbers of the rural destitute population.
 Another looming economic and social problem concerns Kenya's
 70,000-member Asian community which directly accounts for
 approximately one-fourth of Kenya's total economic output.
 African resentment of Asians, primarily because of their
 extensive business holdings, has intensified in direct
 proportion to Kenya's current economic decline. Kenya's
 Africanization campaign to encourage black African
 participation in commercial interests has resulted in some
 Asian emigration and disinvestment and has prompted concern
 within the community for the security of Asian ownership.
 Women constitute an essential factor in Kenya's labor
 equation. They still provide about three-quarters of Kenya's
 farm labor while carrying out their traditional familial
 responsibilities. Because of an accelerating rural out-
 migration of males to the cities in search of difficult-to-find
 but higher paying jobs, female farm labor is likely to maintain
 its prominent position. Several of Kenya's tribes still
 practice female circumcision. The Kenyan Government, however,
 has made a major effort to eliminate the practice. President
 Moi has publicly and repeatedly condemned female circumcision,
 and the Ministry of Health has forbidden such operations to be
 performed in government facilities.
 Primary and secondary education are strongly encouraged in
 Kenya. The primary school enrollment ratio is 129.9 percent
 (1980), but secondary school enrollment rates drop sharply:
 of all students between ages 15 and 19, only 25 percent of
 males and 15 percent of females are enrolled in secondary
 school. About 2 percent of Kenya's college age population is
 
 
 171
 KENYA
 enrolled in institutions of higher education, and of these
 students only 25 percent are female.
 The considerable progress which Kenya made in health care in
 the early independence period has slowed in recent years.
 Life expectancy has risen steadily, however, from 42.5 years
 in 1960 to 57.7 in 1984. Concurrently, the infant mortality
 rate has steadily declined: in 1960 the rate was 150 per
 1,000, a figure which dropped to 83 by 1977 and now stands at
 60.9.
 Although the most recent data available (1975) indicate that
 virtually all city dwellers have access to clean water, only
 four percent of Kenya's rural population has regular access to
 safe water. Last available data (1977) on caloric consumption
 indicate that 93.4 percent of Kenya's minimal nutritional
 requirements are met. The current drought in all probability
 will reduce that percentage.
