 LUXEMBOURG
 Luxembourg is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary
 form of government. The Grand Duke is the Chief of State.
 Luxembourg has a highly developed, industrialized economy
 based on free enterprise, and its people have a high standard
 of living.
 Human rights are respected at home, and Luxembourg actively
 promotes human rights internationally. It continues efforts
 to treat its relatively large foreign population fairly and to
 engage labor unions in the industrial decisionmaking process.
 Residents of Luxembourg enjoy fair and efficient judicial and
 penal systems. Individual human rights are provided for by
 the Constitution and protected in practice.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Killing for political reasons has not taken place in
 Luxembourg. The mysterious bombings which occurred in 1985
 and 1986 were not repeated in 1987. These bombings ceased
 without any group claiming responsibility, and there is no
 evidence to link them to any terrorist group.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known abductions or hostage-taking cases.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by law and does not occur. Prisoners
 are treated fairly, have free choice of attorneys, are allowed
 visitors, and are housed in modern facilities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 Due process is provided for by law and observed in practice.
 Luxembourg law is a composite of local practice, legal
 tradition, and foreign systems--French, Belgian, and German.
 Any person detained by authorities must be charged no later
 than 24 hours after arrest. Preventive detention does not
 exist, but persons may be incarcerated pending trial, if so
 ordered by a judge. Exile is not imposed, nor is there forced
 labor.
 �e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Luxembourg's judiciary is independent and free from executive
 or military interference. Military courts exist, but civilians
 are not subject to their jurisdiction. The right of defendants
 to have legal counsel, at public expense if necessary, is
 assured. Charges are formally and clearly stated. Defendants
 have the right to be present at trial and are presumed innocent
 until proven guilty. There are no political prisoners.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Luxembourg law and customs are based on regard for personal
 freedom. The State, political organizations, and other
 organized entities do not arbitrarily intrude into the private
 lives of Luxembourg residents. Police must have a warrant,
 issued by the judiciary, to enter a private home. Statutes
 prohibit other violations of the home sUch as demolition, the
 sealing of doors and windows, and electronic surveillance.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and the press,
 and it is respected in practice. Except for restrictions on
 pornography, there is no censorship of the media. Opposition
 viewpoints are freely discussed, and criticism of the
 Government is tolerated. Academic freedom is respected.
 Print media are privately owned and controlled. The broadcast
 industry is privately owned, except for 4 percent which is
 indirectly controlled by the French Government. It operates
 independently from the Luxembourg Government. There were no
 incidents in 1987 of any group attempting to inhibit the free
 expression of opinion in Luxembourg.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association is assured
 constitutionally and respected in practice. There are no
 limitations on orderly public meetings. All groups enjoy the
 right of free assembly.
 Unions are independent of the Government and of political
 party control. They have the right to organize, negotiate,
 and strike, but strikes are rare. Unions participate in a
 tripartite arrangement with government and management in all
 decisions affecting the economy and worker welfare. The two
 largest industrial unions are linked to, but organized
 independently from, Luxembourg's Socialist Party and Christian
 Social Party respectively. A large percentage of the work
 force is unionized, but membership is not mandatory. Unions
 and professional groups maintain unrestricted contact with
 international bodies in their fields.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion in Luxembourg, and everyone is free
 to practice the religion of his choice. Statistically,
 Luxembourg is about 90 percent Roman Catholic. This faith is
 deeply intertwined with the conservative culture of the
 country; for example, there is no government funding for
 abortions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within the country
 (including changing residence or workplace), foreign travel,
 or emigration and repatriation. There are no barriers to
 immigrants from European Community (EC) countries, except for
 Greece, Spain, and Portugal. While these countries are in
 transition towards accession to the EC, their citizens must
 obtain work permits to reside in Luxembourg. Such work
 
 
 970
 LUXEMBOURG
 permits are readily obtained. Since 1970 Luxembourg has had a
 large Portuguese population. The status of Portuguese citizens
 in Luxembourg is defined by bilateral agreements and the terms
 of Portugal's accession to the EC in January 1986.
 Although Luxembourg is not a country of first application for
 refugees, government officials believe that on a per capita
 basis relatively large numbers (notably Vietnamese) have been
 admitted. Once admitted, refugees benefit from state social
 programs and are well treated.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Luxembourg's Government is democratically elected. All
 Luxembourg citizens 18 years of age and older may participate
 in national elections for the Chamber of Deputies, held every
 5 years, and local elections, held every 6 years. Voting is
 by secret ballot with multiple candidates for most positions.
 Luxembourg's large foreign population (26 percent) does not
 have the right to vote, although it enjoys the rights of free
 speech, assembly, movement, and religion. It may exert
 considerable influence on the political process indirectly by
 joining labor unions or other organizations. Opposition
 groups, including organized political parties, function openly
 and freely, without fear of government repression.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no requests for the investigation of human
 rights abuses in Luxembourg. The International Committee of
 the Red Cross, Amnesty International, and the U.N. High
 Commissioner for Refugees have representatives in Luxembourg.
 Luxembourg has consistently supported international and
 nongovernmental investigation of alleged human rights
 violations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination based on �he above factors is prohibited by
 law. Adequate food, shelter, health care, and education are
 available to all inhabitants regardless of race, religion,
 sex, ethnic background, or political opinion. Women in
 increasing numbers participate in the political and business
 communities of Luxembourg, although few women in Luxembourg
 are senior executives.
 CONDITIONS O LABOR
 The right to work is guaranteed to every Luxembourger by the
 Constitution. The employment of children under the age of 16
 is prohibited. The normal workweek is 40 hours, spread over 5
 days. Work on Sunday is generally prohibited, except in
 continuous process industries (steel-and chemical) and for
 certain persons such as maintenance and security personnel.
 Working conditions are exemplary.
 Worker representatives are required in all businesses of 15 or
 more erfiployees" In businesses with over 150 employees, 50
 percent of the joint works councils are elected by the
 employees. In businesses with more than 1,000 employees,
 
 
 971
 LUXEMBOURG
 one-third of the membership of the boards of directors must be
 employees or-their elected representatives.
 A safe working environment is mandated by law and enforced
 through a vigorous inspection system, which can impose severe
 penalties. Luxembourg's health and safety standards are among
 the highest in the world.
