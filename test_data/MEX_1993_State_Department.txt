 MEXICO
 Mexico is a federal republic with a president, a bicameral legislature, and a con-
 stitutionally independent judiciary. The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has
 won every presidential election since the party's founding in 1929, but in recent
 years andthrough democratic reform, the opposition has. steadily expanded its stake
 in he  oliica sste. Snceth  198 eectons opostio  patis have gained 180

 govenmets n 10perentof te mnicpaliies Thse ginsrefect increased abil-
 ty by the opposition to attract support and to organize tself, as well as the impact
 ofplitical reforms instituted by the administration of President Salinas. Neverthe-
 less, the PRI continued to dominate the Government through a combination of vot-
 ing strength, organizational power, access to resources not enjoyed by other political
 parties, and-in some elections--outright violations of electoral laws. September
 1993 changes in federal electoral law and practices were designed to make future
 elections more transparent and tamperproof.
 Mexican security forces, which include the military, federal and state judicial po-
 lice, federal highway police, and local police, are under the control of elected civilian
 officials. Despite progress made by the Salinas administration to curb human rights
 abuses, the security forces, in particular the police, continued to commit serious
 human rights violations in 1993.
 Mexico has a mixed economy that combines domestic market capitalism with
 some state ownership of major industries. Private property rights are protected by
 law. The Government's economic reform program was successful in reducing infla-
 tion and restoring both domestic and overseas investor confidence. However, there
 continued to exist serious disparities of income and areas of severe poverty. The
 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and the United
 States was signed in 1992 and won approval from the U.S., Mexican, and Canadian
 legislatures. It entered into force on January 1, 1994.
 Early in 1994, a primarily Indian group calling itself the Zapatista Army of Na-
 tional Liberation resorted to an armed uprising, initially taking control of four mu-
 nicipalities in the state of Chiapas, to protest what it regarded as government fail-
 ure to deal effectively with social and economic problems.
 In 1993 there continued to be widespread human rights abuses and a frequent
 failure to punish violators despite government efforts to do so. Important abuses in-
 cluded extrajudicial killings by the police, torture, illegal arrests, glaring prisn defi-
 ciencies, and extensive illegal child labor in the informal economy. The Government
 has made strong efforts to end the "culture of impunity" surrounding the security
 
 
 forces through reforms in the Office of the Attorney General (PGR), continued sup-
 port to the National Commission for Human Rights (CNDH), and establishment in
 993 of state-level commissions for human rights. These actions together with in-
 creased public awareness of human rights concerns have brought about a noticeable
 decline in the incidence of violations in Mexico.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-A number of political and human
 rights activists were killed in 1993, but a political motive was not clearly estab-
 lished in any of these killings. For example, on June 20 unknown assailants killed
 Amado Solomon Rodriguez, Campeche state leader of the opposition Party of Demo-
 cratic Revolution (PRM. The case was not solved, and there was conflicting evidence
 as to the possible motive.
 The focus remained on developments in the killings of political and human rights
 activists from past years, particularly the 1990 murder of human rights lawyer and
 professor Norma Corona, the 1988 disappearance and suspected murder of political
 activist Jose Ramon Garcia, the 1988 murders of Xavier Obando and Roman Gil,
 and the 1984 murder of journalist Manuel Buendia. In the Norma Corona case, po-
 lice commander Gonzalez Trevino remained on trial for the murder, despite the sub-
 sequent murders of six prosecution witnesses, several of whom were in police cus-
 tody at the time they were killed. Former National Security Director Jose Antonio
 Zorrilla Perez and four others were convicted and sentenced to 35 years in the
 Buendia killing. Two state attorneys general accused of killing Obando and Gil, and
 a former state police chief charged with Garcia's disappearance and murder, are in
 jail.
 The CNDH opened a special investigation into political violence, including
 killings, in 1993. There were 140 cases of violence against PRD members being in-
 vestigated, of which 90 concerned killings. Of the 140 cases, 67 resulted in rec-
 ommendations from the CNDH involving culpability by government authorities. In
 18 cases the CNDH did not find government authorities at fault. The CNDH con-
 cluded 22 cases for lack of additional information from the complainants, and 18
 cases fell outside the CNDH's juridical authority. Three cases were referred to other
 authorities, and six cases were incorporated into previously existing cases.
 The police and police auxiliaries, known as "madrinas," and to a lesser extent the
 army continued to be responsible for extrajudicial killings. A number of detainees
 and prisoners were killed while in police custody. Although many of these cases
 were being investigated by the CNDH, many were not fully prosecuted or the guilty
 parties punished. In Sonora, an auxiliary killed five civilians in an incident arising
 out of a traffic confrontation. Following an attempted coverup and an investigation,
 the auxiliary, a former Mexico City policeman dismissed for involvement in another
 murder, was charged with multiple homicides, transportation of illegal arms, and
 usurpation of functions. Two police commanders who attempted to cover up the
 killings were fired and charged with obstruction of justice. At year's end, all three
 remained on trial. Four other police officers, who knew of the coverup but did not
 report it, were dismissed but have not been charged with wrongdoing. Attorney Gen-
 eral Carpizo ended the practice of hiring police auxiliaries.
 There were a number of deaths of detainees and prisoners in police custody. The
 most prominent was the death in Guadalajara of an alleged member of the drug
 family identified with the May killing of Cardinal Posada and five others. Investiga-
 tions revealed that the drug family had been receiving police protection; a number
 of prominent police officials were charged with crimes as a result. The killing of the
 drug family member was ruled an accident by Jalisco state authorities, but local
 newspapers credibly claimed that it was an extrajudicial killing and openly mocked
 the fndings. One 1992 death of an American citizen in police custody, originally re-
 ported to the authorities as a suicide, has now been ruled a murder. A police officer
 was arrested and charged with murder; the trial continued at year's end.
 Killings of gayb and male prostitutes continued in the state of Chiapas. Press re-
 ports indicated that in 1992-93 at least 12 known homosexuals and 9 male pros-
 titutes were killed, most with high-calibre firearms. At year's end, the police had
 solved none of these murders, and gay rights advocates charged they were making
 little, if any, effort to do so.
 The army was also responsible for some extrajudicial killings. On June 23, Mexi-
 can army units claimed they had killed five narcotics traffickers in a shoot-out in
 Chihuahua state. A subsequent investigation revealed that the soldiers had cap-
 tured, tortured, and summarily executed the suspects. Sixteen soldiers were charged
 in the incident.
 
 
 491
 In Mexico's rural states, violent disputes over land sometimes led to extrajudicial
 killings. Paramilitary bands, police auxiliaries, and local police controlled by politi-
 cal bosses and landowners threatened and sometimes killed indigenous activists.
 With the establishment in 1990 of the CNDH as an independent entity under the
 Constitution and the formation in 1993 of official human rights commissions in each
 state, increased attention was paid to human rights at both the state and federal
 levels. The CNDH has the power to compel officials to grant access and give evi-
 dence. However it then issues nonbinding recommendations that depend on execu-
 tive and judicial organs and the weight of public opinion to ensure enforcement by
 the government entities. To date, of the 624 recommendations the CNDH has is-
 sued, 268 have been followed fully. Eighty-two people were arrested as a result of
 CNDH recommendations to the Attorney General's office and of those, 20 were tried,
 convicted, and sentenced to prison terms averaging over 5 years, including 3 officials
 who were convicted of torture.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no confirmed reports of politically motivated dis-
 appearances in 1993.
 The most significant development in Mexico's continuing effort to resolve past dis-
 appearances was resolution of the 1988 Jose Ramon Garcia case, mentioned above.
 Over the last 6 years, some human rights advocates claimed that there were more
 than a dozen disappearances but in 1992 and 1993 no new cases arising in Mexico
 were added to the list kept by the U.N. Working Group on Involuntary or Forced
 Disappearances.
 The CNDH closed its inquiries into 78 of the more than 200 disappearance cases
 listed by the U.N. Working Group over that period. Of the 80 cases concluded, 51
 persons were found alive,and 22 were determined to be dead. Sixteen of the deaths
 were homicides, but in no case was there evidence that the homicides were politi-
 cally motivated. The remaining seven cases were dropped by the complainants.
 Independent Mexican human rights groups assert that approximately 500 persons
 disappeared in Mexico over the last 23 years, mostly in the early to mid-1970's. Eu-
 reka, a group formed by mothers of several hundred persons who disappeared dur-
 ing the guerrilla conflicts of the 1970's, continued to press for news of family mem-
 bers' whereabouts.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Although prohibited by the Constitution, torture is still used by members of the se-
 curity forces despite increased public awareness and some convictions of violators.
 The most commonly used methods of torture were threats, beatings, asphyxiation,
 and electric shock.
 From its establishment in June 1990 through September 1993 the CNDH re-
 ceived 1,114 complaints of torture, 847 of which were investigated and concluded.
 All were classified as possible torture based on the allegations in the complaints.
 Of these, 103 were found to have involved torture, and recommendations were is-
 sued in those cases. In 293 other cases, violations other than torture were found.
 According to the CNDH, torture complaints declined again during 1993 both in
 number and as a percentage of all complaints. During the CNDH's first year in op-
 eration (May 1990-May 1991), allegations of torture totaled 426 (13.4 percent of all
 cases), though many of those cases were from previous years and only reported to
 the Commission in its first year of operation. During the May 1992-May 1993 pe-
 riod, the number of torture allegations had fallen to 246 (2.8 percent of all cases).
 From June to December 1993, 91 cases (1.6 percent of all cases) of alleged torture
 were lodged with the CNDH. Although state human rights commission presidents
 and some nongovernmental human rights groups agreed that complaints of torture
 have declined, other human rights organizations claimed that torture remained at
 historic levels or even increased, citing frequent allegations to their groups. The
 magnitude of the problem remains significant.
 CNDH investigations into complaints of torture were an important effort to re-
 duce violations. However, there continued a pattern of failure to try, convict, and
 sentence prison officials guilty of abusing detainees. Thirty-two U.S. citizens reg-
 istered complaints with U.S. consulates and, with permission of the complainants,
 the U.S. Government formally protested 13 cases of torture or other mistreatment
 through diplomatic channels. There has been a decline in such cases, as reflected
 in the decreasing number of formal protests over the past several years: 39 in 1990,
 21 in 1991, and 17 in 1992.
 Most prisons in Mexico lack adequate facilities for prisoners and are overcrowded,
 despite an early release program endorsed by the CNDH and legal reforms reducing
 the number of crimes that carry mandatory prison sentences. In addition, an en-
 trenched system of corruption undermined prison authority and led to abuses. Fre-
 quently, prisoners exercise authority within the prison, displacing prison officials.
 Conflicts between rival prison groups, often involved in drug trafficking, continued
 
 
 492
 to spark lethal violence. While a few prison officials were prosecuted for abusing
 prisoners, it was more common to dismiss them or to charge them with only minor
 offenses. Urged by the CNDH, the Government accelerated a major prison-building
 program designed to reduce the overcrowding, lack of security, and the mixing ol
 male and female prisoners and of accused and sentenced criminals that have added
 greatly to prison violence. The federal prison system alone added 400 spaces for
 maximum security prisoners, and 800 more were planned for 1993 and 1994. As of
 December 31,there were 94,768 inmates in Mexican prisons: 48,994 were serving
 sentences; 45,774 were being tried.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arbitrary arrest and imprisonment is the
 most common human rights abuse, reflected both in the complaints brought to the
 CNDH and those brought to the state commissions. Legally, arrests may be made
 only upon the authority of a judicially issued warrant, with two exceptions: suspects
 caught in the act of committing a crime, and serious crimes where there is an ur-
 gent need to make the arrest and no judge is available. In the latter, apublic pros-
 ecutor can issue an arrest warrant, but the suspect must be presented to a judge
 immediately. In practice, police frequently arrested suspects without a warrant,
 even when the suspect was not caught in the act, and judges overlooked this irregu-
 larity.
 The Constitution requires that those arrested be arraigned before a judge as soon
 as possible. In August the Constitution was amended to allow detention of up to 48
 hours after arrest in ordinary cases or 96 hours in cases where organized crime is
 alleged. The amendment was designed to give prosecutors more time to prepare
 their cases. Once arraigned, a judge takes the defendant's statement and must in-
 form the accused of charges and evidence against him within 48 hours. Within 72
 hours of arraignment, a judge must remand the defendant to prison or proceed with
 release. In a ]are majority of cases, detainees are released or arraigned within the
 time frame specimed by law. The impact of the amendments is not yet clear.
 In 1993 arrests without warrants were somewhat fewer but remained common.
 Attorney General Carpizo, a human rights advocate and former CNDH head, backed
 the lengthened prearraignment priod in art to discourage such abuses. As in the
 case of roadside narcotics searches, which Carpizo revived but subjected to strict
 new rules, the lengthened prearraignment period was intended both to assist law
 enforcement and to keep prosecutors out of trouble by setting rules they can follow.
 Before August, prison populations contained a significant number of pretrial detain-
 ees, many of whom had been detained for more than the time pernitted under the
 Constitution. In recent years, the CNDH, other rights groups, and private counsel
 have won release of detainees held beyond the constitutional time limits, but pro-
 longed detention remained an ingrainedprblem.
 Frequent forced expulsions and unlawful arrests continued in rural areas. These
 human rights violations often involved indigenous people evicted by landowners
 with local police and government support. In February squatters who had settled
 on a plot of land in Morelos were violently driven off by special police, losing many
 of their possessions. The state human rights commission and the state Attorney
 General's office concluded that the squatters had no right to the land. At year's end,
 an investigation continued into charges of human rights violations during the evic-
 tion proceedings; no one had been charged with wrongdoing.
 In Chiapas, state police were criticized for wrongfully arresting several  ups of
 Indians while investigating two unrelated incidents in which military officers had
 been  killed. In  both  cases, several Indians were   allegedly  beaten  and
 wronglydetained. While many of the suspects were later released, charges remained
 pending against others, and the Government maintained it acted properly in bring-
 ing those charges. At the beginning of 1994, an armed uprising in Chiapas called
 attention to serious discontent with the human rights and economic situation.
 Indians continued to be detained or arrested without cause as a result of police
 and military investigations into killings of soldiers. An investigation by the CNDH,
 nongovernmental organizations (NGO s), and the army itself into one such case in
 Baborigame, Chihuahua, resulted in an unprecedented admission of responsibility
 by the army, which paid restitution to those Indians affected by the action and pun-
 ished those responsible. In the villages of Ocosingo and Ocotal, Chiapas, several In-
 dian peasants identified as suspects in the murders of soldiers were arrested but
 then released by judges for lack of evidence after local human rights groups and the
 CNDH intervened. The CNDH and the federal Attorney General's office investigated
 the arrests and recommended disciplinary action against the officials involved.
 Other Indians involved in the Ocosingo case remained imprisoned on murder and
 other charges, and government officials asserted that there is evidence to support
 these allegations.
 Exile of Mexican citizens is not normally practiced.
 
 
 493
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judicial system is divided into federal and
 state courts, with federal courts having jurisdiction over most civil cases and those
 involving major felonies, including drug trafficking. Some opposition politicians and
 credible independent analysts asserted that judicial officials were overly partial to
 the executive branch, despite appointments for life (unless dismissed for cause) after
 a tenuring period. Three federal judges in Sonora were dismissed for obstructing
 justice, and an arrest warrant for obstructing justice and bribery was issued against
 a former Supreme Court justice (both unprecedented in modern Mexico). Low pay
 and high caseloads contributed to continued corruption within the judicial system.
 TheConstitution requires that a court must hand down a verdict within 4 months
 of arrest for crimes that carry a maximum sentence of 2 years or less, and within
 a year for those with longer maximum sentences. The trial itself, sentencing, and
 appeals can delay the final outcome for significant periods of time, sometimes add-
 in$ a year or more to the entire process. Trial is by judge, not jury, in nearly all
 criminal cases. Defendants have a right to counsel, and public defenders are avail-
 able. Other rights include protection against self-incrimination, the right to confront
 one's accusers, the right to a translator if one's native language is not Spanish, and
 the right to a public trial. Such protections are not always observed in practice. The
 long trial process is one of the major causes of overcrowding in the prison system,
 as those who do not qualify for or cannot post bond swell the prison population.
 Imprisonment of rural indigenous people, often on charges of cultivating narcotic
 plants, puts a heavy demand on the prison system. Human rights advocates argue
 convincinqly that many Indians were denied fair trials because of language and cul-
 tural barrers, as well as poverty. The CNDH began a program in 1992 to seek early
 release for prisoners, including indigenous people, and to improve compliance by fed-
 eral and state officials with legal requirements that indigenous people be rep-
 resented fairly. More than 1,000 Indians benefited from the early release program
 and the general parole program in 1993.
 Some human rights groups claim that many indigenous prisoners are political
 prisoners because langage and cultural barriers denied them fair trial. The Gov-
 ernment disputes the claim, charging that there is evidence that those whom human
 rights groups consider to be political prisoners have been guilty of common crimes
 such as criminal association, homicide, and damage to property.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the rights of privacy and freedom from intrusion by the
 Government into homes, family, and correspondence. However, although search
 warrants are required by law, unlawful searches without warrants occurred fre-
 quently, and there continued to be credible reports of wiretapping.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and thepress, but there remained significant restrictions on these freedoms. Opposi-
 tion leaders freely voice their criticism of the Government, and there is a large num-
 ber of newspapers and magazines with a wide range of editorial views. The Govern-
 ment's control of a significant advertising budget and its ability to reward favored
 journalists by providing them access to officials were used to discourage unfavorable
 reports. A number of journalists depended upon receipt of under-the-table payments
 from the often public entities they covered to supplement low wages.
 There were signs of change in the relationship between the Government and the
 press. The government practice of paying the press to run material it provided as
 news articles was banned, though some agencies may still de so, disregarding the
 prohibition. The Government put into effect clear rules restricting advertising by
 government entities in the press and requiring receipts for any press expenses. Sev-
 eral newspapers revised their wage and advertising revenue distribution policies to
 reduce or eliminate abuses. In 1992 the Government announced that it would no
 longer cover expenses incurred by reporters accompanying the President at home (it
 had earlier ended the practice on travels abroad). Two of three remaining govern-
 ment-owned television stations were sold to a private group that will provide signifi-
 cant new competition in national television media. Nevertheless, the Governments
 continuing control over broadcast license renewals and a reluctance by journalists
 and newspaper owners to undermine their access to and relationship with the Gov-
 ernment contributed to the media's tendency toward self-censorship.
 During campaign periods, the Federal Electoral Code provides opposition parties
 with 15 minutes per month of television time, plus additional time in proportion to
 their electoral strength. In addition, federal law reforms passed in 1993 stipulated
 that all parties seeking to buy more time from commercial stations shall have equal
 access and pay the same rates. If several parties compete for the same time slots,
 there is a procedure to divide the slot in two, distribute the right to buy slots in
 
 
 494
 the first half pro rata among all parties, and allot the right to buy slots in the sec-
 ond half in proportion to a party's polling in the immediate past federal election.
 A procedure was also mandated to limit overall campaign spending that will include
 media time and space.
 Opposition politicians and others have long claimed that the principal television
 networks accord the government party inordinate news coverage, particularly at
 election time. There continued to be credible allegations that the media did not give
 government critics as much air time as government supporters. The new law re-
 quires the Federal Electoral Commission to inform media of a general requirement
 or fair treatment, but there is no provision for a "right of reply" under the law.
 Violence and threats against journalists continued to be a problem. There were
 at least five reported cases of journalists killed in gangland style during the course
 of the year. Others reported receiving threats. Investigations continued into these
 murders, but none appeared politically motivated. A senior national security official
 was convicted in the 1984 murder of journalist Manuel Buendia. Human rights ad-
 vocates and others speculated that narcotics traffickers and corrupt officials protect-
 ing them have been behind many assaults on journalists.
 The July 1991 death of physician and columnist Victor Manuel Oropeza Contreras
 remained unresolved. Two suspects initially charged with the murder were released
 in 1992 in compliance with a recommendation from CNDH; a new prosecutor is con-
 tinuing the investigation. The police officials who made the two arrests were tried
 for fabricating that case.
 In response to a complaint by the Union of Democratic Journalists, the CNDH
 began an inquiry in 1990 into 55 cases of alleged abuse of journalists' human rights.
 O the original 55 cases, the arrests of 3 persons responsible for the murder of jour-
 nalist Javier Juarez brought to 41 the cases concluded by the CNDH either through
 arrests, final judgments (including convictions), or dismissals for lack of evidence or
 interest by complainants. Police investigations pursuant to CNDH recommendations
 continued in the 14 cases where recommendations were issued. The CNDH did not
 establish a political motive in any of the 41 cases, although as noted above, a cor-
 rupt securityofficial was convicted of the Buendia murder. In December 1992,the
 CNDH updated its report and announced that it had embarked on a second stage,
 investigating 22 new cases. Of these, three new cases were concluded; in two cases
 the CNDH found no violation, and in the third the complaint was withdrawn.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution grants the
 right of peaceful assembly for any lawful purpose. A government permit is generally
 required for major demonstrations. The Government permits demonstrations by a
 broad range of political groups.
 c. Freedom ofReion.-The Constitution permits persons to practice the religion
 of their choice, and that right is honored in fact. Religious entities may acquire legal
 status after operating in Mexico for 5 years, own property, and operate private
 schools but are restricted from owning businesses and communications media. Indi-
 vidual clergy may be candidates for political office but only after a period of separa-
 tion from their religious functions. Otherwise, clergy remain barred from holding
 public office and advocating partisan political positions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Movement within and outside the country is unrestricted. The Govern-
 ment has customarily admitted persons recognized as refugees by the U.N. High
 Commissioner for Refugees. Approximately 45,000 Guatemalan refugees (up from
 43,000 in 1992) reside in camps and resettlement areas in southern Mexican states.
 The refugee population grew due to high birth rates, despite repatriations of 2,500
 refugees in January and 1,300 refugees in December. Since 1990 they have been
 permitted to accept work outside their camps and may travel freely in the five-state
 area of Chiapas, Campeche, Quintana Roo, Tabasco, and Yucatan. The Government
 estimates that an additional 400,000 Central Americans, mostly Guatemalans and
 Salvadorans, are living and working in Mexico. These pre-1990 undocumented
 Central Americans lead a precarious existence, are subject to deportation when
 caught, and are often exploited as a source of cheap labor.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Under the Constitution, citizens have the right to change their government
 through periodic elections. The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) dominates
 Mexican politics and has controlled the Government since its founding in 1929. It
 won every presidential election since then and has maintained power, in part, by
 relying on public patronage, use of government and party organizational resources,
 and-according to respected independent observers--electoral fraud. Recent reforms
 enacted by the Government are intended to ensure that future elections will be, and
 
 
 495
 will be seen to be, free and fair. Opposition parties have argued that the reforms
 do not go far enough to ensure that objective fully.
 Nine states elected governors, state legislators, and municipal mayors in 1993.
 The PRI won all the gubernatorial contests. Most of those victories were won by
 wide margins and prompted only scattered protests by opposition parties who
 claimed electoral law violations. In several cases, however, opposition parties strong-
 ly contested the PRI victories, and credible observers in some instances attributed
 them to electoral fraud. For example, the PRD rejected official results that declared
 the PRI candidate governor in Guerrero in February and in Nayarit in July. In both
 cases, the PRD asserted that vote tallies were distorted by various means that vio-
 lated electoral laws. In Guerrero, the PRD alleged that too few people voted to make
 the election legitimate. The PRI candidates took office in both states amid continu-
 ing opposition protests. The conservative National Action Party (PAN) was the pro-
 tagonist in less extensive protests over the elections in Baja California Sur in Feb.
 ruary. Although local PAN members claimed that their candidate had won the gov-
 ernorship, the national PAN leadership conceded its loss.
 In the Yucatan, the PRI proposed in April that the November gubernatorial elec-
 tion be postponed until 1995, seen as an attempt to prevent the popular PAN mayor
 of Merida from winning the position just months before general elections in August
 1994. The measure was passed in the PRI-dominated state legislature, despite PAN
 protests. Later, however, the PRI proposed that the gubernatorial election be held
 in November as scheduled, but for only an 18-month term. New elections for gov-
 ernor then would be held in May 1995. The state legislature also approved this pro-
 posal, again without PAN support.
 Yucatan elections were held on November 28, with civic action grups reporting
 heavy voter turnout and noting some irregularities in voting procedures. Opposition
 parties, led by the PAN, registered complaints with the state electoral commission
 against procedures in 57 polling places throughout the state. On December 1, the
 Yucatan interim governor, from the PRI, unexpectedly submitted her resignation,
 possibly over the manner in which the elections were conducted; the resignation was
 not accepted by the state legislature. On December 5, the Yucatan electoral commis-
 sion formally declared the PRI candidates victors in the gubernatorial and Merida
 mayoral races. The PAN subsequently launched a series of protest rallies, led by
 PAN presidential candidate Diego Fernandez. After further protests and delibera-
 tions, the PRI mayor-elect of Merida resigned his office on December 20, and the
 electoral commission awarded the post to the PAN candidate who had finished sec-
 ond in the official results. The commission also dismissed most of the PAN's other
 challenes, and the PAN ended its public protests over the elections.
 Continung changes to the Constitution and reforms of electoral legislation have
 somewhat reduced the PRI's advantages. The Congress adopted constitutional
 amendments and revised the electoral law to double the size of the Senate, guaran-
 tee the opposition at least 25 percent of the seats, and revise (effective in 1999) the
 requirements for president by eliminating the bar to native-born Mexicans of for-
 eign-born parents. In addition, the changes establish campaign and party financing
 limits along with an audit function in the semiautonomous Federal Electoral Insti-
 tute (IFE), eliminate the clause that gave the party achieving a plurality of 35 per-
 cent or more of the vote an automatic majority in the lower house, and give parties
 access to commercial media time based on electoral strength. The PRI, PAN, and
 a smaller party voted for these measures. The PRD demurred, arguing that the IFE
 and other organizations running the elections should be controlled by the parties,
 not the Government. The PRD is correct in its contention that the Government still
 has substantial influence over the IFE. Mexico's Secretary of Government remains
 as president and a voting member of the IFE governing council. The current IFE
 Director General served as a subsecretary in the Secretariat of Government before
 taking the post; his predecessor went on to become the victorious PRI candidate for
 governor of Mexico state.
 The 1993 changes did, however, give op  sitionpart representatives and citizen
 members-at-large more votes than PHI anW IFE officials combined on the IFE's dis-
 trict and state electoral boards, which perform the critical first review of campaign
 results and complaints. In addition, the legal changes buttressed the autonomy of
 the Federal Electoral Tribunal (TFE), which adjudicates federal election disputes,
 by adding a five-member appellate panel, presided over by the TFE president and
 including four members who must be federal judges, nominated by the Supreme
 Court and approved by two-thirds of the Congress. The appellate panel will pass
 final judgment on the elections of federal deputies and senators. As a result, newly
 elected federal legislators will no longer sit in judgment over their own elections.
 In another move to legitimate electoral processes in Mexico, the [FE began a cam-
 paign late in 1992 to distribute new voter credentials with photographs and also up-
 
 
 dated the voter registry that was compiled in 1991. The law requires that the list
 of those receiving voter credentials be given to all parties in sufficient time to re-
 view the list and the distribution of voter credentials. Opposition parties remain
 concerned that the process of producing and distributing credentials may be abused
 by printing duplicate credentials or selective distribution. In a further effort to in-
 still confidence in its decisions and reduce the opportunity for political influence, the
 IFE interviewed, tested, and recruited 2,300 individuals to become its new profes-
 sional civil service staff.
 Although improved, the revised Electoral Code was criticized for setting new,
 more stringent standards for parties seeking to form a coalition, such as that which
 supported PRD leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas in 1988. Coalition parties meeting the
 new standards are to be treated as a single party for the purpose of the election.
 As such they are entitled to only one space on the ballot, to one share (equal to the
 largest coalition party's share) of federal financing, and to one party's share of fed-
 eral funding.
 Increasedlgovernment efforts to redress electoral deficiencies at the federal level
 have not been matched at the state and local levels where contests continue to ro-
 voke controversy. State electoral laws have not kept pace with changes at the fed-
 eral level. Local elections continue to be subject to the influence of political bosses
 who have traditionally controlled certain towns or regions and are loathe to lose
 their power base. Nonetheless, 12-15 million Mexicans are governed by opposition
 Farties at the state and local levels. Opposition leaders assert that those gains have
 Paid the foundation for further advances at the state and national levels.
 Under Mexican law, indigenous peoples have the same political rights as all other
 citizens. While there is no separate indigenous political party in Mexico (although
 evangelical Christian Indians in Chiapas state have broached the idea of forming
 their own party), in many states-particularly Chiapas, Oaxaca, and Guerrero-in-
 digenous voters make up an important percentage of the population. Traditionally,
 indigenous voters strongly backed the ruling PRI, with the Government in turn al-
 lowing local groups some autonomy on economic and social issues. Opposition politi-
 cians and human rights advocates have criticized elections in indigenous areas, say-
 ing that the reported results often reflect distortion of the voting process and not
 a genuine consensus to support the PRI.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Although the Government permits both domestic and international human rights
 groups to operate without restrictions or official harassment, human rights monitors
 continued to be subject to threats. Well-known human rights monitor Teresa Jardi,
 who received five written death threats in 1992, rejoined the Attorney General's of-
 fice in 1993 and is now the Attorney General's delegate in the state of Chihuahua
 and in charge of all federal police there. A high-level investigation into the threats
 against her did not determine who had issued the threats, which have since ceased.
 Victor Clark, a human rights advocate in Tijuana who issued a study charging that
 torture continued to be a frequent human rights violation in Baja California, was
 sued for libel by a police official whom Clark accused of involvement in such abuses.
 The suit against Clark is being monitored carefully by many who fear it may dis-
 suade others from reporting abuse.
 In June 1990, President Salinas established the semiautonomous National Com-
 mission on Human Rights (CNDH) and appointed respected jurist Jorge Carpizo
 McGregor as its president. In January 1992, constitutional reforms took effect mak-
 ing the CNDH legally independent. The Commission's mandate does not extend to
 jurisdiction over the substantive aspects of labor or electoral matters. It may, how-
 ever, investigate claims of related abuse of nonlabor or political rights, such as fail-
 ure to proceed with required administrative actions by labor boards or physical or
 other abuse in connection with an election process. The Code of Official Conduct
 provides that CNDH officials investigating a complaint have the right to enter im-
 mediately any government office or prison and that federal government officials
 must respond to CNDH requests for information.
 The CNDH, whose president calls himself an ombudsman, must rely solely upon
 the pressure of public opinion and the accuracy of its investigations to induce com-
 pliance with its recommendationsto state and federal authorities to investigate and
 prosecute transgressors. The recommendations are not legally binding.
 Since announcing in June 1992 that too many of its recommendations had been
 accepted but only partially implemented, the CNDH pursued an aggressive cam-
 paign to enforce full compliance. In the last 2 years, as a result of CNDH rec-
 ommendations to the Attorney General's Office alone, 20 Mexican officials were
 tried and convicted of abuse and jailed for terms averaging more than 5 years. Many
 
 
 more cases were still under trial. In addition, the CNDH developed a nationwide
 register of public officials punished for human rights violations to prevent such offi-
 cials from being rehired by another public office or agency.
 The constitutional change making the CNDH independent also required state
 human rights commissions to be established by legislation, not executive order. The
 state commissions in the 30 states and federal district became operational in 1993.
 There was no evidence of any attempt by the Government to retaliate against
 human rights critics in 1993. Ranking officials routinely meet with domestic and
 international human rights activists to discuss human rights problems. The Salinas
 Government made a conscious effort both to improve protection of human rights in
 Mexico and to respond to criticism at home and abroad on human rights issues.
 Mexican NGO's and international organizations such as Amnesty International and
 Americas Watch continue to report rights abuses in Mexico, especially torture and
 illegal detention.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Historically, women     have   played  a   subordinate  role  economi-
 cally,politically, and socially although they are treated equally under the law. The
 constitutional provision for equal pay for equal work has never been enforced. The
 traditional women's role is changing, albeit slowly, as they become increasingly ac-
 tive economically and politically; one woman is the leader of the PRI in the Con-
 oress and another woman led the PRD congressional delegation, the third largest.
 Women hold important union leadership roles, and they have the right to file for
 separation and divorce and to own property in their own name.
 Domestic assault is a crime, but the magnitude of the problem is unclear because
 it is reported infrequently. Women appear to be reluctant to file reports of abuse
 or to press charges; human rights groups say that they receive relatively few com-
 plaints of such abuse. When notified, police are reluctant to intervene in what is
 often considered a domestic affair. Informed sources indicate that as many as 90
 percent of incidents of abuse may go unreported. The CNDH has included programs
 and publications on women's rights in its training and education campaign, and the
 Center Against Violence toward Women has worked to encourage rape victims to
 come forward and report sexual crimes. Mexico's first National Conference on
 Human Rights and Women, held October 20-22, adopted an action plan to increase
 awareness and enforcement of women's rights.
 Children.-There is no societal pattern of abuse against children, but child advo-
 cates report many cases of such abuse. In 1992 the government-sponsored National
 Action  rgram   or Children reported receiving 94,000 cases of reported abuse and
 opened criminal investigations in almost 1,000 cases. The Government devotes a
 major portion of its discretionary budget to social spending, including programs to
 assist children. Some 500,000 children receive medical and nutritional assistance as
 well as educational grants through the national solidarity program. Advocates call
 for even greater levels of assistance. The protection of children in Mexico is the re-
 sponsibility of the National System for the Total Development ef the Family (DIF),
 an autonomous agency within the Government's social services sector. DIF employs
 social workers throughout the country to investigate child abuse allegations, cases
 of abandoned children, infant malnutrition, and adoptions.
 Indigenous People.-The Government encourages indigenous groups, many of
 which do not speak Spanish, to participate in political life, and it is respectful of
 their desire to retain elements of their traditional lifestyle. Indigenous people do not
 live on independently governed reservations, although many indigenous commu-
 nities continue to exercise considerable local control over economic and social issues.
 These communities continue to apply their traditional law to resolve a variety of dis-
 putes, including allegations of crimes. However, these groups remain largely outside
 the country's political and economic mainstream, a result of longstanding patterns
 of economic and social development, and in many cases their ability to participate
 in decisions affecting their lands, cultural traditions, and the allocation of natural
 resources is negligible. At the beginning of 1994, these problems were particularly
 highlighted by an armed uprising in Chiapas state. Agrarian law reforms designed
 to promote sustainable economic development may negatively affect traditional in-
 digenous land ownership.
 Human rights groups continued to make credible claims that some indigenous de-
 fendants in criminal cases are not treated fairly, despite the 1991 amendment to
 federal law requiring an interpreter at every stage of a criminal proceeding for in-
 digenous peoples not fluent in Spanish. Knowledge of the Spanish language is es-
 sential to work outside indigenous areas, and Indians who do not speak Spanish
 find entering the outside workplace very difficult.
 
 
 498
 In Chiapas, political ties between the PRI and tribal leaders have ensured both
 local autonomy and PRI victories in the indigenous communities. Often the tribe
 would select its leader, the PRI would endorse the choice, and indigenous voters
 would vote a straight PRI ticket for local, state, and federal offices. This practice
 allowed local leaders to maintain autonomy and ties to the national political struc-
 ture but failed to provide a means to remove corrupt or ineffective leaders once they
 obtained PRI backing.
 Indians have protections under Mexican law, ranging from the right to own land
 communally to the right to language interpretation in court cases. Indian commu-
 nities also receive support from social and economic assistance programs. However,
 deep dissatisfaction among the Indians stems, in part, from the ineffectiveness of
 legal guarantees and social welfare programs to achieve the goals they expect.
 The CNDH received 137 complaints from individuals orgroups living or working
 in indigenous communities from May 1992 to May 1993. Most complaints pertained
 to the administration of justice and judicial procedures, arbitrary arrests, torture,
 abuse of authority, failure to carry out land dispute resolutions, and refusal to
 award and restore lands. During the same period, the CNDH made recommenda-
 tions in favor of 17 complainants, faulting the authorities for procedural deficiencies,
 abuse of authority, delays in the administration of justice, and failure to carry out
 arrest warrants. Most recommendations were accepted, and legal proceedings have
 begun and, in some cases, already concluded. The CNDH's civic education work to
 end human rights abuses of Mexico's indigenous people continued and expanded.
 Religious Minorities.-Discrimination against persons on the basis of religious af-
 filiation is illegal, and no complaints of such abuse were brought against the Gov-
 ernment. In Chiapas, indigenous people who converted from their traditional Catho-
 lic religion to evangelical faiths continued to be forcibly expelled from their houses
 by other villagers, despite efforts by the state government and the Catholic hier-
 archy to stop such actions. There was at least one attempt by local residents in
 Nuevo Leon in 1993 to stop construction of an evangelical church. After a delay,
 construction continued. There were also credible reports of private businesses pre-
 ferring Catholic to non-Catholic job applicants.
 People With Disabilities.-Disabled access to buildings and other facilities is sel-
 dom seen in Mexico and not required by law outside Mexico City, where it was re-
 cently mandated. Special education for the disabled is not widely available. Handi-
 capped persons hold prominent positions in political parties and in the workplace
 but do not appear to receive any special assistance by law or in fact.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and provisions of the Federal
 Labor Law (FLL) give all workers the freedom to form unions to defend their inter-
 ests. Unions must register with federal or state government authorities to obtain
 legal status. Unions may freely join labor centrals without the Government's prior
 approval, but centrals too must register to acquire legal status. Registration require-
 ments, involving submission of basic information about the union, are not onerous.
 There have been repeated allegations by labor activists, however, that federal or
 state labor authorities use this administrative procedure improperly to withhold reg-
 istration from groups considered disruptive to government policies, trade union lead-
 ers, or enterprises. Privately, some employers and trade unionists supportive of the
 government agree this occurs occasionally. The considerable delays allow for a vari-
 et of outside pressures from employers, unions, and government or political party
 oficials either in favor of or in opposition to the registration application, which, on
 occasion, have led to public protests, demonstrations, and controversy. However, no
 such delays were reported or aroused controversh in 1993.
 The Federal Government's Secretariat of Labor and Social Protection (STPS), Ar-
 bitration and Conciliation Board (JFCA), and other agencies apply and enforce these
 laws with reasonable fairness and efficiency. There are occasional errors or over-
 sights, however, and vociferous public complaints by losing parties to disputes are
 frequent. This issue is complicated by the federal system which reserves some juris-
 diction to the states. Some state governments are reputed to be less fair and effi-
 cient in enforcing labor law than others. According to federal labor authorities, labor
 law is more effectively enforced in sectors under federal jurisdiction than in those
 under state jurisdiction. NAFTA and its supplemental agreements will enlarge the
 area of federal jurisdiction.
 About 30 to 35 percent of the total Mexican work force is organized in trade
 unions. Most of these are members of several large union confederations, known as
 labor centrals, most of which belong to a national umbrella organization the Labor
 Congress (CT-see below). Unions and labor centers, including independent unions
 
 
 499
 
 and those not allied with the governing PRI party, are free to affiliate with inter-
 national labor organizations and participate in them actively.
 Mexico maintains legal restrictions on public employees that contravene inter-
 national labor standards. In examining compliance by member governments which
 have ratified the International Labor Organization (ILO) Convention on Freedom of
 Association, the ILO Committee of Experts (COE) reminded Mexico again in 1993
 that several clauses of its Federal Government Employees Law do not conform to
 this Convention. The law allows only one union per public body and prohibits public
 servants from leaving their union, reelecting their leaders, or joining workers or
 peasants unions. However, some public sector union leaders have been reelected de-
 spite these restrictions and union statutes. The COE said the law may legitimately
 restrict collective bargaining and certain other activities to "the most representative
 organization" but without prohibiting existence of other organizations, and again
 asked the Government to amend the law. The COE also reiterated a similar re-
 minder about another clause institutionalizing trade union monopoly in the public
 banking sector, but it noted with satisfaction that constitutional amendments and
 the privatization of many banks had freed their employees of such restrictions.
 The largest trade union central is the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM),
 organizationally a major component of the PRI. In the past, CTM members were
 automatically PRI members, but the PRI shifted to individual memberships in 1990.
 The CTM, other PRI-allied federations, and a number of autonomous, mostly PRI-
 allied unions (a total of 37 organizations) belong to the CT, a coordinating body
 which represents approximately 85 percent of Mexico's organized workers.
 Traditionally, a significant number of union officials held appointive and elected
 positions in federal and state governments and in the ruling PRI, and there was
 significant union influence in nominating PRI candidates at all levels of govern-
 ment. This symbiotic relationship gave labor unions a degree of influence in the
 Government but similarly limited their freedom of action. The CT, however, remains
 primarily a coordinating body among the CTM and most other PRI-allied unions
 which can be mobilized to support the PRI's positions on selected political issues
 and in election campaigns. Union officials continue to support PRI political can-
 didates and generally support government economic policies, but the labor sector's
 voice in policy formulation has greatly diminished. When systemic reforms were in-
 stituted in the late 1980's, the mainstream labor organizations lost strength within
 the PRI. Half of the PRI national political council is now chosen on a territorial
 basis, and only half, rather than all, on a sectoral basis. (The national labor centrals
 are one sector). After 1991 federal legislative elections with fewer than usual PRI
 labor candidates, the percentage of CT senators and deputies in the Federal Con-
 gress fell to less than 10 percent. (Only 3 of 62 senators are from the labor sector,
 though 1 of these heads the Senate.) Only 3 of 31 state governors are former labor
 leaders. These factors, as well as the reality of privatization and economic restruc-
 turing of the economy, prompted a debate within the CT about how best to adjust
 to changing circumstances. in an example of the changes taking place in govern-
 ment-union relations, the powerful Teachers' Union already ended its PRI affili-
 ation, and others may eventually follow suit.
 The FLL grants workers, including public sector and public enterprise workers,
 the right to strike. It requires a 6- to 10-day advance strike notice, followed by a
 brief, government-sponsored mediation effort. If a strike is then ruled nonexistent,
 employees must return to work within 24 hours or face dismissal for cause. If it is
 legrlly recognized, the law requires the company or the subunit that is the strike
 target to shut down totally. Not even mansgement officials may enter the premises
 until the strike is resolved. While some stres are declared nonexistent, many are
 declared legal, and many occur. Strike threats are often used to secure collective
 agreements (as with the airline pilots in 1993) without strikes actually occurring.
 The FLL also permits strikes by all public sector and private enterprise employees,
 but they are rare.
 From January to September 1993, 4,142 notices of intent to strike were filed with
 the JFCA, and 121 actual strikes occurred in industries under federal jurisdiction.
 In 1992 there were 6,815 notices of intent to strike and 156 actual strikes, of which
 33 continued. The comparable figures for 1991 were 7,006 strike notices and 136
 strikes. There were also 422 collective conflicts without strike notice from January
 through June 1993, compared to 1,017 in all of 1992 and 832 in 1991. The FLL pro-
 vides protection against dismissal for striking or other reasons and against other
 retribution for striking. While the FLL prohibits direct retribution against strikers,
 indirect pressures may be used from time to time by employers or state or even fed-
 eral government authorities to avoid costly strikes, and employers may try to find
 ways to rid themselves of strikers. Appeal is to the JFCA, which is quite punctilious
 
 
 500
 and reasonably fair and objective in applying the FLL, though there are often
 delays, as in other asects of the bureaucracy.
 The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) alleged in 1993
 that although the right to strike exists in law workers are subject to arbitra  dis-
 missal and violence when exercising this rigfit. It cited the 1992 arrest of Mata-
 moros CTM leader Agapito Gonzalez Cavazos on 3-year-old tax fraud charges on the
 eve of a union strike deadline as an example of government interference in collective
 bargaining in the in-bond export ("maquiladora') industry. While the ICFTU and
 human rights organizations saw his arrest as intended to intimidate workers, the
 union achieved most of its demands, and Gonzalez, released on bond and reinstated
 in his union, was reported once again to be seeking major wage increases in new,
 upcoming negotiations. The head of the Matamors state CTM, Diego Navarro
 Rodriguez, was also arrested and jailed on tax fraud charges but in this case re-
 placed by another CTM leader with Gonzalez' support.
 The ICFTU also criticized the Government's handling of the 1992 Volkswagen
 strike in Puebla, in which 14,000 workers were dismissed when they refused to re-
 turn to work after their strike was declared illegal and later rehired on terms more
 favorable to Volkswagen, with the approval of the JFCA. According to the ICFTU,
 police with trained dogs and clubs attacked a peaceful demonstration against the
 dismissals, injuring 12 workers.
 A JFCA ruling in September denied an appeal by the ousted leadership of the
 Cuautitlan (Mexico City) local of the national Ford Autoworkers Union of the CTM
 for reinstatement. This led to charges by the ousted committee that this was a case
 of CTM-Ford-JFCA collusion to prevent genuine worker representation. In this inci-
 dent, one of many in a succession of labor problems at these plants, the national
 leadership of the Ford CTM union intervened the local after an unsuccessful cam-
 saian by a rival central to take over. After negotiating a settlement for renewal of
 he collective bargaining agreement with Ford, the national union convened new
 local elections in which new leaders were elected. On the advice of outside advisers,
 the ousted leaders appealed their removal to the JFCA and did not return to work
 in the plant. Ford management held the ousted leaders'jobs open well beyond the
 period required by the FLL, made repeated offers, and finally demands that they
 return to work. When dismissed by Ford, they appealed this, too, to the JPCA which
 found the election in accord with-union statutes and ruled the former leaders had
 forfeited reemployment rights by not exercising them.
 Political rivalries within and between Mexican union organizations and leaders in
 and out of the PRI (as well as political factions and parties outside the unions) are
 often noisy, turbulent, and occasionally violent. For example, the national leader of
 the National Railroad Workers' Union, also a PRI deputy in the Nuevo Leon state
 legislature, was shot to death on July 17 in the parking lot of a Mexico City hotel.
 Union sources said he had been threatened days before his murder by the leader
 of a dissident alternative railroad union against whom he had preferred charges.
 Press reports cited the Attorney General's office as saying witnesses identified one
 of the dissidents as the murderer.
 Former Tabasco state Government Employee Union head and indigenous political
 leader Aquiles Magana, a PRI member who had supported the 1988 presidential
 campaign of the PRD's Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, was arrested in 1990 while leading
 a municipal workers demonstration demanding payment of an agreed-upon pay
 raise. Convicted of assault and battery in late 1992, Tabasco's governor pardoned
 him on May 7, following a well-publicized 48-day hunger strike and opposition ral-
 lies in Mexico City on his behalf.
 In September a 39-member group mostly comprised of U.S. and Canadian mem-
 bers of the International Association of Machinists and Aerspace Workers (AM)
 appeared unannounced outside an American-owned in-bond export plant in Tijuana,
 at which a dissident group of workers, in an organizing effort backed by a rival PRI-
 allied labor central, failed earlier (and again subsequently) to displace the existing
 local union affiliated to another PRI-allied labor central. The LAM group parked out-
 side the plant where arrangements had been made to talk to workers during a shift
 change. Plant managers, suspicious of a bus of non-Mexicans parked outside the
 plant, summoned immigration authorities who questioned and later escorted the
 lAM group to the border in its bus. The immigration officials told the delegation
 members their activity was not permitted under terms of their tourist status.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The FLL provides for the
 right to organize and to bargain collectively. On the basis of only a small showing
 orinterest by employees, an employer must recognize the union concerned and make
 arrangements either for a union recognition election or proceed immediately to nego-
 tiate a collective bargaining agreement. Such agreements are commonplace. Employ-
 ers complain the FLL is too favorable to union organization. Some employers en-
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 501
 courage company unionism as the only legal way to resist organization by national
 or local unions affiliated with the dominant labor centrals, or by more radical inde-
 pendent unions. Union representation elections are traditionally open, and votes are
 recorded by name. Management representatives as well as competing trade union
 officials are present with the presiding JFCA official when each and every worker
 votes.
 The public sector is almost totally organized. Public sector unions negotiate collec-
 tive bargaining agreements with their agencies. Their central organization (FSTSE),
 a powerful and influential organization, negotiates to a limited degree on proposed
 changes in pay scales and working conditions with the Government as a whole.
 Political factional disputes (sometimes between prominent PRI politicians, some-
 times involving opposition parties or dissident groups) on occasion lead to noisy pub-
 lic confrontations in which public sector unions or dissident elements within tem
 occupy or blockade government offices, including those of Cabinet secretaries, or
 conduct hunger strikes. These sometimes involve violent clashes. One recent dispute
 involved competing factions in the agricultural and water resources secretariat.
 Similarly, the Social Security Union successfully used press articles and paid adver-
 tisements to forestall rumored presidential initiatives to privatize or reform social
 security and preserved the employment status quo in its collective bargaining agree-
 ment.
 The state petroleum industry (Pemex) union STPRM was once renowned as pow-
 erful, corrupt, armed, dangerous, and practicallyimmune from control under the law,
 though influential in some parts of the PRI. Early in the Salinas administration,
 as a necessary precondition to market-oriented economic reform and downsizing
 state enterprise, the Government brought the STPRM under control, jailing top
 leaders for their illegal actions, while others fled abroad into exile. In the subse-
 quent downsizing of Pemex and privatization of some of its petrochemical installa-
 tions, a large number of workers lost jobs and demonstrated for greater, or more
 rapid, payment of severance pay and benefits. The reformed union is back in the
 good graces of the CTM (to which it belongs), the PRI, and the Government. The
 reform leader recently retired, and one of the former officials who was not arrested
 or exiled was elected to replace him.
 The degree of private sector organization varies widely by states. While most tra-
 ditional industrial areas are heavily organized, states with a small industrial base
 usually have few unions. Workers are protected by law from antiunion discrimina-
 tion, but this law is unevenly enforced, especially in states with a low degree of
 unionization. Workers in industries under federal jurisdiction may appeal to the
 JFCA or labor inspectors, regardless of what state they are in. Workers in indus-
 tries under state jurisdiction may appeal to local boards under state jurisdiction, or
 to state labor authorities, but these are also obliged to apply the FLL. Employers
 found guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for
 union activities, though they may prefer to buy them off by negotiating large sever-
 ance pay packages.
 The rate of unionization of in-bond export industries varies by area, but is com-
 paratively low. This isparticularly true in Baja California, where industrialization
 began only recently andthe in-bnd exporters have small plants. Baja California is
 governed bythe opposition PAN, close to business interests but not to the PRI or
 to PRI-allied unions. Some assert the relatively good wage and benefit packages of
 the lare in-bond export plants reduce the incentives to unionize, but critics decry
 le working conditions and inadequate wages at smaller plants and allege
 state or federal government as well as employer efforts to suppress unionization. In
 on.e' key state (Nuevo Leon), in-bond plants are heavily unionized, mostly by apoliti-
 cal independent unions some term "company unions." There was no credible evi-
 dence the Federal Government has suppressed unionization of the in-bond facilities.
 There were, however, indications that some state and local government and busi-
 ness leaders discouraged unionization, but trade unions have not filed any com-
 plaints about this with the Federal Government.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor. There have been no credible reports of forced labor for many years.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The FLL sets 14 as the minimum
 age for employment by children. Children from 14 to 15 may work a maximum of
 6 hours, may not work overtime or at night, and may not be employed in jobs
 deemed hazardous. Enforcement is reasonably good at large and medium formal sec-
 tor companies, including export industries and especially in sectors under federal ju-
 risdiction. Enforcement is much more difficult and spotty at the many small compa-
 nies and in agriculture, and practically nonexistent in the informal sector, despite
 government efforts.
 
 
 502
 Illegal child labor is extensive in the informal economy. There are significant
 numbers of underage street vendors employees in very small businesses, and work-
 ers in rural areas. The joint 1993 "Report on Child Labor in Mexico and the United
 States" by the U.S. Eabor Department and Mexico's STPS stated that 43 percent
 of child labor is in agriculture. Estimates of the number of children working vary
 from 8 to 11 million (about 31 million Mexicans are under 15). The lower estimate
 is from the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the CTM; the latter an
 estimate by the Mexican Statistics Institute (INEGI) that 34.3 percent of the under-
 15 population are economically active.
 Small-scale employers prepared to disregard company registration, social security,
 health, safety, and tax laws are often equally prepared to violate child labor laws.
 Eighty-fivepercent of all registered Mexican companies have 15 or less employees,
 and 80 perent have 5 or less employees, indicating the vast scope of the enforce-
 ment challenge even within the formal economy.
 1: 1992 the Government increased from 6 to 9 the minimum number of years that
 children must attend school and made parents legally liable, for the first time, to
 ensure their children's attendance. The move was part of a major educational reform
 effort designed to upgrade the skills of the Mexican labor force and to discourage
 child labor. The Government recognizes the need to continue increasing educational
 opportunities for youth and to eradicate child labor, but implementation and en-
 forcement as with the elimination of poverty, will be an uphill battle.
 The ILd worked with the Government's Social Development Secretariat to develop
 a national action program for the eradication of child labor, with the help of
 UNICEF funding. A preliminary project was drawn up but is awaiting high-leveliap-
 proval in the Secretariat. In addition, the STPS authorized an ILO national seminar
 on the work of minors for August 1993, and the ILO, NGO's, and government agen-
 cies are stepping up seminars, media campaigns, and other educational approaches.
 For example, Mexico City radio stations carry announcements admonishing parents
 on the importance of education to enhance their children's future and earning capac-
 ity.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Constitution and the FLL provide for a
 minimum wage. It is set by the tripartite (government, labor, employers) National
 Minimum Wage Commission (NMWC). A tripartite accord, renewed annually, limits
 price and wage increases. Since 1987, wages set by collective bargaining agreements
 and, especially, fringe benefits and white-collar salaries in the private sector more
 than kept pace with inflation, recuperating part (wages), most (fringe benefits), or
 virtually all (salaries) of the real purchasing power [ost since 1982. The minimum
 wage continued to decline in real terms to a level woefully inadequate in 1991 to
 provide a living for a worker and family. In May President Salinas announced he
 would encourage the NMWC to bein to take productivity increases into account in
 adjusting the minimum wage, andhe made this a formal commitment in August
 1993 when the NAFTA supplemental agreements were announced. Labor Secretar-
 iat officials indicate this will begin a gradual increase in the real minimum wage
 over the next several years similar to that in real average wages over the last 5
 years.
 The 1993 minimum wage was $4.60 (14.27 new pesos) per day for the most ad-
 vanced areas (Mexico City, Acapulco, Baja California, and certain municipalities of
 Chihuahua, state of Mexico, Sonora, Tamaulipas, and Veracruz). It was slightly less,
 $4.28 (NP 13.26) per day, for intermediate areas (Guadalajara and some municipali-
 ties of Jalisco, Monterrey and some municipalities of Nuevo Leon, and additional
 municipalities of Sonora, Tamaulipas and Veracruz). It was $3.90 (NP 12.05) per
 day in the rest of the country. There were special, higher minimum wages for 88
 specialized occupations, including various construction trades. The announced 1994
 minimum daily wage, to be implemented January 1, 1994, is $5.00 (NP 15.27) for
 the most advanced areas, $4.58 (NP 14.19) for the intermediate areas, and $4.16
 (NP 12.89) in the poorer parts of the country. The higher rates for 88 specialized
 occupations remain in effect. All these rates reflect a 7-percent increase from 1993
 (5 percent for expected inflation and 2 percent representing the average increase in
 productivity over the past 3 years).
 Social security data indicate that less than 16 percent of Mexico's workers earn
 the minimum wage. Legislation retroactiveto October 1 established a negative in-
 come tax (or devolution) of 7.5 to 10.8 percent for workers earning the minimum
 wage. This devolution will be paid with each paycheck by employers, who may sub-
 tract the amount from any taxes owed the Federal Government. Combined with the
 minimum wage increase, minimum wage earners will receive an increase in their
 incomes of 14.5 to 17.8 percent from 1993 to 1994. The same legislation eliminated
 income taxes on those earning up to two times the minimum wage and reduced
 them for those earning less than four times the minimum. These changes imple-
 
 
 mented provisions of the October 3 tripartite stability, competitiveness, and employ-
 ment pact (PECE), in which employers and workers also agreed to negotiate
 schemes to improve quality and productivity and to devise incentives or bonuses to
 give workers immediately a fair share of the earnings derived from these improve-
 ments.
 The FLL sets 48 hours as the standard legal workweek. The FLL provides that
 workers who are asked to exceed 3 hours of overtime per day or work any overtime
 on 3 consecutive days must be paid triple the normal wage. For most industrial
 workers, especially unionized ones, the real workweek has declined to about 42
 hours, although they are paid for a full 48 hours. (This is why unions zealously de-
 fend the legal ban on hourly wages in favor of daily wages.)
 Mexico's legislation and rules regarding employee health and safety are relatively
 advanced. All employers are bound by law to observe the General Regulations on
 Safety and Health in the Workplace issued jointly by the STPS and the Mexican
 Institute of Social Security (IMSS). In addition, in late 1991 the in-bond export asso-
 ciations in northern border states agreed to cooperate in a special program with
 STPS and IMSS health and safety experts to help their member companies over-
 come any deficiencies in their compliance. This program has made progress and is
 effective.
 The focal point for standard setting and enforcement in the workplace is in FLL-
 mandated bipartite (management and labor) safety and health committees in the
 plants and offices of every company. These meet at least monthly to consider work-
 p lace safety and health needs and file copies of their minutes with federal or state
 labor inspectors. Government labor inspectors schedule their own activities largely
 in response to the findings of these workplace committees. Individual employees
 may also complain directly to the office of labor inspection or the general directorate
 of medicine and safety in the workplace. Workers may remove themselves from haz-
 ardous situations without jeopardizing their employment. Complaints may be
 brought before the JFCA at no cost to the plaintiff. Mexican labor and social secu-
 rity officials report compliance is reasonably good at most large companies, both for-
 eign-owned and domestic. Most compliance difficulties occur with small businesses,
 few of which export any goods or services. Compliance and enforcement is prac-
 tically nonexistent in the informal sector.
