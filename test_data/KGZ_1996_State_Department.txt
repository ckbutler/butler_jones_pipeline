 KYRGYZ REPUBLIC
 The Kyrgyz Republic became an independent state in 1991. Although the 1993
 Constitution defines the form of government as a democratic republic with substan-
 tial civil rights for its citizens, the President, Askar Akayev, dominates the govern-
 ment. Akayev was reelected in December 1995 in an open, multicandidatepresi-
 dential election, which was marred, however, by deregistration of three rival can-
 didates immediately prior to the vote. Also in 1995, a new two-chamber Parliament
 was elected for a 5-year term. The Constitution was amended by referendum in Feb-
 rary to strengthen substantially the p residency and define the role of Parliament.
 However, the referendum was marredby serious irregularities. In 1995 a Constitu-
 tional Court was sworn in, and a reform program was implemented to improve the
 quality of the judiciary in 1996. Parliament and the Constitutional Court are fairly
 weak in practice.
 Law enforcement responsibilities are divided between the Ministry of Internal Af-
 fairs (MVD) for general crime, the Ministry of National Security (MNB) for state-
 level crime, and the procurator's office for both types of crime. Both the MVD and
 MNB deal with corruption and organized crime. These ministries inherited their
 personnel and infrastructure from their Soviet predecessors. Both appear to be
 under the full control of the Government and must conform their actions to the law.
 Kyrgyzstani borders are manned by Russian border troops under an agreement with
 the Russian Federation. The Government has little authority over these troops who
 sometimes enforce their own rules rather than Kyrgyzstani law.
 The Kyrgyz Republic is a poor, mountainous country with a predominantly agri-
 cultural economy. Cotton, wool, and meat are the main agricultural products and
 exports. Other exports include gold, mercury, uranium, and hydroelectricity. The
 Government has carried out progressive market reforms. There was moderate
 growth in most sectors, and economic reform is now accepted by the general public.
 The level of hardship for pensioners, unemployed workers, and government workers
 with salary arrearages continues to be very high. Foreign assistance plays a signifi-
 cant role in the country's budget.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, but there
 were problems with freedom of speech and the press, due process for the accused,
 religious freedom, ethnic discrimination, and electoral procedlures. Prison conditions
 remained poor. Two campaign workers and one journalist were arrested, tried, and
 onvicted under criminal rather than civil statutes for ibeling the President. Al-
 though receiving suspended sentences, they were held for months without bail be-
 fore their trials. One was subsequently rearrested and convicted of additional crimi-
 nal charges despite weak evidence. The Constitution was amended illegally in a ref-
 erendum marred by irregularities. L  l "elders" courts used torture, and levied
 harsh sentences beyond their mandate, in one case ordering the death penalty. Al-
 
 
 1001
 though sanctioned by the Government, elders' courts are not part of the regular ju-
 dicial structure and the Government has made efforts to curtail their activities. in
 general executive domination of the judiciary made assurances of due process prob-
 lematic. The Government does not fully protect freedom of religion. Concerns about
 ethnic discrimination remain, but in general the situation of minorities has im-
 proved and emigation rates have fallen dramatically. Violence against women is a
 problem which   e authorities often ignore.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial KIlig.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings by government officials. There was one report that an in-
 dividual was killed by stoning after being sentenced to death by a local court of vil-
 lage elders (see Section 1.e.). These courts are supposed to handle petty disputes
 and are not authorized to try major crimes or impose punishment other than small
 fines. Apparently, the elders were not punished, but elders' courts are being mon-
 itored more closely.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such practices, and there were no reports that officials
 employed them. There were unconfirmed reports that police beat ethnic Chechens
 during their arrests (see Section 1.d.).
 There have been allegations that local elders' courts in conjunction with unauthor-
 ized vigilantes have used torture to gain confessions in two villages (see Section
 l.e.).
 Prison conditions (including food shortages and lack of heat and other necessities)
 are poor but not so bad as to constitute cruelty. Those detained by the MNB rather
 than the MVD are kept in an MN detention facility; after conviction they go to
 a regular prison.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The judicial system continues to operate
 under Soviet laws and procedures. The procurator's office determines who maybe
 detained, arrested, and prosecuted. The Interior Ministry, the MN, and the Gen-
 eral Procurator carry out investigations. Since 1990 persons arrested or charged
 with crimes have the right to defense counsel. The procurator's office responsible for
 the investigation often nominates the defense counsel who is required to visit the
 accused within the first 3 days of incarceration. However, sometimes the accused
 first sees defense counsel only at the trial.
 The Criminal Code permits the procurator to detain suspects for 72 hours before
 releasing them or accusing them of a crime. The procurator must issue an arrest
 warrant before a person can be detained. If a suspect is charged, the procurator
 must advise defense counsel immediately. The accused usually remains in detention
 while the procurator investigates and prepares the case for presentation in court.
 The procurator has discretion to keep the accused in pretrial detention for up to 1
 year, but there are provisions for conditional release before trial. After 1 year, the
 procurator must release the accused or ask Parliament to extend the period of de-
 tention. Since independence, there have been no known instances in which Par-
 liament extended a detention.
 The procurator, not the judge, is in charge of criminal proceedings. Thus the
 courts are widely perceived as a rubber stamp for the procurator and not protectors
 of citizens' rights. In addition, very low judge' salaries have led to the apparently
 well-grounded view among the population that decisions can be bought easily. Nu-
 merous articles have appeared in the press about judges being charged and con-
 victed for taking bribes.
 Two days before the 1995 Presidential elections, the campaign chairman of opposi-
 tion candidate Medetkan Sherimkulov and a campaign worker were arrested in
 Issyk Kul oblast while campaigning. They were charged with libeling the President
 by handing out leaflets saying that Akayev was ethnically Kazak. They and their
 colleagues denied that they had any leaflets. The men were detained without bail
 (which is usually available in cases of nonviolent crime) for 4 months and were al-
 lowed no visitors other than spouses and attorneys. In April they were convicted of
 libel and received 1-year suspended sentences. A third person was arrested on simi-
 lar charges in Naryn in February and detained without bail until trial in July. He
 was convicted, given a suspended sentence of 1 year, and released. There were
 unconfirmed reports that police arbitrarily arrested and detained ethnic Chechens,
 some of whom were severely beaten during their arrests. The MVD noted that it
 had 'cracked down on Chechen criminals" in 1996.
 The Government does not employ forced exile.
 
 
 1002
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL-The Constitution provides for an independent Judi-
 ciary. However, the court system remains largely unreformed and the executive
 dominates the judiciary.
 Cases originate in local courts, may move to appeals courts on a district or re-
 gional level, and finally to the Supreme Court. Separate ourts of arbitration handle
 civil disputes, and traditional elders' ourts hande low-leve crime in rural areas.
 The procurator brings the case to court and tries it before a judge and two peo-
 ple's assessors (pensioners or citizens chosen from labor collectives). The accused
 and defense counsel have access to all evidence gathered by the procurator. They
 attend alproceedings, which are generaly public, and are allowed to question wit-
 nees and present evidence. In fat neary anyone in the ourt room may be al-
 lowed to question witnesses. Witnesses do not recapitulate their testimony in court;
 instead they affirm or deny their statements in the procurator's files.  fendan.t
 in criminal cases sometimes are treated in a demeaning manner by being kept in
 cages in the courtroom.
 The court may render one of three decisions: Innocent, guilty, or indeterminate,
 i.e., the case is returned to the procurator for further investigation. In May the Con-
 stitutional Court ruled that only the defense hasthe right o a al. Previously the
 prosecutor could appeal bth acqittals and convictions so that defendants might be
 acquitted by the trial court but then convicted on appeal or have their sentences
 increased. The decision of a court to return a case to the procurator for further in-
 vestigation may not be appealed, and the accused are returned to the procurator's
 custody where they may remain under detention.
 Local elders' courts have committed a number of abuses. They are supposed to try
 petty crimes and decide local disputes but have tried major crimes an handed out
 harsher punishments than allowed in the form of high fines or detention. Torture
 is sometimes used to extract confessions (see Section 1.c.). In an extreme case, an
 elders' court sentenced a man to death by stoning for livestock rustling;, the sentence
 was carried out (see Section l.a.). Defendants m elders' courts may appeal to the
 local administrative court. Prosecutors' offices are monitoring these courts more
 closely but continue to report cases in which these courts exceeded their authority.
 The Government has begun to reform the judicial system. Generally accepted
 international practices, including the presumption of innocence of the accused, have
 been introduced. A new system of court administration is being instituted, and sit-
 ting judges are being tested on their knowledge of the law and new civil codes. If
 they fail these tests, they are removed from office. In what may be an indication
 of growing judicial independence, in November the Constitutional Court ruled that
 the speaker of the legislative lower house had been unconstitutionally elected since
 mandated parliamentary procedure was not followed. The legislature accepted the
 Court's ruling and elected a new speaker.
 The appointment of ethnic Kyry to key positions in the~ udicial system has led
 to charges by non-Kyrgyz that the system is arbitrary andunfair, and that the
 ourts trest K yrgyz more leniently than members of other groups. Although system-
 atic discrimination is not clearly evident, it is credible in some cases.
 Economic crimes such as tax evasion, embezzlement, or theft of government prop-
 erty are common. Prosecution for these crimes, however, is relatively rare and some-
 times appears to be directed at opponents of the Government.
 On January 8, 1997, oppition activist Topchubek Turgunaliev was convicted of
 embezzlement, fraud, and abuse of position, stemming from his service as a univer-
 sity rector in 1994 (Turgunaliev also was convicted in April of defaming President
 Akayev and received a 1 year suspended sentence). He was arrested on December
 17 after organizing a demonstration in Bishkek to protest igh unemployment and
 nonpayment of pensions. The charges on which he was convicted had been brought
 previously, but rejected for lack of evidence. The timing of the case and the lack
 of new evidence suggested that the prosecution was politically motivated.
 Many observers consider Topchubek Turgunaliev a political prisoner.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits unlawful entry into a home against the wishes of the occu-
 pant and states that a person's private life, privacy of correspondence, and tele-
 phonic and telegraphic communications are protected. The law and procedures re-
 quire the General Procurators's approval for wiretaps, searches of homes, intercep-
 tion of mail, and similar acts. A change in the law in 1995 weakened these protec-
 tions by allowing the procurator to give approval for searches over the telephone;
 thus no written proof exists to verify that the search was approved. Furthermore,
 in certain cases law enforcement officers may first carry out a search and then get
 approval within 24 hours. If approval is not given, any evidence seized is inadmis-
 sible in court.
 
 
 1003
 Personnel and organizations responsible for violations during the Soviet period
 have remained largely in place; however, no widespread nor systematic violations
 of the privacy of citizens were reported. There were some reports by citizens active
 in politics or human rights issues that the privacy of their communications was vio-
 lated, but credible evidence is not available.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-A 1992 law calls for freedom of the press and
 mass media but also provides guidelines proscribing publication of certain informa-
 tion. The law supports the right ofjournarits to obtain information, to publish with-
 out prior restraint, and to protect sources. However, it also contains provisions that
 the Government used to restrict press freedom. For example, the law prohibits pub-
 lication of material that advocates war, violence, or intolerance toward ethnic or re-
 ligious groups; desecration of national norms, ethics, and symbols like the national
 seal, anthem, or flag;, publication of pornography and propagation of "false informa-
 tion." The law also states that the press shoud not violate the privacy or dignity
 of individuals. It requires all media to register with the Minist  of Justice and to
 await the Ministry's approval before beginning to operate. The Ministry has ruled
 that foreign entities are not entitled to register. An amendment to the Constitution
 makes the dignity of presidents or former presidents inviolable.
 There are fully independent newspapers and magazines, as well a few hours daily
 of independent television broadcasting and some independent radio stations. How-
 ever, almost all electronic media and a significant portion of print media receive
 government subsidies, which permit the government to influence media coverage,
 especially on radio and television. Two print journalists are still barred from practic-
 ing their profession under a 1995 conviction for libel. No overt efforts to interfere
 with the press were observed in 1996, although at least one journalist complained
 of harassment by police and procurators for expressing independent views. The con-
 viction of two campaign workers and one journalist for criminal defamation of the
 President during the election campai emphasized the limits to freedom of speech.
 Ther were given 1-year suspended sentences in April and then released (see Section
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Under the Constitution, citi-
 zens have the right to assemble and associate freely and do so without government
 interference.
 Permits are required for public marches and gatherings but are routinely avail-
 able. Some peacefl protests took place outside the President's office, mostly pen-
 sioners protesting late pension payments and market vendors protesting tax en-
 forcement.
 The 1991 Law on Public Organizations, which includes labor unions, political par-
 ties, and cultural associations, requires them to register with the Ministry of Jus-
 tice. A bureaucratic mentality, carried over from the Soviet period, is at least partly
 responsible for the delay some organizations experience in registering. Ultimately
 all organizations have been able to register, with the exception of a Uighur organi-
 zation with the stated goal of the creation of an independent Uighur state in north-
 west China.
 c. Freedom of Re/i .a-n-The Constitution and the law provide for freedom of reli-
 gion and the right o ill citizens to choose and practice their own religion; however,
 the Government does not fully protect these rights. The Government does not sup-
 port any religion and expressly forbids the teaching of religion (or atheism) in public
 schools.
 In March the Government created a new State Commission on Religious Affairs,
 officially in order to promote religious tolerance, protect freedom of conscience, and
 oversee laws on religion. In its early months, the commission was not active and
 the Government appeared to resist calls by some Orthodox and Muslim leaders to
 limit the activities of "sects" and "nontraditional religions." By fall, however, the
 commission became more active. The President signed a decree req'uiring all reli-
 gious organizations to register with the commission and announced that a new law
 on religion would be presented to Parliament. Under the new regulations, each con-
 gregation must register separately. As previously, if the group wishes to own prop-
 erty, it must also register with the Ministry of Justice as a legal entity.
 Muslim leaders complain that the commission has begun to make decisions about
 religious events without consulting them. The main Baptist organization reported
 that a congregation of Baptists in Naryn oblast was denied registration both by the
 Ministry of Justice and by the Commission for Religious Affairs. The church filed
 lawsuits and appeals, but the courts upheld the denial of registration. The Baptists
 report that in October police broke into their services and threatened worshipers.
 
 
 1004
 The Chairman of the Commission acknowledged that he was aware of the problems
 of the Naryn Baptists, and said that he had informed the authorities that they were
 to allow the Baptists to worship in peace, but was noncommittal on whether they
 would be allowed to register.
 Religious leaders note with concern that the commission frequently uses the term
 "national security" in its statements. They also worry that references to "preserving
 interconfessional accord7 could be used by traditional religious to prevent smaller
 churches from registering. Both Christians and Muslims have expressed concern
 about the State's apparent intention to take a more intrusive role in religion. Ethnic
 Kyrgyz Christian congregations appear to face special barriers, as do some Muslim
 congregations with foreign support.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-In general Government policy allows free travel within and outside the
 country. However, certain Soviet-era policies continue to complicate internal migra-
 tion, resettlement, and travel abroad. Under the Soviet-era law still in force, citizens
 need official government permission (a "propiska") to work and settle in a particular
 area of the country. Home and apartment owners can legally sell their property only
 to buyers with such permission. This law is not enforced, however, and has become
 irrelevant as people move within the country, freely selling their homes and busi-
 nesses.
 There is no law on emigration. Administrative procedures permit movement of
 pople; however, citizens who apply for passports must present a letter of invitation
 the country the intend to visit or to which they intend to emigrate. They also
 need an exit visa. There were no reports, however, that citizens, after presenting
 such a letter, were denied a passport or an exit visa. A Soviet-era law prohibits emi-
 gration within 5 years of working with state secrets." No one is believed to have
 been barred from emigration under this statute in 1996.
 Emigrants were not prevented from returning to Kyrgyzetan, and there is report-
 edly a small but steady flow of returnees. The Government cooperates with the of-
 fice of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian
 organizations in assisting refugees. The issue of first asylum did not arise in 1996.
 There were no reports of forced return of persons where they feared persecution or
 expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Pol'tial Rights:~ The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the constitutional right to change their government peacefully, but
 have limited ability to do so in practice.
 The Constitution mandates presidential elections every 5 years. There is a two-
 term limit. The President was reelected to a second term in 1995 in a multican-
 didate election marred by irregularities. Parliamentary elections are also held every
 5 years. In 1995 citizens elected a new Parliament in elections marred by irregular-
 ities. In February a referendum was held that amended the Constitution to redis-
 tribute power within the government. The referendum violated the Constitution in
 force at the time and the Law on Referendums. Voter apathy was high, and turnout
 low. The results were reminiscent of the Soviet era with a reported turnout of 98
 percent and an approval margin of 95 percent. Ballot stuffing was rampant.
 e amendments approved in the Februar    y referendum further strengthened the
 formal power of the Preien and his advisors who dominate the Government. The
 Parliament and the judiciary tend to be subordinate to the executive branch, but
 ati show some independence. The overwhelming majority of local government offi-
 cials are not elected but appointed by the President.
 Women and most ethnic minorities are underrepresented in government and poli-
 tics. Only 4 of 105 parliamentary deputies are women. There are four female min-
 isters and the Constitutional Court chairman is a woman. A women's group has
 hformed to recruit, advise, and campign for women candidates in the next par-
 liamentary elections. Russians and Uzbeks are underrepresented in government po-
 sitions.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violatians of Human Rights
 A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, inves-
 iti.ng and pubishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials
 are generally responsive and sensitive to their views. However, in 1996 human
 rights groups and diplomats were denied access to the two opposition activists con-
 victed of slandering the President (see Section 2.a.).
 
 
 1005
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Rdigion, Disability, Lamguage, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for the rights and freedom of individuals and prohibits
 discrimination, including on the basis of language. The Government expresses a
 strong commitment to protecting the rights of members of all ethnic, religious, and
 linguistic groups as well as those of women.
 Women.-Research conducted in 1996 on violence against women showed a notice-
 able increase in such incidents since independence.  ivists note that rape is be-
 coming more common with authorities often ignoring such attacks. Official statistics
 show little change in the number of crimes against women, but medical records
 present a different story with increased hospital admissions of women who have
 been injured by a family member. Many of these incidents are alcohol related. Such
 crimes are treated by the normal criminal process if women press charges, but crime
 statistics indicate that most such crimes go unreported. There are no shelters for
 battered women. The Government has not devised a program to deal with this prob-
 len.
 The law gives equal status to women, and they are well represented in the work
 force, in professions, and in institutions of higher learning. Women are prominent
 in law, accounting, and banking, and play an active role in the growing nongovern-
 ment sector.
 Nonetheless, the deteriorating economic conditions have had a severe impact on
 women, who are more likely to lose their jobs. It is estimated that 70 percent of
 the unemployed are women. Women make u the majority of pensioners who are
 also in much worse condition than previously as inflation has eroded pensions,
 which are often paid late. Women's groups express general concern about the situa-
 tion of rural women. With the end of ommunism, traditional attitudes toward
 women are reasserting themselves strongly in the countryside, where women are
 relegated to the role of wife and mother an educational opportunities are curtailed.
 Wmen's groups are invoked in drafting a family law that will include sections
 on the treatment of women and children within the family.
 Children.-The Government continues to rely on former Soviet law in this sphere,
 but is finding it increasingly ineffective in dealing with aoption issues, custody dis-
 putes, and similar matters. A new family code is s  in the drafing stage.
 Human rights grops and the Kr       Cildren's Fund monitor conditions of chil-
 dren. Human rights grups noto that children who are arrested are usually denied
 lawyers. Police often do not notify parents of the arrest and neither parents nor law-
 yers are present during interrogation, despite laws to the contrary. Children are
 often intimidated into signing confessions and sometimes are placed in cells with
 adult criminals to frighten them. In practice children have restricted rights to travel
 abroad until 16. Before that age, they are not entitled to their own passport and
 usually may travel only when accompanying a parent on the parent's passport.
 The Kyrgyz Children's Fund is concerned about the growing number of street chil-
 dren, many of whom have left home because of abusive or alcoholic parents. The
 organization has opened two shelters, one in Bishkek and one in Osh to provide
 food, clothing, and schooling to such children. The forced marriage of underage girls
 is becoming more common and the authorities often ignore this practice. Cultural
 traditions and social structures discourage victims from going to the authorities.
 Children in rural areas commonly pick crops.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no special law to protect disabled individuals,
 nor any law mandating accessibility. Former Soviet law continues to remain the
 basis for any resolution of complaints. Government officials are inattentive to the
 issue.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minmorities.-Reported complaints of discrimination cen-
 ter on the treatment of citizens who are not ethnic Kyrgyz. In an estimated popu-
 lation of 4.5 million, some 59.7 percent are Kyrgyz, 16.2 percent Russians, 14.1 per-
 cent Uzbeks, and the rest Ukrainians, Tajiks, Kazaks, Tatars, Germans, and others.
 These groups which make u   over 40 percent of the population, are often called the
 Russian-speaking minority. [embers of this minority allege discrimination in hir-
 ing, promotion, and housing. They complain that government officials at all levels
 favor ethnic Kyrgyz. The predominance of ethnic Kyrgyz in government lends
 weight to this clain
 Russian speakers (those who do not speak Kyrgyz) also allege that a ceiling exists
 in government employent that precludes their promotion beyond a certain level.
 The representation of ethnic Kyrgyz at high and intermediate levels of government
 is proportionally much greater than the percentage of ethnic Kyrgyz in the gneral
 population. This gives credence to perceptions that career opportunities are l ted
 for those who are not ethnic Kyrgyi.
 
 
 1006
 The Constitution designates Kyrgyz as the official language but provides for the
 preservation and equal and free development of Russian and other languages used
 m the country. In 1996 Russian was also declared an official language for somepur-
 poses. As a result of these reforms and difficult economic conditions in Russia, us-
 sian emigration has significantly declined with some ethnic Russians returning.
 Ethnic Chechens were reportedly subjected to arbitrary arrest and detention with-
 out charge or on false charges, but these reports could not be confirmed.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1992 Labor Law provides for the right of all
 workers to form and belong to trade unions, and there is no evidence that the Gov-
 ernment tried to obstruct the formation of independent unions. Hearings were held
 on a draft labor law, but it has not been passed. The Federation of Trade Unions
 of the Kyrgyz Republic (The Federation), successor to the former official union, re-
 mains the only trade union umbrella organization in the country, although unions
 are not required to belong to it. The leadership is changing, and some properties
 are being sold off.
 The Federation has been critical of government policies, especially privatization,
 and their impact on working class living standards. The Federation still regards it-
 self as in a process of transition in which it is adjusting its relations with the Gov-
 ernment, with other unions in the former Soviet Union, and with other foreign
 unions. A growing number of smaller unions are not affiliated with the umbrella
 organiation.
 While the right to strike is not codified, strikes are not prohibited. There were
 small strikes of short duration. There were no retaliatory actions against strikers,
 nor were there instances of human rights abuse directed at unions or individual
 workers.
 The law permits unions to form and join federations and to affiliate with inter-
 national trade union bodies. It calls for practices consistent with international
 standards. Since independent unions are still in their infancy, no meaningfil afl-li-
 ation with international trade union bodies has taken place.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectivdy.-The law recognizes the right
 of unions to negotiate for better wages and conditions. Although overall union struc-
 ture and practice are slowly changing from that of the Soviet era, there is growig
 evidence of active union participation in state-owned and privatized enterprises. The
 Government sets the minimum wage, and then each employer sets its own wage lev-
 els.
 The law protects union members from antiunion discrimination and there were
 no recorded instances of discrimination against anyone because of union activities.
 There are free economic zones that can be used as export processing zones. The
 minimum wage law does not apply to workers in the zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law forbids forced or compul-
 sor labor, and it is not known to occur.
 SMinimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 is 18 years. Students are allowed to work up to 6 hours per day in summer or in
 part-time jbs from the age of 16. The law prohibits the use of child labor (under
 age 16); the Ministry of Education monitors enforcement. However, families fre-
 quently call upon their children to work to help support the family.
 e. Acceptabie Conditions of Work.-The Government mandates a national mini-
 mum wage at a level theoretically sufficient to provide minimal subsistence. The
 minimum wage is about $6.00 (75 soms) per month. In practice even the higher me-
 dian wage is considered insufficient to assure a decent standard of living for a work-
 er and family. The Federation is responsible for enforcing all labor laws, including
 the law on minimum wages. Minimum wage regulations are largely observed. How-
 ever, enforcement of labor laws is nonexistent in the growing underground economy.
 Market forces help wages in the unofficial sector to keep pace with official wage
 scales.
 The standard workweek is 41 hours, usually within a 5-day week. For state-
 owned industries, there is a mandatory 24-hour rest period in the workweek.
 Safety and health conditions in factories are poor. The deteriorating economy hin-
 dered enforcement of existing regulations and prevented investment to improve
 health and safety standards. A 1992 law established occupational health and safety
 standards, as well as enforcement procedures. Besides government inspection teams,
 trade unions are assigned active roles in assuring compliance with these measures,
 but the rapidly deteriorating economic situation in the country has made the compli-
 ance record of businesses spotty. Workers have the legal right to remove themselves
 from unsafe working conditions.
