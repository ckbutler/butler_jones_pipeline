 VANUATU
 Vanuatu, a small South Pacific island nation which became independent in 1980,
 has a parliamentary form of government with a 46-member Parliament, including
 a Prime Minister, and a President. The latter's powers are largely ceremonial, ex-
 cept when acting on the advice of the Council of Ministers. Political legitimacy is
 based on majority rule.
 The civilian authorities control the small police and paramilitary mobile forces.
 Because the Vanuatu economy is dependent on international trade, it is vulner-
 able to shifts in world market prices. Growth in tourism and Vanuatu's offshore
 banking center were expected again to lead other sectors of the economy in 1994.
 Restrictions on freedom of speech and press, together with the treatment of
 women, remain the major human rights problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kiling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or      ading Treatment or Punishment.-Con-
 stitutional provisions against torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment
 are observed in practice and enforced by the courts. The law provides that prisoners
 shall have recourse to the Ombudsman, a constitutional position filled for the first
 time in July. Laws and regulations governing the office are still to be defined.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-There were no reports of arbitrary ar-
 rests. Arrest is by warrant. The constitutional provision that suspects must be in-
 formed of the charges and given a speedy hearing before a judge is observed in prac-
 tice. There is no exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria.-The courts uphold constitutional provisions for a
 fair public trial, presumption of innocence until guilt is proven, prohibition against
 double jeopardy, the right of judicial determination of the validity of arrest or deten-
 tion, and appeal to the Supreme Court. The courts are free of military or executive
 interference.
 There were no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-There
 were no reports of arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspond-
 ence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution provides for freedom
 of speech and press, the Government does not fully respect this in practice and fre-
 quently uses its control over access to the media to prevent opposition viewpoints
 from reaching the general public. In 1993 the Government threatened to revoke the
 editor's work permit and the publication license of Vanuascope, an independent
 newspaper, because it defied a government ban on covering the statements of an
 opposition political party. With the demise of Vanuascope early in 1994 due to fi-
 nancial losses, the Government controls all of the nation's domestic media. In De-
 cember the Prime Minister's Office instructed the government-run Vanuatu Broad-
 casting and Television Corporation to submit stories on political events for approval,
 ostensibly to ensure their accuracy.
 A Pacific regional news agency (PACNEWS) was permitted to move its head-
 quarters to Vanuatu in January 1994 and has continued to enjoy freedom to trans-
 mit its stories throughout the region, even when they include criticism of political
 leaders in the country. Correspondents for international media are also allowed to
 
 
 707
 report from Vanuatu without interference; they write largely for external audiences.
 Even so, the Government continues to manipulate the media to its advantage. The
 political opposition and trade unionists often encounter difficult in gettm 5 press
 statements -broadcast and published in state-controlled media. The nation cour
 tends either to uphold the Government's ban on access to media or to refuse to hear
 such cases.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Permits must be obtained to
 hold public demonstrations and rallies. In response to a general strike (see Section
 6.a.), the Government in February obtained a court order prohibiting picketing on
 government property.
 The Government did not restrict the forming of political parties or other groups.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The law provides for freedom of religion and the Govern-
 ment generally respected it in practice. Missionaries of various Christian denomina-
 tions work without restrictions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-All citizens are free to travel internally and externally and to return
 from abroad without restrictions. In the wake of an extended strike (see Section
 6.a.), the Government stopped an athlete from leaving the country to compete in re-
 gional championships.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right freely to change the Government through periodic
 multiparty elections. The Constitution provides for parliamentary elections every 4
 years. The Government is a coalition of Prime Minister Maxime Carlot Korman's
 Francophone Union of Moderate Parties and the Deputy Prime Minister's People's
 Democratic Party, which broke from the Anglophone National United Party in mid-
 year. In opposition are the Vanua'aku Party, National United Party, and three oth-
 ers. Outside observers generally consider campaigns and voting to be fair, although
 government restrictions and pressure on the meia inibit the ability of opposition
 parties to publicize their views (see Section 2.a.).
 There were reports of government discrimination in the prvision of services to
 persons and communities suspected of or known to be supporting opposition political
 candidates. The Government has also been charged with politicly biased employ-
 ment practices (see Section 6.a.).
 In Vanuatu's traditional society, males are dominant and women are frequently
 limited to customary family roles. These traditional attitudes have hampered those
 women who have sought to take more active roles in economic and political life.
 There is only one female member of Parliament.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no restrictions on the formation of local nongovernmental human rights
 organizations (NGO's). Vanuatu's first such NGO, Human Rights Forum, was found-
 ed in late 1994. An NGO to promote and protect the rights of women, The Women's
 Center (formerly Committee on Violence Against Women), provides counseling and
 conducts workshops to improve the status of women.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-While women have equal rights under the law, they are only slowly
 emerging from a traditional culture characterized by male dominance, a general re-
 luctance to educate women and a widespread belief that women should devote
 themselves primarily to childbearing. There are no women serving as leaders in
 Vanuatu's municipalor village councils, churches, or chambers of commerce. Mem-
 bers of the National Council of Women (NCW) view village chiefs as a primary ob-
 stacle to the attainment of social, political, and economic rights by women.
 While no accurate data are available, violence against women, particularly wife
 beating, is reportedly common and on the rise. However very few cases of wife beat-
 ing are brought to the attention of the authorities, and even fewer are prosecuted.
 Usually the women involved drop the cases before trial. In villages, where custom
 is strong, women who have been beaten, abused, or raped frequently suffer greater
 punishment than their abusers. The police are reluctant to intervene in what are
 considered purely domestic matters. Although there are no specific laws against
 spouse beating, the courts have at times dealt severely with such cases, using com-
 mon-law assault as a basis for imposing punishment. At a conference on violence
 sponsored by the Women's Center, a senior government minister said that tradi-
 tional village societies had dealt effectively with women s issues for thousands of
 years and cautioned against "inappropriate" Western notions of equality. The Gov-
 
 
 708
 enent has refused the Center's application to establish a women's refuge, osten-
 sibly because of fears that it would encourage the breakup of families.
 The majority of women enter into marriage through 'bride-price payment". On
 those islands where the custom of paying "bride price" is observed, the woman is
 regarded as the property of the husband and may be dealt with as he chooses. In
 some areas, women are still forced to marry men chosen for them.
 Children.-Children are protected within the traditional extended-family system,
 in accordance with the family's financial resources and access to services. Members
 of the extended family, particularly paternal uncles play an active role in a child's
 development. As a result, virtually no children are homeless or abandoned. Though
 cases of child abuse are sometimes reported, there is no pattern of societal abuse.
 The Government has made education a priority, but access is limited r-nd school at-
 tendance not compulsory.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Most of the population is made up of Mela-
 nesians. Small minorities of Chinese, Fijians, Vietnamese, Tongans, and Europeans
 are generally concentrated in two towns and on a few plantations; they experience
 some discrimination with regard to land ownership. Although there have been alle-
 gations of corrupt practices by a member of the Government, there is no evidence
 to suggest a pattern of ethnic discrimination in the provision of basic services.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no known governmental or national policy on
 the disabled, and no legislation mandates access for the disabled. Their protection
 and care is left to the traditional extended family and to voluntary nongovernmental
 organizations.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The law provides workers with the right to organize
 unions. Unions may not affiliate with international labor federations without gov-
 ernment permission.
 There are 5 trade unions, with a combined membership of more than 4,000, in
 the private and public sectors. The high percentage of the population still engaged
 in subsistence agriculture and fishing deters extensive umon activity. The unions
 are grouped under an umbrella organization, the Vanuatu National Council of
 Trade Unions (VCTU), a member of the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions. The trade unions are independent of the Government.
 Strikes are generally uncommon, due in part to high rates of unemployment. The
 union movement declared the country's first general strike in February in support
 of the long-ruing public servants' strike begun in November 1993 over wages. The
 Vanuatu Teachers union (VTU) and private sector Vanuatu National nion of
 Labor (NUL) joined the Vanuatu Public Servants Union (VPSA) in a 24-hour strike
 in February. During the general strike, there were reports of isolated violence, some
 allegedly instigatedby a government minister. Approximately 50 strikers were ar-
 rested, and 4 were convicted of contempt of court for defying a court order against
 picketing on government property. They were sentenced to 6 months' imprisonment,
 ater suspended. Private sector employers fired at least 20 private sector strikers
 as a result of the general strike. The Government also suspended about 170 teach-
 ers who had joined the strike, although approximately 90 percent have been rein-
 stated. In March the Chief Justice rstrained the VCTU and three of its leaders
 from claiming or alleging to have legal authority to represent their members in rela-
 tion to the strike. In June the Government formally dismissed two VTU leaders
 from their teaching positions for advising members to join the February general
 strike.
 The long-running public servants' strike affected postal, health, and agricultural
 sectors badly. In January the Government dismissed all daily rate workers and sus-
 pended all strikers, approximately 1,200, and reportedly prohibited state-owned
 media from airing union views. At the end of February, the Supreme Court ruled
 that the VPSA had not complied with its own rules when it undertook strike action,
 and it declared the strike illegal, without addressing the legality of the Govern-
 ment's subsequent suspensions. (Public service rules require a hearing before dis-
 missal. No strikers were granted such a hearing.) The Government formally dis-
 missed all strikers in March. Of the approximately 400 full-time public servants dis-
 missed, 100 reportedly applied for reinstatement. Only 15 have been rehired, with
 loss of seniority and rank, amid credible allegations that the Government's decisions
 were politically influenced. In a test case, the court ruled in November that the Pub-
 lic Service Commission should conduct a hearing on the dismissal of a medical doc-
 tor. At year's end, the hearing had not yet been held. Public services are gradually
 returning to normal, but some offices are still understaffed. The law prohibits ret-
 ribution if the strike is legal. In the case of private sector employees, violations
 
 
 709
 would be referred to the Labor Department for conciliation and arbitration. In the
 public sector, violations would be handled by the Public Service Commission.
 In the wake of the strike, in February the Government reportedly stopped a local
 athlete from leaving the country to compete in championship games in New Zealand
 because he had participated in strike action. The Government also reportedly can-
 celed previously approved overseas scholarships for public servants involved in the
 strike.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions exercise the right to
 organize and bargain collectively. Labor unions negotiate wages and conditions di-
 rectly with management. If the two sides cannot agree, the matter is referred to a
 three-member arbitration board appointed by the Minister of Home Affairs. The
 board consists of one representative from organized labor, one from management,
 and the senior magistrate of the magistrate's court. While a dispute is before the
 board, labor may not strike and management may not dismiss union employees.
 Unions and management, however, generally reach agreement on wages without
 having to refer the matter to arbitration. Complaints of antiunion discrimination are
 referred to the Commissioner of Labor. While the law does not require union rec-
 ognition, once a union is recognized, it does prohibit antiunion discrimination. In the
 private sector, violations are referred to the Labor Department for conciliation and
 arbitration; in the public sector, to the Public Service Commission. There are no
 known instances of such complaints.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohi'bits forced or coin-
 pulsory labor, and there have been no reports that either is practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment ofChildren.-The law prohibits children under
 12 years of age from working outside of family-owned agriculture, where many chil-
 dren assist their parents. Employment of children from 12 to 18 years of age is re-
 stricted by occupational category and conditions of labor for example, restrictions on
 employment in the shippindustry and nighttime employment. The Labor Depart-
 ment effectively enlorces these laws. The high level of unemployment discourages
 the use of child labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Vanuatu has a legislated minimum wage, ef-
 fectively enforced by the Labor Department. Minimum wage rates were last raised
 in November 1991 to $107 monthly for urban workers and $93 monthly for rural
 workers (13,200 and 11,440 Vat, respectively). Agricultural workers' minimum
 wages are tied to market prices for copra and cocoa. Most workers are not in the
 wage economy and are thus outside the scope of the minimum wage laws. For those
 covered by them, the wages provide an adequate standard of living within the local
 context.
 Various laws regulate the rights to sick leave, annual vacations, and other condi-
 tions of employment, including a 44-hour maximum workweek, with at least one 24-
 hour rest period. Vanuatu's Employment Act, enforced by the Labor Department, in-
 cluds provisions for safety standards. However, the 1987 safety and health legisla-
 tion is inadequate to protect workers engaged in logging, agriculture, construction,
 and manufacturing, and the single inspector attached to the Labor Department is
 hard pressed to enforce the Act fully  orkera do have the right to remove them-
 selves from dangerous work situations.
