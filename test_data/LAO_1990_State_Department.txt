 LAOS
 The Lao People's Democratic Republic (LPDR) is an
 authoritarian, one-party state. The Lao People's
 Revolutionary Party (LPRP) is the primary source of political
 authority, in the country, and the party's leadership imposes
 broad and arbitrary controls on Laos' 4 million people.
 Although the draft constitution now under consideration
 declares that power is exercised through the Supreme People's
 Assembly and the Local People's Councils, the document makes
 the LPRP's supremacy clear.
 In 1990 the Supreme People's Assembly took a more active role
 in political affairs, voting on a new constitution that woula
 confer substantial powers on that body, including the right to
 remove the head of state. The Government has made developing
 "rule by law" a major goal, and the new constitution will set
 up a system of public courts. A new penal code enacted in
 November 1989 provides new protections for some categories of
 rights while restricting others.
 The LPDR was established in 1975, but a draft constitution was
 presented only in mid-1990. The document, which is expected
 to enter into force in the first quarter of 1991, was written
 by a committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, which was
 elected in 1989. The LPRP approved all candidates in that
 election, though a number of victorious candidates were not
 party members. New elections are expected in 1991 under the
 constitution, which provides for secret ballot and universal
 suffrage and imposes few restrictions on who may run for
 office. The Government is also developing a system of
 published laws for the first time. Laws on contracts, private-
 property, and inheritance are in various stages of development.
 The Ministry of Interior (MOI) is the main instrument of state
 control. Although little is known by outsiders about the
 MO's police-, they are believed to be active in monitoring Lao
 society and expatriates who live in Laos. The LPRP also has
 its own system of informants, in workplaces and residential
 communities, who monitor and control events.
 Laos is one of the poorest countries in the world. The
 Government's harsh policies, particularly in its first 5
 years, combined with difficult economic conditions in general,
 drove some 350,000 Lao into exile. Among those refugees were
 most of the educated elite. Since 1985 the Government has
 instituted a series of ambitious economic reforms, known as
 the "New Economic Mechanism," that have shifted the country
 from a centrally planned system to a more market-oriented
 economy. The economic reform program has improved the economy
 and allowed many people to participate in the emerging private
 or mixed state/private sector, but the average standard of
 living remains extremely low.
 The human rights situation in Laos, which showed some
 improvement in 1989, was mixed in 1990. There was progress
 in some areas, such as increased freedom of religion, somewhat
 broader opportunities for political discourse, and
 presentation of a draft constitution embodying human rights
 guarantees. Severe limitations remained, however, on freedom
 of speech and press, freedom of assembly, and the right of
 citizens to change their government. In addition, the
 Government reportedly tightened some forms of internal control
 in 1990, as developments in Eastern Europe and a liberalizing
 
 
 944
 LAOS
 economy sparked concern over its ability to control the pace
 and scope of political reforms.
 The Government closed most reeducation camps and released most
 camp inmates before 1990. However, an unknown number of
 inmates, believed to be at least 33, are entering their 15th
 year of detention without benefit of judicial trial or legal
 review. Many former camp prisoners have been able to obtain
 work, some in responsible positions with government or
 international organizations. Others have gone into private
 business. Some, however, appear to be blacklisted and able to
 find only menial positions. In general, those released from
 the camps are able to obtain passports and exit visas freely
 and have been able to travel overseas. Some have decided to
 emigrate.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Following the announcement by antigovernment insurgents of the
 formation of a provisional government in exile in December
 1989, reports of shooting incidents involving armed groups
 leaving or entering Laos illegally increased significantly.
 Most of these insurgents appear to be former Royal Lao Army
 soldiers and Hmong tribesmen. A group of insurgents
 reportedly set up a temporary base area in Laos in December
 1989, leading to increased fighting as government forces
 ejected the insurgents. The increased fighting was
 accompanied by a greater number of people reported killed in
 military operations against insurgent forces. There have been
 reliable reports of the use of aircraft for ground attack,
 causing civilian deaths, and of insurgent attacks on
 progovernment villages. Insurgents have claimed repeatedly
 that the Lao military used chemical weapons against them in
 early 1990. Despite considerable investigation, no credible
 evidence has been found to support these claims.
 Both sides are reported to have used brutal tactics on
 occasion, with the insurgents attempting assassination and
 ambush of civil and military officials as well as private
 citizens. The insurgents reportedly ambushed a convoy of
 government vehicles and burned several civilian buses in early
 1990, resulting in dozens of deaths. Insurgents have also
 reportedly burned down uncooperative villages. There have
 been recurrent reports of attacks by bandit groups in isolated
 areas. Official policy calls for the execution of insurgent
 leaders, but no such executions were reported in 1990.
 b. Disappearance
 No disappearances were reported in 1990.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 At least 33 "reeducation" prisoners continue to be held in
 harsh conditions, but details are not available. One former
 detainee reported that there was no physical torture but that
 detainees were subjected to psychological abuse. The penal
 code prohibits torture or mistreatment of accused persons or
 
 
 945
 LAOS
 prisoners, and the police do not appear to use torture or
 degrading or ruel treatment during arrest or detention,
 although, prison conditions are stark. There have been claims
 from refugees of torture and other abuse, but it is unknown to
 what extent this may have occurred in 1990.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Government continues to maintain reeducation camps, or
 "seminar camps," in which people who served the Royal Lao
 government or who have offended the current Government are
 imprisoned. Even rough estimates for the population of these
 camps are difficult to make, but they range from a minimum df
 33 political detainees, left from the original population of
 Royal Lao government officials, to several hundred. The
 higher humber reportedly includes the original 33 plus many
 who were imprisoned during the late 1970's and the 1980's.
 Many of the remaining detainees live in a kind of internal
 exile in isolated provincial areas with severe restrictions on
 their freedom of movement. Some reportedly have been assigned
 to collective farms or construction units near their former
 camps in individual "reeducation" assignments and have had
 their travel restricted. Others who have lost property and
 families are reported to have remained in areas near the camps
 out of necessity.
 Government officials continue to claim that all soldiers and
 officials sent to the camps in 1975-76 have been released and
 that those who remain in remote areas do so of their own free
 will. The accuracy of these statements cannot be verified
 because the Government refuses to allow independent observers
 access to such persons. It is more reasonable to assume that
 some degree of coercion plays a significant role in most if
 not all of these cases. There are reliable reports that some
 prisoners in Houaphanh Province are forbidden to return to
 Vientiane, though they can move about relatively freely in
 that province and receive mail and financial assistance from
 friends and family. There were reports of releases of groups
 of up to 300 persons in 1988 and of additional releases in
 1989, but firm numbers are not available. Since 1979,
 conditions in the remaining camps reportedly have improved.
 Those accused of hostility to the regime or of what the
 Government calls "socially undesirable habits," such as
 prostitution, drug abuse, idleness, and "wrong thought," are
 arbitrarily arrested and sent to "rehabilitation" centers,
 usually without public trial. Most of these people have been
 allowed to return to their homes after periods, ranging from a
 few months to several years, of forced labor, political
 indoctrination, and admission of guilt.
 The penal code enacted in November 1989 contains some
 protections for those accused of crimes, such as a statute of
 limitations and provisions for public trials. The Government
 is trying to strengthen the rule of-law and is setting up a
 system of courts to administer justice publicly for the first
 time since the change of government in 1975. It remains to be
 seen, however, how these provisions will be implemented.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Supreme People's Assembly enacted a criminal code and laws
 establishing a judiciary in November 1989, but these steps
 have. not yet made a significant difference in the
 
 
 946
 LAOS
 administration of justice. It is not known what changes these
 laws may make in Lao legal procedures. At present the courts
 are not independent, and there is no guarantee of due
 process. Prior to the recently passed penal code, the
 Government had promulgated interim rules and regulations for
 the arrest and trial of those accused of specific crimes,
 including armed resistance to the Government. Although the
 regulations allow an accused person to make a statement
 presenting his side of the case, they provide no real
 opportunity for the accused to defend himself and do not
 permit bail or use of a freely chosen attorney. Rather, the
 Government has issued instructions on how to investigate,
 prosecute, and punish wrongdoers. These instructions are
 applied capriciously and inconsistently.
 People can be arrested on unsupported accusations and without
 being informed of the charges or of the accusers' identities.
 Government officials and their families can often influence
 judgments. Regulations call for judgment to be given in
 public, however, this is only a public announcement of the
 sentence and not a true public trial. There is some provision
 for appeal, although important political cases tried by
 "people's courts" reportedly may not be appealed. The Council
 of Ministers must approve death sentences, but there were no
 reports of capital sentences in 1990.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 As the economy has undergone considerable liberalization,
 there appears to have been a significant relaxation of some
 elements of state control, including police monitoring of
 personal and business activities and enforcement of the
 nighttime curfew. However, in 1990 there were credible
 reports that the Government tightened restrictions in some
 areas, perhaps in response to increased insurgent activity,
 anxiety over developments in the former Communist bloc, and
 concern about its declining control over the economy. Search
 and seizure continue to be authorized by the security bureaus
 rather than by judicial authority, and government regulations,
 which are not always followed, provide little protection. The
 draft constitution and the 1989 penal code address these
 issues, but changes have not yet been observed in practice.
 The draft constitution specifically requires search warrants.
 At present, there is probably some monitoring of international
 and domestic mail and telephone calls, although the new penal
 code outlaws listening to telephone calls or secretly
 examining documents without proper authorization. The
 Government is lifting restrictions on the sale of privately
 owned land and instituting a procedure for the return of land
 confiscated after the change of government to the original
 owners. It is too early to judge the effectiveness of this
 process.
 The Government and party continue to monitor some aspects of
 family and work life through a system of neighborhood and
 workplace informants. There have been reports that an
 undetermined number of people, including suspected prostitutes
 and some returned students from Eastern Europe, were rounded
 up and sent for political and social reeducation for a month
 or more.
 
 
 LAOS
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Public expression of opposition to the party and State is not
 permitted, and participants in such activity have been
 jailed. In October-three people, including one current and
 one former senior government official, were arrested for
 violating-Articles 52-and 59"of the penal code, which-ban acts
 of rebellion and sedition. The three reportedly wrote-an
 article advocating political reform, including multiparty
 elections. There have been demonstrations by Lao students in
 Eastern European countries calling for a democratic,
 multiparty system. Private criticisms of official policies
 are heard more frequently. The new penal code bars slandering
 the State, including distorting party or state policies, and
 spreading false rumors conducive to disorder, prescribing I to
 5 years' imprisonment for such offenses. The penal code also
 bars dissemination of books and other materials deemed
 indecent or "infringing" on the national culture.
 Newspapers and the state radio and television are instruments
 of the Government, reflecting only its views. There are.
 limitations on which foreign publications-can be imported,
 though some Thai newspapers are-sold..-The Government makes no
 effort to discourage reception of Thai-radio or television,
 which are widely watched and heard in Vientiane and other
 parts of the country. Academic freedom does not exist, but
 the content of many courses has been expanded to include a
 wider variety of materials, including many previously
 forbidden.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government controls most large public gatherings and,
 except for religious, athletic, and communal events, organizes
 them. The new penal code expressly forbids demonstrations or
 protest'marches aimed at causing turmoil and social
 instability, prescribing penalties of I to 5 years'
 imprisonment. Unspecified "destabilizing subversive
 activities" are also banned, with penalties ranging from house
 arrest to death. All associations--such as those for youth,
 women, workers, and a "peace organization"--are party
 controlled and disseminate official policy. The LPRP
 organizes all professional groups, and their leadership is
 often drawn from party ranks.
 Associations are permitted to maintain relations with
 like-minded, politically acceptable organizations in other
 countries, though the definition of what organizations are
 politically acceptable has been relaxed in some cases.
 Contact between ordinary Lao citizens and foreigners is
 increasihg as restrictions, such as the requirement that the
 Government approve invitations to most foreigners' homes, are
 no longer consistently enforced and appear to be changing.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Nearly all lowland Lao-are Buddhists and most highland Lao are
 animists. In official statements, the Government has
 recognized the right to free exercise of religious belief as
 well as the contributions religion can make to the development
 of the country. The draft constitution cdntains explicit
 guarantees of religious freedom, though this is limited to
 "legitimate activities," excluding "divisive acts."
 
 
 948
 LAOS
 While the new penal code prohibits entrance into the clergy
 without government approval, and the Government still monitors
 and tries to control the clergy to some extent, its policy
 with regard to Buddhist organizations has improved
 substantially in recent years. The Government is no longer
 actively engaged in a long-term effort to subvert religion.
 The open practice of Buddhism is now tolerated, and many
 Buddhist temples are being repaired and reopened. Monks
 remain the only social group still entitled to special
 honorific terms of address, which even high party and
 government officials use. Buddhist clergy are prominently
 featured at important state and party functions, and most high
 party officials now participate in religious ceremonies.
 The Government permits religious festivals without hindrance.
 Links with coreligionists and religious associations in other
 countries, usually other Communist countries, require
 government approval. The Government does not formally ban
 missionaries from entering Laos to proselytize but in practice
 almost always denies them permission to enter.
 Roman Catholics and Protestants are permitted to worship, and
 new churches were permitted to open in 1990, but the
 activities of these churches are probably monitored. The
 Government tries through the news media and other means to
 persuade highland minority groups to abandon their
 "old-fashioned" animist beliefs.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Although it has relaxed requirements, the Government retains
 the right to require citizens to obtain permission from the
 authorities for internal travel. Non-Lao residents in
 Vientiane must obtain permission to travel outside the city,
 though this requirement has also been eased. Government
 officials have cited threats of "disorders" created by
 "reactionary elements" as the reason for the restrictions.
 Foreign travel is increasingly permitted for officials,
 students, and those who have family abroad. Passports and
 exit visas are widely available. Travel to the United States
 and other Western countries has increased sharply in the past
 several years. Border crossing permits are available for
 those with business in Thailand. The permits are not,
 however, granted automatically and may be denied arbitrarily.
 Legal emigration is rarely authorized for ethnic Lao, but in
 the past year or so Laos appears to have adopted a de facto
 policy of free emigration. Most Lao, even those who have been
 released from reeducation camps or have otherwise run afoul of
 the Government, appear to be able to obtain passports and exit
 visas. In addition, many young people are able to obtain exit
 permission even though many of their predecessors had decided
 to stay in the United States. Nevertheless, the new penal
 code considers "misleading people to depart illegally from
 Laos" a crime. In recent years, the Government reportedly has
 imprisoned some people seeking to leave the country
 illegally.
 The Government has announced a policy of welcoming back the
 approximately 10 percent of the population that fled after the
 1975 change of government. A number of organized groups of
 expatriate Lao have returned temporarily to investigate
 business possibilities, and some have petitioned for the
 
 
 949
 LAOS
 return of properties- expropriated in the 1970's. Laos has
 also agreed to take back, on a case-by-case basis, its  .
 citizens who had crossed into Thailand but now wish to return
 home, and also to return properties that were confiscated.
 Since May 1980, when the Lao Government reached agreement on a
 repatriation program with Thailand and the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), over 5,800 Lao have
 voluntarily returned to Laos under UNHCR auspices. Lowland
 Lao -ave made up the majority of returnees, though about 1,000
 hill tribe Lao had applications for voluntary repatriation
 pending as of August. In June 1989 at Geneva, the Lao
 Government was one of 56 governments that agreed to the
 Comprehensive Plan of Action (CPA). Since then, Lao asylum
 seekers in Thailand have been processed in accord with the
 CPA, both for repatriation'and for determination of status
 under UNHCR-auspices.
 Those who return receive several days of political
 indoctrination and then are released, generally to return to
 their home areas. The UNHCR provides them basic necessities
 and is given regular access to them to monitor their treatment
 and living conditions. According to the UNHCR, returnees are
 generally not the subject of discrimination, official or
 otherwise, and are allowed back into Laos with all the
 belongings they accumulated in Thailand or third countries.
 In addition to those repatriated under the UNHCR program, an
 estimated 20,000 people have repatriated themselves without
 official involvement.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government.
 The LPRP is run by a relatively small elite who also occupy
 most of the principal government posts. Although changes in
 the new national assembly have broadened and publicized
 political discourse, there is still little freedom to
 participate in politics outside the party and no popular
 choice of policies.
 The Supreme People's Assembly elected by secret ballot in 1989
 includes a number of legislators who are not members of the
 LPRP, although all candidacies were approved by the party.
 Some 121 candidates ran for a total of 79 seats, and each
 multimember electoral district had more candidates than
 seats. This election followed similar elections for district
 and provincial officials in r988. No other parties were
 permitted to organize and voting was mandatory.
 The Supreme People's Assembly has drafted a constitution that
 is expected to be approved in the first quarter of 1991. The
 draft constitution contains guarantees of the primary human
 rights, including freedom of religion, private property, and
 elections by secreat ballot of most important officials,
 including judicial officials. The draft constitution
 stipulates the primacy of the LPRP but does not specifically
 forbid other parties.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Laos generally does not cooperate with international human
 rightq organizations. It has, however,- permitted visits by
 
 
 950
 LAOS
 officials of international humanitarian organizations and has
 communicated with them by letter. No domestic human rights
 groups are allowed.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Approximately one-half of the population of Laos is ethnic
 Lao, also called "lowland Lao," and the other half is a mosaic
 of upland hill tribes. The Government is attempting to
 integrate these groups through voluntary programs and to
 overcome traditional antagonisms between lowland Lao and
 minority groups. Women and minority groups have explicitly
 guaranteed voting rights, and there is little legal
 discrimination against them. The LPRP and the Government
 continue, however, to be dominated by lowland Lao males.
 Efforts have been made to include minorities in the political
 and governmental elites. For instance, 43 of the 121
 candidates for the Supreme People's Assembly were from
 minority groups.
 The Hmong, a significant upland group, are split along clan
 lines. During the years of insurgency, many were strongly
 anti-Communist; others sided with the Lao Communists and the
 Vietnamese. The Government has repressed many of those groups
 that fought against it, especially those continuing to resist
 .its authority by force. The Hmong tried to defend some of.
 their tribal areas after 1975, and some reportedly continue to
 support insurgent groups. Lao armed forces conduct operations
 against armed insurgents, most of whom are Hmong. There were
 also credible reports of bombing, aimed at insurgent groups,
 that may have caused unnecessary civilian casualties.
 Local ethnic Chinese encountered government suspicion and
 surveillance after 1979, when Sino-Lao relations deteriorated
 seriously. This has abated, however, since relations between
 Laos and China improved greatly in 1988. A majority of the
 Chinese community left in the post-1975 period. Those who
 remain have maintained government-approved Chinese schools in
 Vientiane and Savannakhet as well as Chinese associations in
 several provincial capitals.
 Traditionally, women in Lao society have been subservient to
 men and often have been discouraged from obtaining an
 education. Today, the active but government-controlled Lao
 Women's Federation has as one of its stated goals the
 achievement of equal rights for women. The Government claims
 that a higher percentage of women make up the school
 population now than before 1975 and that women are being
 encouraged to assume a greater role in economic and
 state-controlled political activity. Women, though absent
 from top party and state ranks, occupy responsible positions
 in government and private business. There is no pattern of
 widespread domestic or culturally approved violence against
 women, but both lowland Lao and hill tribes tend to hold women
 in lower esteem than men.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 An estimated 80-85 percent of Lao are subsistence farmers.
 Among salaried workers, the overwhelming majority are employed
 by the State. There is no cogent set of labor laws and no
 minimum wage. The Supreme People's Assembly has enacted a
 
 
 951
 LAOS
 labor law but its text has not yet been publicly released.
 While some labor unions exist, they have no right to strike
 and are controlled by the Federation of Lao Trade Unions,
 which in turn is controlled bytthe LPRP.
 Laos is a member of the International Labor Organization (ILO)
 but has not ratified ILO Convention 87 on freedom of
 association, Convention 98 on the right to organize and
 bargain collectively, or any other ILO convention related to
 the worker rights covered in this report.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 There isno right to organize and bargain collectively. In-
 addition, unions play no discernible role in ameliorating the
 low wages of public employees, the largest single category of
 employment in the cash economy. The foreign investment code
 published in 1988, however, guarantees some worker rights,
 such as the right to have job responsibilities defined, to be
 paid for that job and not another, and to be paid more for
 overtime. There is no prohibition of employer discrimination
 against unions, but, given the controlled nature of union
 activity, this would play a very limited role in expanding
 worker rights. There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 There is no general pattern of forced labor in Laos, though
 there is no law prohibiting it. Prisoners in reeducation
 camps or in prison camps (the former for "ideological" crimes,
 the latter for "economic" or "social" offenses) are expected
 to do manual:.labor, including growing their own food. In
 addition, there are reports that some of these prisoners, when
 released, are restricted to the general area of the camp
 (often in mountainous terrain) and expected to work there on
 state enterprises.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 There is no minimum age for employment of children. In
 practice, children in this rural economy commonly assist in
 the work of their families. Employment of children in Laos'
 small but growing industrial sector is not widespread,
 although it is common in urban shops.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of-Work
 Laos is a very poor country that suffers from many difficult
 circumstances. Workplace conditions are not systematically
 exploitative but often fail to protect workers adequately
 against sickness or accident. There is no specific system of
 worker safety laws or regulations. There is also no law
 regulating the workweek, but working hours do not normally  -
 exceed 4B hours a week. Wages are extremely low, particularly
 in the large state sector. In fact, they are barely
 sufficient to live on unless supplemented by other sources of
 income. Some workers receive paid vacations.
