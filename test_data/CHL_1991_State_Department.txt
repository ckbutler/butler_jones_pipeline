 CHILE
 After more than 16 years of military rule, democracy was
 restored to Chile on March 11, 1990, with the inauguration of
 President Patricio Aylwin. The fiew Congress is an active and
 independent legislative body, comprising 120 Deputies and 38
 Senators who were elected in December 1989. An additional nine
 Senators were appointed during the previous military
 government, depriving the elected Aylwin Government of a
 majority in that body. There is a separate, independent
 judicial branch which, however, -is dominated by appointees of
 the former military regime.
 Civilian control of the military is increasing but not
 complete; the armed forces remain largely autonomous
 institutions. The Minister of Defense is a civilian appointed
 by the President and responsible for oversight of the
 military. General Augusto Pinochet, the only member of the
 1973 junta still on active duty, remained as commander in chief
 of the army after the transition to civilian goverrnment, a
 posit'ion he may hold until 1997 under a constitutional
 provision approved during the military regime. The national
 police, or Carabineros, have primary responsibility for public
 order and safety, crime control, and border security. The
 Investigations Police are responsible for controlling and
 investigating serious crime. Both police organizations,
 although under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Defense, are
 under the operational control of the Minister of Interior.
 Chile's economy is based on free market principles and has a
 dynamic and growing export sector. Copper is Chile's major
 source of foreign exchange, followed by fresh fruits and fish
 meal. This was the eighth consecutive year of real economic
 growth. Despite weak rates of job creation, the rate of
 unemployment remained relatively unchanged from 1990.
 In 1991 the principal human rights problems included the need
 to address past human tights violations committed during the
 military regime, incidents of torture by police, terrorist
 violence, and restrictive legislation inherited from nearly 17
 years of military rule. President Aylwin in March released a
 comprehensive report by the National Commission on Truth and
 Reconciliation that implicated the security forces in over
 2,000 cases of murder and disappearance during the 1973-90
 military regime headed by General Pinochet. Based on the
 Commission's recommendations, the Aylwin Government presented
 the Congress with a compensation package for the families of
 the victims mentioned in the report. Other legislation amended
 vaguely defined and far-reaching state security laws and
 transferred from military tribunals to civilian courts crimes
 relating to state security.
 The Chilean Government showed a strong commitment to bring to
 justice those individuals indicted by a U.S. grand jury in
 connection with the 1976 murders in Washington, D.C., of former
 Chilean official Orlando Letelier and his American associate
 Ronni Moffitt. The case passed from military to civilian court
 jurisdiction; the Supreme Court reopened the investigation; and
 a special investigating judge indicted the suspected authors of
 the crime for murder and passport fraud. The Supreme Court
 subsequently upheld the indictments, and the case at year's end
 was headed for trial.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Political and other extrajudicial killings were largely the
 result of terrorist action. Two terrorist organizations, the
 dissident wing of the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front (FPMR/D)
 and elements of the Lautaro Youth Movement (MJL), were
 responsible for most of the political violence. The April 1
 assassination of Independent Democratic Union (UDI) Senator
 Jaime Guzman, a leading rightist political figure; was the
 first terrorist assault directed against a demociatically
 elected legislator in recent Chilean history. A self-described.
 spokesman for the FPMR/D claimed responsibility for the
 attack. A special investigating judge was assigned to the
 case. Unidentified gunmen assassinated retired army physician
 Carlos Perez Castro and his wife on March 3, the day before the
 public release of the report of the Commission on Truth and
 National Reconciliation; he had previously received numerous
 FPMR/D telephone threats. Perez Castro, who allegedly'advised
 the National Intelligence Center (CNI> on the medical condition
 of torture victims during the military dictatorship, was
 sanctioned by Chile's national medical association for
 unethical behavior in 1983. The MJL claimed responsibility for
 the murder on March 15 of Investigations Police Chief Hector
 Sarmiento Hidalgo in Concepcion. The Government continues to
 investigate these cases and has requested the extradition of a
 Chilean citize in Spain who is suspected of having
 participated in the Guzman assassination. The Government has
 also been increasing the number of uniformed police to better
 combat both crime and terrorism.
 Eight police officers were killed during the year in
 confrontations with Chilean terrorists; most were gunned down
 by the MJL while patrolling the streets. Nine terrorists were
 killed in 1991; a bomb killed two of them allegedly just before
 they were to place it at the home of the Senate's Vice
 President.
 According to government records, leftwing terrorist groups in
 1991 caused 46 personal injuries in attacks which included 173
 bombings through November 30. A failed rocket attack on a U.S.
 Marine van injured one U.S. serviceman in February; the FPMR/D
 claimed responsibility. There were more than 30 bombings of
 Mormon churches through November 30; most were conducted by
 elements of the MJL. Several offices of the center-right
 political parties National Renewal (RN) and the Independent
 Democratic Union (UDI) were bombed, as was the residence of the
 Supreme Court president.
 In March President Aylwin released the findings and
 recommendations of the Commission on. Truth and National
 Reconciliation, or Rettig Commission, which he appointed in
 1990 to report on human rights abuses that took place during
 the 1973-1990 military regime. The report held the security
 forces responsible for more than 2,000 cases of murder and
 disappearance that occurred during that time. According to the
 report, many of the victims were poor young males, and nearly
 half of the victims had no known political affiliation. The
 report also concluded, among other things, that the judiciary
 had been ineffective when faced with human rights violations,
 that the National Intelligence Directorate (DINA), the secret
 
 
 526
 CHILE
 police agency, had targeted political opponents of the military
 regime for elimination and was responsible only to General
 Pinochet, and that the regime's claim that it was fighting an
 internal war in the years follow ing the coup was not valid,
 given that the regime had established effective control over
 the country within days of the 1973 coup with very little armed
 opposition.
 The Commission recommended that the Government compensate the
 families of the victims with financial payments and special
 health care services, among other benefits. Though the
 Government's proposed legislation on reparations was still
 under consideration in Congress by year's end, the package was.
 expec.ted to be approved without difficulty. The Commission
 also emphasized the need to determine the fate of the missing
 by establishing a national foundation that would assist in
 locating them.
 President Aylwin, while reaffirming the validity of the 1978
 amnesty law, called upon the Supreme Court to reconsider its
 decision not to investigate offenses falling under that law,
 arguing that while the ultimate sentencing might be negated by
 that law, the facts and guilt should be determined in
 individual cases. *The Court, however, chose not to do so,
 interpreting the law as proscribing such investigations.
 However, the Catholic Church's Vicariate of Sol'darity
 succeeded in having some individual civilian judges reopen
 certain investigations. In September, at the Santiago general
 cemetery, authorities disinterred 125 bodies of victims who
 were detained by security personnel and who then disappeared
 during the months immediately following the military coup. For
 the first time, a Santiago appeals court in November indicted
 an active duty army officer in connection with the
 disappearance of two Chilean youths in 1974, ruling that
 kidnaping is not covered by the 1978 Amnesty Law. The Supreme
 Court, however, suspended the detention order while it reviewed
 whether the amnesty law is applicable.
 At the request of the Aylwin government, the Supreme Court in
 July appointed Supreme Court Judge Adolfo Bafiados to reopen the
 investigation into the 1976 car bomb murders in Washington,
 D.C., of former Chilean Foreign Minister Orlando Letelier and
 his assistant Ronni Moffitt, a U.S. citizen. In September
 Judge Bafiados, the first appointment by President Aylwin to- the
 19-member Supreme Court, indicted retired General Manuel
 Contreras and Colonel Pedro Espinoza in connection with the
 crime. Contreras had served the military regime as director of
 DINA, the precursor to CNI, and Espinoza had served as DINA's
 chief of operations. The Supreme Court upheld the indictments
 against the two men in November. In a related action in July,
 both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate ratified an
 agreement reached between the Governments of the United States
 and Chile'in June 1990 in which the Governments were to convene
 a commission under provisions of the 1914 Bryan-Suarez treaty
 to determine the amount of ex gratia compensation the Chilean
 Government would.pay the Letelier and Moffitt families.
 Carmen Gloria Quintana, who was seriously burned in a
 confrontation with a military patrol in 1986, and the family of
 Rodrigo Rojas, who died of burns in the same confrontation,
 filed an appeal to the Supreme Court in 1991, but no decision
 had been rendered by year's end. A military appeals court in
 1990 had overturned a serious injury finding by a military
 tribunal in 1989. There was little advancement in other
 outstanding cases against Carabinero officers.
 
 
 527
 CHILE
 b. Disappearance
 There were no confirmed cases of politically motivated
 kidnaping in 1991. Unidentified assailants, however,
 reportedly abducted a son of the owner of the El Mercurio
 newspaper in September. In March the Rettig Commission
 concluded that the security forces were responsible for 957
 cases of disappearance following the 1973 coup and that there
 was substantial evidence that the victims were dead (see
 Section l.a.).
 c. Torture and. Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Credible reports of torture by some Carabinero and
 Investigations Police units continued. The Chilean Human
 Rights Commission (CHRC)'reported 32 instances of torture as of
 August 30. The most serious case was of six suspected MJL
 members believed responsible for the murder of the
 Investigations Police Chief in Concepcion. The detainees were
 held incommunicado for several weeks-and reportedly beaten by
 Investigations Police during detention. Some allegedly were
 subjected to electric shock. There were other credible -
 complaints of mistreatment and torture in 1991, including sleep
 deprivationIbeatings, and threats by the Carabineros's Third
 Commissary in Santiago.
 Judicial investigations of torture have seldom been concluded,
 due in large part to the refusal of some- state security ,
 organizations to comply with court orders to make security
 agents available to the courts for questioning. The ,
 unwillingness of members of the judiciary, many of them
 appointed by the military regime, to 'pursue human rights cases-
 has been responsible, at-least in-part, for the'failure to ."
 investigate and prosecute cases of torture and other
 mistreatment by police.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under article 19 of the Constitution, civilian and military
 courts may order detention for 5 days, and extend it up to 10
 days, for suspected terrorist acts. Under 1991 legal reforms-,
 detainees are to be provided immediate anddailyaccess to a
 doctor to verify their physical condition. With few
 exceptions, this practice appears to have been observed. In
 politically motivated crimes or cases of suspected terrorists,
 some judges have denied detainees their leqally protected right
 to access to a lawyer. Though most cases-related to the .
 antiterrorist law were transferred to civilian courts in 1991,-
 ad hoc military prosecutors continue to hold open
 investigations of two cases: the discovery of arms caches in
 1986 and the 1986 assault on a bakery in which a Carabinero
 official was killed.
 Despite the Constitutional prohibitions, incidents of arbitrary
 arrest increased in 1991. The CHRC reported 101 arbitrary
 individual arrests and 77 arrests during demonstrations through
 November 1991. Many of those detained were never charged and
 were released after several days. In April, for example,
 immediately after the assassination of Senator Guzman, police
 detained approximately 500 people, but released them shortly
 thereafter.
 
 
 528
 CHILE
 There were no cases of forced exile in 1991, but some Chileans
 convicted of politically motivated crimes during the military
 regime opted to go abroad to secure their release from jail.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Jurisdiction for the prosecution of proscribed political
 activities remains with the regular civilian courts, but under
 the military government a broad interpretation of state
 security laws had greatly expanded the jurisdiction of military
 courts over these cases. The Government's 1991 package of
 legal reforms, or "Cumplido Laws," limited the jurisdiction of
 military courts and transferred many such cases to the civilian
 courts. The Social Aid Foundation of the Christian Churches
 (FASIC) reported that, as of early December, 63 persons charged
 with violating state security laws before March 11, 1990,
 remained in jail. In 1991 the antiterrorist law was revised to
 better define security crimes, and some penalties were reduced
 to reflect more appropriate punishments.
 Trial is not by jury, reliance is on the written record rather
 than oral testimony, and the judge renders a verdict after
 directing the investigation. The investigation phase is
 considered secret, with limited access for the accused or his
 attorney to evidence or testimony which has been developed by
 the judge. There is a well-developed, multistage appeal
 process leading ultimately to the Supreme Court.
 The courts made little progress during 1991 in investigating
 past human rights violations (see Section l.a.). Although the
 broad jurisdiction of military tribunals over civilians was
 reduced in 1991, military tribunals generally retain
 jurisdiction over all cases where active duty military
 personnel are charged with a crime, including instances of
 crimes committed against civilians. Military personnel have
 only rarely been convicted for human rights abuses; to prevent
 further investigation, military tribunals often seek
 jurisdiction in cases in which military officials are suspect.
 When jurisdictional conflicts arise, the Supreme Court has
 sided more often with military tribunals; these decisions have
 produced considerable criticism and charges that Chile's
 highest court collaborates with the military to impede justice
 for victims of human rights abuses committed by the security
 forces.
 In a special joint session of Congress on March 23, article 9
 of the Constitution was revised, giving the President temporary
 authority to pardon those convicted of security or terrorist
 crimes committed during the military regime. During 1991
 President Aylwin granted pardons to more than 50 people who had
 been convicted of politically motivated crimes. In November
 the Congress also approved a law authorizing the appointment of
 up to 30 temporary justices to clear a backlog of cases that
 were transferred form military to civilian courts.
 f." Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Searches of the home and interception of private communications
 are prohibited by the Constitution, unless search warrants are
 issued by either a civilian or military court for specific
 locations. The 1984 antiterrorist law provides for
 surveillance of those suspected of terrorist crimes, and for
 interception, opening, or recording of private communications
 and documents in such cases. In response to increasing crime,
 
 
 529
 CHILE
 Congress passed a law in 1991 that allows the police to enter a
 location without a warrant if they have-good reason to believe
 perpetrators of a flagrant crime are in hiding there.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution recognizes freedom of speech and press and
 these rights are generally respected in practice. In 1991
 legislation was enacted that reduced the penalties for libel,
 which previously had consisted of lengthy jail sentences and
 high fines. In addition, under article 6 of the'State Security
 Law, the legislation transferred from military to civilian
 courts cases against journalists for "offenses against the
 Armed Forces and Carabineros. ! However, at the time of the
 transfer of court jurisdiction, there were approximately 31
 such cases, affecting approximately 19 journalists. Almost all
 of these cases were dismissed, and a similar outcome is
 expected in the rest. Few new cases of such offenses were
 brought in 1991, although in September the Government filed a
 summons against the leftist weekly Punto Final for a cover
 image it deemed offensive to General Pinochet. In April
 Congress passed a law stipulating that only universities could
 award the professional journalism degree, a measure which is.
 interpreted as a first step toward restricting the exercise of
 the profession to university journalism degree holders.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Citizens have the right to peaceful assembly and association.
 Although official permission to hold rallies is not technically
 required, authorities must be notified in writing of planned
 public events. In September Carabineros used tear, gas to
 disperse a demonstration by university students and arrested
 dozens of people for reportedly setting up road blocks. Human
 rights groups charged that the police often used excessive
 force, including tear gas and water cannon, particularly
 against leftist protesters, to break up demonstrations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution provides for freedom of religion. Although
 Chile is predominantly Roman Catholic, there are no
 restrictions on rel-igious practices and no official
 discrimination against any religious group. The Mormon Church
 continued tobe a target of leftwing terrorist groups,
 primarily the MJL; apparently for political rather than
 religious reasons.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 By law Chileans are-free to move within and to enter and leave
 their country. In September 1990, the Congress passed a law
 establishing the National Office of Returnees to facilitate the
 reincorporation of returning exiles into Chilean society. The
 office opened in November 1990 and is scheduled to close in
 March 1994. In its first 6 months it assisted more than 9,500
 Chileans who returned from exile.
 
 
 530
 CHILE
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to -Change Their Government
 Citizens have the right to change their government through
 periodic elections. There is universal suffrage for citizens
 18 years of age or over, and over 95 percent of those eligible
 are registered to vote. Women are active in Chilean political
 life, especially at the grass roots political party level.
 There are few women in leadership positions. The Senate and
 the Chamber of Deputies passed legislation 1991 to amend the
 Constitution to allow municipal elections by June 30, 1992.
 The military regime designed certain provisions of the 1980
 Constitution to protect its interests and maintain conservative
 forces in power during the transition to civilian rule. For
 example, critics charge that the Pinochet government designed a
 system for Congressional elections to accord disproportionate
 representation to the right. This "binominal" system is
 considered undemocratic by many who prefer Chile's former
 proportional representation system, and strong sentiment exists
 in the Congress to introduce a traditional system of
 proportional representation.- According to a multiparty
 political agreement, upcoming municipal elections will be based
 on a proportional representation system. Under the terms of
 the 1980 Constitution; as amended, nine Senators were appointed
 by the outgoing government and the judiciary to take office
 with the 38 elected Senators, which effectively deprived the
 elected Aylwin Government of a majority in that body. One
 appointed Senator died in December 1990, and the Government
 decided not-to fill his vacant seat.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Catholic Church's Vicariate of Solidarity took the lead in
 defence of human rights during the Pinochet regime and
 continues to provide legal counsel to those accused of
 politically related crimes and to victims of human rights
 abuses. The Government permits visits and investigations by
 private international human rights groups. In 1990 the United
 Nations Human Rights Commission terminated its mandate for a
 special rapporteur, and, at its request, the Chilean Government
 presented a report before a special session of the Commission
 in February on its progress in the establishment of human
 rights and fundamental freedoms.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Although Chile seeks to integrate its indigenous population,
 the only significant racial minority, the Mapuche Indians in
 southern Chile, remains separated from the rest of society
 because of historical, cultural, educational, and geographical
 factors,.rather than by official policy. In accord with the "
 International Labor organization's resolutions on indigenous
 peoples, President Aylwin has introduced constitutional changes
 which would better protect the traditional life-styles and land
 ownership of indigenous Chileans.
 Legal distinctions between the'sexes still exist, despite a law
 passed in 1989 to reduce restrictions on women. Under the law,
 for example, wives may now retain control over income earned
 independently from their spouses, although assets held at the
 time of marriage become community property controlled by the
 
 
 531
 CHILE
 husband;.decisions on where to live are to be taken jointly,
 whereas previously a woman was obliged to live where her
 husband decided. Most importantly, a provision giving control
 of a woman's person to her husband was rescinded.
 The change in law has not been matched by a change in attitude
 by society, police, or the courts; In many cases, violence,
 such. as wife beating and other abuse, continues to be tolerated
 or ignored. The National Women's Service (SERNAM), whose
 director in January became the first woman with cabinet rank,
 estimates from polling data that approximately 30 percent of
 women in the lower economic strata have experienced domestic
 violence. No estimate is available for women from middle- or
 high-income families. Besides providing legal and medical
 information to abused women, SERNAM conducts courses on the
 legal, medical, and psychological aspects of domestic violence
 for Carabineros, most often the first public officials to
 intervene in such incidents.
 The legal retirement age for women is 5 years lower than that
 for men. Inheritance laws provide strong protection for wives
 and protect female offspring. According to government
 statistics, as of 1988 women made up 30 percent of the work
 force. The average salary for women is 87 percent of that for
 men for the same job-, and the unemployment rate for women is
 higher, especially among those entering the work force for the
 first time., As of 198a, women made up 50 percent of the
 professional work force; 14 percent of working women were
 professionals, compared to 6 percent of working men.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Private sector workers and employees of state-run enterprises
 in Chile have the right to join trade unions, and approximately
 12 percent of the work force is organized. The Labor Code does
 not allow government employees to form trade unions, but their
 "associations" have legal status, and they participate in labor
 confederations. These associations do not engage in collective
 bargaining. The police and military are not allowed to form
 employee associations.
 The Labor Code was amended in 1991 to allow for the formation
 of nationwide labor "centrals," but the requirements are
 onerous, and none of the existing de facto centrals hive yet
 obtained legal recognition. However, the Government discussed
 Labor Code reforms with the Unified Workers Central (CUT) and
 provided it with a headquarters building, implicitly
 recognizing its existence. In October the CUT decided to begin
 the legal steps required to obtain legal status. The
 Government's failure to consult more closely with smaller
 centrals, including the divided Democratic Workers Central and
 the conservative Chilean Workers Central, was strongly
 criticized by these groups and opposition political parties.
 Unions are independent of the Government, but they maintain
 ties with political parties. Only the Democratic Labor Central
 sought political independence, but it has suffered a decline in
 membership and power. Labor unions can and do maintain
 relations with international labor bodies.
 In 1991 Labor Code reforms removed some severe restrictions on
 the right to strike, but a majority of bargaining employees
 must reject an employer's final offer in the presence of a
 Labor Inspector and vote by secret ballot for a strike.
 
 
 532
 CHILE
 Employers may no longer fire striking workers after 60 days
 without paying severance benefits, and the benefits have
 increased from a maximum of 5 to 11 months' salary. Even
 before passing the labor reforms', the Government restored the
 right to strike at copper mines and most other entities which
 had previously been included on a list of strategic
 enterprises. Employees of other vital services, such as bus
 companies, are not allowed to strike but may take disputes to
 neutral arbitration. In the private sector, unions have the
 option of using an arbitrator when negotiations reach an
 impasse, but most prefer to take legal steps toward a strike.
 Organized labor continued to press during the year for a full
 investigation of the 1982 murder of labor leader Tucapel
 Jimenez, the most serious human rights abuse committed against
 a labor leader in recent times. The case is in the hands of a
 Supreme Court justice, but there was no visible progress in the
 case during 1991.
 In February 1988, Chile was formally suspended from trade
 benefits under U.S. Generalized System of Preferences
 legislation for its failure to take steps to afford
 internationally recognized worker rights to Chilean workers.
 After a thorough review, which included public hearings, the
 U.S. Government restored these benefits in February 1991.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The climate for collective bargaining improved vith the passage
 of the new labor reforms, but the process is strictly
 regulated, and employees in small firms face serious problems
 of antiunion discrimination. The entire collective bargaining
 procedure may be nullified if any of a series of legally
 imposed deadlines are missed by either the union or
 management. A decision not to negotiate a new contract upon
 expiration of the former one results in automatically extending
 the former agreement for a minimum 2-year period.
 The Government unilaterally sets the wages of public employees
 without formal bargaining. Reforms to the Labor Code allow
 bargaining in the private sector and state enterprises, and it
 may occur at other than the company level, but all parties must
 agree to the alternate venue. Negotiations by "unions of
 transient workers," defined as the merchant marine, port
 workers, construction workers, and artists, "do not have the
 legal status of a labor contract," according to the revised
 Labor Code.
 Although Chilean law guarantees the right of private sector
 workers and employees of state-run enterprises to form unions,
 in practice such laws are ineffective, especially in small work
 places. Employers may no -onger dismiss workers without cause,
 but they use technicalities in the Labor Code to fire union
 leaders even when they enjoy legal protections. Reforms to the
 Labor Code provide that the employer must pay a 20-percent
 penalty to the worker if courts rule that he was fired without
 just cause, but they do not require that the worker be
 rehired. Employers are allowed to negotiate with ad hoc worker
 groups, which undermines the bargaining ability of the union.
 There are no export processing zones or other special districts
 where different labor laws apply.
 
 
 533
 CHILE
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is implicitly prohibited in the
 Constitution and Labor Code, and there have been no complaints
 on this issue since the mid-1970s.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Child labor is regulated by law. Young people aged 14 and 15
 may be employed only with the permission of their parents or
 guardians and if they have completed their schooling, and then
 only in restricted types of labor. Those aged 15 to 18 may be
 employed in a larger variety of jobs and at expanded hours, but
 again only with the permission of their parents or guardians.
 Labor Inspectors enforce these regulations, and voluntary
 compliance is good in the formal sector. Economic factors have
 forced many children to seek employment in the informal economy
 which, by definition, is more difficult to regulate.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational safety and,
 health standards are regulated by law. The normal workweek is
 48 hours. There is a minimum wage, and lower paid workers also
 receive a family subsidy which is designed to raise their
 earnings to an acceptable level. When the minimum wage was
 increased' in 1991, the Tripartite Committee--which is composed
 of representatives from government, labor, and management--
 agreed in principle that future wage increases would be tied to
 increases in productivity. The Ministry of.Labor has
 inspectors to enforce laws covering wages, hours of work, and
 occupational health and safety, but enforcement is poor,
 especially in small industries.
