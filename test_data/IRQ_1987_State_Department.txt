 IRAQ
 Iraq is governed by  tje Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party (ABSP) of
 Iraq through a Revolutionary Comqand Council (RCC) which has
 both exedutive And legislative authority under the provisional
 Constitutio,.f 1968. Saddam Hussein holds decisive power as
 President of the Republic, Chairman of the Council, and
 Secretary General of the Regional Command of the ABSP.
 Iraq's security services are widely feared and reputedly
 omnipresent. -Though little is known of the various security
 branches, their agents rqportedly engage in extensive
 surveillance of individual behavior and conversations., The
 reluctance of Iraqis to-speak to foreigners is attributable to
 this monitoring.
 Iraq's population comprises many disparate groups, most notably
 Shi'a and Sunni Arab Mulims, Kurds, Xurcomans, and various
 Christian sects, predominantly Assyrians and Chaldeans.
 The Government exerts a high level of control over the.
 economy, which is dominated-by the petroleum sector. The
 State owns al major ind4stries, including petroleum and
 banking. UHQwever,t-he small private sector is important in
 some ind strteq.  .xpansion-of the rol of the private sqctor
 was greaterinl$987 than in previous years.
 The humaaright$,situationin Iraq remained qssentially
 unchanged in 1987. Political and individual rights are
 sharply limited. The news media are largely government
 controlled and subject to censorship. Antiregime activity is
 dealt with harshly, often by extralegal means, including
 torture and summary execution, employed by a large internal
 security police force and the intelligence services. In
 addition to the repressive domestic controls that predated the
 7-year-old war with Iran, tight wartime controls imposed in
 the name of national security remain in effect, including a
 decree which prescribes the death penalty for anyone who
 damages the country's military, political, or economic
 position. Wartime travel restrictions, which prevent most
 Iraqis from departing the couhtry, also remain in force.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Execution has been an established method for dealing with
 perceived political and military opponents of the Government,
 particularly members of the outlawed Da'wa Party (Iran-
 supported fundamentalist Shi'a Muslim) and the Communist
 Party. Amnesty International (AI) charged in February 1987
 that security forces tortured and murdered at least 29 Kurdish
 youths arrested in 1985; AI said the Iraqi Ambassador in London
 later confirmed 7 of the deaths.
 The number of casualties are unknown in the Government's 1987
 campaign to pacify parts of Kurdistan by razing a large number
 of Kurdish villages, displacing their inhabitants. In its
 1987 Report (covering 1986), AI referred to reports of the
 killing and execution of hundreds of people in 1986, but said
 it had insufficient information to ascertain the precise
 number. Among those executed were said to be army deserters,
 members of banned political parties, suspected government

 IRAQ
 opponents, and students. Over the past few years, Iraq has
 expelled several terrorists who previously sheltered there.
 Iraq officially forswears terrorism, and Iraqis themselves in
 recent years have been the victims of several terrorist acts
 supported by Syria and Iran.
 During Iran's January-March 1987 offensive near Basra and in
 late 1987, Iran renewed charges that Iraq used chemical
 weapons, allegations denied by Iraq. Iraq also charged Iran
 with chemical weapons use. In April 1987, a U.N. investigation
 of both sides found convincing evidence only of Iraqi use.
 There have also been reports of Iraqi use of chemical weapons
 against rebel forces and Kurdish villages in Kurdistan. The
 State Department has repeatedly condemned Iraq's use of
 chemical weapons. Iraq is a party to the 1925 Geneva Protocol
 banning use, but not production, of lethal and incapacitating
 chemical weapons. There are indications that Iraq continues
 to stockpile lethal agents.
 b. Disappearance
 Iraqi emigrants have reported that some suspects, particularly
 those detained by the security police for subversion, disappear
 following detention. It is difficult in such cases to confirm
 whether the suspect was executed or died while incarcerated.
 In its 1987 Report, AI expressed concern about disappearances
 in Iraq. It said it had received a report of the arrest in
 March and April 1986 of a large number of civilians, including
 students, in the town of Arbil following an assassination
 attempt on the governor of Arbil by Kurdish opposition forces,
 and noted that 15 students were subsequently executed and that
 the others "disappeared."
 Antigovernment Kurds in northern Iraq occasionally kidnap
 foreign workers and businessmen. The Patriotic Union of
 Kurdistan claimed in late 1987 to be holding 12 foreigners
 hostage.
 c.- Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture and prescribes stiff
 punishment for it, and the Government rejects charges that it
 practices torture. Nevertheless, reliable reports make clear
 that both physical and psychological torture are used by the
 authorities, especially the security police. Given the rigid
 chain of command within the Government and security services,
 it is unlikely that torture could be practiced without the
 authorization of senior officials.
 According to former prisoners, persons detained by the security
 police for political or security-related matters are frequently
 tortured and mistreated. Treatment is reported to be worst
 immediately following arrest and during the period of
 interrogation and investigation, which can last for months.
 TOrture and brutal treatment are not limited to political
 cases. Security-related offenses include such routine criminal
 matters as currency violations.
 The security forces' methods of torture, often to extract
 confessions or information about the suspect and his
 colleagues, reportedly include beatings with fists and rubber
 truncheons, electrical shocks to the genitals and other parts
 of the body, and the extraction of fingernails and toenails.

 IRAQ
 In its 1987 Report, AI expressed its concern about the. "routine
 torture 'and ,ill-treater~t- of detainees inthe custody of the
 security'foï¿½Ces'!1id p9tedthat some detainees reportedly died
 as a estbf tortur.' It said that over the years the
 Government had aenied allegationsbf torture even when the
 allegations were supported by detailed medical evidence; and
 that the Government had also failed to show that such
 allegations were ever investigated or that any perpetrators
 were brought to justice.
 *d. "A:xbitr&ry Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 The Constitution and legal code provide for the rights of
 citizenrs and place checks on polie powers in such areas as
 arrest,' detention, imprisonment, and search. These provisions
 are ge nerally respected in ordinary criminal cases but have
 littld weight 'n political or national security cases.
 Security poli'ce n6t only make arbitrary arrests but also
 secretly detain suspects, whose fate sometimes becomes known
 only after execution. Security charges have included
 espionage, treason, and conspiracy against Iraq or the party
 and revolution, often in collaboration with unnamed foreign
 foes,.  -
 In the past, Iraq ixpelled to Iran large numbers of Iranians
 and Iraqis of supposed Iranian descent. These deportations
 ceased in the Qarly 1980's; however, most of the few remaining
 Iranians have been imprisoned or live under the fear of
 deportat.ion or incarceration. Spouses of Iraqis of franian
 origin ake required to obtaip.divorce or suffer the same
 consequences. Morebver, other Iraqis whose grandparents are
 not shown f? be of Iraqi oiigin ar subject to arbitrary
 detention and deportation. Assyrian religious groups in the
 United States alleged in 1987 that many Iraqi Assyrians were
 expelled to Turkey under this rule.
 As fighting ,cofttinued in 1987 between the Iraqi army and
 Kurdish guerrillas supported by Iran, Iraq embarked on a
 tougher campaign to control Kurdistan. This campaign involved
 widespread destruction and bulldozing of Kurdish and Turcoman
 villages, mass forced movement of Kurds, and exile of Kurdish
 families into non-Kurdish parts of Iraq.
 Apart from the expulsion of thousands of residents of Iranian
 descent in 1980 and. earlier, exile is not resorted to as a
 means of punishjnent. The mass forced migrations of Kurds to
 non-Kurdish 'parts of Iraq constitute internal exile on a large
 scale. Therp is no indication that Iraq uses forced labor.
 e. Denial of Fair'Public Trial
 Iraq's legal system provides for investigation by police and
 then by an inquiry judge who may refer a case to the criminal
 court. A judge tries criminal cases; there is no jury.
 Convictions may be appealed to a court of cassation or, in
 case of major crimes, the High Court of Appeals.
 Trials of nonsecurity cases are held in civil, criminal, and
 religious courts and are open. Defendants are entitled to
 counsel. A lawyer is provided if a defendant cannot afford
 one. Charges and evidence are available for review.
 Appellate courts hear cases not under the jurisdiction of the
 revolutionary courts. The revolutionary courts, which usually
 
 
 1173
 IRAQ
 hold closed trials, deal with espionage, treason, smuggling,
 and drug trafficking. The right of defense in such courts is
 reportedly severely restricted.
 The "special courts" constituted by the Revolutionary Command
 Council for specific incidents, such as the reported conspiracy
 against the regime in 1979, are also closed. These special
 tribunals are apparently exempt from constitutional safeguards
 of defendants' rights. The right of defense is suspended;
 defendants are held incommunicado, and confessions extracted
 by torture are used against defendants. Appeals can be taken
 only to the Chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council
 (RCC). However, the availability of this appeal is open to
 question, since there are reports that executions take place
 shortly after trial.
 Political dissidence in Iraq is taken by the authorities to
 encompass a wide range of activities and, in an environment
 where public acknowledgment of arrest or imprisonment is rare,
 it is extremely difficult to gauge the number of political
 prisoners. In its 1987 Report, AI expressed its continued
 concern about the "widespread arbitrary arrest and detention
 of hundreds of political prisoners."
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides protections for the inviolability of
 the home, and strong cultural values reinforce these
 protections. Police must obtain a search warrant before
 entering the home of a criminal suspect. Warrants are not
 required for the arrest of security suspects. Although most
 arrests occur outside the home, there have been reports of
 forced entry and arrest by the security police, particularly
 of suspected members of the outlawed Da'wa Party.
 In 1987, as part of an intensified campaign in Kurdistan,
 Iraqi government forces conducted large-scale searches of
 homes in Kurdish towns and arrested and relocated a number of
 people.
 There is no legal protection against the monitoring of
 telephones, which many Iraqis belieye to be a common practice.
 All mail is believed subject to review by censors.. Government
 security services and the Ba'ath Party are generally assumed
 to maintain pervasive networks of informers.
 Membership in the ruling Ba'ath Party is viewed as a key to
 advancement inside'and outside the Government. Although the
 Ba'ath is an elitist party and "membership" entails stages
 from init)i te to full member, recruitment can be aggressive.
 Some emi rats have claimed that they joined the party to
 avoid beatings or harassment or to enhance career prospects.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are not respected. The Government views
 political dissent as a security threat and strictly controls
 speech, press, and assembly. The Constitution prohibits "any
 act aimed at undermining the national unity of the people,
 provoking racial, sectarian, and regional bigotry, or
 violating gains and achievements of the country." The
 Government owns and operates the press, radio, and
 
 
 "1174
 television.. -,The-media do not criticize the Government, and
 news reporting it'stronglybiased. Opposition yiewpoints are
 not heard. Few foreign periodicals reach Iraq, and Western
 newspapers are not sold. Foreign'visitors' newspapers,
 magazie,. cassettes cameras, and video cassettes can be
 confiscated at 'the -airport. To control the dissemination of
 political, 1ealets)'typewriters.and photocopying machines must
 be ;registered. -        -

 punishable' by- imprisonment. Journalists and photographers
 visitingInaq:at. the iiydtation of the Government are required
 to present- fihi taken i-Iraq for' inspection by the
 authorities.
 b. Freedom. of, Peaceful;Assembly, and Association

 Industrial workers do not constitute a significant part of the
 total work force, whose principal components are agricultural
 workersA. shopkeepes, -and government' employees.- Until' early
 1987, industrial.workers'bere-organized in the Fedetation of

 federatnon-, the, right to- bargain collectively was not
 recognized. Although-workers legallyhave the right to
 strike, after providing notice to the Labor Ministry, no
 strikes hama-ie'n reported, for allnost 20-years.
 c. Freedo. of Religion
 Iraq is an ethnically and religiously diverse society. Many
 non-Muslims, principally Jews and Christians,'left Iraq under
 previous regimes. Since its rise to power in 1968, the
 Ba'athist Government,,while carefully controlling religious
 groups, has enforced tolerance of religious diversity, seeking
 to submerge religious differences in the.promotion of secular
 nationalism.
 A 1981 law gave the Ministry of Endowments and Religious
 Affairs the authotity to promulgate laws and regulations
 governing places-of worship, appointment of clergy,,.religious
 literature, and participation in religious councils and
 meetings. Muslim religious leaders operate under close
 government supervision, are considered government employees,
 and receive their salaries through the Government. The
 Government administers the principal Muslim shrines and
 mosques and has increased allotments to refurbish and maintain
 them in an apparent attempt to win support from the devout.
 While the Government has assumed much greater authority in
 Islamic religious affairs since 1981, the law has not been
 invoked agai'nst Iraq's Christian sects. Iraq's Christians
 number more than 500,00 and constitute nearly 4 percent of
 the population. Their freedom of worship-in churches of
 established denominations is legally protected, but they are
 
 
 1175
 IRAQ
 not permitted to proselytize or to hold meetings outside
 church premises. Convents and monasteries exist, and some new
 churches have been constructed, in some cases with government
 financial support. The Jewish community is believed to have
 decreased from 150,000 following World War II to about 400.
 It was severely persecuted in the past, but there is no
 evidence of recent persecution. One synagogue in Baghdad
 still functions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Iraqis are generally free to travel within the country and to
 change their residences or workplaces. However, they are
 likely to be constrained by social, cultural, and religious
 traditions which define the areas occupied by the various
 ethnic and religious groups. Sensitive border and other
 security areas are off-limits. Civilian travel in the war
 zone is restricted. Curfews are in effect where Kurdish
 insurgents have been active. There are police checkpoints on
 highways and outside major towns, but most Iraqis and
 foreigners travel freely in nonrestricted areas. Foreign
 diplomats must obtain Foreign Ministry permits for travel
 outside of Baghdad, which are usually granted when requested
 sufficiently in advance.
 All Iraqis and most foreigners who have remained in the country
 for more than 2 weeks must obtain exit permission. Travel has
 been even further limited since September 1986 when severe
 restrictions on currency exchange were imposed. Because of
 the war's drain on the economy, permission to travel abroad is
 restricted to a few categories of Iraqis, including officials,
 government-approved students, and persons needing medical
 treatment. (While permission for medical treatment abroad may
 be granted, permission to transfer hard currency abroad to pay
 for it usually is not.) The Government seeks to limit the
 countries an Iraqi traveler may visit and, should the traveler
 visit a nonauthorized country, a small fine may be levied upon
 his return. Iraqis who have residences abroad may depart the
 country provided they originally had left before the war began.
 In general, a married woman must have the permission of her
 husband to travel abroad.
 The Government can require a prospective traveler to post a
 substantial bond to assure return. The RCC decreed in 1987
 that Iraqi students abroad who refuse to return to Iraq must
 reimburse the Government for all education received in Iraq or
 abroad at government expense. The resolution is applicable
 retroactively to students who have refused to return since May
 16, 1983, the day the Government began requiring those
 employees who left government jobs before completing the
 required 20 years of work to reimburse the State for the cost
 of their education. Amounts due can be recovered by
 confiscation; nonpayment may result in imprisonment. Each
 student must provide a guarantor before traveling abroad.
 This guarantor and the student's parents may be held liable
 for the student's return.
 There is no specific ban on emigration nor special restrictions
 for members of minority groups; however, emigration is
 discouraged. Prospective emigrants have had travel permission
 ,delayed and have been harassed. Many emigrants leave behind
 substantial property because of the difficulty of exporting
 assets. Currency exchange violationp are considered national
 security offenses, and penalties can be severe.
 
 
 1176
 IRAQ
 Alien spouses of Iraqi citizens who have resided in Iraq for
 at least 3 years are required to become naturalized or leave
 Iraq. 'Many people, including several Americans, have thus
 been obliged to-accept rragi citizenship and are therefore
 subject V6o the present travel restrictions. In March 1984, a
 resolution by the RCC reduced the residency period before
 naturalization to I year for the spouses of Iraqis employed in
 government offices. The Iraqi spouse faces penalties for
 noncompliance, including loss of job, a fine of approximately
 $10,000, and repayment of the costs of education.
 In recent years, the Government has instituted special programs
 to encourage the repatriation of qualified professionals.
 Aliens of Iraqi origin can apply for a document permitting
 them td enter and exit Iraq without a visa.' Former Iraqis can
 more easily obtain visitors,'visas than can other aliens, who
 generally must have an official sponsor..
 Other persons of Iraqi origin-are permitted to return,
 including many Versons who were admitted to other countries
 as refugees. Anumber of- such people, especially Assyrian
 Christians, have returned on temporary visits. They are free
 to come and-go, within the limits of the present-travel
 restrictions, sirfce they are not considered to have violated
 Iraqi laws. However, those who emigrated only after the
 beginning of the Iran-Iraq war, including several U.S.
 permanent resident aliens, have been unable to depart Iraq
 after 'returning.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights:. The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government in
 Iraq. The elitist Ba'ath Party, dominated by the President
 and the party's Regional,Command, rules Iraq. The party
 reportedly has some 1.5 million adherents, representing about
 10 percent of the population; but only some 50,000 "active" or
 full members, less than-0.33 percent of the population,
 participate influentially in party activities. There are two
 other legal political parties, both Kurdish. They and the
 Ba'ath Party constitute the Patriotic and Progressive National
 Front, essentially a vehicle of support for the Government.
 The two non-Balath parties carry on only limited activity.
 Members of the military or security services may engage in
 politicl activities only within the Ba'ath Party.
 Association with the party is -ot required for appointment to
 senior government positions or military ranks or election to
 the National Assembly, but normally is necessary to attain
 political influence.
 Opposition-groups, including qvarious Kurdish groups and
 splinter parties, are severely repressed. The Communist Party
 was removed from the National Front and declared illegal in
 1979. The Da'wa Party, a violent dissident Shi'ite Group, is
 still proscribed, and-its members-are subject to incarceration
 and execution, as are members of other parties believed to be
 cooperating with Iran.
 General elections were last held for the 250-seat National
 Assembly in 1984. The Government screened all the candidates
 for consonance with Ba'ath party ideology. Though in theory
 possessing a wide range of official duties, the Assembly   -
 exercises little real authority.- The most recent zlocal -
 elections Were held in the Kurdish Autonomous Region in August
 1986.                 -

 IRAQ
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongoveinmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Iraq denies charges that it violates human rights. Iraqi
 officials claim Amnesty International and other human rights
 groups receive information on which they base their charges
 from pro-Iranian Iraqi exile groups in London and Paris. The
 Government acknowledges some of AI's appeals and accusations
 and in a letter to AI in July 1985 confirmed approximately
 two-thirds of the executions AI said took place in February
 and March 1985. The Iraqi Government contended, however, that
 these were not political executions but executions carried out
 for crimes against national security. In the past it has
 offered to investigate allegations of torture if the victims,
 interviewed outside Iraq, returned. None is known to have
 done so.
 There is no government office or official charged with
 investigating human rights and coordinating with other
 governments and international organizations on human rights.
 Since 1980 the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
 delegation based in Iraq has made regular visits to Iranian
 prisoners of war (POW's) (whose number is estimated at 14,700)
 and has assisted in Iraq's unilateral repatriation of some of
 them. Iraq has received the ICRC president and other
 delegates several times to discuss the treatment of POW's and
 the protection of civilians in the Iran-Iraq war.
 Iraq cooperates with the ICRC in efforts to resettle Iranian
 civilian refugees in third countries. A total of 401 such
 refugees had departed Iraq or had been accepted as refugees by
 other countries as of June 1987. The United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has begun to operate in Iraq,
 having sent several delegations to register refugees and to
 make efforts for their resettlement. The UNHCR intends to
 establish a permanent office in Baghdad.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Ba'ath Party has been committed to the equality of the
 sexes, and a series of laws since it came to power in 1968 has
 steadily improved the status of women. Such laws have
 protected women from exploitation in the workplace; granted
 subsidized maternity leave; permitted women to join the
 regular army, Popular Army, and police forces; and equalized
 women's rights on divorce, land ownership, taxation, suffrage,
 and election to the National Assembly. In the 1970's, the
 Government imposed legal penalties on families that opposed
 sending their women to literacy schools, and on men who were
 seen harassing women. However, women may still travel abroad
 only with the permission of their husbands.
 The percentage of female students among students in elementary
 schools climbed from 37.4 percent in 1977-78 to 46.4 percent
 in 1982-3. Secondary school female enrollment went from 29.2
 to 34.5 percent of students in the same period. About 32
 percent of the students at universities and technical
 institutes are female.
 Women represent about 47 percent of agricultural workers and
 about 25 percent of the total work force. The war has
 accelerated the Government's drive to elevate the status of
 women, and some Iraqis believe that it has permanently broken
 
 
 1178
 IRAQ
 cultural barriers to'the acceptance of women in traditional
 male rolet. -Women have become increasintgly-visible as ,
 architects, construction engineers, oil engineers, air traffic
 controllers, factory and farm managers, and Air Force pilots.
 Some 40,000women were-reportedly volunteers in the Popular
 Army in 1982.   .              .     ;..
 The General. Federation of Iraqi Women (GFIW) was established
 in 1969,, the-regime's first year in power to-promote the
 Government's policies towards women. Mambership in the GFIW
 does not require affiliation with the Ba'ath Party.. The GFIW
 organizks conferencei on-women's issues, establishes training.
 courses for women; Implements-programs to eradicate illiteracy,
 undertakes civilian-war relief activities, and- administers.
 nurseriesr- It drew-up a 4-yearplan (1983-86) to encourage
 women to work outside the home and has opened four employment
 offices in Baghdad for women graduates.
 The use of minority languagesois unrestricted. Kurdish, an
 official language, is used in schools and media in:Kurdish
 areas. Tiurcomans--piblish- in their dialect of Turkish.
 The Shi'a, who- make up roughly 55 percent of the population,
 have hidtorically been economically, politically, and socially-
 disadvantaged throughout the Mideast. The Government has-a
 declared policy to raise their living standards and equalize
 opportunities for economic and professional advancement. In
 recent years, the Government and party have promoted Shi'as
 into prominent positions, and the economic and social status
 of the Shi'a has improved markedly. Nevertheless, the  ..
 Government maintains a close watch against Iranian attempts to
 exploit dissatisfactionamong theIraqi Shi'a, who share the
 same branch of Islam prevalent in Iran.
 Although Christians sometimes allege discrimination in
 education and jobs, adherence to their religion has not
 prevented many from obtaining wealth and professional
 advancement. The Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister,
 a Chaldean Christian, has represented Iraq even at meetings of
 the foreign ministers of the Organization of the Islamic
 Conference. Other Christians hold important official and
 private positions.
 Citizens considered to be of Iranian origin bear special
 identification, often precluding desirable employment or-
 impeding advancement. Many "Iranian" families have been in
 Iraq for generations. Some say their forebears were not from
 Iran but claimed Iranian nationality to evade Ottoman military
 conscription.r
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Children are frequently encouraged to work as necessary to
 support the family, a common social practice in the Middle
 East. The employment of children is forbidden in state-run
 enterprises orother than small-scale family enterprises. The
 urban workweek is 6 days a week, 6 to 7 hours a day for
 government workers; on Friday all but private vendors are
 closed. Wages are set by the Government for public sector
 workers (i.e., the bulk of the employed) and do not adhere to
 any fixed per-hour or per-day rate; salaries are generally
 deemed low but adequate. Wages in the small private sector
 are set solely by supply and demand. Occupational safety
 
 
 1179
 IRAQ
 programs are in effect in state-run enterprises and inspectors
 make irregular visits to private establishments; enforcement
 varies widely.
