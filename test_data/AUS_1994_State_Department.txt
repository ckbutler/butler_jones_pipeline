 AUSTRALIA
 Australia has a federal system of government and a long history as a multiparty
 parliamentary democracy. Federal, state, and local police carry out their functions
 m accordance with the law, which respects and safeguards individual human rights.
 A highly developed economy, which includes manufacturing, mining, agriculture,
 and services, provides most Australians with a high per capita income. A wide range
 of government programs offers assistance for the minority of relatively disadvan-
 taged citizens.
 Laws provide for basic human rights; the Government respects and enforces these
 laws.
 The Government administers many programs to improve the socioeconomic condi-
 tions of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders, who together form about 1.6 per-
 cent of the population, and to address longstanding discrimination against them.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial KiUing.-There were no reports of political
 killing.
 The April 1991 report of the Royal Commission investigating the deaths of
 Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders in official custody stated that, although the
 deaths were not caused deliberately by police or prison officials, "in many cases
 death was contributed to by system failures or absence of due care." The Commis-
 sion found that indigenous Australians died at approximately the same rate as oth-
 ers in prison, but it stressed that they were arrested at a rate 29 times that of
 whites (see also Section 1.c.).
 In a report issued in June, the Australian Institute of Criminology stated that the
 number of Aboriginal deaths in custody remained at 8 in 1993-the same number
 recorded for 1992, and significantly fewer than that for 1991 (12). Further the rate
 of deaths per 1,000 persons in custody in 1993 stayed significantly fower for
 Aboriginals than for others (i.e., this was the case for the second straight year). That
 represented a notable improvement over 1991 data which attested to a somewhat
 higher death rate among Aboriginal prisoners.
 In terms of all prisoners, however, the Institute noted that the total number of
 deaths increased to 74 in 1993. This was the highest figure recorded since 1987 and
 contrasted with data for 1991 and 1992, in which the total number of deaths re-
 mained essentially constant (65 and 64, respectively).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of political disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits all such practices, and the authorities generally respect these pro.
 hibitions. However, the Royal Commission investigating the deaths of Aboriginals
 and Torres Strait Islanders in custody indicated it ad oun credible evidence that
 indigenous Australians had frequently been mistreated while in custody. It rec-
 ommended several stepsto reduce the number of arrests and improve the treatment
 of prisoners. During 1994 federal and state authorities continued to address the
 problem of deaths and mistreatment of indigenous Australians in custody by means
 of police reform, including improved detention procedures and training courses in
 Aboriginal culture.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law prohibits arbitrary arrest and
 imprisonment. This prohibition is respected in practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-A well-developed system of federal and state
 courts, independent of the executive and legislative branches, ensures the right to
 fair trial. Both in law and in practice, defendants enjoy rights to due process, includ-
 ing the presumption of innocence, the right to conrnt witnesses, and the right of
 (531)
 
 
 532
 appeal. With regard to indigent defendants, all Australian states except New South
 Wales oblige persons charged with criminal offenses to meet a merit test before
 qualifying for legal aid. The purpose of the merit test is to save the Government
 from 'wasting funds on unwinnable cases. Under these procedures, many, but not
 all, defendants in serious criminal cases have been found to deserve legal counsel.
 Defendants who receive an unfavorable decision may appeal to a panel of independ-
 ent lawyers and social workers appointed by the Legal Aid Commission. The High
 Court has stated that it would be an exceptional case in which a person accused
 of serious charges could be tried fairly without a lawyer.
 The Government provides legal counsel for all persons of Aboriginal or Torres
 Strait Islander descent. Defendants appearing before a defense force magistrate are
 likewise exempt from the merit test.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-By law,
 the authorities may not conduct searches without a judicially issued warrant, and
 in practice they do not do so. The Government respects the privacy of family, home,
 and correspondence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-A democratic political system, a highly profes-
 sional judiciary, and diverse, vigorous, and independent news media combine to pro-
 tect freedom of speech and press and full academic freedom. Australia does not have
 a bill of rights, and from time to time a few journalists have been subjected to court
 proceedings aimed at compelling them to reveal confidential sources. In 1994, how-
 ever, there were no reports of such cases.
 The Northern Territory and five of Australia's six states (all but Western Aus-
 tralia) prohibit public disrespect, e.g., verbal abuse directed toward police or other
 officials. Spokespersons for Aboriginal groups charge that these laws are enforced
 in a racially discriminatory manner.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Although not codified in law,
 citizens exercise these freedoms without government restriction.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Australians have complete freedom of religion. A provi-
 sion in the Constitution precludes the adoption of a state religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government imposes no restrictions on movement within or out-
 side the country and respects the rights of emigration and repatriation.
 The Government repatriates boat people whose applications for asylum or human-
 itarian admission are denied. In late 1992, the Australian High Court upheld the
 Government's right to detain boat people pending adjudication of their cases.
 Representatives of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees have com-
 mended Australia for speeding up official processing of refugee claims, while rec-
 ommending that the Government adopt a policy of administrative release into the
 community under appropriate safeguards. Parhament's Joint Standing Committee
 on Migration advanced a similar proposal on March 2, recommending standardized
 procedures that would permit release into the community of boat people detained
 for more than 6 months, those whose continued detention resulted from inaction or
 administrative error, and others who met specified conditions. The Government,
 however, rejects such proposals, arguing that all unauthorized entrants and their
 children should remain in detention until final disposition of requests for asylum or
 refuge, even though administrative appeals and lawsuits can take several years.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Australians elect representatives to a two-chamber federal parliament as well as
 to numerous state and local bodies through free and open elections. Voting by secret
 ballot is compulsory in general elections for Australians 18 years of age and older.
 Voters who do not at least collect ballots may be fined, and fines are in fact levied.
 Indigenous people participate fully in Australia's political process, doing so as vot-
 ers, members of political parties, and candidates for elected office.
 Although no legal impediments-exist to prevent women from holding public office,
 in practice, relatively few women are elected to public office (e.g., only about 14 per-
 cent of current Members of Parliament are women). In September, the Australian
 Labor Party (ALP) formally decided that, by the year 2000, women will be 35 per-
 cent of its nominees for "winnable seats." The Liberal Party has likewise declared
 it wishes to increase the number of female candidates, but it has not adopted a spe-
 cific quota.

 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Nongovernmental human rights organizations operate freely, and the Government
 grants unimpeded access to all international groups investigating alleged human
 rights violations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-In a July report on equality before the law, the Australian Law Reform
 Commission, a government-funded advisory body reporting to the Attorney General
 on possible law reforms, concluded that women face systemic discrimination within
 the legal system. The Commission found that discrimination against women per-
 meates substantive law, judicial interpretation, and women's access to appropriate
 legal services. Although this reflects women's unequal social and economic status,
 the Commission believes that the legal system contributes to the inequality and
 tends to perpetuate and exacerbate it. The Commission recommended the immediate
 establishment of a national women's justice program in which the federal, state, and
 territorial governments would work together to address women's needs in the areas
 of legal representation, legal advice and referral, community legal education, devel-
 opment of the law, research and data collection, court processes, and facilities.
 The Federal Sex Discrimination Act of 1984 prohibits discrimination on the basis
 of sex, marital status, or pregnancy. The Afimative Action Act of 1986 also obliges
 employers to provide equal employment and equal promotion opportunities for fe-
 male employees. The Department of Industrial Relations and the Sex Discrimina-
 tion Commissioner receive complaints and attempt to resolve those that they find
 valid. They mainly do this by seeking to persuade employers to comply with the law
 but can also decide to refer complaints to the Attorney General's Department and
 recommend legal action. Overall, enforcement is reasonably effective. Pay equity as
 a legal right went into force on March 30.
 In an effort to end violence against women, the Government continued its commu-
 nity education campaign, begun in 1991 and oparating under a 3-year budget of
 about $2.3 million. Social analysts and commentators estimate that domestic vio-
 lence may affect as many as one Australian family in three or four. However, gov-
 ernment officials stress that, because of underreportig and the lack of an ag d
 method for collecting statistics, it is impossible to provide an accurate national pro-
 file of the number of women who are victims of domestic violence. The Government
 is currently considering a national survey on violence against women in order to
 provide baseline data.
 Children.-The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare estimates 20,000 chil-
 dren are victims of child abuse or are at significant risk of abuse each year. This
 is somewhat less than 0.5 percent of persons under 17, but the president of the Aus-
 tralian Medical Association stresses that many cases of neglect and abuse are not
 reported. The six states and two territories investigate complaints of neglect or child
 abuse and institute practical measures aimed at protecting the child (e.g., placement
 in foster homes) when such complaints prove founded.
 On June 30, Parliament enacted a law that prohibits sexual relations and other
 indecent acts with children on the part of Australians who are visiting other coun-
 tries. Offenders as well as organizers of travel for such purposes, may be prosecuted
 in Australia. The maximum penalty is 17 years' imprisonment. By year's end, no
 prosecutions under this law had taken place.
 Indigenous People.-The Racial Discrimination Act of 1975 prohibits discrimina-
 tion on grounds of race, color, descent, or national or ethnic origin. In practice, how-
 ever, the community services provided to Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders
 tend to be distinctly inferior, and Aboriginal spokespersons charge that police are
 less responsive to requests for law enforcement services which originate in Aborigi-
 nal rather than in other communities.
 Even though Aboriginal Australians constitute about 1.6 percent of the population
 at large, Aboriginal prisoners exceed 15 percent of the overall total. In May Minister
 for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs Robert Tickner criticized the states'
 lack of action on various recommendations put forward by the 1991 report of the
 Royal Commission on deaths in custody. "A cross Australia," Tickner said, "There
 has been an abject failure by state and territory governments to tackle this deplor-
 able over representation" of Aboriginals in prison. He called for a "radical reassess-
 ment" of criminal justice policies.
 In much of Australia, the incidence of arrest of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Is-
 landers for minor street crimes is disproportionately high. Public drunkenness re-
 mains a criminal offense in three states (Queensland, Victoria, and Tasmania), even
 though decriminalization was one of the 1991 Royal Commission's key recommenda-
 
 
 534
 
 tions. Drunkenness is no longer an offense in New South Wales. However, instead
 of being charged with drunkenness, disproportionate numbers of indigenous Aus-
 tralians are arrested for violating a provision of the state's criminal code which pro-
 scribes "conduct * * * in an offensive manner in * * * a public place." New South
 Wales is conducting small-scale trials of an alternative procedure that would not re-
 quire arrests under such circumstances. In effect, a court summons that would re-
 semble a traffic ticket would direct the offender to appear in court and answer
 charges on a specified date.
 The states have established racial-sensitivity training programs for police officers,
 as well as advisory bodies and other outreach programs which seek to improve po-
 lice relations with Aboriginal communities. In spite of notable and praiseworthy im-
 provements in particular localities, there is no evidence to suggest that current ap-
 proaches have been effective in reducing arrests nationwide.
 Because Aboriginals are the most disadvantaged group in relation to education,
 housing, health, and employment (unemployment is three times the national aver-
 age), the federal and state governments provide special services which supplement
 the broad range of programs that are available to all Australians. These special
 services are aimed at improving socioeconomic conditions among indigenous Aus-
 tralians. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission gives indigenous
 Australians control over many government programs intended for their benefit. The
 Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation is coordinating a 10-year program to promote
 better understanding between indigenous Australians and others.
 Aboriginal spokespersons generally support federal and state programs but often
 describe them as underfunded. They note that much of the underlying problem of
 racial discrimination stems from deeply rooted personal attitudes and views and ex-
 press doubt that government programs will produce notable results in the short run.
 In addition, they question whether federal and state police authorities have shown
 sufficient diligence and energy in pursuing police reform.
 Most Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders welcomed landmark legislation (De-
 cember 1993) which established federal tribunals to adjudicate claims to land own-
 ership by groups of indigenous Australians who can demonstrate active association
 and uninterrupted use (native title). But most indigenous Australians cannot meet
 this test, and Parliament is considering draft legislation that would establish a na-
 tional trust fiud to purchase land for them.
 People With Disabilities.-The Disability Discrimination Commissioner, a member
 of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, promotes compliance
 with federal law prohibiting discrimination against the disabled. The Commissioner
 also promotes more energetic implementation and enforcement of state laws that re-
 quire equal access and otherwise protect the rights of disabled persons.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Australian law and practice provide workers, includ-
 ing public servants, freedom of association domestically and internationally. Ap-
 proximately 40 percent of the work force is unionized.
 Unions carry out their internal functions free of government or political control,
 but most local affiliates belong to the state's branch of the ALP. Union members
 must make up at least 60 percent of the delegates to ALP congresses, but unions
 do not participate or vote as a bloc.
 There are no restrictions on the right to strike. Legislation which went into force
 on March 30 for the first time legalized what had -long been a de facto right to
 strike.
 Laws and regulations prohibit retribution against strikers and labor leaders, and
 they are effectively enforced. In practice, employers tend to avoid legal remedies
 (e.g., secondary boycott injunctions) available to them in order to preserve long-term
 relationships with their unions.
 Since 1992 the Federal Government has used its adherence to International Labor
 Organization (ILO) conventions to override state objections to new labor relations
 legislation. Major provisions (right to strike, parental leave, pay equity, minimum
 wage, and protection from unfair dismissals and hiring discrimination) of the 1994
 legislation referred to above were deliberately based on ILO conventions and rec-
 ommendations, as well as on broader U.N. conventions and covenants.
 However, the official employers' representative to the ILO the Australian Cham-
 ber of Commerce and Industry formally complained to the IO Committee on Free-
 dom of Association in June tat the new legislation actually restricts employers
 from bargaining freely with their employees without impediment because it contains
 vestiges of the old system, namely compulsory arbitration and centralized wage-fix-
 ing. The ILO has not yet issued a ruling on this complaint.
 
 
 535
 Unions may freely form and join federations or confederations, and they actively
 participate in international bodies.
 b. The Right to Or anize and Bargain Collectively.-Australian law and practice
 give worker. the right to organize and bargain collectively, and they protect them
 ro  antiunion discrimination.
 Officials administer centralized, minimum wage awards and provide quasi-judicial
 arbitration, supplemented by industrywide or company-by-company collective bar-
 gaining.
 The Government's 1994 legislation aimed to facilitate decentralized collective bar-
 gaining, keyed to individual enterprises, in order to relate wage increases more di-
 rectly to gains in productivity. Workers can trade fringe benefit for greater wage
 increases, but must register their agreement with the Australian Industrial Rela-
 tions Commission, which insures that they suffer no net disadvantage. The legisla-
 tion also created an industrial relations court to adudicate disputes, especially the
 failure to bargain in good faith, arising from the increased use of enterprise-level
 Expotapocesin zones doa not exist.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Although there are no laws pr-
 ibiting it, forced labor is not practiced in Australia.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-There is no federally mandated
 minimum age for employment, but state-imposed compulsory education require-
 ments, monitored and enforced by state educational authorities, effectively prevent
 most children from joining the work force until they are 15 or 16 years of age. Fed-
 eral and state governments monitor and enforce a network of laws, which vary from
 state to state, governing minimum school-leaving age, minimum age to claim unem-
 ployment benefits, and minimum age to engage in specified occupations.
 e. Acceptable Conditions q' Work.-Although a formal minimum wage exists, it
 has not been relevant in wage setting since the 1960's. Instead, 80 percent of work-
 er are covered by differing minimum wage rates for individual trades and profes-
 sions, all of which are sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker
 and his family. However, cottage industry work has grown recently, especially in the
 clothing industry. These workers, working at home and paid by piecework, com-
 monly earn less than $1.50 (A$2.00) hourly, not enough to maintain decent living
 standards. The ALP, at its September 1994 Congress, noted that such worker are
 almost always women (frequently immigrants); it urged the Government to inves-
 tigate this phenomenon and afford such workers the wide range of protections and
 entitlements found in the formal labor market.
 Most workers are employees of incorporated organizations. For them, a complex
 body of government regulations, as well as decisions of the applicable federai or
 state industrial relations commission, presece a 40-hour or shorter workweek, paid
 vacations, sick leave, and other beneits, includion at least one 24-hour rest period
 per week.
 Federal or state safety laws apply to every workplace. The Occupational Health
 and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act of 1991 gives a federal employee the
 legal right to cease work if he or she believes that particular work activities pose
 an immediate threat to individual health or safety. Most states and territories have
 laws that grant similar rights to their employees. At a minimum, private sector em-
 ployees have recourse to state health and safety commissions, which will investigate
 complaints and demand remedial action.
