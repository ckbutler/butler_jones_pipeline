 MALDIVES
 Maldives is a country of 1200 islands in the Indian Ocean,
 400 miles from its nearest neighbor. The country was governed
 as an hereditary sultanate for centuries. A British protec-
 torate from 1887.to 1965, Maldives in the past several decades
 experimented with various forms of government, including an
 elected sultanate and republicanism. The present system
 provides for a strong President, assisted by a Council of
 Ministers, and an elected Parliament, called the "Majlis".
 Maldives historically has been ruled in an authoritarian
 manner and its Islamic society traditionally has been governed
 by the principles of Shariat Law. The constitution guarantees
 basic human rights, but in the political sphere in particular
 their practice is just begipning. Economically, Maldives has
 been experiencing rapid growth in the past few years. The
 government has committed itself to providing basic human needs
 and improving the quality of life in a country which is listed
 by the United Nations as one of the world's poorest.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Under the Maldivian constitution, no person may be penalized
 except as convicted under Shariat Law (Islamic Code) or on
 conditions specified by law and "under no circumstance can
 an injury be inflicted". The government does not condone
 torture and no allegations of torture have been made in 1980,
 to the best available information.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There is a detention center in Maldives, but no prisons.
 Violent crime occurs rarely. Common forms of punishment for
 crimes are fines, payment of compensation, house arrest, and
 banishment to thinly-inhabited islands where the person must
 earn his own living but is otherwise unrestricted. Severe
 forms of corporal punishment provided for in Shariat law are
 not imposed in Maldives.
 c. Disappearances
 No allegations of abductions, secret arrests or clandestine
 detention by government officials, were received in 1980.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Maldives has a long history of banishing influential persons
 for political reasons. Often such persons are later returned
 to positions of power. Some persons associated with the
 former regime have been sentenced to banishment or house
 arrest on charges related to security of the state or creat-
 ing disaffection toward the government. Several persons,
 including the former President, who now lives abroad, are
 under investigation on charges that they fomented an aborted
 coup in 1980 employing foreign mercenaries. Statistics on
 numbers of persons detained or sentenced to banishment are
 not available. In a July 1980 press interview, a high
 government official said that 15 persons were under arrest
 at the time, in connection with the recent attempt: nine in
 detention, five under house arrrest and one in exile. Some
 others were questioned and released. According to law, a
 
 
 1046
 suspect may be detained for two weeks or placed under house
 arrest while a case is being investigated. By authority of
 the President, detention may be extended another month. In
 practice, it appears that suspected persons are sometimes
 detained for longer periods.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The legal system of Maldives derives from traditional
 Islamic law, but a body of civil law is developing to meet
 circumstances of modernization. The system is administered
 by secular officials, a Chief Justice, lesser judges, and
 legal officials known as "Gazis" who are trained in Male
 (the capital island) and assigned to islands throughout the
 country. The governmeht is also considering establishment
 of a High Court to try major cases. The President appoints
 judges and they function under the Ministry of Justice and
 the Attorney General. In the islands, hearings are open to
 the public, and the accused have the right to defend them-
 selves, proceedings are recorded, and there is a right of
 appeal to the central government in Male.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 According to the constitution, private premises and dwelling
 places shall be respected and shall not be trespassed, save
 under conditions specified by law.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 Maldives' estimated 147,000 people live on some 200 islands
 scattered within the 500-mile length and 88-mile breadth of
 the country. The economic base of Maldives is limited,
 with no natural resources except fishing grounds. Fishing
 is the main source of individual income. Agriculture is
 minimal and basic food staples, such as rice and sugar, have
 to be imported. Manufacturing is practically non-existent.
 Per capita income is less than $200. With the assistance of
 foreign governments and international agencies, the govern-
 ment is undertaking programs to improve the economy, to
 foster rural development, and to provide educational, health
 and social services to the people, particularly on outer
 atolls. Past development has concentrated on the capital
 island of Male where there is a 48-bed hospital and the
 country's only secondary schools. There are health workers
 and health centers in some of the atolls. Other than in
 Male, the capital, education traditionally has been provided
 in small island schools at a basic level. Females share
 about equally in the educational system.
 Provision of shelter is not a major problem, except in Male,
 where the burgeoning population (estimated 32,000) has led
 to scarcity of house lots for lease and caused the government
 to seek to reclaim the maximum amount of land from the
 adjacent shallow sea. As in the past, all land in Maldives
 is state-owned. Citizens are allotted standard house lots
 in perpetuity, rent free, and own the building they construct.
 Women may own and inherit such property. The government
 leases out agricultural land at standard rates. Unemployment
 and underemployment are high, and the government is seeking to
 promote additional opportunities through tourism, mechanizing
 and enlarging the fishing fleet, encouraging commercial
 vegetable cultivation (particularly as a source of employment
 for women), and seeking foreign investment and projects. The
 government is committed to fulfilling basic human needs.

 Provision of services is currently limited by budgetary
 constraints, inadequately trained manpower, dispersal of
 the small population over a wide area, and an inadequate
 transportation system.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The Maldivian constitution provides that every person is
 entitled to freedom of speech, press, assembly, and associ-
 ation so long as provisions of Shariat and Civil law are not
 contravened. However, exercise of certain of these freedoms,
 such as that of assembly, is limited in practice.
 There is no prior press censorship, although all publications
 must be registered with the government. Newspapers exercise
 self-censorship, since journalists are subject to prosecution
 if articles are deemed to contravene a number of laws (such
 as one prohibiting "arousal of ill feelings against a law-
 fully formed government"). The Republic of Maldives is an
 Islamic state. There are few if any Maldivians of other
 religions. Associations such as clubs, parties, and companies
 which do not contravene rules of behavior prescribed by
 Shariat and civil law are permitted but must register with
 the government. There are no trade unions nor have strikes
 taken place; there is no information to determine their legal
 status.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Maldivians are free to travel within and outside their
 country. There are certain requirements that must be met in
 changing one's island of residence, particularly to densely
 populated Male, where more than 20 percent of the population
 now lives. The widely dispersed population makes provision
 of services difficult, but the government does not favor
 consolidation of population on larger islands. Instead, it
 attempts t encourage voluntary relocation by bringing
 services to the people.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 There are no organized political parties in Maldives, and
 there is no information to indicate their legal status.
 Candidates stand for election to the Majlis. Political rallies
 are not the custom, and candidates "campaign" on the basis
 of personal approaches. Participation in the political
 system is open to all citizens. Women have the vote and may
 hold political office. The Presidency is limited to men.
 The President is chosen by the Majlis and then confirmed or
 rejected in a national referendum by secret ballot. Women's
 role is limited in Maldivian society and in the political
 process, but some serve as government officials and as
 delegates to conferences abroad.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There have been no known requests for outside investigations
 of any alleged violations of human rights in Maldives. There
 are no local human rights organizations.
