 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 The United Kingdom (U.K.) is a constitutional monarchy, with
 government based on a multiparty, parliamentary democracy. As
 there is no written constitution, human rights are "residual,"
 i.e., assumed unless limited by statute. Human rights have
 traditionally been respected and guarded by the British people
 and their elected governments.
 Great Britain has a long tradition of respect for basic human
 rights. Public safety is maintained by a civilian police
 force. In Northern Ireland, however, human rights traditions
 have been, from time to time, put to the test as the British
 Government combats terrorism by militant organizations
 demanding the forcible unification of Ireland, as well as
 reciprocal violence by both militant nationalists and
 loyalist groups against Catholics. Since 1969, Army units
 have backed up the police in an effort to provide security.
 The United Kingdom's highly developed industrial economy has a
 mix of private and state-owned industries. Individuals may
 freely own property and pursue private economic interests
 under the law, and the population benefits from a
 comprehensive social welfare program. Public policy,
 supported by legislation and tradition, opposes discrimination
 on the basis of race, religion, sex, or political opinion.
 The principal development affecting human rights practices in
 Great Britain in 1985 was urban rioting in London suburbs,
 which led to government proposals for new legislation on
 public disorder.
 On November 15, 1985, the British and Irish Governments
 concluded an agreement which gives the Irish Government a
 consultative role in certain Northern Ireland affairs. Both
 the Irish and British Parliaments subsequently approved the
 agreement. Rejecting the agreement, Unionist members of the
 British Parliament resigned their seats and look forward to
 January 1986 by-elections as a popular referendum on the
 agreement.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The British Government does not practice or condone killing
 for political motives. Under law, police may use only
 reasonable force in the prevention of crime.
 The Government reported that during 1985, 47 persons were
 killed by terrorists in incidents related to Northern Ireland,
 about three-fifths belonging to the security forces. During
 the same period, security forces killed five persons. In an
 incident in February 1985, for which the Provisional Irish
 Republican Army (PIRA) claimed responsibility, 14 policemen
 were killed in a mortar attack on a Royal Ulster Constabulary
 station in Newry. Since 1969, 2,465 persons on all sides have
 died in Northern Ireland-related violence.
 Human rights activists have expressed concern over the use by
 security forces in Northern Ireland of plastic baton rounds
 (PBR's or plastic bullets) for the purpose of riot control,
 
 
 1138
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 which has led to over a dozen deaths in recent years. In
 April 1985 one Northern Ireland policeman was charged with
 manslaughter and another with assault in connection with the
 death of a man struck in the chest by a plastic bullet fired
 at close range at an August 1984 political rally in Belfast.
 In 1984, the European Parliament passed a resolution calling
 for a ban on PBR use in Northern Ireland. While acknowledging
 the danger of PBR use, the British Government contends they
 are less dangerous than live rounds. This view was supported
 in October.1984 when the European Commission on Human Rights
 dismissed as "manifestly ill-founded" a case on PBR's, ruling
 that their use was "acceptable" and "less dangerous than
 alleged."
 b. Disappearance
 Government authorities do not abduct, secretly arrest, or hold
 persons in clandestine confinement, nor do they sponsor or
 condone such activities.
 The Government reported that, during the first 7 months of
 1985, 50 persons were abducted or illegally detained by
 terrorists in incidents related to Northern Ireland.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 British domestic law forbids mistreatment or torture of
 prisoners and provides penalties for such abuse. Confessions
 obtained by torture or any other inhuman or degrading
 treatment are not admissible as evidence in court. British
 official policy prohibits deliberately cruel, inhuman, or
 degrading treatment or punishment of prisoners.
 In questioning arrested persons, police are expected to comply
 with the Judges' Rules and Administrative Directions. These
 rules serve only as guidelines because the United Kingdom has
 no exclusionary rule. Improperly obtained evidence and
 statements made by an accused person before being warned of
 his rights may be used in court. However, judges can and do
 refuse to accept improperly obtained evidence.
 The Judge's Rules are to be superseded in January 1986 by a
 Code of Practice for the police which has been approved by
 Parliament. Failure to comply with any provisions of the Code
 will render a police officer liable to disciplinary action.
 Under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act of 1984, an
 independent Police Complaints Authority was established in
 April 1985 in England and Wales. It will also have the
 authority to initiate investigations based on media reports.
 The Government plans to introduce similar legislation to cover
 Northern Ireland.
 The Government acknowledges that some old British prisons are
 unsatisfactory and overcrowded and that many prisoners live in
 cramped, unhygienic cells. Britain's prison population is
 rapidly rising, up 5,000 in 1985 to approximately 46,000, but
 prison facilities are officially capable of holding only
 40,000 persons. To relieve overcrowding, the Government is
 expanding parole opportunities and planning to build 16 new
 prisons. The prison service budget has increased 85 percent
 since 1979. Nonetheless, the Prison Officers Association has
 
 
 1139
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 complained about a shortage of prison staff, claiming that
 overtime for its members averages over 16 hours a week. Home
 Office figures show that, in some prisons, guards have been
 working 80-hour weeks.
 Prison conditions in Northern Ireland differ in some respects
 from those in Great Britain. All prisons in the province are
 maximum-security institutions, forcing low-risk common
 criminals to serve under maximum-security conditions. On the
 other hand, Northern Ireland prisons are newer and less
 crowded than those in Great Britain, and prisoners can wear
 civilian rather than prison clothing. Prisoners are also
 entitled to weekly visits and parcels, while mainland
 prisoners get these privileges monthly. The prison population
 in Northern Ireland, as opposed to that in the U.K. as a
 whole, declined by over one-third from September 1984 to
 September 1985.
 There continue to be complaints about "strip searching" in
 Northern Ireland prisons, especially of female prisoners at
 Armagh prison. Strip searching is now conducted on a random
 basis for prisoners making home visits or court appearances.
 Visitors to prisons, including government officials, are
 subject to a "rub-down search," which involves an officer's
 passing his or her hands over the visitor's clothing to detect
 hidden weapons. Despite allegations to the contrary, visitors
 to prisons, unlike the prisoners themselves, are not subject
 to strip searches.
 In March 1985, Amnesty International expressed concern about
 evidence it says strongly supports allegations by a Northern
 Ireland man that he was tortured and ill-treated during
 questioning by the police in August 1984. In May 1985,
 Britain ratified the Council of Europe Convention on sentenced
 persons, which allows prisoners to be sent to their home
 countries to serve their sentences. Within the U.K., convicts
 are almost always required to serve their prison time in the
 general region in which they committed the crime. For
 example, persons from Northern Ireland convicted of offenses
 in mainland Britain are usually made to serve their sentences
 in the jurisdictions where the crimes were committed.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Police and Criminal Evidence Act of 1984 and the Criminal
 Law Act (Northern Ireland) of 1967, which applies similar
 provisions to Northern Ireland, empower a constable to arrest
 without warrant, but with reasonable cause, any person who he
 suspects has committed, is committing, or is about to commit
 what is, or what he reasonably suspects to be, an arrestable
 offense. Procedures for bail, judicial determination of the
 legality of detention, and suits for false imprisonment are
 routinely utilized in the United Kingdom.
 Except as noted below, anyone arrested without a warrant must
 be released on bail if he or she cannot be brought before a
 magistrate's court within 24 hours, unless the alleged offense
 is serious. If detained in custody the defendant must be
 brought before a magistrate's court as soon as practicable.
 In some cases, magistrates have repeatedly remanded persons
 into custody for periods totaling up to 18 months before
 trial. With the recent opening of several new courts,
 including a temporary building to relieve long waits in the
 Greater London area, remand prisoners are now being held for
 
 
 1140
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 shorter periods before trial. Nonetheless, 26 percent of
 persons in jail are remand prisoners awaiting trial. One
 Northern Ireland man charged with terrorist offenses was a
 remand prisoner for over 3-1/2 years and was acquitted in four
 trials before conviction on five terrorist-related charges,
 including murder, in his fifth trial. Human rights
 organizations have regularly criticized such delays.
 Subject to review by Parliament, British common law allows for
 the abrogation of individual liberties by the executive in an
 emergency situation, such as the one posed by the continuing
 violence in Northern Ireland. Acting on the premise that the
 fundamental "right to life" was in serious jeopardy due to the
 violence in Northern Ireland, the British Government adopted
 two acts to deal with the threat: The Northern Ireland
 (Emergency Provisions) Act of 1973, now amended and
 consolidated as the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions)
 Act of 1978, which is applicable only to Northern Ireland; and
 the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act of
 1984, (originally enacted in 1976), almost all of which is
 applicable to the entire United Kingdom. Although both these
 acts empower the restriction of personal liberties, they are
 subject to parliamentary review and to mandatory renewal at
 frequent intervals.
 The 1984 Prevention of Terrorism Act gives the police the
 power to arrest without warrant persons anywhere in the United
 Kingdom whom they reasonably suspect to be involved in
 terrorism or from whom they wish to obtain information on
 terrorism. Such persons may be detained for up to 48 hours
 after arrest, and detention may be extended 5 days, provided
 that suspicion of their involvement with terrorism is such as
 to bring them within the criteria for arrest established by
 the Act. In 1985, this Act was used frequently to detain
 persons suspected of planning terrorist acts related to
 Northern Ireland, India, and the Middle East.
 Under the 1978 Emergency Provisions Act, the Northern Ireland
 police are empowered to arrest without warrant a person
 suspected of being a terrorist, and to detain that person for
 up to 72 hours on their own authority. The Act also gives the
 Northern Ireland police the power to arrest without warrant a
 person suspected of having committed, or being about to
 commit, a "scheduled" offense (i.e., one listed on a schedule
 attached to the law). For the purpose of doing so, the police
 may enter and search without a warrant any premises or other
 place where that person is or where the police suspect him of
 being. Also under this Act, members of the armed forces on
 duty may arrest suspected terrorists without warrant and hold
 them for up to 4 hours, after which they must be transferred
 to police custody or released. Allegations that these limits
 have been exceeded by the police or the armed forces have not
 been substantiated. In Northern Ireland, the police generally
 act in accordance with the provisions of the Prevention of
 Terrorism Act and the Emergency Provisions Act whereunder
 arrested persons have the right of access to a solicitor after
 48 hours of detention. Human rights activists allege,
 however, that the 48-hour rule is not always followed.
 An independent review of the 1978 Act by Sir George Baker,
 published in April 1984, concluded that its provisions were
 still necessary. The Northern Ireland Secretary announced in
 June 1985 that the Government would introduce a bill in
 Parliament within 2 or 3 years to implement several of Baker's
 
 
 1141
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 recommendations. These would include provisions to increase
 the Attorney General's discretion to try specific cases by
 regular rather than non-jury courts, to rationalize police
 powers of arrest, and to limit the life of the legislation to
 5 years.
 There is no forced or compulsory labor practiced in the United
 Kingdom.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair trial is guaranteed by law and observed in practice. All
 criminal proceedings are conducted in public, with the
 exception of cases involving public security; public decency,
 at the judge's discretion; and juvenile court cases, from
 which the public, but not the press, is excluded. In a trial
 of charges under the Official Secrets Act, the court can be
 closed at the judge's discretion; the sentence must always be
 passed in public. In a 1985 trial, under this Act, of a
 government official charged with leaking documents on the
 Falklands war, the court was open to the press.
 The Prosecution of Offenses Bill of 1985 will establish a new
 national, independent prosecution service, taking over from
 the police the role of deciding whether to prosecute
 individual cases. The bill's national coverage is intended to
 achieve more consistency than is presently possible with
 prosecutions initiated by dozens of police departments across
 the country.
 In Northern Ireland, certain cases are tried by a judge
 without a jury, under legislation which decrees that terrorist
 offenses be tried in this manner. This form of criminal trial
 was introduced in 1972, following proposals of the Diplock
 Committee, which was established to consider legal procedures
 to deal with terrorist activities in Northern Ireland. The
 committee recommended that, for the duration of the emergency
 and for scheduled offenses, trial by a single judge should
 replace trial by jury. Among the arguments for this
 recommendation were that jurors were open to and afraid of
 intimidation or acts of physical violence against them, and
 that there was a continuing risk of unusual verdicts by
 partisan juries. However, juries continue to sit on all
 offenses not enumerated in antiterrorist legislation, and
 these constitute the majority of criminal cases. The 1984
 Baker Report concluded that restoration of jury trials for
 terrorist offenses is not possible given present conditions in
 Northern Ireland.
 The absence of a jury and the ability to convict solely on the
 basis of confession have been the subjects of criticism. Some
 human rights activists see an increasing tendency to rely on
 confessions rather than search for independent evidence of
 guilt or innocence. They criticize the lengthy time spent in
 custody awaiting trial. Critics also maintain that the
 conviction rates in the Diplock courts are unusually high.
 However, conviction rates in Diplock courts are no higher than
 those in non-Diplock jury courts, with about half those
 pleading innocent being found not guilty as charged. Judges
 in Diplock courts must give written reasons for their
 decisions, which are made public. Defendants convicted in
 Diplock courts have an automatic right of appeal to the
 three-judge Court of Appeals (Criminal), on any ground,
 against conviction or a sentence. In October 1985, such an
 
 
 1142
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 appellate court reversed the muraer conviction of a leading
 Irish Republican paramilitary figure.
 The use of evidence provided by terrorist informers
 ("supergrasses") in non-jury courts continues to be
 controversial. Government officials state that the use of
 these informers has led to a marked reduction in the level of
 violence in Northern Ireland. Although the evidence of an
 accomplice has always been admissible in U.K. courts, in
 nonjury courts the judge alone must decide whether the
 evidence of the "supergrass" is credible, bearing in mind the
 danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of an
 accomplice.
 The Government maintains that the use of informers is vital in
 the legal fight against terrorism; but critics assert that
 this places too great a burden of assessing credibility on a
 single individual. They also question whether the gains to
 security and public safety arising from the "supergrass"
 procedure outweigh the dangers to the integrity of the
 judicial system in Northern Ireland. The use of
 uncorroborated evidence seems to be returning fewer
 convictions. The three "supergrass" trials held in 1985
 resulted in 43 convictions and 60 acquittals.
 The Criminal Law Jurisdictions Act, enacted by both the
 British Government (1975) and Irish Government (1976), permits
 trial in the Republic of Ireland, in Northern Ireland, or in
 Britain of those accused of certain terrorist offenses,
 regardless of where the offense was committed.
 On November 15, 1985, the British and Irish Governments signed
 an agreement giving Dublin a consultative voice in Northern
 Ireland affairs through an Intergovernmental Conference. One
 of the prime topics of the Conference, which met for the first
 time in December 1985, is the administration of justice in
 Northern Ireland.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The right of privacy is well respected in both law and custom.
 In a 1983 case, the European Court of Human Rights found the
 British Government'technically at fault with regard to police
 use of telephone tapping, as regulations allowing wiretapping
 only under a warrant from the Home Secretary were
 administrative and not statutory. The Government's
 Interception of Communications Bill of 1985 is designed to
 meet the Court's criticism.
 Warrants are generally required to search private premises.
 However, under the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act
 of 1978, any member of the armed forces on duty or any
 constable may enter any premises or other place, if he or she
 considers it necessary to do so to preserve peace or maintain
 order. This provision was introduced in recognition of the
 practical difficulty of obtaining a warrant in certain
 situations involving terrorist incidents, but it has been
 criticized for allowing excessively broad powers of entry on
 mere suspicion of wrongdoing.
 The Data Protection Act of 1984, designed to protect
 individuals against misuses of personal data stored in
 computers, came into force in 1985.
 
 
 1143
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Personal liberty and freedom of speech are well established by
 British history, custom, and tradition. While the Government.
 appoints the Board of Governors of the British Broadcasting
 Corporation (BBC), it does not seek to control the content of
 programs. Viewpoints independent and critical of the
 Government are well represented.
 In July 1985, when the Government learned of BBC plans to
 broadcast a television documentary featuring the reputed
 Provisional IRA Chief of Staff, the Home Secretary wrote to
 the BBC that terrorism "thrives on the oxygen of publicity"
 and asked that, in the national interest, the program not be
 screened. The request provoked public discussion of the
 issues of freedom of speech and the BBC's independence. The
 program was broadcast in late October with minor alterations.
 There is no government intimidation or censorship of the
 media, foreign and domestic books, and artistic works. On
 matters of national security falling under the Official
 Secrets Act, the Government may seek to prevent the
 publication of certain materials. In early 1985 , however, a
 former Assistant Secretary of Defense was tried under this Act
 and found innocent for leaking papers alleging government
 misconduct related to the sinking of an Argentine warship in
 1982.
 Self-policing by the media is practiced by such independent
 bodies as the British Board of Film Classification operating
 under clear, published, apolitical guidelines. Material may
 be subject to legal action under very restricted
 circumstances, such as the infringement of libel laws.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association are a part of the
 tradition of civil liberties in the United Kingdom. Except in
 cases of extreme civil disorders in which public safety is
 judged to be at risk, the British authorities do not exercise
 their statutory right to limit individuals' freedom to attend
 public meetings of their choice. Neither is any limitation
 ,placed on individual freedom to join associations, including
 trade unions, with the exception of several terrorist
 organizations.
 British trade unions have full rights, deriving from common
 law rather than statute, to organize, bargain collectively,
 and strike on behalf of their own members. The Employment Act
 of 1980, however, makes unions liable under civil law for
 losses resulting from "sympathy" strikes. In the rare
 instance where the right to strike is prohibited, e.g., for
 police officers, there are other means to resolve labor
 differences.
 The Government does not control, intimidate, harass, or
 persecute unions and other associations, nor does it limit in
 any way their freedom to maintain relations with recognized
 international bodies. However, in 1984 the Government
 prohibited continued trade union membership for public
 employees at its communications headquarters at Cheltenham on
 grounds of national security. The ban was first overturned
 
 
 1144
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 and then upheld in the courts. This controversy continued
 into 1985 as the Government threatened to fire approximately
 100 employees who rejoined their banned union. In 1984 and
 again in 1985, the issue was considered by the International
 Labor Organization which urged the Government to negotiate
 with the unions involved to reach an agreement that would meet
 the Government's concerns and conform to the ILO Convention on
 Freedom of Association. Employees have also taken the
 Government to the European Court of Human Rights, where the
 case is now pending.
 In connection with the lengthy 1984 coal miners' strike, some
 commentators expressed concern about limitations on secondary
 picketing, which is illegal in the United Kingdom; inhibitions
 on the movement of striking miners into areas where miners are
 not on strike; and allegations of police brutality in
 confrontations with strikers. Others have called attention to
 instances of intimidation against working miners by those on
 strike.
 Another significant exception to freedom of association in the
 United Kingdom is a response to terrorist violence associated
 with Northern Ireland. The Prevention of Terrorism Act of
 1984 and the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act of
 1978 include sections prohibiting membership in or support of
 organizations (Loyalist and Republican) which are involved in
 terrorism. These organizations are specifically listed in the
 statutes. Despite pressure, the lists do not include
 political parties, even those, such as Provisional Sinn Fein,
 which have close links to terrorist paramilitary organizations
 and openly support violence.
 The Government announced in the spring of 1985 that it
 intended to introduce a number of public order measures called
 for in a White Paper discussing the inner city riot of 1981,
 violence during the coal miners' strike, and disorder at
 soccer games. These measures will give the police the power
 to control numbers of pickets, to fix crowd limits at sporting
 events where trouble is expected, and to require demonstrators
 or pickets to move from sensitive areas where violence is
 likely to occur. Laws already prohibiting conduct likely or
 intended to stir up racial hatred are to be tightened, and the
 possession of racially inflammatory material for distribution
 is to be made a new offense. When announcing the Government's
 planned public order measures, the Home Secretary said that
 people had the right to be protected against being bullied,
 hurt, intimidated, or obstructed. Critics responded that they
 believed the planned legislation would dangerously infringe
 civil liberties and the right to peaceful dissent.
 Subsequently, after riots in London suburbs, the Home
 Secretary announced the Government would introduce legislation
 to create a new offense of public disorder.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 As a matter of government policy and in general practice,
 everyone in Britain has religious freedom (in teaching,
 worship, and observance) without interference from the
 community or the state. Churches and religious societies may
 own property, conduct schools, and propagate their beliefs in
 speech and writing. Virtually every religion and sect found
 in the world is represented in the United Kingdom. There is
 no religious or denominational bar to the holding of public
 office except in the case of the Sovereign, who must be a
 
 
 1145
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 member of the Church of England. The Sovereign's children
 must be raised in this church or they lose their right of
 succession to the throne.
 England and Scotland both have established churches. The
 established church's relationship with the State is one of
 mutual obligation--privileges accorded to the church balanced
 by certain duties which it must fulfill. The State makes no
 direct financial contribution to church expenses. Church
 independence was demonstrated in 1985 when leading bishops
 criticized government policies. The existence of established
 churches does not limit the freedom or access to public life
 of members of other churches. The Church of Ireland and the
 Church of England in Wales have been disestablished.
 In Northern Ireland, the Constitution Act of 1973 specifically
 prohibits discrimination on the basis of religious belief or
 political opinion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 In general, U.K. citizens have freedom of movement within the
 country, and in foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation.
 One exception to this general principle is contained in the
 Prevention of Terrorism Act of 1984. The Act gives the Home
 Secretary the authority to exclude or prevent from entering
 mainland Britain anyone he believes may be connected with
 terrorism related to Northern Ireland, unless that person was
 born in Great Britain or has been ordinarily resident there
 for 3 years. Only one person was excluded in 1984, and none
 were excluded in 1985. The Secretary of State for Northern
 Ireland also has the power to exclude people from that
 province on the same grounds, unless they were born and have
 been ordinarily resident in Northern Ireland, or have been
 ordinarily resident there for 3 years. In addition, any
 person may be excluded from the United Kingdom who may be
 ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom, but who is not a
 U.K. citizen, and is involved in terrorism related to Northern
 Ireland. Once excluded from a region of the United Kingdom,
 the person is forbidden to reenter that area. Under the 1984
 Act, exclusion orders are subject to review after they have
 been in force for 3 years. These powers have been referred to
 by many, including the National Council for Civil Liberties,
 as a system of internal exile.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The United Kingdom is ruled by a Government formed on the
 basis of a majority of seats in the House of Commons won in
 freely contested elections. Participation in the political
 process is open to all persons and parties, of which there are
 several representing a broad range of political views.
 For parliamentary and local elections, the franchise is given
 to all citizens 18 years of age and over. The right to
 citizenship itself was significantly affected by the British
 Nationality Act, which came into force on January 1, 1983.
 Under one of its provisions, the automatic, unchallengeable
 right to British nationality, previously accorded to virtually
 every child born in Britain, now extends only to those
 
 
 1146
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 children born on British soil, of whom one parent has the
 right of permanent residence in the United Kingdom.
 Women have full rights of participation and are represented at
 all levels of British political life, but in relatively small
 numbers. Of 650 members of Parliament, 24, including the
 Prime Minister, are women. Women officials in both major
 political parties have complained of de facto discrimination
 against women within their respective parties.
 While racial minorities comprise about 5 percent of the total
 population, no members of these groups presently sit in the
 House of Commons, although some are members of the House of
 Lords. Many non-white Britons, however, have been elected to
 local government, and in 1985 the first ethnic Asian mayor of
 a British city took office in Bradford.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government generally maintains an open attitude toward
 international inquiries into alleged violations of human
 rights in the United Kingdom. It cooperates fully with the
 European Commission on Human Rights in investigations of
 complaints. The Government took a number of steps in 1985 to
 rectify its own laws and policies when they were found not to
 be in conformity with the European Convention. In response to
 a decision of the European Court of Human Rights, the
 Government introduced the Education (Corporal Punishment) Bill
 of 1985 to give parents the right to exempt their children
 from caning in schools. The House of Lords, however, voted
 for the total abolition of corporal punishment in both state
 and private schools. No legislation to comply with the
 courts' judgment has yet been passed.
 In May 1985, the European Court of Human Rights ruled against
 Britain's immigration policy which restricted some foreign
 husbands, but not wives, from joining spouses legally settled
 in the United Kingdom. To comply with the court's ruling, the
 Government in July extended to wives the "Primary Purpose"
 Rule, which requires men seeking to join wives in Britain to
 prove that their main purpose in going to Britain is marriage
 and not immigration.
 The United Kingdom is a party to several human rights
 conventions, participates in international and regional human
 rights bodies, and is the host country to international
 nongovernmental human rights organizations, such as Amnesty
 International.
 In its 1985 Report (covering the year 1984), Amnesty
 International was concerned about allegations of torture and
 ill-treatment during interrogation of political suspects in
 Northern Ireland; judicial procedures in political cases in
 Northern Ireland and shootings by security forces there; and
 allegations of ill-treatment of arrested miners by the
 police. Freedom House rated the United Kingdom "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 With a population of just over 56.4 million, the United
 Kingdom's per capita gross national product in 1983 was about
 $9,200.
 
 
 1147
 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND
 Through a highly developed welfare system available to all
 inhabitants regardless of race, religion, sex, ethnicity, or
 political opinion, the British Government meets the health,
 educational, and other basic needs of the people. The
 National Health Service provides comprehensive medical
 services to the entire population at virtually no charge to
 the user. Life expectancy at birth is 74 years, and infant
 mortality is 9.8 per 1,000 live births. The primary school
 enrollment ratio for both boys and girls in 1981 was 97.0.
 Minors are allowed to do limited part-time work beginning at
 age 14. Working conditions and hours are strictly regulated
 to ensure that a job does not interfere with school. At age
 16, minors are considered adults for purposes of working hours
 and conditions.
 Although Britain has no national minimum wage, about 48
 percent of the work force belongs to labor unions that set
 their wages with employers. Until September 1985, organized
 labor opposed a national minimum wage. For about 10 percent
 ,of workers, wages councils comprising representatives of
 management, labor, and the public set minimum wages and other
 conditions of employment. The Government plans to abolish
 minimum wages set by wages councils for persons under 18.
 Basic rights for other nonunion workers, including white
 collar professionals are covered by employment protection
 legislation. Turn-of-the-century legislation still prohibits
 night work and excessive overtime for women employed in most
 manufacturing occupations. Critics of these laws contend such
 legislation can bar women from well-paid jobs requiring shift
 work or occasional lengthy overtime.
 Under the terms of the 1974 Health and Safety at Work Act, the
 Health and Safety Executive enforces strict occupational
 standards of health, safety, and working environment
 conditions. The Health and Safety Commission, consisting of
 management, labor, and public members, supervises the
 Executive and can develop new codes and regulations subject to
 government approval.
 Equal status and equal opportunity for women in professional
 fields is provided by law. Under the Equal Pay Act of 1970,
 women are entitled to equal pay with men for doing work that
 is the same or broadly similar. The Sex Discrimination Act of
 1975 guarantees equality of status and opportunity for women.
 The Equal Opportunities Commission assists in the enforcement
 of these acts. There is corresponding legislation and a
 separate commission for Northern Ireland.
 Despite their legal rights to equal employment, however, in
 practice women have yet to achieve fully equal status in the
 United Kingdom. Women hold three-quarters of Britain's
 lowest-paying jobs, and the average female wage-earner takes
 home only three-quarters the pay of her male counterpart, up
 from 63 percent in 1970. Trade unions have complained of
 discrimination against women in occupational pension schemes,
 unemployment benefits, inadequate care allowances, and
 housewives' noncontributory invalidity pensions.
 Progress toward women's equality is also visible. In November
 1983, a rule change in the Social Security benefit payments
 system allowed women to be treated as head of the household
 and to claim benefits in ways that only men could do

 previously. Over twice as many women as men have been
 recruited into the civil service over the past few years in an
 attempt to redress previous imbalances. In 1985, bills passed
 Parliament prohibiting female circumcision and outlawing curb
 crawling by men in cars soliciting prostitution. The National
 Council for Civil Liberties opposed the latter bill, because
 they said it would lead to unfair arrests. Another bill
 pending in Parliament would increase the presently lower
 penalty for indecent assault upon a woman to equal the maximum
 penalty for assault upon a man.
 The Race Relations Act of 1976 bars discrimination on the
 basis of race, color, nationality, or national or ethnic
 origin. Some studies have documented a black unemployment
 rate that is nearly double that of whites, black
 overrepresentation in manual jobs, and racial discrimination
 in job recruitment. In 1984, a Code of Practice on Employment
 proposed by the Commission for Racial Equality and accepted by
 the Government, took effect. Although the Code does not have
 the force of law, it is used as a standard of good practice by
 industrial tribunals in racial discrimination cases and serves
 as a guideline for firms in eliminating direct and indirect
 forms of discrimination. The Church of England's first black
 bishop to serve in Britain was consecrated Bishop of Croydon
 in July 1985.
 In Northern Ireland, the majority Protestant community is more
 prosperous and highly skilled than the Catholic community, and
 controls much of the local economy. The unemployment rate in
 Northern Ireland is substantially higher than that of the
 United Kingdom as a whole, and, according to a July 1985
 Northern Ireland Office report, twice as high for the minority
 Catholic population as for Protestants. The reasons for this
 are complex, involving a long history of discrimination by the
 one community against the other for the purpose of maintaining
 its traditionally dominant position. In addition, a higher
 Catholic population in younger age groups and rural areas,
 which suffers from higher unemployment throughout the United
 Kingdom, tends to skew this statistic, although Catholic youth
 unemployment is still higher than that for Protestants.
 British Government policy attempts to alleviate the problem by
 promoting equal opportunities, attracting more investment to
 the area, and subsidizing the economy through public sector
 spending.
 Since 1972, when direct British rule was introduced in
 Northern Ireland, specific measures have been taken to combat
 religious discrimination against Catholics. These include the
 institution of universal suffrage and abolition of voting
 limitations based on property; the Representation of the
 People Act of 1985 to ensure more honest elections;
 prohibition of religious or political discrimination by any
 level of government; establishment of a Commissioner for
 Complaints to deal with grievances against local government;
 establishment of a Central Housing Authority to meet the
 problem of discrimination in housing; prohibition of
 discrimination in employment; and a special effort to recruit
 more Catholics into the Civil Service and the Police. While
 not disputing the value of these structures, critics are not
 satisfied and point to slow progress in remedying historical
 imbalances.
 Within the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the proportion of
 Catholics reflects their proportion in the overall population

 in lower (under 35) age groups. In upper age groups and in
 the security forces, Protestants still dominate. Recruitment
 of Catholics into the security forces is made more difficult
 by terrorist threats, often carried out, to kill Catholics who
 join the Royal Ulster Constabulary or Ulster Defence Regiment.
