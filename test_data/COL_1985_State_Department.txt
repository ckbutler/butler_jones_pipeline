 COLOMBIA
 Colombia is a two-party democracy in which elected governments
 have ruled for all but four years (1953-57) of this century.
 While Colombia's two traditional political parties, the
 Liberals and the Conservatives, have dominated the political
 arena since the mid-19th century, smaller parties have fielded
 candidates at all levels and are usually represented in
 Congress, state assemblies and city councils. Governors and
 mayors are appointed by the President under a constitutional
 provision requiring "adequate and equitable" representation of
 the major party not holding the Presidency. On January 1,
 1986, the constitution was amended to provide for direct
 election of mayors beginning in March 1988.
 Notwithstanding its long tradition of electoral democracy,
 Colombia continues to experience high levels of both political
 and criminal violence. For most of the past 35 years, the
 country has lived under a constitutionally authorized state of
 siege to deal with civil disturbances, insurgent movements
 and, most recently, organized crime. The state of siege was
 lifted in 1982 but reimposed following the assassination of
 the Minister of Justice on April 30, 1984 by narcotics
 traffickers.
 Colombia has a mixed economy, with expenditures of the
 central, departmental (state) and municipal governments
 accounting for about 35 percent of gross domestic product
 (GDP) in 1985. Private enterprise plays a substantial role in
 the economy: the coffee industry (which accounts for one-half
 of the country's exports) is in private hands. At the same
 time, state enterprises control the domestic participation in
 major industries such as oil, steel, and coal. The service
 sector accounts for half of GDP; agriculture and mining
 one-fourth; and manufacturing has grown to 22 percent of GDP.
 In his 1982 inaugural address, current President Belisario
 Betancur stated that he would give the highest priority to
 achieving sustained peace in Colombia. After the Congress
 passed an amnesty for guerrillas in 1982, the Government
 negotiated cease-fire agreements in 1984 with four of
 Colombia's five major insurgent groups: the Revolutionary
 Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC); the 19th of April Movement
 (M-19); the Popular Liberation Army (EPL); and the Workers'
 Self-Defense Movement (ADO). Two factions of a fifth group,
 the National Liberation Army (ELN), signed an accord later, on
 December 9, 1985. In these agreements the guerrillas
 generally pledged to cease hostilities for one year provided
 the Government followed suit and supported political and
 economic reforms aimed at "opening up Colombia's limited
 democratic system." The Government agreed to observe a
 one-year cease-fire; to submit political and economic reform
 measures to Congress for approval; and to establish three
 commissions to facilitate the peace process. The Government
 was also to seek legislation for a general pardon. At the end
 of the cease-fire, if all went well, both sides committed
 themselves to entering into an indefinite period of sustained
 peace.

 COLOMBIA
 However, in mid-1985, the M-19 and the EPL accused the
 Government of failing to abide by the accords and subsequently
 joined forces with other guerrilla factions to renew combat.
 Fighting between government forces and the M-19 reached
 pre-ceasefire levels in June, especially in the Department of
 Cauca; On November 6, the M-19 attacked and siezed control of
 the Palace of Justice, which housed the Supreme Court and the
 Council of State, in central Bogota. Government forces ended
 the attack the following day. Over 100 persons died,
 including all the attackers (estimated at 35) and 11 Justices
 of the Supreme Court. According to eyewitness accounts of
 surviving hostages, the attackers executed the President of
 the Supreme Court during the night of November 6-7.
 Meanwhile, in March 1985, the FARC established a political
 party known as the Patriotic Union (FARC-UP) and requested the
 reorganization of the three peace commissions and a nine-month
 extension of the cease-fire. In mid-October, the President
 named a new 20-member peace commission to assume the functions
 of the three former commissions, while he considers whether to
 extend the cease-fire.
 In spite of the Government's efforts to achieve sustained
 peace, political and criminal violence have continued.
 Legislation limiting the applicability of preventive detention
 to more serious criminal'offences was a significant
 development in the area of human rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 In this period of active insurgency, statistics on killings
 and disappearances are undependable and subject to differing
 interpretations. The Permanent Committee for the Defense of
 Human Rights has asserted that during the year ending July
 1985, 644 people were killed by the armed forces, police,
 secret agents, paramilitary groups, or unknown persons. The
 Committee also listed 292 death threats and 178 woundings by
 security forces and paramilitary organizations. The vast
 majority of these alleged incidents were reported to have
 taken place in rural areas, where the armed forces were
 fighting guerrilla groups. In such cases, persons wounded or
 killed may have been engaged in guerrilla or criminal
 activity. The Committee's data are based on press reports,
 personal testimony, and complaints filed by relatives and
 friends of alleged victims. The Committee seldom investigates
 incidents but turns over the information gathered to the
 Government's Prosecutor's office.
 Colombian armed forces statistics covering the period July 28,
 1984 through July 17, 1985 reported the deaths of 168
 policemen, 178 members of the armed forces, and 605
 guerrillas. During the same period, the armed forces reported
 that 272 civilians were assassinated by guerrillas for
 collaborating with military and/or police forces. A statement
 by the Director General of National Police published in the
 press on December 27 reported that 199 policemen had been
 killed and 480 wounded in the line of duty during 1985.
 In mid-December, Colombian authorities announced that they had
 discovered six common graves near Toribio containing over 100
 bodies, including women and children, many of whom had been
 
 
 466
 COLOMBIA
 tortured. Some of the victims were dressed in the uniform of
 the Ricardo Franco Front (RFF) of the FARC. The authorities
 continued to find new graves and bodies through the remainder
 of the month. In early January 1986, RFF leader Javier
 Delgado said that his group was responsible and had executed
 158 of its own members accused of being army spies. The M-19
 broke relations with the RFF over the incident and, according
 to press reports, the RFF relieved Delgado of his command and
 said he would be tried for "arbitrary detentions, torture, and
 homicide." On January 14, 1986 the president of Colombia's
 Permanent Committee for the Defense of Human Rights issued a
 statement condemning the killings, describing them as "one of
 the most horrifying criminal acts to have taken place in many
 years in Colombia."
 b. Disappearance
 In a report issued December 28, 1985, the Attorney General of
 Colombia said that 344 persons had disappeared during the
 first 11 months of the year, compared with 150 disappearances
 in 1984. Of those reported in 1985, 71 had been released
 safely, 67 had been found dead, and the remaining 206 were
 still missing. The report noted that 32 members of the police
 and armed forces had been subject to investigation or other
 legal proceedings in connection with these disappearances; it
 did not specify the nature or outcome of the investigation or
 legal actions. The Permanent Committee reported that 103
 people had disappeared or were kidnapped in the period
 January-July 1985. It attributed 36 of these incidents to
 military and police forces, 52 to paramilitary groups and the
 remaining 15 to persons unknown. The Colombian military
 intelligence organization (D-2) reported 165 kidnappings
 through the first nine months of 1985. It reported that of
 these, 41 victims had been freed, 18 had been killed, 13 had
 been rescued, and 93 were still being held. D-2 compared
 these figures with 299 kidnappings that it had reported for
 all of 1984.
 A Colombian press report published December 30 stated that 149
 kidnappings had taken place in 1985. The report attributed 42
 of the kidnappings to the FARC, 17 to the M-19, 3 to the EPL,
 and 87 to common criminals. A report prepared privately by a
 former military judge and published in the Colombian press
 January 3, 1986, stated that 216 kidnappings had taken place
 in 1985. The report did not attribute responsibility to any
 group or groups.
 Eight U.S. citizens were kidnapped in Colombia in 1985: one
 by persons claiming to be from the Revolutionary Workers'
 Party (PRT) on August 16, four by the FARC on October 5, and
 three by persons claiming to be members of the EPL on December
 10. One of those kidnapped by the FARC escaped from his
 captors two days later; the other three were released by the
 FARC on November 6. The individual kidnapped by the PRT was
 released December 22. One of those kidnapped on December 10
 was released the following day; the other two remained in
 captivity as the new year began, and there had been no
 information about their safety or well-being since their
 abduction.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment
 or Punishment
 In a report issued December 28, 1985, the Attorney General of
 Colombia reported that his office had investigated 242 cases
 of alleged torture of individuals by the police between 1983
 
 
 467
 COLOMBIA
 and October 1985. According to the report, in 12 cases the
 charges had been substantiated and police officers had been
 punished, in two cases the officers had been absolved, and in
 27 cases officers had been charged and the charges were under
 judicial review. The report stated that the remaining cases
 were still under investigation. The Permanent Committee for
 the Defense of Human Rights reported 297 cases of torture
 between August 1984 and August 1985. It attributed 173 cases
 to military and police forces, 77 to paramilitary
 organizations, and the remainder to persons unknown. It
 stated that most of the reported cases occurred in rural
 areas. In a judicial decision in June, the Third Panel of the
 Civil Wing of the Council of State ruled in favor of a doctor
 who claimed to have been tortured while detained by the armed
 forces as a suspected M-19 guerrilla in 1979 and 1980. Based
 on the Panel's ruling, the Council of State ordered the
 Government to indemnify the doctor and to investigate the
 conduct of government officials linked to the case, including
 the current Minister of Defense, who at the time was commander
 of the military installation where the doctor was detained.
 The Ministry of Defense has posted a bond in order to appeal
 the ruling of the Panel to the full Council of State. The
 case will now be reviewed by all 16 judges constituting the
 Council; of them, the four judges of the Third Panel will have
 a voice but no vote in the final ruling.
 Colombian prisons are notoriously overcrowded and understaffed
 due to the practice of preventive detention and inadequate
 budgets. In most prisons, inmates receive a subsistence diet
 which they must supplement with purchases from prison stores.
 Prisoners with financial resources live better than those
 without. Family members and friends are allowed to visit
 regularly and to bring food and clothes. Consular officers
 are given regular access to foreign prisoners. Most prisoners
 accused of crimes in connection with guerrilla activites are
 incarcerated in regular prisons, although segregated from
 common criminals.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution provides for habeas corpus procedures, and
 the law requires that individuals be brought to court within
 72 hours of arrest in most cases. These requirements are for
 the most part respected in practice. Persons detained for
 disturbance of public order can be held up to 10 days before
 charges must be filed. There are no legal provisions for
 exile.
 Forced or compulsory labor is legally prohibited, and the
 prohibition is respected in practice.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The rights of public trial and due process are guaranteed to
 all by the Constitution, and a prisoner may be represented by
 an attorney of his choice. If he has none, the court will
 appoint one. Historically, however, an overburdened and
 underfunded judicial system and the widespread practice of
 preventive detention have meant that most prisoners
 incarcerated for common crimes never come to trial but are
 simply released after serving the minimum sentence applicable
 to their alleged crime. In September 1985, there were
 approximately 30,000 persons in prison, of whom 9,000 had been
 tried and found guilty.
 
 
 468
 COLOMBIA
 In 1985, the Congress passed two laws which are expected to
 have a positive effect on the human rights situation in
 judicial and penal areas. The first authorizes the Ministry
 of Justice to hire up to 200 special judges to try cases of
 extortion, kidnapping and terrorism. To reduce the backlog of
 cases, the law expands the authority of police inspectors to
 try less serious crimes. A second law, which entered into
 force on July 8 eliminates provisional arrest for defendants
 charged with misdemeanors; as of late September 1985,
 approximately 3,000 prisoners had been released under
 provisions of this law.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution requires a court order before authorities can
 enter a private home, except in the case of hot pursuit.
 While Colombian human rights organizations allege widespread
 violations in the more remote areas, the concept of the
 sanctity of the home and privacy is widely respected in most
 parts of the country. Persons from rural areas frequently
 claim that they have been forced to leave their farms by
 military counterinsurgency operations, guerrilla
 conscription/confiscation, and paramilitary thugs hired by
 local landowners.
 Section 2 Respect.for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 These constitutionally guaranteed rights are as a rule
 respected, and the press often vigorously criticizes the
 Government and its leaders. The privately owned print media
 are under no government restraints and publish a wide variety
 of political views. Television channels are controlled by the
 state, which leases time to private companies. The Government
 does not permit private news programs to broadcast interviews
 which last longer than ten minutes; during political
 campaigns, news programs cannot broadcast the voice of a
 candidate whose campaign rally is being filmed. There is no
 such restriction on talk shows. A section of a bill on
 electoral reform before the Congress, under consideration for
 about a year, calls for guaranteed access to the electronic
 media for all political parties.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public meetings and demonstrations are normally held without
 interference. Under the state of siege, prior permission is
 required for demonstrations and is usually granted, except
 when there is a clear and present danger to public order. As
 an example of the latter restriction, President Betancur
 declared the communist-promoted general strike of June 20
 illegal on the grounds that terrorists planned to take
 advantage of the strike to disrupt.,public services and attack
 public institutions. When the Communists went forward with
 the-strike, the Government suspended their legal status and
 froze the funds of six participating labor federations for six
 months.
 Colombian workers enjoy very strong legal protections,
 including the right to organize and, in the private sector, to
 bargain collectively and strike. Use of strikebreakers is
 prohibited, and heavy severance benefits are intended to
 discourage management from firing union militants. However,
 benefits in practice are much more limited. Many provisions
 
 
 469
 COLOMBIA
 of the law are scarcely enforced and are effectively ignored
 by small and medium-sized enterprises. Amidst conditions of
 severe labor surplus, labor has limited bargaining power and
 has been unsuccessful in organizing beyond the ranks of the
 largest employers and the public services.
 Only about eight percent of Colombia's economically active
 population is unionized, according to the latest government
 census of trade unions. The total of 880,000 union members is
 divided almost equally between the traditional "confederated"
 labor sector and the leftist/independent sector. Of the four
 confederations, two are affiliated with the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions, one with the World
 Federation of Trade Unions, and one with the World
 Confederation of Labor.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of religion. Although an
 overwhelming majority of Colombians are Roman Catholics, no
 constitutional discrimination exists against any religious
 group. In practice, however, non-Catholic and/or evangelical
 Christian groups operating in Colombia have found it
 increasingly difficult during the past year to obtain entry
 and resident visas for additional, or even replacement mission
 workers. According to official statistics, 217 different
 religious sects are registered in Colombia.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Colombians are free to leave the country without unusual
 restriction. In areas under government control where
 operations against rural guerrilla groups are underway,
 travelling civilians require "safe conduct" passes; guerrillas
 reportedly use a similar means to restrict travel in areas
 where they are active.
 Colombians who have sought and have been granted "diplomatic
 asylum" in foreign embassies have always been allowed to
 depart. Expatriates can, by law, repatriate. Colombia in the
 past has accepted refugees; however, because of high
 unemployment and underemployment, the Government is
 increasingly reluctant to accept displaced persons.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of
 Citizens to Change Their Government
 Colombia has a two-party democratic system of government, and
 elections are conducted fairly and openly. Persons are
 enfranchised by the constitution at age 18. Those convicted
 of certain crimes may be disenfranchised. Public employees
 are forbidden by law to participate in political campaigns
 but, with the exception of military personnel, can vote.
 Colombian politics are dominated by two major parties, the
 Liberal and the Conservative, and each includes elements with
 widely divergent political views. All parties are free to
 raise funds, field candidates, hold public meetings, have
 access to the media, and publish their own newspapers. Almost
 seven million voters--approximately 60 percent of those
 eligible--turned out for the May 30, 1982, presidential
 election, the greatest participation in recent history. Many
 went to the polls despite guerrilla threats to punish those
 who did so. Elections are scheduled twice in 1986; in March
 to elect a new Congress, and in May to elect a new president.
 
 
 470
 COLOMBIA
 President Betancur's program to reach a permanent peace
 settlement with guerrilla groups has several important
 electoral implications: first, two of the political reforms
 promoted by the guerrillas and subsequently submitted by the
 Administration to Congress for approval concern the popular
 election of mayors and general electoral reform. Legislation
 providing for direct election of mayors beginning in March
 1988 passed Congress and was signed into law by President
 Betancur January 1, 1986. Second, the participation of the
 Patriotic Union, or FARC-UP, in the 1986 elections has
 generated a heated controversy over the possibility of "armed
 proselytizing" by the FARC-UP in rural areas. The FARC-UP
 presidential candidate withdrew from the race in January 1986,
 citing safety concerns. The party plans to name an alternate
 candidate. The Administration has announced the establishment
 of an electoral commission to oversee and guarantee free and
 fair elections in 1986.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Colombia has actively participated in international and
 regional human rights bodies, is currently a member of the UN
 Human Rights Commission, and has welcomed nongovernmental
 human rights organizations.
 In September 1985, the Colombian press published the text of
 Amnesty International's report on the status of Colombian
 human rights in 1984. The report expressed concern over
 extrajudicial executions and systematic torture carried out
 "as a matter of policy" by some army and police entities, as
 well as cases of execution-style killings of kidnap victims
 held captive by guerrilla organizations. Amnesty
 International also noted that there were substantially fewer
 reports of such abuses than in previous years and welcomed
 measures by the Attorney General and civilian courts to
 investigate and prosecute military and police officials
 alleged to be responsible for serious abuses of authority.
 Partially in response to Amnesty International's report, the
 Attorney General's office established a new human rights
 advisory commission to investigate alleged violations and
 propose corrective measures. The new commission will be
 headed by the Deputy Attorney General and will include
 representatives of the military, the police, the Permanent
 Committee for the Defense of Human Rights, and the Association
 of Families of Disappeared Persons.
 The Permanent Committee for the Defense of Human Rights is the
 most active Colombian human rights organization. The
 Committee's 94 members include among others the current
 Justice Minister, members of the Congress, journalists, labor
 leaders, and persons in the arts, including Nobel laureate
 Gabriel Garcia Marquez. The Committee compiles statistics
 based on press stories and personal testimonies, which it
 turns over to the Government for investigation and, if
 necessary, prosecution. It has no staff or budget to be able
 to verify such reports by conducting independent inquiries.
 The Committee's statistics have been used extensively by
 international organizations soch as Amnesty International,
 Americas Watch, and the Washington Office on Latin America.
 The Permanent Committee also sponsors periodic human rights
 forums in Colombia.
 
 
 471
 COLOMBIA
 In early January 1986, the New York-based human rights group
 Americas Watch published a report saying that Colombia's armed
 forces were responsible for summary executions, torture, and
 "disappearances" in actions against leftist guerrillas. The
 report also attributed kidnappings and killings of civilian
 noncombatants to leftist guerrillas. "As conflicts have
 increased between the guerrillas and the military, human
 rights violations have accelerated dramatically," the report
 said.
 Freedom House has classified Colombia as "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 According to nearly completereturns from an October 1985
 census, Colombia's population is 27,000,000. It grew at a
 rate of 2.0 percent in 1985. The per capita GNP was $1,430 in
 1983.
 The period of slower economic growth which began in 1980 has
 continued. While the real Gross Domestic Product showed an
 increase of three percent in 1984, for 1985 it is expected to
 be between two and three percent. Inflation, which declined
 from 24.5 percent in 1982 to 16.2 percent in 1984, rose again
 to 22.25 percent in 1985. Government data shows unemployment
 increased to 14.7 percent in July 1985, with underemployment
 estimated at 14 to 16 percent. According to Colombian labor
 experts, however, official labor statistics do not take into
 account an estimated 2.5 million children under 15 who work
 for low pay under poor conditions and with little protection
 from the Colombian Labor Code. Although increases in minimum
 wages have more than kept pace with increases in the cost of
 living in past years, a large percentage of workers do not
 earn the minimum wage. The Government's economic adjustment
 program called for a maximum 10 percent increase in wages in
 1985 and for a wage increase somewhere between 10 percent and
 the increase in the prevailing cost of living in 1986.
 There is inequality in the distribution of the nation's income
 and wealth, with the wealthiest 10 percent of the population
 receiving 40 percent of the national income and the poorest 20
 percent only 5 percent (1983 World Bank figures). Similarly,
 land tenure is severely skewed: the top 10 percent of
 landowners hold 80 percent of the land, while the bottom 10
 percent own 0.2 percent. Significant regional inequalities
 also exist, with the best economic opportunities, health care
 facilities, and education available in the largest cities.
 This has contributed to heavy, though decreasing, migration
 from the countryside to urban areas. A notable exception to
 the general pattern of income distribution is in Colombia's
 important coffee-growing regions, where farms have
 traditionally been small-to-medium-sized. More recently, some
 small farms in the higher altitude areas of Bogota and
 Medellin have been able to take advantage of the increasing
 export demand for fresh-cut flowers.
 Some 20,000 people died in mud slides resulting from the
 eruption of the Nevado del Ruiz volcano on November 13.
 President Betancur signed a decree authorizing a 35-day state
 of economic emergency on November 24 in order to create a
 special fund for reconstruction of the affected areas. The
 decree authorized the fund to receive donations from foreign
 and domestic donors and the imposition of additional taxes to
 raise revenues for this purpose. No new taxes have been
 levied.
 
 
 472
 COLOMBIA
 The Betancur Administration promised to provide 400,000
 low-cost housing units between 1983 and 1985 and to
 concentrate on rural adult literacy and vocational training.
 Indeed, the 1986 proposed budget for the social sector
 ministries (Labor, Government, Health, and Education)
 accounted for approximately 23.2 percent of total
 expenditures. There is a severe shortage of teachers in rural
 areas. Primary school enrollment nationwide has increased,
 and the adjusted enrollment ratio in 1982 was 102 percent.
 The adult literacy rate was estimated at 85 percent in 1981.
 Colombia's infant mortality rate was 62 per 1,000 live births
 in 1985. While the ratio of caloric supply available for
 consumption relative to nutritional requirements in 1977 was
 104 percent, per capita consumption of important commodities
 such as meat, eggs, and milk declined between 1948 and 1978,
 and malnutrition is a leading cause of death among children
 under five years of age. According to World Bank statistics,
 92 percent of the population in 1980 had access to safe water.
 The law prohibits the employment of children in most jobs
 before the age of 14, particularly where such employment might
 interfere with schooling. These provisions are respected in
 the larger enterprises and larger cities. However, an
 unofficial sector exists in the economy which includes very
 small businesses, workers employed by relatives, self-employed
 workers, and street sellers. This sector is effectively
 outside government control, and many children are exploited in
 it.
 The Labor Code regulates the hours of labor and other work
 conditions. The eight-hour day is standard in larger
 companies, but the work week generally exceeds 40 hours; a
 standard week of five eight-hour days remains an important
 long-term goal of Colombian trade unions. A national minimum
 wage is set at least annually by the Government, and serves as
 an important benchmark for wage bargaining, although a large
 percentage of workers do not earn the minimum wage.
 Occupational safety and health is extensively regulated,
 including use of protective clothing and ventilation, first
 aid and firefighting equipment at the job site, sanitary
 facilities and potable water for workers, and compensation if
 injured. These regulations apply to the larger agricultural
 enterprises as well as industry and mining. However,
 exemptions for small companies, the frequent use of workers as
 "subcontractors" rather than employees, and a general
 difficulty in enforcement cause very large numbers of workers
 to fall outside the protection of the law. The Government is
 endeavoring to improve regulatory enforcement, and improved
 work conditions are a priority goal of the trade unions.
 Women have equal civil and property rights by law. Their
 economic situation, though improving, is inferior, especially
 in rural areas; they comprise just over 25 percent of the
 country's economically active population, but are concentrated
 in low-productivity, low-income sectors. Historically, the
 unemployment rate for women has been higher than for men, but
 this difference has decreased in recent years. Although women
 are legally entitled to pay equal to that of their male
 counterparts and are normally paid equal salaries when
 employed by the Government, this is not generally the case in
 private industry.
 As more Colombian women graduate from universities and
 participate in the work force, they are increasingly active at
 
 
 473
 COLOMBIA
 all levels of society. A growing number are receiving higher
 education; they currently comprise 40 percent of the
 university population. They serve as legislators, judges,
 governors of departments (states), political party leaders,
 government officials and diplomats. One indicator of the
 growing role of Colombian women in urban society is the
 unprecedented number of high-level women appointees in the
 Betancur Administration. A woman is running as the candidate
 of a minor party in the 1986 Presidential elections.
 Colombian Indians legally enjoy all rights and privileges of
 full citizenship, but some claim to be suffering a wide
 variety of abuses and are now seeking to promote local
 improvements through community action, public education, and
 legal aid. Their most common complaint is that large
 landowners have hired paramilitary thugs to force them off
 contested lands and, when they retaliate, that the landowners
 call on local police and military forces for protection. One
 Indian group has organized a guerrilla band, the Quintin Lame
 which has reportedly allied itself with the M-19 guerrilla
 group in some recent confrontations with the armed forces.
 The upsurge of land invasions beginning around mid-1984 has
 continued unabated into 1985. Some landowners attribute this
 to leftist political activists, others consider it a natural
 result of the current politicking over land reform. Whatever
 the cause, the trend toward increased invasions continues to
 generate concern in both government and land-owning circles.
