 COMOROS
 The Comoros unilaterally declared its independence from France
 in 1975. The first president, Ahmed Abdallah Abderemane, was
 overthrown almost immediately but regained power in 1978 when
 mercenaries ousted the increasingly-repressive and xenophobic
 socialist" regime of Ali Soilih. Abdallah was reelected in
 1984, in an-election boycotted by the opposition. In recent
 years, including 1985, constitutional amendments have
 strengthened the President's position, notably by giving him
 the right to appoint the governors and by establishing a
 single legal political instrument, the United Progress Party.
 A March coup attempt by some two dozen Comoran soldiers
 resulted in their arrest and that of a number of civilians
 identified with the communist-dominated Democratic Front.
 Comoran security forces consist of the Presidential Guard, the
 strongest military unit in the country, the Gendarmerie, and
 the Army. The Presidential Guard is led and trained by a
 .mercenary force, which, in the aftermath of the March coup
 plot, is being.expanded. French technical assistance is
 provided to the small Comoran Army and the Gendarmerie.
 Agriculture dominates economic activity, but with a population
 of 450,000, likely to double by the year 2000, the Comoros are
 fully utilizing their arable land.  Farming on small
 landholdings, subsistence fishing, and petty commerce provide
 a livelihood for most of the population. Revenues from the
 export of copra, vanilla, essence of ylang-ylang, and cloves
 offset only a part of the cost of necessary imports. There
 are few industries, inadequate port facilities, and limited
 highway and communications infrastructure. The Comoros are
 part of the Francophone Africa Monetary Zone. Government
 expenses far exceed revenues, and the country depends heavily
 on France for budgetary support and technical assistance.
 The human rights situation in the Comoros in 1985 was affected
 by the March coup attempt and other alleged plots against the
 Government. The authorities reportedly subjected many of the
 200 persons arrested in March to cruel treatment, including
 beatings, and kept 80 alleged participants in isolation for
 long periods before trial. At the same time, the trial
 process, while criticized as too extended, seemed generally
 fair to outside observers and ended with the conviction of 77
 persons (18 of whom were pardoned in December, 1985).
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From
 a. Political Killing
 There were no confirmed reports of political killings in
 1985. However, there were allegations that as many as four
 individuals, accused of complicity in the March coup plot, may
 have died during initial interrogation by the security forces.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance in 1985.

 COMOROS
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment
 or Punishment
 The March 1985 attempt to assassinate the mercenary officers
 in the Presidential Guard, as well as certain senior members
 of the Abdallah regime, led to the arrest of about 200
 military and civilian personnel and to the extended detention
 of about 80 persons. Unconfirmed but credible reports
 indicated that members of the "Democratic Front" were
 initially subjected to degrading treatment, including beatings
 and electric shocks, to extract information implicating other
 alleged party members in the coup attempt.
 Except for the treatment given the alleged coup conspirators,
 penal discipline is generally lax; prisoners are usually
 released daily for prayers, and work and families provide
 their meals.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There is no concept of habeas corpus in the Comoros. However,
 detainees do have the right to a judicial hearing on the
 legality of their detention. The 80 persons held without bail
 for 8 months were confined in isolation to a military camp
 under rudimentary conditions awaiting trial in November.
 About 200 persons in total were arrested following the March
 coup plot, but most were subsequently released. In addition,
 there were several others detained during 1985 and charged
 with plotting the armed overthrow of the Government, including
 the arrest of some 20 persons, mostly military, in November
 and December. However, except for these 20 persons, all were
 subsequently released without trial. Eight individuals
 associated with the Ali Soilih regime, who had been convicted
 in 1980, were pardoned in 1985.
 There is no evidence of forced or compulsory labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The 1978 Constitution provides for the equality of all
 citizens before the law and the right of all accused to a
 defense counsel. The judiciary is independent and trials are
 public. The Comoran legal system mixes Islamic law with an
 inherited French legal code. A new consolidated code is
 slowly being drafted. Most disputes are settled by village
 elders or by a civil court of first instance.
 President Abdallah ordered the establishment of a special
 court of appointed members to try the alleged coup
 conspirators, based on a 1960 decree as amended in October
 1985. Human rights observers protested the lengthy procedural
 delays but were impressed by the tenor of the trial process
 itself, which ended in November with the conviction of 77 of
 the 78 defendents. Sentences ranged from 10 months to life
 imprisonment. President Abdallah subsequently pardoned 18 of
 the 77 convicted.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for the inviolability of home and
 property and this is respected in practice.
 
 
 COMOROS
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Constitution guarantees freedom of expression,
 thought, and conscience, the only local news medium is the
 government-controlled radio station, which is self-censoring
 and features progovernment coverage of domestic events. No
 independent local news publications exist. In 1985,
 clandestine tracts critical of the regime increased in number
 and sharpened their attacks and prompted several arrests and
 the confiscation of printing equipment. A monthly newspaper
 begun in 1985 features government views on local
 developments. Foreign journals and newspapers are available,
 as are books from abroad. Comorans discuss and criticize
 their government and its leading personalities in private.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution states that freedom of association and
 freedom to form unions are guaranteed, as well as the right to
 strike. In practice these rights are partially
 circumscribed. Since 1982, the only legal political activity
 is that which takes place under the auspices of the United
 Progress Party, although in practice social conventions such
 as the traditional lavish, extended Comoran weddings serve as
 vehicles for intense political activity. Anniversaries of the
 death of former political figures and funerals of prominent
 Comorans also sometimes carry overt political overtones. A
 September commemoration of the 1975 death of one of President
 Abdallah's political opponents attracted a large attendance.
 Although the right to strike is guaranteed and trade unions
 are legal, the wage labor force is small and no trade unions
 exist. The increasing scarcity of jgbs is also a restraint on
 labor complaints, and the Government's inability to pay wages
 and salaries on schedule sometimes results in work slowdowns,
 increased absenteeism, and informal peaceful protests to
 Comoran authorities.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 An overwhelming majority of the population is Muslim. The
 Constitution holds Islam to be the "wellspring of the
 principles and rules which guide the state and its
 institutions." However, the Government upholds non-Muslims'
 right to practice their faith. There are churches for the
 diminutive Protestant and Catholic populations. Christian
 missionaries work in local hospitals and schools, but they are
 not allowed to proselytize.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Movement in and out of and within the Comoros for citizens and
 foreigners is not restricted. A Comoran community abroad,
 concentrated in France, opposes-the Government, but in 1985
 there was no evidence that those returning to the Comoros were
 subjected to government reprisals.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 A 28-month long xenophobic and increasingly irrational regime
 between 1975 and 1978 saw the destruction of all the country's
 
 
 COMOROS
 civil records, intermittent persecution of traditionally
 prominent families, and a violent assault on closely held
 traditional values. That experience caused many Comorans to
 fear radical change. The restoration in 1978 of President
 Abdallah, who represents a combination of traditional power
 broker politics and a commitment to moderately paced change,
 ended that phase.
 Standing unopposed when the opposition boycotted the election,
 President Abdallah was overwhelmingly reelected with 99
 percent of the vote in September 1984. A French-based
 opponent was reportedly denied listing on the ballot on
 technical grounds. The vote total may have been partially
 inflated by questionable electoral practices. In 1985,
 Abdallah faced growing opposition exemplified by the March
 coup attempt. Many of the leaders of the illegal Democratic
 Alliance, the major opposition political force to Abdallah,
 remain in detention. Abdallah has had to rely heavily on
 mercenary support and the personal loyalty of the Presidential
 Guard. His position is buttressed both by tradition and by
 his own personal wealth.
 Abdallah consolidated ministerial portfolios into four "super
 Ministries" in January 1985 and in September replaced the
 leading "notables" in the Cabinet with "technicians," citing
 the notables' "disloyalty" as reason for the change. Those
 who were replaced have subsequently undertaken a
 'constitutional" effort to depose Abdallah. The 38-member
 Comoran National Assembly supported the President's various
 initiatives throughout 1985.
 The Comoros historically represent the southernmost extension
 of Arab influence on the Indian Ocean littoral. The
 constitutional deference to Islam formalizes the deeply held
 commitment of most Comorans to an Islamic world view. The
 Comoros Government claims the island of Mayotte as part of the
 country. A referendum on the status of Mayotte, scheduled for
 1984, was postponed by the French Government. No new date has
 been set. In 1977, 96 percent of the voters in Mayotte opted
 in favor of retaining ties to France. The Comoran Government
 has alleged electoral coercion of Mayotte and has pressed
 France to acknowledge Comoran sovereignty without a plebiscite.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International
 and Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 The March coup prompted a visit by several international human
 rights groups who were critical of the extended detention of
 alleged coup plotters without legal action. However, they
 generally considered the trial process to have been fairly
 conducted. Their attempts to verify reports of beatings of
 alleged coup plotters were circumscribed by the Government.
 Amnesty International did not include the Comoros in its 1985
 Report (covering 1984). Freedom House rated the Comoros
 "partly free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Economic prospects for the Comoros remain dim. The population
 of 450,000 is growing at rate of 2.9 percent per year. All
 arable land is already under cultivation; erosion and
 deforestation have reached devastating proportions. There are
 no evident prospects for industrialization. Markets for the
 
 
 80
 COMOROS
 Comoros' tropical cash crops are fragile and dwindling. The
 per capita GNP of $339 (1982) may decrease further as exports
 decline and the population grows.
 Thus far,. an abundance of tropical fruits and fish has kept
 serious malnutrition at bay. In 1977, calorie levels met 89
 percent of minimum needs, but child malnutrition is growing.
 Major food commodities such as rice must be imported. The
 need for long-term international help in the form of food aid
 and technical assistance for crop diversification appears
 unavoidable. Combined with rising unemployment for Comoran
 youth and very limited prospects for growth in the industrial
 or service sectors, the Comoros faces intensifying
 unemployment and continued severe fiscal and balance of
 payments crises. A steadily deteriorating health situation,
 aggravated by endemic malaria, exacerbates Comorans'
 difficulties.
 Young children are employed in household chores but not in the
 public or commercial sectors; the absence of a minimum age law
 for employment does not in practice encourage child labor
 abuse because jobs for adolescents and young adults are scarce
 and wages for workers of all ages are very low. There is
 little industrialization or factory activity. There are
 regulations on occupational safety and health, but in the
 absence of any significant industrial sector they are not
 being enforced. There is a minimum wage for government
 employees. Hours of work in any category rarely exceed 35
 hours per week.
 Within Comoran society, men have the dominant role. The
 .society respects authority based on inheritance, age, and
 wealth or religious leadership. At traditional ceremonies and
 social gatherings, the sexes are separated. However, women
 are neither veiled nor limited to minor civil service jobs.
 The Constitution guarantees the equality of citizens
 regardless of race, sex, or religion. Suffrage is universal,
 although the opinions of husbands and fathers exercise a
 formidable influence over women's voting habits. Women have
 the right to participate in the political process, but
 traditioii has thus far discouraged the exercise of that right.
