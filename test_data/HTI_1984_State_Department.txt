 HAITI
 Haiti has had a turbulent history characterized by alternating
 periods of authoritarian rule and political instability.
 Haiti's current ruler, Jean-Claude Duvalier, is the ninth
 president-for-life in Haitian history. The current president
 has eliminated such conspicuous violence as the killings and
 disappearances that marked the rule of his father, Francois
 Duvalier (1957-71). Although Haiti has made slow and
 inconsistent progress under Jean-Claude Duvalier toward
 greater respect for human rights, significant human rights
 abuses continue. Constitutionally guaranteed freedoms, such
 as freedom of speech, press, and association, are in practice
 effectively restricted by other legislation and laws. Due
 process guarantees relating to judicial procedures are often
 not respected.
 Haiti remains the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere.
 Though the Government has instituted tax and budgetary
 reforms, Haiti's economic problems remain serious. The
 Government has actively sought foreign assistance from Western
 government and private organizations, and has succeeded in
 bringing more foreign economic assistance to Haiti.
 Constitutionally, Haiti is a republic with executive authority
 vested in the President. The legislature is unicameral, with
 members elected for six-year terms. Although the judicial
 system is independent of the executive branch in theory, this
 is not the case in reality. In practice, all government
 powers are concentrated in the presidency. Article 136 of the
 1983 Constitution names the President 'guarantor of the
 independence of the judicial power.* He also has the power to
 dissolve the legislature, and during the nine months when the
 legislature is not in session he rules by decree. Haiti's
 small regular military force and its militia - the Volunteers
 for National Security - play little or no direct role in the
 decision-making process.
 In 1984, the Government made human rights progress in some
 areas but there were setbacks as well. In February,
 legislative elections were held. The elections attracted a
 record number of candidates, and two thirds of all incumbents
 were defeated. In some areas these were the freest elections
 to take place under the Duvaliers, but there were also abuses
 and interference by the Government. Some well-known
 opposition candidates were not allowed to participate, and in
 some localities the Government resorted to fraud or violence
 to ensure that government candidates won. In March, President
 Duvalier wrote public letters to the heads of the police,
 militia, armed forces, and the Ministers of Justice and the
 Interior calling on them to respect the law and human rights.
 These letters began a three-month period during which an
 atmosphere of liberalization existed. In late May, partly
 caused by economic conditions but also affected by the
 President's letters, riots broke out in a number of northern
 provincial towns. On June 18 the Government detained three
 prominent journalists for periods of up to 48 hours, one of
 whom was beaten in the presence of a Minister of State. Two
 of the three independent weekly publications ceased
 publication in June; one of these resumed publishing in
 August. On July 4, police detained Haiti's UNESCO
 Representative, Hubert De Ronceray, and attempted to detain
 oppositionist Sylvio Claude. De Ronceray and oppositionist
 Gregoire Eugene were placed under house arrest in July, but
 this was lifted in late September. Claude remained in hiding,
 
 
 569
 HAITI
 even though the Government had given assurances to foreign
 diplomats that he was free to return home. In September the
 Government brought to trial five persons who had been accused
 of participating in bombings in early 1983 and who had been
 held more than a year without charges. They were found guilty
 and sentenced to life imprisonment. One other detainee was
 released.
 In early 1984 the hopes and expectations of many were raised
 by President Duvalier's March letters, a degree of greater
 press freedom, and other actions by the Government. The
 June-July crackdown then proved to be a setback. Late in
 1984, however, the Government took some steps which began to
 recapture the February-May movement toward democratization.
 Nevertheless, the events of June 18 served as a vivid reminder
 that, at best, only a beginning has been made toward
 democratization in Haiti.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of politically-motivated killings by the
 Government or opposition in 1984. Three persons died in late
 May when security forces opened fire to suppress riots in the
 northern city of Cap Haitian, but most objective observers
 believed that government forces had handled the incident with
 relative restraint.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no confirmed disappearances in 1984. Some reports
 of "disappearances" were received, but in all cases the person
 in question was ultimately accounted for.
 c. Torture, and Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 In one case of torture, Pierre Robert Auguste, a journalist
 for an independent weekly, was detained by police June 18.
 During his questioning and in the presence of high ranking
 government officials, he was beaten with a wooden rod and one
 finger was broken. In July, Jocelyne Claude, daughter of
 oppositionist Sylvio Claude, was beaten about the head and
 body at her home by police attempting to locate her father.
 The practice of beatings, however, is not believed to be
 widespread. Most released prisoners report no abuse;
 international observers who visited Haitian prisons and
 detention centers in 1984 reported that those with whom they
 spoke indicated no physical mistreatment.
 Prisoners and detainees are normally permitted to receive
 visitors, food, and medical treatment. However, particularly
 in the early stages of an arrest, or when prisoners are taken
 to the Casernes Dessalines barracks, prisoners are often kept
 in degrading circumstances, such as stripped to their
 underwear in crowded and unsanitary conditions. Visitors are
 often not allowed into the Casernes and fpod is not always
 provided. Dr. Hubert De Ronceray, detained from July,4-6
 was kept stripped in a small ceil'with no toilet facilities
 other than a small bucket. In the provinces,'abusive
 
 
 570
 HAITI
 treatment by local authorities is not uncommon. In February,
 in the town of Berrettes, a loan collector was allegedly
 beaten by a local official after objecting to the official's
 misappropriation of a loan payment. In Gonaives in May, one
 woman reportedly was beaten by the police authorities when she
 refused to be taken in for questioning. This beating was a
 contributing factor to the riots in that northern city.
 President Duvalier's March letters called on government
 officials not to engage in abusive practices. The Government.
 also increased the budget for the Ministry of Justice in 1985
 and is attempting to make all officials aware of their
 responsibilities under the law.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under the Haitian legal system, arrests must be based on a
 charge of violation of a law. A warrant is legally, though
 not in practice, necessary for arrest. Once a person has been
 taken into custody, the arresting authority is required by law
 to obtain a ruling on the validity of the arrest from a judge
 within 48 hours. Although this procedure is open to
 considerable abuse, there are indications that the Government
 has begun to adhere to it, at least in non-security, non-
 political cases.
 Preventive detention is practiced most noticeably in cases
 related to political opposition acitivites and state security
 matters. In 1984 the Government detained a number of people
 for questioning about their political activities. Serge
 Beaulieu, the only independent candidate in the legislative
 elections, was detained in March. Three prominent journalists
 were detained on June 18, and some of their associates a few
 days later. In July, Hubert De Ronceray, a former minister
 and prominent social scientist was questioned.
 All of the above were released within the 48 hour limit.
 However, persons detained for security or political reasons
 are often held incommunicado for indefinite periods. Five
 persons, all associates of Hubert De Ronceray, were picked up
 by security forces July 1 and not released until early
 October. Five associates of Sylvio Claude were arrested in
 late 1983 and have not yet'been tried or released. There are
 others in the same situation; the total number of persons
 detained in Haiti without charge is not known. The Government
 released nine persons regarded as detainees in 1984.
 Haitian law requires that charges against arrested persons be
 filed at least two weeks before a trial. In practice, this is
 often not the case. The law allows legal counsel for
 defendants. However, a client is sometimes not allowed to
 meet with counsel until immediately before the trial. There
 is no system of bail, though 'provisional liberty' can be
 obtained in some cases. Expulsion of persons who pose a
 political challenge or security threat to the regime has been
 used frequently in the past. However, there are no reports of
 any expulsions in 1984. Gregoire Eugene, who was expelled
 along with other journalists and labor leaders in November
 1980, was permitted to return to Haiti in February 1984.
 e. Denial of Fair Public*Trial
 Legally the Haitian judiciary is a separate institution. In
 practice, however, it does not operate independently of the
 
 
 571
 HAITI
 executive branch. The accused are permitted counsel and to
 know the charges against them. Both juries and judicial
 tribunals are permitted to hear cases, render decisions, and
 impose sentences. Defendants have the right to appeal their
 conviction, which must be done within three days.
 In September 1984 five persons who had been held without
 charges for over a year were tried for involvement in a series
 of politically motivated bombings in 1982 and 1983. Another
 person arrested was released for lack of evidence, and two
 persons believed to be in the U.S., were tried in absentia.
 The defendants were informed of the charges against them only
 about one week prior to the trial. The trial itself, which
 was public, lasted about 14 hours and was in accordance with
 Haitian legal procedure. Defense lawyers were permitted to
 call witnesses and generally mounted a strong defense. The
 defendants were able to testify on their own behalf. They
 claimed to be involved in smuggling narcotics, rather than
 attempting to overthrow the Government. All five were found
 guilty of Oplotting against the security of the state' and
 were sentenced to life at hard labor. The defense has
 appealed.
 Persons detained for political or security reasons in Haiti
 are seldom charged or brought to trial; some have been held
 for years. There may be as many as forty or fifty persons in
 this category in Haitian jails, though the actual number is
 probably lower. Amnesty International had earlier identified
 21 political prisoners being held in Haiti. Some of them
 appear to have been released during 1984 and it is estimated
 that from eight to twenty-seven detainees are currently held
 because of political and/or security reasons.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Searches and monitoring of homes routinely take place without
 warrants or other judicial authorization. In late 1983 and
 early 1984 oppositionist Sylvio Claude was placed under house
 arrest. In July, Gregoire Eugene and Hubert De Ronceray were
 also placed under house arrest for about three months. This
 procedure is not legal under Haitian law except in times of
 national emergency. In July 1984, police entered Sylvio
 Claude's home without a warrant. Before leaving, they took
 Claude's printing press and copies of his magazine. A
 policeman struck Claude's daughter, Jocelyne, on the head with
 his gun.
 A national militia, the Volunteers for National Security
 (VSN), performs security functions and serves as an informer
 system reporting on political opposition and threats to the
 regime. These forces are often poorly disciplined and
 sometimes abuse their local position through intimidation and
 interference in police and judicial activities. In his March
 13 letter addressed to the militia, President Duvalier
 specifically called for an end to such practices, as well as
 to the abuse of power for extortive purposes. In October, the
 Government appointed a twelve-man commission--five of whom.
 were non-VSN military officers--to oversee the VSN.

 HAITI
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Article 40 of the Constitution of 1983 guarantees each citizen
 the right to express his thoughts in all matters and by every
 ineans at his power.' The press is actually governed by the
 1980 press code, which requires that all'publications be
 submitted for governmental review 72 hours prior to
 publication, that all journalists (including foreigners) be
 accredited by the Ministry of Information, and that no
 material critical of the Duvalier family be published. While
 the first two of these requirements are not always enforced,
 the spirit of the press code and governmental actions do serve
 to restrict freedom of the press.
 In 1984, two independent publications, often critical of the
 Government, appeared for the first time; the new weeklies,
 L'Information and Fraternite joined the long-established
 independent weekly Le Petit Samedi Soir, in introducing an
 independent tone and editorial line seldom seen in recent
 years. Articles discussing pluralism, political parties, and
 the activities of oppositionists proliferated. Sylvio
 Claude's La Conviction, previously a clandestine newsletter,
 also appeared on the streets a couple of times, although the
 Governmbnt moved on legal grounds to prevent its distribution
 in May. In addition, the Catholic station, Radio Soleil,
 continued its outspoken commentary, denouncing election
 irregularities in February and speaking out on human rights
 during the course of the year. From January to June there was
 some movement toward a freer press in Haiti. On June 18,
 however, Haiti's fledgling independent press received a severe
 blow when the Government detained the publishers of the three
 independent weeklies. Subsequently, Fraternite's Gregoire
 Eugene was placed under house arrest for three months.
 L'Information and Fraternite ceased publishing after the
 incident, though L'Information reappeared in August. Both
 L'Information and Le Petit Samedi Soir adopted a milder
 editorial tone after the incident, though by October they had
 begun to recover some of their prior outspokenness.
 Fraternite has not appeared since June, when it featured an
 article by Eugene criticizing the constitutional provision for
 a presidency for life. There are several pro-government
 newspapers in addition to the official daily. The Government
 also owns a radio station and a television station. There is
 one private television station, and a number of private radio
 stations operate throughout the country. These exercise
 self-censorship and refrain from criticizing the Government.
 Puolic criticism is allowed in discussions of the Haitian
 economy, international affairs, and Haitian history before
 1957. Too strident a criticism of the present Government, and
 criticism of the President or the First Lady, however, is not
 tolerated. In June, a deputy delivered a speech in the
 National Assembly attacking high level corruption in the
 Government. The Government reacted by organizing a petition
 to recall the deputy; the deputy has since refrained from
 criticizing the Government. After Fraternite's Gregoire
 Eugene was detained on June 18, he was removed from his
 position as professor of constitutional law at the National
 University. Hubert De Ronceray's Center for Investigation of
 Social Studies was forced to suspend its activities after De
 Ronceray was detained in July.
 
 
 573
 HAITI
 Although foreign publications and broadcasts are received in
 Haiti, most publications are reviewed by the Government upon
 arrival to determine whether there are any articles critical
 of it. If there are, the offending publication is usually
 confiscated. Publications openly critical of the Government,
 such as those published by exile groups in the U.S., are not
 permitted to circulate in Haiti.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution grants Haitians the right to assemble
 peaceably and the right to form unions, political parties, and
 cooperatives. Haitian law requires that any public assembly
 of more than 20 persons have police authorization and that all
 formal organizations have governmental sanction. Professional,
 cultural, religious, trade, and similar non-political
 organizations operate freely in Haiti, and such organizations
 are free to maintain ties with related groups outside of
 Haiti. However, and in spite of the constitutional quarantees
 of the right to form political parties, the Government
 continues to ban activities by parties pending the passage of
 legislation to regulate the operation of political parties.
 The Government took a number of important steps in 1984 to
 improve the situation of labor in Haiti. A federation of
 union workers of Haiti was founded January 12, 1984, with nine
 active unions in Port-au-Prince as charter members. The
 Federation, which represents 2500 workers, has assumed the
 leading role in union activity in Haiti. Under the
 sponsorship of the Federation, representatives from its nine
 affiliates develop joint resolutions to union problems and
 coordinate assistance to workers throughout Haiti who request
 aid in forming new unions. The Federation has invited
 representatives from the AFL-CIO and the Inter-American
 Regional Organization of Workers to visit Haiti in the near
 future. The Government has publicly stated it does not objdct
 to international labor organizations visiting Haiti.
 In March, the Government revised the labor code by making it
 easier for employees to form unions, protecting the right of
 Haitians who work abroad, and revising provisions on forced
 labor to comply with International Labor Organization
 conventions on forced labor. In May, Federation and union
 officials met with members of the ILO delegation and discussed
 the possibilities of international assistance. In June, for
 the first time in many years, the President of the Federation
 traveled to the ILO conference in Geneva as the labor union
 representative on the official Haitian delegation.
 While limitations on labor activity continue to exist, such as
 de facto restrictions on the right to strike, the creation of
 a federation, the revised labor code, and other measures
 undertaken by the Government in 1984 ,have provided for an
 expansion of the role of labor in Haitian society.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Roman Catholicism is the official religion of Haiti. Voodoo,
 a religion combining Christian and African animist elements,
 is also practiced by a majority of the population. Other
 religions are freely practiced; proselytizing, conversion,
 missionary activity, foreign ties, building of churches, and
 religious education and publishing all take place without
 government interference. In addition to the Protestant sects
 
 
 574
 HAITI
 which are active throughout the country, non-Christian faiths,
 such as the Bahai and Judaism, are practiced in Haiti. There
 is no religious persecution or discrimination.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 The Government does not generally restrict travel within Haiti
 for ordinary citizens or foreigners. A network of police
 checkpoints does exist throughout the country, and foreigners.
 and inter-city transport vehicles are required to register
 before entering some towns. Persons are free to change their
 residence or place of work as they wish. In 1984 some critics
 of the Government were restricted in their movements within
 Haiti. Both Gregoire Eugene and Hubert De Ronceray were told
 after their house arrest was lifted they would have to seek
 police permission if they wished to leave the Port-au-Prince
 area. Foreign travel and the right to emigrate are
 unrestricted. Emigrants are free to return to Haiti, and many
 do so. Haitian exit and entry visa and passport regulations
 and fees do not generally impose an undue hardship on persons
 desiring to travel. Immigration officials at the
 international airport do maintain a list persons who may not
 enter or exit the country because of criminal, security, or
 political reasons. For the most part, political expellees in
 recent years have not been allowed to return to Haiti,
 although Gregoire Eugene was permitted to return in February
 after three years in exile.
 Illegal emigration from Haiti continued to increase in 1984.
 In accordance with the U.S.-Haitian bilateral agreement on
 migrant interdiction, 2,501 migrants were returned to Haiti by
 the U.S. Coast Guard in 1984. This represents fully 73
 percent of all migrants returned (3,415) over the 39-month
 life of the 1981 interdiction agreement. Based on the
 migrants' own statements, U.S. immigration officers
 determined that all were intending economic migrants and
 ineligible for refugee status. Embassy officers have
 inteviewed one fifth of all interdictees as part of the
 continuing program to monitor the treatment of repatriated
 migrants. These interviews generally take place within six
 months of the return of the attempting illegal migrant. None
 of the interdictees reported official mistreatment or
 harassment by Haitian officials as a result of their attempt
 to emigrate. In accordance with the agreement, the Haitian
 Government has not prosecuted nor arrested any repatriates for
 their illegal departure. However, also in accordance with the
 agreement, the Government has arrested several persons
 suspected of organizing clandestine voyages, persons crewing
 such vessels, and persons found in possession of illegal drugs.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Haiti is ruled by President-for-Life Jean-Claude Duvalier,
 assisted and counseled by a small group of advisors. The
 Constitution grants the President the right to name the
 cabinet and all important officials (in the executive and
 judiciary) and to designate his own successor, all without
 legislative approval. When the legislature is not in session,
 the President can make laws by decree. The 1984 legislature
 was virtually powerless and followed the lead of the
 President. Legislative elections were held in February 1984.
 On the positive side, there were a record number of candidates
 
 
 575
 HAITI
 and, in some districts, these were the freest elections under
 the Duvaliers. However, the Government did not allow such
 opposition leaders as Sylvio Claude and Gregoire Eugene to
 participate in the process, and in some districts the
 Government interfered with the process to ensure that its
 candidate won through intimidation and altering of the
 results. In general, however, these elections were less
 flawed than either the 1983 municipal elections or the 1979
 legislative elections.
 There are no officially recognized political parties in
 Haiti. In May, the Government announced that it would submit
 to the National Assembly legislation to regulate the operation
 of political parties, but would continue to ban political
 activity by political parties until the law was passed.
 Although it was not submitted to the legislature in 1984, in
 October President Duvalier announced the establishment of a
 commission to examine the first draft of such a law.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is sensitive to its international image in
 human rights matters. In recent years the Government has
 augmented its cooperation with international human rights
 organizations. In June 1984, the Government allowed an
 International Committee of the Red Cross representative to
 visit prisoners in Haiti's jails. The representative was able
 to visit prisoners in the Port-au-Prince national penitentiary
 as well as the Casernes Dessalines. In October, the
 representative returned to Haiti and gave President Duvalier a
 list of recommendations for improvement of the conditions of
 prisoners in Haitian jails.
 During the past year the Government has sought to develop a
 closer working relationship with the International Labor
 Organization (ILO). An ILO mission visited Port-au-Prince in
 May to consider a Government request for new ILO technical
 cooperation programs. The team met with officials from
 several ministries, labor unions, the labor federations and
 international donor organizations. The Government and ILO are
 engaged in a continuing dialogue concerning Haiti's requests
 for increased technical assistance and the situation of labor
 in Haiti.
 Two human rights organizations operate in Haiti. The first is
 the government-sponsored National Human Rights Commission
 created in 1982. The nine-member Commission meets to
 investigate citizens' complaints of government abuses.
 However, the Commission has only advisory powers and does not
 get involved in 'political* cases (Claude, Eugene, De
 Ronceray). The Commission usually acknowledges receipt of
 requests from international human rights organizations, but
 does not respond to all. The Haitian Human Rights League,
 founded by a local attorney and educator in 1979, is
 affiliated with the International Federation of the Rights of
 Man. While articles by individual members of the League
 appear in the local press, the League was not active in 1984.
 In September the League published a communique in the local
 press praising the Government for bringing to trial five
 individuals accused of participating in a bombing incident in
 1983 and calling on the Government to lift the house arrest of
 Gregoire Eugene and Hubert De Ronceray.
 
 
 576
 HAITI
 There were other visits of international human rights groups
 in 1984. A representative of the Lawyers' Committee for
 International Human Rights visited Haiti in January and met
 with Sylvio Claude--who was under house arrest at that time--
 and government officials. Representatives from the United
 Nations Human Rights Commission also visited Haiti in January
 and were received by government officials. In September,
 three representativgs of the Commtttee to Protect Journalists
 came to Haiti to iniestigate the June 18 arrests of the three
 publishers. They met with journalists and government
 officials.
 Freedom House rates Haiti as 'not free'. Amnesty
 International's 1984 report (which covered events during 1983)
 focused on allegations of torture and other forms of
 mistreatment of prisoners, detention without trial, including
 unacknowledged detention for long periods of political
 prisoners, and cases of disappearances.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Haiti is the poorest and, in most terms, least developed
 nation in the Western Hemisphere with an annual GNP per capita
 of about $300. A small elite and a growing middle class in
 Port-au-Prince control most of the wealth of the country,
 while 78 percent of the rural population and more than half of
 the urban population exist in dire poverty. Such extreme
 poverty has caused massive migration from Haiti. Foreign
 remittances, estimated to exceed $50 million per year, are a
 crucial element of survival for many families.
 Haiti's population is estimated to be 5.7 million, with over
 one million in the greater Port-Au-Prince area. Haiti suffers
 from a lack of natural resources and a terrain which is 70
 percent mountainous. In addition, erosion of the topsoil
 resulting from destruction of the forest cover on the
 hillsides and the frequent droughts and floods in various
 parts of the island have lowered agricultural production and
 the income of peasant families. Coffee, essential oils from
 vetiver, and mangoes are the primary agricultural exports.
 Most farming is done on small plots owned by peasant families
 and subdivided through inheritance over generations, resulting
 in inefficient agricultural practices. The Government has
 endorsed the development of agricultural cooperatives to
 improve productivity and access to markets for farmers in
 remote areas. Food imports are necessary, and even with them
 Haitians receive only 93 percent of their caloric supply
 requirements. More than 60 percent of children under five
 suffer from some malnutrition, and nearly 10 percent of these
 are characterized as seriously malnourished.
 The most dynamic sector of the Haitian economy is the assembly
 industry, which has created over 50,000 jobs in the past ten
 years. This has been due primarily to favorable Government
 investment policy, high laoor productivity, and a low minimum
 daily wage (currently $3.00), which have attracted foreign
 businessmen either for direct investment or for subcontracting
 of assembly operations. Spurred by a growing U.S. economy,
 which receives over 90 percent of the total output of the
 assembly industry, and the benefits of duty-free entry into
 the United States for many products under the Caribbean Basin
 Initiative (CBI), the assembly industry is expected to grow
 rapidly in the future.
 
 
 577
 HAITI
 Haiti has an extremely complex society. Conflicts and
 suspicions among the various social groups have left little
 tradition of national service. Mass education, for example,
 has seldom been encouraged and at times has beenoactively
 discouraged. The same has applied to agricultural and
 infrastructural development, health care, and openness to the
 world. A consequence of this social disorganization has been
 lack of respect for political and civil rights by those in
 positions of authority.
 The role of women in Haitian society is limited by the
 nation's traditionalism. Since 1982 there has been no legal
 discrimination against women as compared to men. Women enjoy
 full rights to education and property ownership and such
 social rights as divorce. Nevertheless, especially among the
 peasantry, women are limited to traditional domestic
 occupations. Middle class women quite often work, but
 generally out of economic necessity. Women comprise a large
 part of the assembly work force. Secretarial, teaching, and
 nursing positions are dominated by women. Few women, however,
 rise to prominent positions in the Haitian business world. As
 a rule, greater opportunities are available to women in the
 civilian government bureaucracy. There are two women
 secretaries of state, and several women of upper- and mid-
 level managerial rank are in the Government. Women are not
 permitted in the armed forces, except as nurses.
