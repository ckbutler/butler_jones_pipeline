 JAPAN
 Japan is a parliamentary democracy in which democratic
 institutions are firmly established. Its industrial free-market
 economy is the second largest in the world in terms of gross
 national product (GNP), with income distribution among the most
 egalitarian in the world. Japan's culture incorporates many
 elements from the West while retaining strong Eastern roots.
 Buddhism and Confucianism continue to have a basic and pervasive
 influence on thought and social institutions, but many other
 religions also flourish. Though Japan is known for its
 receptivity to foreign ideas, as a densely populated, racially
 and culturally homogeneous country, it has not established a
 significant record of receptivity to immigrants.
 The Japanese Constitution states, 'All of the people are equal
 under the law and there shall be no discrimination in political,
 economic or social relations because of race, creed, sex, social
 status or family origin.' The human rights guaranteed by the
 Constitution are secured by a just and efficient legal system.
 Political liberties are guaranteed to all nationals, and over 70
 percent of the electorate usually vote in general elections for
 candidates from seven political parties which function freely.
 The right of workers to organize and to bargain and act
 collectively is guaranteed by the Constitution with about 31
 percent of the active workforce belonging to labor unions. Most
 unions are involved in political activity as well as labor
 relations.
 On January 1, 1981, Japan became a formal party to the United
 Nations Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of
 Refugees. Concurrent legislation expanded pension and health
 insurance benefits to all resident aliens in Japan under age 35,
 addressing an issue of concern mainly to the resident Korean
 community. Though entrenched social attitudes of prejudice
 against Koreans and persons who for historical reasons have been
 considered outcasts are slow to change, legal statutes are
 gradually-evolving to grant equality of opportunity. Women's
 rights are undergoing similar long-term evolution. In order to
 ratify by 1985 the United Nations Convention on Abolition of
 Discrimination Against Women, for example, the Japanese
 Government has drafted legislation aimed at revising the
 nationality law to give women equal status with men in
 transferring nationality to their children. In the area of
 employment, numerous programs instituted by the Government in
 recent years to assist women in attaining greater equality are
 slowly showing results.
 For most of the post-World War II period, the only allegations
 of violations to the integrity of the person have been directed
 at right and left wing terrorist groups, among them the Japanese
 Red Army. Although members of the Red Army periodically send
 communiques from Mideast training camps, they have been inactive
 inside Japan for several years. Isolated small-scale incidents
 of violence by Red Army splinter groups now constitute the only
 infringements on the integrity of the person in Japan.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Killing
 There have been no known cases in 1982 of murder for political
 motive on the part of the Government or any organization. In
 
 
 722
 the recent past radical groups have murdered members of rival
 organizations, but this interfactional warring has not affected
 the general public.
 b.   Disappearance
 There are no known cases in Japan in which people have been
 abducted, secretly arrested, or held in clandestine detention by
 security forces or any other organization.
 c.   Torture
 Torture is forbidden by the Constitution and there are no known
 instances of torture committed in Japan.
 d.   Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Freedom from cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by the Constitution and respected in
 practice. Criminal sentences do not include physical
 punishment. There is no evidence that penal treatment varies by
 social class, sex, or religion. However, foreign prisoners
 serving sentence, regardless of the severity of their crimes,
 are detained in maximum security prisons where they are subject
 to the same strict regime and rules accorded Japanese prisoners
 sentenced to maximum security imprisonment.
 e.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaranteed by
 the Constitution and respected in practice. Japanese law
 provides for a writ of habeas corpus. Individuals cannot be
 detained without charge, and prosecuting authorities must be
 prepared to demonstrate before trial that sufficient evidence
 exists to detain the accused. Length of time before a suspect
 is brought to trial depends on the nature of the crime, but
 rarely exceeds two months; the average is one to two months.
 Preventive detention does not exist, and no political prisoners
 are held in Japan.
 f.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution guarantees the right to a speedy and public
 trial by an impartial tribunal in all criminal cases, and this
 right is respected in practice. The defendant is made aware of
 charges upon arrest, and guaranteed a public trial by
 independent civilian courts with defense counsel and the right
 to cross examination. Defense counsels have free and private
 access to defendants without harassment by government
 authorities, and have the right of access to evidence before the
 trial after a formal indictment has been made. Defendants also
 are protected from self-incrimination and the application of ex
 post facto laws. Judges are appointed by the cabinet for
 permanent terms, but face periodic "review" through popular
 referendum. A defendant who is dissatisfied with the decision
 of a trial court of first instance may, within the period
 prescribed by law, appeal to a high court as the reviewing court.
 g.   Invasion of the Home
 Under the Constitution, each search or seizure shall be made
 upon separate warrant issued by a competent judicial officer.
 Japanese authorities have been scrupulous in observing the legal
 requirements for warrants. The standards for issuing such
 warrants are adequate to guard against arbitrary searches.
 There are no reported allegations of government 'bugging" or
 other violations of the home.

 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.    Freedom of Speech and Press
 These freedoms are guaranteed by the Constitution and respected
 in practice.
 b.   Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These freedoms are guaranteed by the Constitution and respected
 in practice. Japanese law grants unions the right to organize,
 strike, bargain collectively, lobby, and make political campaign
 contributions. Public corporation employees are not accorded
 the right to strike, but have recourse to mediation and
 arbitration in the resolving of disputes. The collective
 bargaining rights of government employees are limited in that
 members of the armed forces, police officers, and fire fighters-
 are not permitted to organize.
 c.   Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed by the Constitution and
 respected in practice. While Buddhism and Shinto remain the two
 major religions, others flourish, including 133 Christian
 denominations. Missionaries are welcome and receive special
 visa status.
 d.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Nationals have the right to travel freely, both within Japan and
 abroad, to change their place of residence, to emigrate, and to
 repatriate voluntarily. Nationality is never revoked. As a
 signatory of the United Nations Treaty on Refugees, Japan grants
 asylum to Indochinese refugees until permanent homes can be
 found for them in other countries, and has also begun to allow
 permanent resettlement of some Indochinese in Japan itself on a
 limited basis.,
 e.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 As a parliamentary democracy, Japan is ruled by the political
 party able to form a majority in the lower house of its
 bicameral Diet. The Liberal Democratic Party, composed of
 several competing factions, has held a parliamentary majority
 since 1955. Six opposition parties are active, ranging from a
 communist party to a moderate conservative party. Elections are
 open and generally perceived as reflecting the public will. All
 adult nationals have the right to vote. Voting rates for lower
 House elections generally surpass 70 percent. Vote is by secret
 ballot. Political interest groups can organize and engage in
 non-violent political activity regardless of their political
 hue. Well-organized labor unions play an active role, not only
 in bringing economic benefits but also in ensuring participation
 by workers in the political process. Women hold 26 of 754 Diet
 seats and 4.6 percent of senior government posts.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 There were no known cases in 1982 of international investiga-
 tions of alleged human rights violations in Japan. In 1981, the
 United Nations Human Rights Commission considered and dismissed
 allegations of human rights violations against Koreans living in
 Japan. The Japanese government cooperated fully in UNHCR
 consideration of the case.
 
 
 724
 There are a large number of private organizations in Japan which
 are interested in human rights. They mainly lobby against the
 death penalty, for increased social and economic opportunities
 for minorities, for certain legal rights denied non-nationals,
 and for human rights in other countries. The activities of
 these organizations are not circumscribed and, by keeping their
 cases before the public eye, they can be credited with helping
 to refine and expand the boundaries of an egalitarian and
 democratic society.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Good quality food, shelter, health care, and education are
 widely available to inhabitants of Japan regardless of race,
 religion, sex, ethnic background, or political opinion.
 Some discrimination against women in the area of employment
 continues despite its prohibition by the Constitution and the
 various legislative measures adopted over the past 30 years to
 accord women the same legal status as men. The Government is
 cognizant of the problems faced by women in employment and has
 instituted numerous programs to assist women in attaining
 greater equality. An expert group on equality of the sexes,
 established in 1979 by the Ministry of Labor, continues to work
 on this issue. This group, along with the Women's and Young
 Worker's Bureau and the Tripartite Advisory Committee on Women's
 and Young Worker's Problems (both in the Ministry of Labor) is
 charged with identifying existing areas of employment discrim-
 ination and with proposing legislative and administrative
 measures for achieving equality of opportunity and treatment in
 employment. The Women's and Young Worker's Bureau also provides
 counseling and vocational training services and allowances to
 women experiencing difficulties in entering or re-entering the
 labor market.
 Japan's industrial free market economy is the second largest in
 the world, after the United States, in gross national product
 (GNP). Distribution of income is afaong the most equitable in
 the world (per capita GNP was US $9,892 in 1980).
 The population grew at a rate of 1.2 percent in 1980, reaching
 118,305,000 in 1981. The infant mortality rate was 7 per 1,000
 live births in 1981 with a life expectancy at birth in 1980 of
 75.6 years. With a highly competitive education system that
 provides nine years of free, compulsory schooling, Japan has a
 primary school enrollment ratio of 100 percent and has long had
 nearly total adult literacy (99-plus percent in 1980). The
 ratio of calorie supply available for consumption relative to
 nutritional requirements was 134 percent in 1980.
