 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 There were no reports of arbitrary arrests. According to law,
 Grenadian police have the right to detain individuals "on
 suspicion" without a warrant, but formal charges must be
 brought within 48 hours. This time limit is adhered to in
 practice. If the detainee is n6t charged within this time, he
 or she must be released. In 1987 no one was detained for
 political reasons.
 The law provides for a judicial determination of the legality
 of detention within 15 days after arrest on a criminal charge.
 Formal arraignment or release of the arrestee must be
 determined within 60 days. These procedures were generally
 followed.
 There is a functioning system of bail, although those charged
 with capital offenses are not eligible. Persons charged with
 treason can only be accorded bail upon recommendation of the
 Governor General.
 No Grenadian citizen was exiled in 1987. The Constitution
 specifically prohibits forced labor and no such incidents were
 reported in 1987.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Grenadians have the right to fair public trials under law and
 in practice. Those arrested and charged are brought before an
 independent judiciary and are allowed access to a lawyer of
 their choice. For capital crimes, the courts appoint lawyers
 when the accused cannot pay for his defense. In other cases,
 the defendant is assigned counsel if the case reaches the
 appellate stage. Following a determination by a judicial
 hearing that there is sufficient evidence to substantiate a
 criminal charge, the defendant is remanded for trial. Due to
 the backlog of cases caused by a lack of judges and facilities,
 a significant amount of time can pass before those charged are
 brought to trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There is no arbitrary interference by the state or any
 political organization in the private life of individuals.
 Warrants for searching homes are normally required by law
 except in cases of "hot pursuit." In practice, warrants are
 obtained in the majority of cases before a search is conducted.
 There is no forced membership in any organization and no
 arbitrary monitoring of telephones or correspondence.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is provided for by the Constitution
 and freely exercised. There are five weekly newspapers, plus
 several other papers which are published irregularly. Most of
 the papers are affiliated with political parties, but the two
 most widely circulated newspapers are independent. Flyers are
 occasionally distributed by remnants of the Revolutionary
 Military Council and the New Jewel Movement.
 Grenada has one government-run radio station as well as a
 nascent television broadcasting system being organized by a

 Grenadiah7.Goveinment.- Its growth has bden hampered by
 technical"lind finahcial constraints, as well as difficulties
 in obtaining'qualified staff.- The future 6f the television'

 b. Freedbm'ofiPeaceful Assembly and Association
 Grenadian' enj6y the right to assemble for any peaceful
 purpose, including the public protest of policies or actions
 of the Government. Supporters of political parties, including
 those whibh'we're'in owirpriorto October 1983, ndet

 Ministry officials estimate that approximately 25 percent of
 the total work force'is unionized, although this figure'may be
 low. Workers:can and do strike in'the public sector legally
 if they give advance notification. In 1987 all unions were
 free of government control, and none was given government
 support.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Roman Catholic and Anglican faiths predominate, but there
 are many Presbyterian and Methodist as well as Evangelical
 church members. In addition, there is a small Baha'i
 community and an Islamic center which serves the Muslim
 community.' Complete ieligious freedom extends to the-
 Rastafarians, who were harassed under the PRG regime. Clergy,
 including missionaries, travel and prosyletize freely. NG
 apparent advantages or disadvantages are conferred by
 adherence'to a particular faith, although Christian prayers
 and hymns form part of many governmentaland political
 meetings.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is freedom of movement within Grenada and, in principle,
 the right to enter and leave is guaranteed to all Grenadian
 citizens. However, a government-sponsored law, the "Act to
 
 
 492
 GRENADA
 Restrict the Freedom of Movement of Certain Persons," was
 passed in 1986. The law allows the Minister responsible for
 national security to restrict travel out of Grenada of "any
 person whose aims, tendencies, or objectives include the
 overthrow of the democratic and parliamentary system of
 government." The law allows anyone so restricted to appeal
 after 3 months to a three-man tribunal, headed by a lawyer.
 The law was enacted after the Grenadian Appeals Court upheld a
 government action withholding the passport of a former member
 of the PRG who sought to leave the country in 1985. There
 were no reported cases of this law being applied in 1987.
 Against considerable opposition, in 1987 Parliament passed the
 Emergency Powers Act (EPA) which gives the Government the
 authority to suspend some civil rights should the Governor
 General declare a state of national emergency. According to
 the EPA, the Governor General may declare a state of emergency
 whenever the State is "immediately threatened by any person or
 body... so as to be likely to endanger the maintenance of
 public order or the defense of the State ...." Under the
 provisions of the Act, declaration of a state of emergency
 empowers the Government, among other things, to control
 transport, communications, and resources; to ban free
 association and public assembly, impose curfews and otherwise
 restrict the movement of persons and the use or possession by
 persons of any specified article; make arrests without
 warrants and detain, deport, or exclude persons from the
 State; and appropriate privately owned property except real
 estate.
 The present Government argued in Parliament that Canada and
 the United Kingdom have similar legislation, and that the EPA
 represents part of an ongoing law reform program aimed at
 reinstituting measures needed to protect society. The
 opposition countered that the United Kingdom and Canadian
 parliaments cannot be compared to Grenada's due to its much
 smaller size, lack of dissenting backbenchers, and multiple
 ministerial portfolios. Oppositionists also argued that the
 Grenadian populace is not as well informed as its United
 Kingdom and Canadian counterparts and also complained that the
 sole radio station is government controlled. The Act has
 never been implemented.
 No one was forcibly repatriated to Grenada in 1987, and there
 were no official applications for refugee status. The Baha'i
 community includes Iranians who left their homeland to escape
 persecution. Work permits are granted to them, and they are
 allowed to practice their religion freely. The Government has
 allowed students and others to return from Cuba and other
 Communist countries.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The-Constitution provides for free and fair elections to be
 held at least every 5 years. The majority party in Parliament
 is the New National Party (NNP) under the leadership of Prime
 Minister Herbert Blaize. Formed by the union of three parties
 to contest the December 1984 elections, the NNP won 14 of the
 15 parliamentary seats in an election in which 85 percent of
 the voters participated. The NNP's majority was reduced to 12
 of 15 seats after the resignation of two members in 1986, and
 further defections in 1987 left the NNP with a 9 to 6 majority.
 Local government elections promised .by the NNP in the 1984
 campaign remain a topic of public debate but have yet to be
 
 
 493
 GRENADA
 implemented. Other parties actively espouse their views and
 seek support from the electorate.
 The political system is not dominated by any particular ethnic
 group, nor are there any restrictions which limit participation
 of any elements of the Grenadian population.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The present Government has welcomed visits of several human
 rights organizations. in the past and cooperated with an
 Amnesty International visit in November 1987.
 There are no active internal human rights organizations in
 Grenada.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language,'or Social Status
 Discrimination in health care, employment, or education is
 virtually negligible in Grenada, although there have been some
 reported incidents of unofficial job discrimination'against
 Guyanese and other'foreign-born residents.
 Women frequently earn less than men performing the same work.
 and tend to occhpy jobs which pay less. Wage differences are
 less prevalent for-more highly paid jobs,-but there are fewer
 women in such positions. A notable exception is the-civil
 service where women account for a substantial percentage of
 the work forbe  There are two female junior ministers.
 CONDITIONS OF.LABOR
 There is no effective regulation of work hours, wages, or
 occupational safety standards.* However, normal work hours
 rarely exceed 40 hours per week; the Government's own wage
 rate and vacation allowances are'comparable to those in the
 rest of the Eastern Caribbean; and common law allows employers
 to be sued for hegli-gence." Many minors work in family-run
 shops and farms, but employment of children under 16 in
 Grenada's relatively-small industrial sector is prohibited by-
 statute.
