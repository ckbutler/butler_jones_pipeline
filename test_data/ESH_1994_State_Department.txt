 WESTERN SAHARA
 WESTERN SAHARA
 The sovereignty of the Western Sahara remains the subject of a dispute between
 the Government of Morocco and the Polisario, an organization seeking independence
 for the region. The Moroccan Government assumed administration of the Western
 Sahara's northern three provinces after Spain withdrew from the area in 1975 and
 it extended its administration to the province of Oued ed Dahab in 1979 after Mau-
 ritania renounced its claim to it. After unifying the Western Sahara, the Moroccan
 Government undertook a massive economic development program that has resulted
 in substantial growth in the region's towns.
 Since 1973 the Polisario has challenged successively the claims of Spain and Mo-
 rocco to the territory. Moroccan and Polisario forces have fought intermittently since
 1975, although there have been no significant clashes since a 1991 cease-fire and
 deployment to the area of a United Nations contingent, known by its French initials,
 MINURSO.
 In 1975 the International Court of Justice issued an advisory opinion on the sta-
 tus of the Western Sahara. The Court held that Morocco was not entitled to sov-
 ereignty over the territory. According to the Court, the people of the Western Sa-
 hara, the Sabrawis, are entitled to self-determination. Efforts by the Organization
 of African Unity (OAU) to resolve the sovereignty question collapsed in 1984 when
 the OAU recognized the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic, the civilian arm of the
 Polisario. Morocco withdrew from the OAU in protest.
 In 1988 Morocco and the Polisario accepted the United Nations' plan for a referen-
 dum that would allow the Sabrawis to decide between integration with Morocco or
 independence for the region. The referendum was scheduled for January 1992 but
 was postponed because the parties could not agree on a common list of eligible vot-
 ers. The United Nations continues to seek a compromise on the voter issue. In Au-
 gust MINURSO personnel began to hold oral hearings for voter applicants in
 Laayoune and Tindouf, Algeria. At such hearings, applicants may present evidence
 of identification and residence, as well as oral testimony from tribal elders on the
 bona fides of the applicant's claim to voter eligibility.
 Since 1977 the Saharan provinces of Laayoune, Smara, and Bouidour have par-
 ticipated in Moroccan elections. The southern province of Oued ed Dahab has par-
 ticipated in Moroccan elections since 1983. Sabrawis fill all 10 seats allotted to the
 Western Sahara in the Moroccan Parliament.
 The civilian population in the 85 percent of the Western Sahara under Moroccan
 administration is subject to Moroccan law. U.N. observers and foreign human rights
 groups report that Sahrawis have difficulty obtaining Moroccan passports, that the
 Government monitors the political views of Sahrawis more closely than those of Mo-
 roccan citizens, and that the police and paramilitary authorities react especially
 harshly against those suspected of supporting the Polisario.
 Sahrawis who returned to Morocco from refugee camps administered by the
 Polisario have presented strong circumstantial evidence that they were tortured by
 Polisario security officers in the camps. However, there were no reports that camp
 residents were tortured in 1994.
 After years of denying that Sahrawis were imprisoned in Morocco for Polisario-
 related military or political activity, the Government released 300 such prisoners in
 1991. Entire families and Sahrawis who had "disappeared" in the mid-1970's were
 among those released. The Government has failed to conduct a public inquiry or to
 explain how and why those released were held for up to 16 years in incommunicado
 detention without charge or trial. The Polisario claims that the Government contin-
 ues to hold more than 800 Sahrawis as political prisoners. The Government formally
 denies that any Sahrawi noncombatants remain in detention. However, in announc-
 ing an amnesty for political prisoners in July, King Hassan declared that any pris-
 oner who questions Morocco's sovereignty over the Western Sahara would not be eli-
 gible for amnesty. Observers interpreted the King's remarks as implying that the
 Government still holds some Sahrawi nationalists in prison.
 According to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Morocco holds
 69 Sahrawi combatants as prisoners of war (POW's), and the Polisario holds be-
 tween 2,500 and 3,000 Moroccan POWs. In 1994 ICRC representatives visited both
 ups of prisoners but had not released any reports at year's end. The Polisario
 as separated out 200 Moroccan soldiers and offered them for repatriation along
 
 
 1155
 
 with another group of 25 POW's reportedly in need of medical attention. The Gov-
 ernment of Morocco, beliei  that the offer is predicated on according the Polisario
 greater legitimacy, has not officially responded to them.
 Freedom of movement within the Western Sahara is limited in militarily sensitive
 areas. Elsewhere, security forces subject travelers to arbitrary questioning, deten-
 tion, and abuse.
 The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, using figures provided by the Govern-
 ment of Algeria, estimates that approximately 165,000 refugees live in the camps
 near Tindouf, Algeria. However, the Moroccan Government maintains that no more
 than 80,000 refugees inhabit the camps. The Government alleges that the residents
 are held in the camps against their will, an allegation denied by the Polisario.
 There is little organized labor activity in the Western Sahara. The same labor
 laws that apply in Morocco are applied in the Moroccan-controlled areas of the
 Western Sahara. Moroccan unions are present in the Moroccan-controlled Western
 Sahara but are relatively moribund. The 15 percent of the territory outside Moroc-
 can control does not have any population centers or economic activity beyond no-
 madic herding. The Polisario-sponsored labor union, the Sario Federation of Labor
 (UGTSARIO), does not have any activities in the Western Sahara.
 There were no strikes, other job actions, or collective bargaining agreements in
 1994. Most union members are employees of the Government or state-owned organi-
 zations. They are paid 85 percent more than their counterparts outside the Western
 Sahara. Workers in the Western Sahara are exempt from income and value-added
 taxes and receive subsidies on such commodities as flour, oil, sugar, fuels, and utili-
 ties.
 Moroccan law prohibits forced labor, which does not appear to exist in the West-
 ern Sahara. Regulations on the minimum age of employment are the same as in Mo-
 rocco. Child labor appears to be less common in the Western Sahara than in Mo-
 rocc, primarily because of the absence of industries most likely to employ children,
 such as rug knotting and garment making. A government work program for adults,
 the Promotion Nationale, provides families with enough income so that children
 need not be hired out as domestic servants Children in the few remaining nomadic
 groups presumably work as shepherds along with other group members. Adult un-
 employment in the Western Sahara is below 5 percent. The minimum wage and
 maximum hours for work are the same as in Morocco. In practice, however, employ-
 ees in some fish-processing plants may work as much as 12 hours per day, 6 days
 per week, well beyond the 10-hour day, 48-hour week maximum allowed by Moroc-
 can law. Occupational health and safety standards in Western Sahara are those en-
 forced in Morocco. They are rudimentary, except for a prohibition on the employ-
 ment of women in dangerous occupations.
