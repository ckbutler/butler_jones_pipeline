 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 The Central African Republic became a democracy in 1993 following free and fair
 elections in which Ange Felix Patasse, candidate of the Movement for the Liberation
 of the Central African People (MLPC) was chosen President. Citizens also elected
 an 85-member National Assembly in which no party achieved a majority. In 1994
 a multiparty democratic Constitution was widely discussed, debated, revised and fi-
 nally accepted in a national referendum in late December.
 The military and the National Gendarmerie, under the Minister of Defense, share
 internal security responsibilities with the civilian police force under the direction
 of the Minister of Public Security. Under President Patasse, the Presidential Secu-
 rity Guard was reduced in size and responsibilities. Outside of banditry in border
 regions, a brief university student demonstration, and an ethnical ? charged, non-
 political fracas with Chadian merchants, there were no incidents o unrest nor dis-
 turbances of public security.
 The Central African Republic is a landlocked and sparsely populated country,
 most of whose inhabitants practice subsistence agriculture. _Prncipal exports are
 coffee, cotton, timber, tobacco, and diamonds. Devaluation of the currency in Janu-
 ary had the effect of raising producer prices, including these commodities, and thus
 boosted rural income. On the other hand, devaluation raised the cost of imported
 items, which constrained consumption by civil servants and other workers. Eco-
 nomic structural reforms began to take effect midway through the year, greatly im-
 proving the prospects for economic growth.
 The overall human rights situation improved considerably following the Septem-
 ber 1993 elections and the installation of the new Government in October. Local
 watchdog groups, however, remain vigilant. They have expressed concerns that
 prosecutions of former regime figures for corruption not be tainted by political ven-
 detta. Similarly, they criticized the Government's tendency to use police powers to
 intimidate opponents. Actions such as harassment of travelers, politically inspired
 searches and interrogations, and telephone monitoring have been used occasionally
 against political opponents. Several persons remained detained under national secu-
 rity criteria in excess of legal limits without their cases going to trial. Police beat-
 ings of some detainees continued, and the army's treatment of captured bandits was
 harsh. The Government is not known to have punished those responsible. Other
 human rights abuses included continuing discrimination and violence against
 women and discrimination against pygmies.
 
 
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no known political
 killings, but there were credible reports that army troops captured and summarily
 executed several bandits after a firefight near the Chadian border.
 The Government investigated extrajudicial killings which had occurred in April
 1993 and August 1992, when security forces used excessive force in suppressing
 anti-government forces. A military tribunal found four soldiers guilty of causing the
 deaths of civilians in those incidents.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Deading Treatment or Punishment.
 Although the Penal Code prohibits torture and specifies sanctions for those found
 gulty of physical abuse, the police continue to beat and abuse criminal suspects.
 ere were reliable reports that officials of the former regime held by authorities
 as criminals on corruption charges were among those mistreated. So far as is
 known, the Government did not punish those responsible. Prison conditions are
 harsh. Cells are overcrowded, and the basic necessities of life, including food, cloth-
 ingj, and medical care, are in short sup ly.
 Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Ei.-The law stipulates that persons detained
 in cases other than those involving national security must be brought before a mag-
 istrate within 96 hours. In practice, this deadline is often not respected, in part due
 to inefficient judicial procedures. By law, national security detainees defined as
 "those held for crimes against the security of the State" may be held without charge
 for up to 2 months. Authorities in early 1994 arrested, interrogated, and incarcer.
 ated under this section of the law approximately 24 persons-half military, half ci-
 vilian-suspected of harboring weapons and plotting against the Government. Police
 freed several following investigation and reduced charges against most others, but
 some detainees remain in jail awaiting trial or court-martial. Although previous gov-
 ernments used the national security provision of the law to arrest opponents for ex-
 ercising internationally recognized human rights, the Government did not detain
 any person for such presumed infractions. There were no known instances of incom-
 municado detention.
 The judicial system does not provide for bail, but authorities do release suspects
 on their own recognizance. The Government arrested six politically prominent per-
 sons on apparently valid charges of corruption. It has been slow to bring them to
 trial, however, reflecting both the complexity of the cases as well as politically driv-
 en motives to ensure convictions.
 The law does not permit exile, and it does not occur in practice.
 The Government has repeatedly stated that any person in exile for strictly politi-
 cal, rather than criminal, reasons may return home without fear of persecution. At
 the end of the year, there were no known political self-exiles. Former politician
 Rodolph Iddi-Lala died in exile in 1994.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL.-The judiciary consists of regular and military
 courts, with the Supreme Court at the apex. In criminal cases, the accused have
 the right to legal counsel, to public trial, and to be present at their trials. The Gov-
 ernment generally respects these safeguards in practice, but the judiciary suffers
 numerous shortcomings, including executive interference, institutional neglect, inef-
 ficient administration of the law, and shortages of trained personnel and material
 resources. The military court, for example, did not convene during the first half of
 the year for lack of money. It did convene in September and worked its way through
 a full docket of cases. Military court proceedings are open to the public and are
 broadcast on national radio.
 Parliamentary critics condemned as unconstitutional President Patasse's action to
 grant amnesty, prior to completion of investigations and possibly trial, to persons
 accused of engaging in fraudulent manipulation of educational examination results.
 The Constitution is vague regarding authority to grant executive clemency prior to
 conviction. There were no known political prisoners in 1994.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government rarely abused legal prohibitions on invasion of the home without a war-
 rant in civil and criminal cases. Title IV of the Penal Code, which covers certain
 political and security cases, allows police to search private property without written
 authorization. Early in the year, po ice conducted such searches as part of investiga-
 tions into illegal weapons caches. In at least one other attempt, when the police did
 not invoke national security provisions, irate neighbors thwarted a politically in-
 spired search. The Government used telephone monitoring to maintain a close
 watch on opposition figures.

 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Private citizens spoke freely and publicly about
 political developments, criticizing the Government, the President's handling of cer-
 tain issues, and political parties. Opposition leaders, in particular, used press state-
 ments, manifestos, broadsides, and copies of open correspondence to the Govern-
 ment to circulate their views. Although not all of this documentation was published
 in the government-controlled media, the Government made no apparent effort to
 censure, seize, or halt circulation of these materials.
 The Government owns and controls one newspaper, which appeared only 6 times
 during the year, a more regular wire service news bulletin, and a radio and tele-
 vision station. Although the Government refused to provide unimpeded access to the
 media, it allowed some opposition statements and press conferences as news items.
 The political opposition felt that, under this policy, media coverage of political activi-
 ties was unbalanced and unfairly limited the public's right to information. This
 point was particularly relevant for several days during the campaign leading to the
 constitutional referendum when the government press did not report opposition
 views. However, it subsequently relented and reported opposing perspectives prior
 to the voting.
 Several private newspapers began publication during the ear, but only sporadi-
 cally. In  addition, the   Government granted     Radio Africa   One, a    private
 continentwide music-and-news radio station, permission to begin unrestricted local
 broadcasting in Bangui. Finally, a church-run radio station was authorized but had
 not yet started broadcasting by year's end. The Government did not impede foreign
 journalists in their work.
 University faculty members and students belonged to the full range of political
 parties and expressed their respective views without fear of reprisal. No issues of
 academic freedom were tested.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of assembly, but this is restricted by regulation. A 1992 decree requires
 the organizers of all demonstrations and public meetings to register with the Gov-
 ernment 48 hours in advance. The decree also prohibits political meetings in schools
 or churches. In September the political party responsible for the decree, the
 Rassemblement Democratique Centrafricain (RDC), led by former President
 Kolingba, scheduled a rally on school property, which the Government then prohib-
 ited. The RDC conducted the rally a week later on its own premises without dif-
 ficulty. There were no other known instances of permissions for meetings being re-
 fused, nor did the Government interfere in or monitor such meetings.
 Associations are required to register with the Government in order to enjoy legal
 status. A 1991 law requires all political parties to register with the Ministry of Pub-
 lic Security in order to participate legally in politics.
 The Government permitted the 23 registered political parties, as well as a variety
 of nonpolitical associations, to hold congresses, to elect officials, and to publicly de-
 bate policy issues without interference.
 c. Freedom of Relign.-There is no state religion, and a variety of religious com-
 munities are active. Religious organizations and missionary groups are free to pros-
 elytize, worship, and construct places of worship. However, religious groups must
 register with the Government, and any group whose behavior is considered subver-
 sive in nature remains subject to sanctions, although no sanctions were imposed in
 1994. Jehovah's Witnesses, which the previous Government had banned, encoun-
 tered no difficulties during 1994.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-People are free to move within the country, but police and other offi-
 cials sometimes harass travelers unwilling or unable to pay bribes at checkpoints
 along major intercity roads and at major intersections in Bangui, the capital. The
 Government has not taken effective measures to eliminate these practices. On sev-
 eral occasions police refused to let former President Kolingba or members of his
 family, who are not under any sort of restraining order, pass through the control
 barrier toward his farm some 20 miles from town. After protest, and without admit-
 ting responsibility for its actions, the Government permitted the former president
 to travelIn an unrelated case, authorities refused permission to the nephew of a
 presidential candidate to board a Paris-bound plane. Again after protest, the indi-
 vidual was allowed to depart. As part of an anticorruption measure, the Government
 decreed that former chief executives of state-owned companies would not be free to
 leave the country until auditors had certified that accounts were in order.
 There were no known cases of revocation of citizenship during the year.
 The Government continued to host refugees from Chad, Sudan and several dozen
 from Rwanda. It cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refu-
 
 
 43
 gees (UNHCR). There were no reports of forced repatriation of refugees to countries
 in which they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 In 1993 citizens were able to exercise peacefully their constitutional right to
 change their government by democratic means. International observers deemed the
 elections free and fair.
 The new Constitution, which was adopted by national referendum in December,
 provides for multiple litical parties and increased powers and independence for
 the legislative and judicial branches at the expense of the executive. Bye-elections
 for six empty parliamentary seats were also held in December. One of the six out-
 comes was again rejected because of irregularities. The ruling MLPC Party failed
 to gain seats.
 Most presidential candidates, including Patasse, promised municipal and local
 elections by 1994, but as yet none are scheduled. In the interim the Government
 moved to appoint a new mayor for Bangui, an action that engendered criticism from
 prodemocracy forces as reneging on a commitment. A constitutional challenge by an
 opposition party led to executive annulment of the appointment on the grounds that
 the appointee, an elected member of the National Assembly, was not eligible for a
 concurrent post.
 Women remained underrepresented in politics. Three women candidates were
 elected to Parliament, and two others were named as Cabinet ministers.
 Pygmies (Ba'aka), who represent from 1 to 2 percent of the national population,
 are not represented in the Government and have little political power or iifluence,
 although they voted in large numbers in the 1993 election. In general, the Ba'aka
 have little ability to participate in decisions affecting their lands, culture, traditions,
 and the allocation of natural resources.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Central African Human Rights League (LCDH) is a nongovernmental organi-
 zation with multiple goals, including publicizing human rights violations and plead-
 ing individual cases of human rights abuse be ore the courts. During the course of
 the year, several other nongovernmental organizations, including the Movement for
 the Defense of Human Rights and Humanitarian Action and the Central African
 Red Cross, actively pursued human rights issues, including prison visits. The Gov-
 ernment did not attempt to hinder any such activities.
 A representative of the International Committee of the Red Cross visited the
 Central African Republic at least once during the year and was given access to pris-
 ons. There were no nown requests from other international human rights organiza-
 tions for visits.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution stipulates that all persons are equal before the law without re-
 Lard to wealth, race, or religion, but significant discrimination exists, as indicated
 ow.
 Women.-Despite the Constitution, in practice women are not treated as equal to
 men economically, socially, or politically, women in rural areas suffer mere discrimi-
 nation than women in urban areas. Sixty to seventy percent of urban females go
 to primary school, while only 10 to 20 percent of their rural counterparts do. Over-
 all,. at the primary level females and males enjoy equal access to education, but a
 majority of young women drop out at age 14 or 15 due to social pressure to marry
 and bear children. Only 20 percent of the students at the University of Bangui are
 women.
 In rural communities, women continue traditional childraising duties and perform
 most subsistence farming, while men seek salaried work or produce cash crops. Cus-
 toms forbidding women and children to eat certain classes of food, including some
 meats, persist in some areas of the country.
 There are no accurate statistics on the percentage of female wage earners, but in
 cities many educated women find work outside the traditional patterns. Some hold
 clerical positions, and a modest but growing number are establishing private busi-
 nesses or moving into the higher echelons of government. Women serve in the mili-
 tary, the police force, and the Gendarmerie.
 Polygyny is legal, although there is growing resistance among educated women to
 this practice. There is no legal limit on the number of wives a man may take, but
 a prospective husband must indicate at the time of the marriage contract whether
 he intends to take further wives. In practice many Central Africans never formally
 
 
 marry because men cannot afford the traditional bride payment. Women who are
 educated and financially independent tend to seek monogamous marriages. Divorce
 is legal and may be initiated by either partner. Central African law does not dis-
 criminate against women in inheritance and property rights, but a welter of conflict-
 ing customary laws (depending on region or ethnic background) often prevail.
 Violence against women, including wife beating, occurs, but it is impossible to
 quantify its extent as data are lacking, and victims seldom make reports. The courts
 try very few cases of spouse abuse, although litigants cite this abuse during divorce
 trials or in civil suits for damages. Some women reportediy tolerate abuse in order
 to retain a measure of financial security for themselves and their children. The Gov-
 ernment did not address this issue in 1994.
 The Government chartered the Association of Central African Female Jurists in
 1993. This group established a legal clinic to advise women of their legal rights and
 published pamphlets in conjunction with the Ministry of Social Affairs that advised
 women of the legal prohibition and dangers of female genital mutilation. A second
 pamphlet, directed at women and young children, discussed food taboos. In 1994 the
 group sponsored theatrical presentations designed to educate the populace about
 women's rights.
 Children.-Although there is no official discrimination against children, the Gov-
 ernment spends little money on programs for children. There are a few church and
 other nongovernmental projects for youth. Cripping strikes in the education sector
 caused 3 years of missed school. Schools restarted in late 1993 and have operated
 normally since that time. Nonetheless, most children are woefully behind in their
 studies, and a number have dropped out completely. Bangui contains a population
 of street children who make their way by begging and stealing. Several charitable
 organizations strive to assist them.
 Current interpretation of Article 187 of the Penal Code forbids blows or injuries
 to children under the age of 15. The project of drafting a strong family code designed
 to protect women's and children's rights was not completed in 1994.
 The Government has never enforced in court a 1966 law forbidding female genital
 mutilation (FGM) nor Article 187, which is also interpreted as prohibiting FGM.
 International health experts have condemned FGM as damaging to both physical
 and psychological health. This traditional tribal practice is found in certain rural
 areas, and to a lesser degree in Bangui, and is performed at an early age. Prelimi-
 nary data from a national health census indicates that 44 percent of females have
 undergone this mutilation.
 Indigenous People.-Despite constitutional provisions, in practice some minorities
 are treated unequally. In particular, indigenous forest-dwelling pygmies are subject
 to social and economic discrimination and exploitation which the Government has
 done little to correct. Pygmies often work for villagers at wages lower than those
 paid to other groups.
 National Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-here are about 90 ethnic groups, and in the
 past there has been little ethnic balance at the higher levels of government. Under
 the former Kolingba government, members of the minority Yakoma ethnic group
 held a disproportionate number of senior positions in the government, military, and
 state-owned firms. Under the Patasse Government, this trend has changed. Al-
 though residents of the north of the country are a majority in his Cabinet, a broader
 ethnic balance has been achieved. Even so, observers detect noticeable favoritism to-
 wards northerners in government appointments and caution that the ethnic pen-
 dulum not swing too far in that direction.
 Religious Minorities.-Muslims, particularly Mbororo (Peuhl) herders, claim to
 have been singled out for harassment, including police shakedowns and bandit at-
 tacks, due to popular resentment of their presumed affluence. In October, following
 a confrontation between Muslim Chadian merchants and an off-duty policeman
 which left three persons dead, anti-Chadian rioting resulted in the looting of several
 dozen shops. Few Muslims hold senior executive posts in government, but around
 six Muslims serve in the National Assembly.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no codified or cultural discrimination against
 the disabled. There are several government-initiated programs designed to assist
 the disabled, including handicraft training for the blind and the distribution of
 wheelchairs and carts by the Ministry of Social Services. There is no legislated or
 mandated accessibility for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Under the new Labor Code, last revised in 1990 all
 workers are free to form or join unions of their own choosing without prior author-
 ization. A relatively small part of the population has exercised the right of associa-
 
 
 45
 tion, chiefly wage earners, such as civil servants, which includes teachers and postal
 worker.
 The current Labor Code does not refer to trade unions by name, a change from
 previous versions. The International Labor Organization (ILO) had requested this
 change to reflect the proliferation of new unions. There are now five recognized
 labor federations, including the Organization of Free Public Sector Unions and the
 Labor Union of Central African Workers (USTC). The USTC and its member unions
 continued to assert and maintain their official independence from the Government
 and political parties.
 Unions have the right to strike and, although there were no significant strikes,
 they have exercised'this right in both the private and public sectors in previous
 years. To be legal, strikes must be preceded by the union's presentation of demands
 the employer's response to these demands, a conciliation meeting between labor and
 management, and a finding by an arbitration council that the union and employer
 failed to reach agreement on valid demands. The Labor Code states that if employ-
 ers initiate a lockout which is not in accordance with the Labor Code, then the em-
 ployer is required to pay workers for all days of the lockout. Other than this, the
 Code does not provide for sanctions on employers for acting against strikers. It is
 not known to what extent this policy is actually followed.
 Labor federations are free to affiliate internationally. The USTC maintains inter-
 national labor contacts, although it is not yet formally affiliated with any inter-
 national bodies. In October USTC members voted to seek formal affiliation with sev-
 eral international labor organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code accords trade
 unions full egal status, including the right to sue in court. However, by requiring
 a union official to be employed full-time in the occupation as wage earner, the Labor
 Code serves to restrict union organizing activities to after-hours.
 The Labor Code does not specifically provide that unions may bargain collectively.
 While collective bargaining has nonetheless taken place in some instances, the Gov-
 ernment is usually involved in the process.
 Wage scales are set by the Ministry of Labor and Civil Service but have been only
 a tangential issue in labor negotiations; the nonpayment of salary arrears and high-
 er consumer costs attributed to the devaluation continued to be the major com-
 plaints of the unions.
 The law expressly forbids discrimination against employees on the basis of union
 membership or union activity. However, leaders of public sector unions, particularly
 teachers, complained of government discrimination against them and their mem-
 bers, most often through arbitrary reassignment to provincial posts. The Labor Code
 does not state whether employers found-guilty of antinnion discrimination are re-
 quired to reinstate workers fired for union activities.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is specifically prohib-
 ited by the Labor Code, and there were no reports of such labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Employment of children under 14
 years of age is forbidden bylaw, but this provision is only loosely enforced by the
 Ministry of Labor and Civil Service. In practice, the role of children in the labor
 force is generally limited to helping the family in traditional subsistence farming or
 in retailing.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code states that the Minister of
 Labor, rather than the National Assembly, must set minimum wages by decree.
 Minimum wages differ among the various sectors. In September 1991, minimum
 wages were raised for the first time since 1980 by between 10 and 50 percent, de-
 pending on the category of employee. The lowest paid workers received the largest
 percentage increases in the minimum wage. The minimum wage assures a family
 the basic necessities but is barely adequate to maintain a decent standard of living
 in a country with a high cost of living relative to family income. Agricultural work-
 ers are guaranteed a minimum of $14 (CFAF 7,800) per month, while office workers
 are guaranteed $32 (CFAF 18,000). Most labor is performed outside the wage and
 social security system, especially by farmers in the large subsistence agricultural
 sector.
 The law sets a standard workweek of 42 hours for Government employees and
 most private sector employees. Domestic employees may work up to 55 hours per
 week. The law also requires that there be a minimum rest period of 24 consecutive
 hours on Sundays, although in certain circumstances the Sunday requirement may
 be waived.
 There are also general laws on health and safety standards in the workplace, but
 the Ministry of Labor and Civil Service neither precisely defines nor actively en-
 forces them, a matter about which the ILO has expressed concern to the Govern-
 
 
 46
 ment for many years. The Labor Code states that a labor inspector may force an
 emloyer to correct unsafe or unhealthy work conditions, but it does not provide the
 righ for workers to remove themselves from such conditions.
