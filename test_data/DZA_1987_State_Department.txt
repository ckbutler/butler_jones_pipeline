 ALGERIA
 According to its Constitution, Algeria is a Socialist, Islamic
 state in which ultimate power is vested in a single political
 party, the National Liberation Front (FLN). As Secretary
 General of the party, President of the Republic, and Minister
 of Defense, Chadli Bendjedid holds the key decisionmaking
 positions. Nonetheless, most important decisions are taken by
 consensus involving the military, the Government, and the
 party elites. These elites are bound together by the common
 experience of a harsh struggle for independence, obtained from
 France in 1962. Though a new generation of technocrats has
 begun to attain positions of leadership, a sense of
 revolutionary, anticolonial mission remains basic to the
 ruling elites' self-perception of what Algeria is and ought to
 be. This revolutionary consensus is the principal source of
 popular legitimacy for the Government and the nation.
 In January 1986, Algerian voters overwhelmingly approved a
 referendum on revisions to the National Charter, the country's
 basic political document, first promulgated in 1976. Though
 retaining Algeria's Socialist orientation, the revised Charter
 places increased emphasis on the Islamic roots of the
 country's political and economic system and calls for greater
 private sector participation in service and light industries
 and the achievement of agricultural self-sufficiency. The
 current 5-year plan (1985-89) reaffirms the Government's shift
 in emphasis from heavy industry to development of agriculture,
 job creation, and the satisfaction of unmet social needs in
 the fields of housing, education, and health. Low world
 prices in 1987 for hydrocarbons, the Government's principal
 source of hard currency earnings, have adversely affected
 performance in some of these areas, as has the continued high
 rate of population growth. The Government announced major
 reforms in 1987 involving autonomy for state enterprises and
 privatization of agriculture.
 Urban police and the rural-oriented gendarmerie generally
 adhere to constitutional guarantees against arbitrary arrest
 and imprisonment. Military security forces, in practice, are
 given greater leeway to make arrests, and there are charges of
 abuse and torture. Those charges have not been documented.
 Generally speaking, excesses committed by security forces,
 chiefly involving incommunicado detention of suspects beyond
 legal limits, are a major element behind human rights
 violations in Algeria.
 Although the Constitution contains human rights provisions,
 civil liberties remain restricted. Political rights, in
 particular, are circumscribed by the party and the Government
 which limit the electoral choices and restrict public debate
 to officially sanctioned forums and issues. An important
 reform of the Law on Associations was passed by the National
 Assembly in 1987 which, if implemented, should allow citizens
 to undertake a number of social, economic, and humanitarian
 activities free of party control. Algerians have the right to
 possess private property and are generally free to pursue
 private interests without state interference. Some Berber
 elements claim to be the object of discriminatory treatment.
 The Government, however, has sought to reduce tensions with
 the Berbers, who constitute from one-fourth to one-third of
 the population, by accommodating some of their cultural
 demands and investing heavily in the development of
 predominantly Berber areas.

 ALGERIA
 There were several significant developments in the human
 rights field over the past year. Within days of major rioting
 in Constantine and Setif in November 1986, nearly 200 persons
 were quickly tried and sentenced to prison terms ranging from
 2 to 8 years. Over the following 2 months, leftists suspected
 of involvement in the riots, along with leaders of a banned
 human rights organization, were arrested and confined to the
 desert south. These arrests were described as administrative
 measures, and no charges were brought against the 23 involved.
 In a major turnabout, however, the Government released the 23
 in March, and in April permitted the establishment of an
 officially recognized human rights league comprised of a
 number of distinguished and independent fiqures from various
 walks of life. The new League'proceeded to lobby successfully
 for the release of almost all known political prisoners in
 Algeria, including the convicted rioters from Constantine and
 Setif as well as opposition and human rights activists who had
 been convicted by the State Security Court in December 1985.
 Finally, the leader of a group of fundamentalists responsible
 for an attack on a police academy in August 1985 was killed in
 a shoot-out with police in January 1987, and 195 of his
 followers were convicted by the State Security Court in July.
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings.
 b. Disappearance
 Abductions, secret arrests, and clandestine detention are not
 condoned or known to be practiced. There were no accusations
 of such practices in 1987.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Algerian Constitution prohibits torture and in 1987 there
 were no confirmed reports of torture. However, Islamic
 fundamentalists on trial in June at the State Security Court
 in Medea charged that their confessions had been extracted
 under torture.
 In its 1987 Report, covering 1986, Amnesty International (Al)
 expressed its concern about allegations it had received about
 torture and ill-treatment during detention in Algeria as well
 as allegations of deaths in custody as a result of torture.
 Al reported that, according to its information, Adbdelwahab
 Abderrahman was called for questioning by police in July 1986,
 kept in secret detention at the Central Commissariat in Oran,
 and his body later returned to his family. The police
 reportedly stated that he had died in a car accident. AI also
 noted that Mustapha Arris was arrested by security police in
 September 1986 and had died soon after being returned to his
 home suffering from serious injuries, and that Salem Lamali,
 reportedly detained without charge since October 1983, is
 believed to have died in September 1986 following an
 operation. AI also noted that it had asked Algerian
 authorities to inform it of any inquiries into allegations of
 torture of the defendants in a trial before the State Security
 Court in December 1985 on charges including conspiracy against
 the security of the State. AI reportedly received no reply to
 its request.

 Persons convicted of civil crimes are sent to provincial civil
 prisons, while those found guilty of more serious crimes
 against the State, such as treason or terrorism, or those who
 have committed crimes which carry the death penalty, such as
 murder, kidnaping, or rape, are sent to one of three
 penitentiaries. Conditions in both types of institutions
 range from primitive to modern; conditions in penitentiaries
 are reportedly worse than those found in the more numerous
 civil prisons. Although all prisons have medical facilities,
 and each prison has a contract with a local doctor who visits
 the prison regularly to treat ill prisoners, medical care is
 generally rudimentary. Seriously ill prisoners may be sent to
 local hospitals. Prisoners in both civil prisons and
 penitentiaries are fed a bland, starchy diet, and long-term
 prisoners rely on family support to augment this diet.
 Families are allowed to visit civil prisons once a week; it is
 considerably more difficult to visit prisoners held in
 penitentiaries. At the discretion of local prison authorities,
 conjugal visits are sometimes permitted in civil prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 The Constitution states that no one may be prosecuted,
 arrested, or held except as provided by law. It also provides
 that detention for questioning in criminal investigation cases
 cannot exceed 48 hours, after which the suspect must be charged
 or released. This period may be extended legally to 4 days in
 ordinary criminal cases and to 8 days in cases involving state
 security. The penal code provides for informing detainees
 immediately of charges against them. Once charged, an
 individual may be held in pretrial detention indefinitely
 while his case is being investigated. Algerian law does not
 include a bail system. Lawyers are legally entitled to access
 to their clients at any time. Meetings take place under the
 visual supervision of a guard.
 Despite these constitutional safeguards, military security
 forces have held suspects up to a month before releasing or
 charging them, as reportedly occurred in the case of Moslem
 fundamentalists who were tried in the State Security Court in
 June-July 1987. Military security officials are authorized to
 investigate not only military offenses but also cases
 involving internal security and espionage. In cases that
 involve subversion, they may also investigate civil crimes.
 Amnesty International has noted its concern about cases of
 prolonged incommunicado detention, and leaders of the new,
 officially recognized Algerian League of Human Rights have
 declared that elimination of this abuse as well as the
 practice of "administrative' or technical house arrest is
 their number one priority. President Bendjedid has encouraged
 the new League to combat excesses by the security services and
 to promote respect for the law by all agencies of government.
 Persons arrested for the expression of views critical of or
 different from those of the Government are generally charged
 with disturbing the public order, associating with illegal
 organizations, or, in extreme cases, threatening state
 security. Eight supporters of exiled former President Ben
 Bella were sentenced by the State Security Court in June to
 prison terms ranging from 2 to 5 years for antigovernment
 activity, while 10 of their codefendants were acquitted.
 Officials of the Algerian League of Human Rights who attended
 their trial indicated that the League would support freedom of
 expression. Four of those convicted have since been freed,
 
 
 1102
 ALGERIA
 while the League is currently lobbying to obtain the release
 of the other four remaining in prison.
 There is no forced labor.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Defendants in civil and security courts have free access to
 counsel, and there is no harassment of defense counsel. The
 Algerian Bar Association has a pool of lawyers who provide
 free services to defendants who cannot afford private counsel.
 As far as is known, defendants are made fully aware of the
 charges against them at the time they are bound over for
 trial. Defendants have the right to confront-witnesses and
 present evidence. Trials are public, although not generally
 publicized, and defendants have the right to appeal. The
 judicial system is divided into three parts: civil courts,
 military courts, and the State Security Court. There are no
 Islamic courts in Algeria.
 The civil courts are generally independent of executive or
 military control. Military courts deal directly with
 espionage and with offenses committed by military personnel.
 The State Security Court at Medea is not in permanent session
 bit has jurisdiction over cases that are deemed "to endanger
 the national security." At least a ministerial-level decision
 is required to refe-r a case to the State Security Court, which
 generally provides procedural protection similar to that of
 civilian courts. Interested observers are allowed to attend
 trials held in this court.
 All political prisoners arrested prior to February 1979,
 including former President Ben Bella, have been released since
 President Bendjedid took office. The Government has continued
 to encourage additional supporters of Ben Bella to return.
 During March and April 1987, the Government moved to release
 virtually all known political prisoners in the country. The
 first to benefit from this apparent policy shift was Rachid
 Ben Brahim, a producer from Algerian state television, who had
 been convicted in January of distributing antigovernment
 tracts. Ben Brahim was released on March 8 after more than
 1,0OD intellectuals had signed a petition, reportedly
 sponsored by the outlawed Communist Parti de Lavant Garde
 Socialiste, on his behalf. In June 1986, internationally
 known human rights lawyer Ali Yahia Abdenour was released
 after completing an 11 month sentence for founding an
 unsanctioned-human rights league in 1985. In December 1986,
 he along with 22 others was placed under administrative
 detention in the desert south. The Government released them
 on May 24. Finally, President Bendjedid ordered the release
 on April 2 of all 186 individuals convicted of participating
 in the Nomemher 1986 rioting in Constantine and Setif,
 following an appeal for clemency by the newly created Algerian
 League of Human Rights. The League also claimed credit for
 the release April 26 of six founding members of Abdennour's
 human ridhts group and two members of another unsanctioned,
 predominantly Berber organization, the Sons of Martyrs of the
 Revolution, who had been convicted by the State Security Court
 in December 1985.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Membership in political organizations is not required, except
 for senior government and military officials who are almost
 always members of the party. There is an efficient police
 force responsible for tracking possible sources of dissent,
 which is believed to use informer systems. It is also
 believed that telephone monitoring systems are used, rarely
 with prior court authorization.
 Inviolability of the home is provided for by the Constitution
 and generally is honored in practice except in cases involving
 military security. Police may not enter a house without a
 warrant from the local prosecutor or investigating magistrate,
 nor may they enter a residence during night hours.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Constitution provides for freedom of expression,
 it also states that such freedom may not be used to "undermine
 the foundations of the Socialist revolution." All print media
 are published either by the Government or the party, and all
 journalists are government employees. The distribution of
 foreign-newspapers and magazines is controlled.
 Some foreign publications are available in small quantities.
 However, the French-language weekly Jeune Afrique is
 proscribed, and the French daily Le Monde is occasionally
 seized. A French journalist was expelled from the country in
 November 1986 following her reporting on the rioting in
 Constantine and Setif. Radio and television stations are also
 government controlled. The Government does not permit
 criticism of its authority, the one-party system, or Algerian
 foreign policy. Criticism of specific domestic programs and
 policies, corruption and inefficiency in government, and even
 to some extent the Socialist system is allowed, including on
 state-run television and in the weekly organ of the ruling FLN
 party, Revolution Africaine.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 All nongovernment associations must be approved by state
 authorities who have traditionally refused to recognize groups
 with political, economic, or social views that differ from
 those of the FLN. However, an important reform of the Law on
 Associations, which was passed in July, permits citizens,
 organizations to begin functioning without obtaining advance
 approval from the Ministry of Interior. Approval is supposed
 to be rout'ae',except for associations concerned with
 politically sdnsitive matters or involving foreigners. It
 remains to be seen whether the liberalized law will lead to a
 flourishing of citizens' associations, but the new, officially
 recognized Algerian League of Human Rights already has set a
 precedent as the first important association allowed to exist
 outside of the FLN structure and control.
 Theie is only one legal political party and one labor union,
 the General Union of Algerian Workers (UGTA). These and other
 mass organizations for youth, women, farmers, veterans, and
 professional groups are all tightly controlled by the party
 and constitute the primary government-recognized associations.
 They play key political roles in mobilizing popular support
 
 
 1104
 ALGERIA
 for various government programs and elections and maintain
 relations with recognized international bodies in their
 fields, such as the International Labor Organization.
 Workers and employers-do not have the right to organize
 independent unions. Strikes are illegal in the public sector,
 but workers have successfully used strikes and work stoppages,
 without sanction of the national union, to win more pay and
 protectbenefits. Most labor-management disputes, however-,
 are solved by union representatives and labor ministry
 inspectors meeting with managers. While collective bargaining
 in the strict Western:sense is not practiced, the UGTA does
 engage in industry-wide negotiations on behalf of workers
 under its umbrella, and workers'are -represented on the
 management bodies of state enterprises.
 Although individuals are technically free to assemble,
 security personnel -watch public gatherings closely, and all
 nonparty associations must receive government recognition to
 exist legally. There have been no demonstrations involving
 illegal organized opposition groups, such as Berber or Islamic
 fundamentalists, for the past several years. As noted above,
 serious rioting occurred in Constantine and Setif in November
 1986,-during which mobs attacked government and party
 installations over a 3-day period. The rioters were
 reportedly angered by alleged police repression of student
 demonstrations and by shortages of basic food items connected
 with the economic downturn.
 Some very limited political opposition, such as student
 demonstrations, is tolerated. Opposition political tracts are
 sometimes circulated, almost certainly with official
 knowledge, but persons caught with them may be subject to
 arrest.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Legally an Islamic state Algeria pr~tects the rights of the
 very small Christian and Jewish populations to worship in
 their churches and synagogues. There is little evidence of
 individual prejudice. The Christian clergy directs its
 activities to the non-Muslim, non-Algerian community.
 The Islamic clergy is government trained. Friday sermons are
 not formally censored, but government monitoring constrains
 the clergy's freedom of expression. However, rampant mosque
 construction, largely financed by private donations, has
 overtaxed the Government's ability to provide trained imams
 and thus to control proceedings within all the country's
 mosques. The yearly pilgrimage to Mecca is government
 organized.
 The Muslim Brotherhood is banned, and its members reportedly
 are subject to police harassment. This group is rooted in a
 centuries-old tradition of North African mysticism and has
 been used as a vehicle for propagating fundamentalist ideas
 such as the creation of an Islamic-state in Algeria that would
 subordinate secular authority to that of religious leaders.
 Fundamentalists responsible for an attack on a police academy
 outside Algiers in August 1985 were arrested and placed on
 trial in the State Security Court in June after their leader,
 Mustapha Bouiali, was killed in a shoot-out with police in
 January 1987. The 208 defendants denied charges of plotting
 the armed overthrow of the State or of assisting group leaders
 who committed violent acts. One hundred and ninety-five were
 
 
 1105
 
 ALGERIA
 convicted and received sentences ranging from 10 months to 20
 years in prison; three alleged group leaders were sentenced to
 death. There is no indication whether these death sentences
 will be carried out.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom to travel within Algeria and abroad and to emigrate is
 provided for by law and generally is respected in practice.
 One of the first acts of the Bendjedid Government was to
 remove the exit visa requirement. Government permission,
 however, is necessary to travel to Morocco and difficult to
 obtain. Men who are 19 years or older must have proof of
 completion of mandatory 2-year military service, and employees
 of state organizations who are paying back educational
 scholarships through work must have valid leave papers to exit
 the country. Passports may sometimes take months to acquire,
 although this situation is improving. The amount of hard
 currency which Algerians may carry abroad (the equivalent of
 $200 once every 4 years) remains the primary limitation on
 foreign travel.
 Except for foreign diplomats, who must apply for permission to
 travel farther than 50 kilometers from Algiers, travel within
 Algeria is generally unrestricted, except in areas designated
 as "military zones." Visitors must register with the police
 if they are staying overnight in a locality. Gendarmerie
 checkpoints in the countryside routinely inspect vehicle
 registrations and occasionally search vehicles. The
 50-kilometer limit for diplomats is not strictly enforced, and
 permission to travel farther is quickly granted upon
 application.
 The Constitution providds for the right of political asylum.
 It is estimated that more than 100,000 refugees from the
 Western Sahara live in camps in southwestern Algeria. They
 are largely supported by the Government and, to a much lesser
 extent, by the United Nations Migh Commissioner for Refugees.
 Algeria continues to provide refuge and support to an
 estimated 11,000-12,000 drought victims from Niger and Mali
 located in 4 camps near Tamanrasset. The Algerian Government
 has been discussing with the Niger and Mali Governments and
 with international organizations the conditions for returning
 these remaining drought victims to their countries of origin.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Major political decisions are made by the top leadership of
 the party, Government, and military, all three headed by
 President Bendjedid. The political process is confined to the
 single party, which significantly limits deviation from the
 path prescribed by ruling authorities. Basic policy decisions
 are not strictly questioned, but popular grievances are aired
 within the party organization. Some diversity of views is
 -also evident in the national popular assembly, the provincial
 and local councils, and the government-controlled press. The
 National Assembly, whose members are all nominated to run for
 election by the FLN, has begun to assert itself in recent
 years by modifying in a conservative direction key aspects of
 government-sponsored reform legislation.
 
 
 1106
 ALGERIA
 There is .universal adult suffrage. All candidates for public
 office are nominated by the party, but voters usually have a
 choice among two or more candidates.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Algerian Government does not readily discuss its human
 rights record with outside governmental or nongovernmental
 organizations. The Government's recognition in April 1987 of
 a human rights league composed of respected figures in the
 fields of law, medicine, religion, journalism, and diplomacy,
 however, indicates an official interest in human rights
 questions, which will be tested over time.
 The Government released from prison or house arrest all
 members of Ali Yahia Abdennour's unsanctioned human rights
 league, but has continued to refuse to recognize the group
 because of its alleged involvement in opposition political
 activities. Abdennour himself, moreover, has still not
 received permission to travel outside the country. The
 Paris-based International Federation for Human Rights
 recognized the Abdennour group in December 1986 and criticized
 the official Algerian League of Human Rights at the time of
 its creation in April as not being independent from the
 Government. However, the new League has scored important
 successes in its first months of existence, obtaining the
 release of some 300 prisoners, and it is now preparing studies
 on prison conditions and on incommunicado detention. It is
 not yet clear to what extent its activities will be tolerated
 by the Government.
 Representatives of Amnesty International attended trials in
 the State Security Court in Medea during 1987. Algeria
 participates in U.N. and regional human rights forums.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 It does not appear that minority groups are treated unfairly
 in terms of their access to jobs, housing, education, and
 health care. The Government's difficulties in meeting these
 social needs are mostly linked to the country's extremely
 rapid population growth, and minorities seem to fare no better
 or worse than the Arab majority under these circumstances.
 The Government has given extra attention to building houses,
 schools, and municipal infrastructure in Berber regions, and
 the rate of school attendance among Berbers is higher than in
 most other parts of the country. Nevertheless, Berber ethnic
 consciousness remains strong and is fueled mostly by Berbers'
 desire to preserve their distinctive cultural identity and
 language in the face of the Government's emphasis on the
 development of Algeria's Arab identity. Berber spokesmen
 assert that the Government seeks to repress the distinct
 Berber cultUre.
 Women ,enjoy equality under the law, but there are exceptions.
 For example, the 1984 family code permits male polygamy, makes
 it more difficult for a woman than a man to obtain a divorce,
 and awards only 4 months of alimony to the woman in the event
 of divorce, regardless of the husband's means and the
 circumstances under which the divorce was obtained. Both
 culture and tradition make it difficult for women to follow an
 independent path; a woman remains throughout her life under
 
 
 1107
 ALGERIA
 the legal "tutelage" of a man, regardless of her age or civil
 status. About 250,000 Algerian women work outside the home,
 and an increasing number are trained and employed in the more
 liberal professions. Two women are members of the party's
 Central Committee; one is a state minister, and women serve in
 the armed forces. Elections to the National Assembly in
 February produced a decline in the number of female deputies
 from 10 to 6, although 60 women ran for seats in the
 295-member Assembly.
 The literacy rate in Arabic or French (or both) among males
 over the age of 9 is 65 percent and only 40 percent for
 females in the same category. However, an effort has been
 made to close the gap separating women from men in education.
 According to government statistics, 72 percent of all
 school-age girls were enrolled in 1985. The rate of female
 school attendance fluctuates widely from urban centers to
 conservative rural areas. Algeria also has launched a
 nationwide program encouraging proper spacing of pregnancies
 as a means of safeguarding a mother's health, improving infant
 care, and reducing the high population growth rate. The
 program provides free access to contraceptives and counseling
 on a voluntary basis. Abortion is illegal.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Alqeria's 1978 General Workers' Statute provides for a normal
 workweek not to exceed 44 hours, a full 24-hour rest period,
 and a minimum wage. It prohibits employment of persons under
 16 years of age. The statute also sets out minimum worker
 safety standards and standardizes pay according to the work
 performed. Although the law has not yet been fully
 implemented in all economic sectors, most of its provisions
 are respected.
