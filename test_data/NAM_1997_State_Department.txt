 NAMIBIA
 Namibia is a multiparty, multiracial democracy with an independent judiciary.
 President Sam Nujoma, leader of the South West Africa People's Organization
 (SWAPO), won Namibia's first free elections in November 1989. President Nujoma
 and the SWAPO party received just over 70 percent of the vote in the December
 1994 Presidential and National Assembly elections, which, despite some irregular-
 ities, were generally regarded as free and fair. Although the Constitution limits the
 President to two terms in office, in May the SWAPO party congress recommended
 that the Constitution be amended to permit President Nujoma to run for a third
 term in 1999.
 The police, supervised by the Ministry of Home Affairs, and the Namibian De-
 fense Force (NDF), supervised by the Ministry of Defense, share responsibility for
 internal security. The civilian authorities maintain effective control over the secu-
 rity forces, although members of the police force committed some human rights
 abuses.
 Namibia's modern market sector produces most of its wealth, while a traditional
 subsistence agricultural sector (mainly in the north) supports most of its labor force.

 The principal exports are diamonds and other minerals, cattle, and fish. Mining,
 ranching, and fishing-the mainstays of the market sector-are still largely con-
 trolled by white Namibians and foreign interests. Government policy, however, is to
 "Namibianize" the increasingly important fishing sector, so that more indigenous
 entrepreneurs are able to participate, and to provide opportunities for black
 Namibians in the potentially lucrative and labor-intensive tourism industry. Per
 capita annual gross domestic product is $1,860. There remains, however, a wide dis-
 parity between income levels of blacks and whites. Whites have an average per cap-
 ita income of $14,000 a year and many of the poorest blacks earn just $65 a year.
 The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, although
 there were problems in several areas. There continued to be credible reports that
 police beat or otherwise abused criminal suspects. Using an apartheid-era law, the
 President attempted to ban public demonstrations that did not have prior police ap-
 proval. Police in the north broke up a private meeting between attorneys and their
 ethnic minority clients. The ruling party voted to amend the local election law in
 a manner that favored the ruling party's chances in local elections. In addition, the
 President and other high government and ruling party officials made repeated, well-
 publicized verbal attacks on the independent press. The Government rejected a re-
 quest by the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission to hold hearings
 in Namibia and still refuses to provide a full accounting of missing detainees who
 were in SWAPO camps before independence. Namibian defense forces admitted to
 seven cases of extrajudicial killings since 1994 along the northern border with An-
 gola. Prison conditions remain harsh, and a large court backlog continues to lead
 to lengthy delays of trials.
 Although violence against women and children, including rape and child abuse,
 continue to be serious problems, the President, members of his Cabinet, and par-
 liamentarians have spoken out forcefully on these problems which are receiving sig-
 nificant attention at all levels of government. Women married under customary law,
 however, continue to experience serious legal and cultural discrimination. Relatively
 little has been done to elevate women to high-level positions in government and the
 ruling party despite promises by the President to nominate more women. Racial and
 ethnic discrimination and glaring disparities -especially in education, health, em-
 ployment, and working conditions-continued despite sustained efforts by the Gov-
 ernment to reduce them. Discrimination against indigenous people persists, and the
 problem was exacerbated during the year by governmental actions involving
 Bushmen.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 After repeated prodding by a local nongovernmental organization (NGO), in July
 the Government admitted that since 1994, seven civilians had been killed by Na-
 mibian security forces along the northern border with Angola. The admission came
 after the Namibian Defense Force and the Ministry of Defense conducted an inves-
 tigation into charges that over a thousand civilians had disappeared along the Ango-
 lan border (see Section 1.b.). One NDF officer was charged with murder and another
 was found guilty of culpable homicide. Investigations into the other killings were on-
 going.
 b. Disappearance.-While there were no reports of politically motivated disappear-
 ances, a local NGO charged that more than 1,500 persons disappeared along the
 northern border with Angola after being deported by-Namibian security forces. This
 charge has not been substantiated, and an investigation by the Ministry of Defense
 found that seven civilians had been killed by Namibian Security Forces (see Section
 L.a.). Human rights organizations, political parties, and the public continued to call
 for a full accounting of unexplained disappearances of persons detained by SWAPO
 prior to independence. In August 1996, President Nujoma released the long-prom-
 ised, official SWAPO memorial book, known as the Heroes Book, which lists the
 names of nearly 8,000 people who died during the liberation struggle. Local human
 rights organizations harshly criticized the book, characterizing it as an unconvincing
 cover-up and declaring that the listing is fraught with inaccuracies and omissions
 regarding those who died or disappeared in SWAPO detention camps.
 SWAPO was again viewed widely in 1997 as having failed to deal forthrightly
 with the missing detainee issue. In May the Government formally rejected a request
 by the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission to hold hearings in Na-
 mibia. Such a hearing might have shed light on disappearances that occurred on
 both sides during the liberation struggle. While some of the Government's critics
 
 
 243
 would be satisfied with an official apology for SWAPO abuses against these detain-
 ees, others are pressing for full accountability through a truth commission, prosecu-
 tions, and convictions.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution provides that "no persons shall be subject to torture or to cruel,
 inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment." There were published newspaper
 reports, however, that members of the police beat or otherwise abused civilians, ei-
 ther during arrest or in police station houses in the northern towns of Oshakati,
 Ombalantu, and Omungwelume. Twenty-five official complaints of police brutality
 were recorded as of July. According to human rights organizations, there has been
 an increase in the number of reported cases of police brutality, and the problem re-
 mains particularly acute in northern areas. One human rights advocate noted that
 the increase in reported cases of brutality was likely due in part to growing public
 awareness of citizens' rights and a willingness to report such cases. The Attorney
 General has ordered a full investigation of these complaints.
 Prison conditions are harsh, and during the year there was at least one case of
 a prisoner being murdered by fellow inmates in a crowded cell. Human rights orga-
 nizations continued to complain about prison overcrowding. In March 1995, the Gov-
 ernment created a Ministry of Prisons and Correctional Services, charged with ad-
 ministering the country's prisons and jails. The Ministry emphasizes correctional
 and rehabilitation functions, including vocational training, and has made some con-
 crete progress. The Government is also making efforts to separate youthful offenders
 from adult criminals, although in many remote and rural areas juveniles continue
 to be held with adults.
 The Government continued to grant NGO's and diplomatic officials regular access
 to prisons and prisoners.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution forbids arbitrary arrest
 or detention, and the Government generally respected these provisions in practice.
 According to the Constitution, persons who are arrested must be informed of the
 reason for their arrest and must be brought before a magistrate within 48 hours
 of their detention. The accused are entitled to defense by legal counsel of their
 choice, and those who cannot afford a lawyer are entitled to state-provided counsel.
 In practice, however, many accused persons in remote and rural areas are not le-
 gally represented, primarily due to resource constraints. A trial must take place
 within "a reasonable time," or the accused must be released. Human rights organi-
 zations criticized the length of time that pretrial detainees were held, which
 stretched up to 1 year in many cases while investigations were pending.
 Some traditional leaders reportedly continued to detain and imprison persons ac-
 cused of minor offenses without recourse to police or judicial review. The Govern-
 ment continued training traditional leaders on the legal limits of their authority.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice.
 The formal court system has three levels: 30 magistrates' courts, the High Court,
 and the Supreme Court. The latter also serves as the court of appeals and as a con-
 stitutional review court.
 Most rural Namibians first encounter the legal system through the traditional
 courts, which deal with minor criminal offenses, such as petty theft and infractions
 of local customs, among members of the same ethnic group. A special commission,
 created to make recommendations on the prospective jurisdiction of traditional
 courts, concluded that traditional cultural practices and structures should be main-
 tained, provided that they were consistent with constitutional protections and exist-
 ing laws. The Traditional Authorities Act delineates which offenses may be dealt
 with under the traditional system.
 The constitutional right to a fair trial, with a presumption of innocence until prov-
 en guilty, is generally afforded.by the judiciary. However, long delays in hearing
 cases in the regular courts and problems associated with the traditional system
 limit this right in practice.
 The lack of qualified magistrates, other court officials, and private attorneys has
 resulted in a serious backlog of criminal cases, which often translated into long
 delays of up to a year or more between arrest and trial. Many of those awaiting
 trial are treated as convicted criminals. This practice contravenes Namibia constitu-
 tional provisions for the right to a speedy trial.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides all citizens with the right to privacy and requires arresting
 officers to secure a judicial warrant before conducting a search. Government au-
 
 
 244
 
 thorities respected these rights in practice, and violations were subject to legal ac-
 tion.
 Under the Central Intelligence Service bill passed by the National Assembly in
 July, this agency is authorized to conduct wiretaps, intercept mail, and engage in
 other covert activities, both inside and outside the country in the interests of na-
 tional security. Wiretaps and other forms of covert surveillance, however, require
 the consent of a judge.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government generally respected these rights.
 Reporters for independent newspapers criticize the Government openly and do not
 engage in self-ensorship. During the year, there was a series of attacks on the pri-
 vate media by the President, the Prime Minister, and other members of the Govern-
 ment. These attacks included charges that the independent press was 'Toreign
 owned" and "an enemy press." While such charges may have been calculated to
 quiet criticism, they do not appear to have had any impact on the aggressive style
 of the independent media.
 The government-owned Naxnibian Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) operates most
 radio and television services. NBC provided significant coverage to opposition points
 of view. Same believe that NBC reporters exercise self-censorship on certain con-
 troversial issues, such as the question of missing detainees and the issue of a third
 term for President Nujoma. Despite these complaints, NBC is generally balanced in
 its reporting.
 There are three private radio stations, one private television station in the town
 of Rehoboth, and a private cable and satellite television service that broadcasts
 Cable News Network, British Broadcasting Corporation, and a range of South Afri-
 can and international news and entertainment programs. Therare no restrictions
 on the private ownership of satellite dishes.
 On October 28, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MOIB) issued new
 regulations that require foreign journalists seeking to visit Namibia to provide 1
 month's advance notice to the MOIB, stating the purpose of their proposed visit.
 Journalists are required to schedule appointments with government officials
 through the MO E and request permission to visit areas under the control of the
 Ministry of Environment and Tourism. Additionally, journalists must obtain a tem-
 porary work permit from the Ministry of Home Affairs. There were no reports of
 complaints from journalists.
 The Government respects academic freedom. During the year there were numer-
 ous seminars held at universities and other venues in Windhoek on controversial
 issues.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Associatipn.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association.
 While in the past the Government has generally respected these rights in prac-
 tice, in July the President announced a ban on all public demonstrations that did
 not have prior police approval. This ban was based on an apartheid-era law. The
 ban was selectively enforced in late July when police in the northern town of
 Okanguati broke up private meetings between a public interest law firm and its cli-
 ents, Himba tribesmen opposed to the construction of the Epupa Dam, which the
 Government supports (see Section 5). In August the High Court struck down the
 1989 law used by the President to justify the ban. The Government plans to appeal.
 During the year various organizations, including political parties, religious
 groups, women's organizations, students, and unemployed and former combatants
 held large meetings and public gatherings without interference.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 pat riation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice. The Government cooperates with the United Nations High
 Commssioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and UNHCR officials have observed a
 marked improvement in the Government's refugee policy. The Government's eligi-
 bility committee has met on a regular basis to consider asylum requests. Refugee
 status has been accorded to a number of asylum seekers, andthose rejected are gen-
 erally not being deported. There were no reports of forced expulsion of those having
 a valid claim to refugee status, although illegal immigrants are often detained in
 prisons for long periods of time before being deported.
 Namibia is a first asylum country and continues to permit asylum seekers to
 enter the country. There are presently more than 2,200 refugees and asylum seekers
 at Osire camp, 90 percent of whom are from Angola. The re re from the Demo-
 
 
 cratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania and other African coun-
 tries. Asylum seekers are interviewed by government officials, and those granted
 refugee status are permitted to work and attend school including the University of
 Namibia. Schools have been established at the Osire refugee camp. Residents are
 free to leave the unfenced facility, and many travel to Windhoek and other towns
 on personal business and to sell handicrafts. On November 29, 129 Angolan refugees
 were voluntarily repatriated to Angola. There were no credible reports that persons
 were forcibly returned to a country where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercised this right for the second time in December 1994 in what observ-
 ers generally agreed, despite some irregularities, to be free and fair presidential and
 parliamentary elections. The Government printed and distributed useful and in-
 ormative voter guides with lists of government and opposition candidates and re-
 quested international election observers. There were televised debates, and the op-
 position parties were able to campaign freely. Two new parties were established
 during the year.
 The Constitution establishes a bicameral parliament and provides for general
 elections every 5 years and regional elections every 6 years. Incumbent President
 Sam Nujoma was reelected to a second 5-year term of office during the country's
 first postindependence elections for the National Assembly and Presidency in De-
 cember 1994. Although the Constitution limits the President to two terms, in May
 the ruling SWAPO party's national congress recommended that the Constitution be
 amended to permit President Nujoma to serve a third term.
 The ruling SWAPO party holds 53 of the 72 elected National Assembly seats, the
 Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA, the major opposition party) has 15 seats, and
 three smaller parties occupy a total of 4 seats. Members of the National Assembly
 are elected on a party list system on a proportional basis.
 In April the ruling SWAO party voted to changed the voting procedure, under
 the Local Authorities Act, for local elections to be held early next year. The change
 required local elections to be held on a party list instead of a ward system. It is
 generally believed that the party list system favors the ruling SWAPO party, al-
 though SWAPO claimed that it amended the law to promote more female candidates
 and because wards could not be delineated in time for the scheduled elections. Op-
 position members walked out of Parliament in protest when SWAPO used its over-
 whelming majority to amend the Local Authorities Act.
 Women are increasingly involved in the political process but remain seriously
 underrepresented despite promises by SWAPO to increase the number of women on
 the party's appointed central committee. There are 2 female ministers and 3 female
 deputy ministers out of a total of 42 ministerial and deputy ministerial positions.
 In addition, two women hold cabinet-level positions, as Director of the Department
 of Women Affairs in the Office of the President and Director of the National Plan-
 ning Commission, and another woman serves as Ombudswoman. Women hold 15 of
 98 parliamentary seats in the National Assembly and National Council. In 1996 fe-
 male legislators formed a Women's Caucus in Parliament to review legislation for
 ender sensitivity. Historic economic and educational disadvantages have served to
 imit the participation of the indigenous San ethnic group in politics, although vir-
 tually all of Namibia's other ethnic minorities are represented in Parliament and
 the Cabinet.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local nongovernmental organizations, such as the National Society for Human
 Rights (NSHR) and the Legal Assistance Center, the Breaking the Walls of Silence
 Movement, and those working with the Himbas in opposition to the Epupa Dam,
 freely criticized the Government's handling of the SWAPO detainee issue, the ban
 on public demonstrations, misconduct by security forces along the border, and dis-
 crimination against women and indigenous ethnic groups. In addition, other human
 rights organizations such as the Media Institute for Southern Africa, the Center for
 Applied Social Sciences, and the Human Rights Documentation Center worked
 openly on a variety of human rights issues affecting the.press, women, ethnic mi-
 norities, and other groups.
 Although no specific grounds were made public, the Government briefly ques-
 tioned the admission of the National Society for Human Rights to consultative sta-
 tus in the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), but in February
 it decided not to prevent the NGO from associating with the U.N. body.
 
 
 246
 
 Representatives of international human rights organizations traveled to Namibia
 and discussed human rights issues with governmental and nongovernmental rep-
 resentatives.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, creed, gender, or religion,
 and specifically prohibits "the practice and ideology of apartheid." Over the past
 year, there was a significant improvement in the attention paid to women's issues
 and the rights of the disabled.
 Women.-Violence against women, including beating and rape, is widespread. Tra-
 ditional attitudes regarding the subordination of women exacerbate problems of sex-
 ual and domestic violence. In 1997, however, there was a dramatic improvement in
 the attention paid to the problems of rape and domestic violence. Government min-
 isters joined in public protests against violence. The President, members of his Cabi-
 net, and parliamentarians spoke out forcefully against violence and called for longer
 prison sentences for sexual offenders. Model rape legislation, prepared by the Wom-
 en's Law Reform and Development Commission, was introduced in Parliament.
 Courts handed down longer prison sentences to convicted rapists, and police confirm
 that more women were coming forward to report cases of rape and domestic vio-
 lence. Centers for abused    women   and   children  in  Oshakati, Windhoek,
 Keetmanshoop, Walvis Bay, and Rehoboth are staffed with specially trained female
 police officers to assist victims of sexual assaults.
 In 1996 the President elevated the head of the Department of Women Affairs to
 cabinet rank. The passage in that year of the Married Persons Equality Act also
 eliminated discriminatory practices against women married under civil law. Women
 married in customary (traditional) marriages continue to face legal and cultural dis-
 crimination. During the year, Oshiwambo chiefs denounced traditional practices
 that permit family members to confiscate the property of deceased men from their
 widows and children. Efforts are underway to address this issue and the problem
 has been considerably reduced.
 Children.-The Constitution enumerates children's rights, including those in the
 area of education and health. The Government devotes 31 percent of the national
 budget to education and an additional 15 to 20 percent towards health. In practice,
 however, outmoded policies and laws and an untrained work force lead to inad-
 equate attention to child welfare. Many San children do not attend school, and it
 is difficult for the Government to afford basic protections to children living on re-
 mote commercial farms.
 Child abuse is a serious and increasingly acknowledged problem. The authorities
 vigorously prosecuted cases involving crimes against children, particularly rape and
 incest. One particularly heinous sexual assault on a baby was widely publicized in
 the media and led to a national outcry against the problem of sexual attacks on chil-
 dren. Courts are handing down stiffer sentences against child rapists and the Gov-
 ernment is providing training for police officials to improve the handling of child sex
 abuse cases. Centers for abused women and children are actively working to reduce
 the trauma suffered by abused children.
 The Government is expanding programs to separate juvenile offenders from adults
 in the criminal justice system.
 People With Disabilities.-While discrimination on the basis of disability is not ad-
 dressed in the Constitution, the Labor Act of 1992 prohibits discrimination against
 disabled persons in employment. However, enforcement in this area is weak.
 The Government does not legally require special access to public buildings for the
 disabled, and many ministries remain inaccessible to the disabled. Some municipal
 governments, however, have installed ramps and special curbing for the disabled at
 street crossings.
 Indigenous People.-The Bushmen, also known as the San people, the country's
 earliest known inhabitants, historically have been exploited by other ethnic groups.
 While the Government has taken a number of measures to end this societal dis-
 crimination against the San, including seeking their advice about proposed legisla-
 tion on communally held lands and increasing their access to primary education, lit-
 tle has been done to bring San representatives into the Government.
 By law all indigenous groups are able to participate equally in decisions affecting
 their lands, cultures, traditions, and allocations of natural resources. Nevertheless,
 the Bushmen and other indigenous citizens have been unable to exercise fully these
 rights as a result of minimal access to education and economic opportunities under
 colonial rule, coupled with their relative isolation in remote areas of the country.
 In January authorities arrested 73 members of the Hai//om Bushmen community
 for blocking the gates to a national game park. The Bushmen were protesting in
 
 
 247
 support of the return of their ancestral lands which had been seized in order to cre-
 ate the park. The Hai//om maintained that their previous requests to discuss the
 case with government officials had been ignored. The protesters were released on
 bail, and later in the year the case was dropped.
 In April the Government unilaterally announced plans to expand a prison in the
 West Caprivi Game Park on land claimed by the Kxoe ethnic group. The expansion
 would deny access by members of the Kxoe ethnic group to revenues from commu-
 nity-based tourism projects on their lands. There is some question, however, regard-
 ing the Kxoe's right to occupy that land. The project was an important mechanism
 for empowering the Kxoe to benefit from tourism activities in their community.
 The Government's plans to build a dam on the Kunene river that would flood an-
 cestral graves and grazing areas of the seminomadic Himba people proved con-
 troversial. The Government has made repeated efforts to consult with Himba lead-
 ers regarding the project, but many of the Himba chiefs remain adamantly opposed
 to the project. Namibian leaders have harshly criticized those opposed to the project,
 terming them "enemies of development" In July police in Okanguati broke up a pri-
 vate meeting between Himba chiefs and their lawyers (see Section 2.b.).
 The Traditional Authorities Act, which came into effect in December 1995, defines
 the role, duties, and powers of traditional leaders. The act provides that customary
 law that is inconsistent with provisions of the Constitution is invalid and it enumer-
 ates the types of crimes that may be dealt with in traditional courts. The act assigns
 to traditional leaders the role of guardians of culture and tradition, and also man-
 dates that traditional leaders elected to Parliament choose between their traditional
 and elected offices before the end of 1996. This provision has not been enforced, and
 several traditional leaders remain in Parliament.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.The Constitution prohibits discrimination
 based on race and other factors and specifically prohibits "the practice and ideology
 of apartheid." Nevertheless, as a result of more than 70 years of South African ad-
 ministration, societal, racial, and ethnic discrimination persists, and some apart-
 heid-based statutes have not yet been repealed or replaced by the Parliament. Many
 nonwhites continued to complain that the Government was not moving quickly
 enough in education, health, housing, employment, and access to land.
 Some opposition parties, including members of the Herero and Nama ethnic
 groups, also complained that the SWAPO-led Government provided more develop-
 ment assistance to the numerically dominant Ovambo ethnic group of far northern
 Namibia than to other groups or regions of the country. Nevertheless, members of
 smaller ethnic groups hold prominent government posts, including the offices of the
 Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the Speak-
 er of the National Assembly. In June leaders of the 'Baster" community in Rehoboth
 reconciled with the Government and dropped their demand that the Government re-
 turn the community's "traditional lands" which had reverted to the central Govern-
 ment upon independence.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for freedom of association,
 including freedom to form and join trade unions. The 1992 Labor Act extended that
 right to public servants, farm workers, and domestic employees. Trade unions have
 no difficulty registering, and there are no government restrictions on who may serve
 as a union official. No union has been dissolved by government action. During the
 year, the Namibian public service held vigorously contested union elections.
 Unions are independent of Government and may form federations. The two prin-
 cipal trade union umbrella organizations are the National Union of Namibian Work-
 ers (NUNW), and the Namibia People's Social Movement (NPSM). The larger
 NUNW continues to maintain its strong affiliation with the ruling SWAPO party.
 Roughly half of the wage sector is organized to some degree, although less than 20
 percent of full-time wage earners are organized.
 Except for workers providing essential services (e.g., jobs related to public health
 and safety) and workers in the nascent export processing zones (EPZ's), workers
 enjoy the right to strike once conciliation procedures have been exhausted. Under
 the Labor Act, strike action can only be used in disputes involving specific worker
 interests, such as pay raises. Disputes over worker rights, including dismissals,
 must be referred to a labor court (which is convened when needed in the existing
 magisterial districts) for arbitration. The Labor Act protects legally striking workers
 from unfair dismissal.
 Unemployment, which is nearly 40 percent, remained a significant problem in Na-
 mibia, affecting largely the black majority. Apartheid-era attitudes among some em-
 ployers contributed to a divisive, 10-week strike at a major mining firm. While the
 
 
 atmosphere at the three mine sites was tense and occasionally violent, the con-
 frontation was eventually defused by high-level government intervention.
 Trade unions are free to exchange visits with foreign trade unions and to affiliate
 with international trade union organizations. Unions have exercised this right with-
 out interference. The American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organi-
 zations, through its African-American Labor Center representative in South Africa,
 provided technical assistance to the NUNW during regular visits to Namibia.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The 1992 Labor Act provides
 employees with the right to bargain individually or collectively. Collective bargain-
 ing is not widely practiced outside the mining and construction industries; wages
 are usually set by employers. As unions become more active, however, informal col-
 lective bargaining is becoming more common.
 The Labor Act provides a process for employer recognition of trade unions and
 protection for members and organizers. The law also empowers the labor court to
 remedy unfair labor practices and explicitly forbids unfair dismissals, which may be
 appealed to the labor court.
 The Labor Act applies to the prospective EPZ in Walvis Bay. A compromise on
 this point was reached by the Government and NUNW representatives in August
 1995. However, trade unionists continued to challenge the constitutionality of the
 compromise because it precludes strikes and lockouts. Under the compromise, labor-
 related issues in the EPZ would be referred to a special EPZ Dispute Settlement
 Panel, composed of employers and workers, for expeditious resolution. With only a
 few businesses operating in the Walvis Bay EPZ, the effectiveness of this com-
 promise in securing the rights of workers in the EPZ could not yet be determined.
 c. Prohi bition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced and bonded labor of adults
 and children is prohibited by law. During the year there were ongoing reports in
 the media that farm and domestic workers often receive inadequate compensation
 for their labor and are subject to strict control by employers. Ministry of Labor in-
 .spectors sometimes encountered problems in gaining access to the country's large,
 privately owned commercial farms in order to document possible Labor Code viola-
 tions.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Gov-
 ernment prohibits forced and bonded labor by children (see Section 6.c.). Under the
 1992 Labor Act, the minimum age for employment is 14 years, with higher age re-
 quirements for certain sectors such as mining, construction, and night work. Min-
 istry of Labor inspectors generally enforce minimum age regulations, but children
 below the age of 14 often work on family and commercial farms, and in the informal
 sector. A 1991 census report on the status of children estimates that 13,800 children
 under 15 years of age are already in the labor force. Of these, 41 percent are work-
 ing as unpaid laborers on family and commercial farms. Boys in rural areas tradi-
 tionally start herding livestock at the age of 7. According to 1991 figures, approxi-
 mately 2 percent of farm workers are children (mainly from the San ethnic group).
 There were also reports that Angolan and Zambian children, who are not protected
 by the Labor Act, worked on communal and cattle farms in border areas.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no statutory minimum wage law. In
 Windhoek's nonwhite townships, many workers and their families have difficulty
 maintaining a minimally decent standard of living. White citizens earn significantly
 more on average than do black citizens, in large part because whites own most of
 the country's productive resources and have had access to education that enables
 them to take advantage of the skilled labor shortage.
 After independence the standard legal workweek was reduced from 46 to 45
 hours, and includes at least one 24-hour rest period per week. An employer may re-
 quire no more than 10 hours per week of overtime. The law mandates 24 consecu-
 tive days of annual leave, at least 30 workdays of sick leave per year, and 3 months
 of unpaid maternity leave. In practice, however, these provisions are not yet rigor-
 ously observed or enforced by the Ministry of Labor. In 1996 two important NGO
 studies-one of farm workers and the other of domestic employees-highlighted the
 dismal conditions which some employees encounter while working in these occupa-
 tions.
 The Government mandates occupational health and safety standards. The Labor
 Act empowers the President to enforce them through inspections and criminal pen-
