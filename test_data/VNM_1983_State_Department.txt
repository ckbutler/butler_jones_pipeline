 VIETNAM
 
 The Socialist Republic of Vietnam is a Communist dictatorship
 dominated by an aging leadership whose primary policies for
 decades have been pursued through armed struggle. The Vietnam
 Workers' (Communist) Party came to power in North Vietnam in
 1954, following the Geneva Conference that resulted in
 partition of the country after a long war of independence from
 France. North Vietnam launched an armed effort to take over
 the Republic of Vietnam in the South in the early 1960's,
 culminating in 1975 with the victory of North Vietnam's
 military forces over the Republic of Vietnam. North Vietnamts
 long occupation of northern Laos with 50,000 of its own troops
 and its effort to organize and direct armed insurgency in that
 country also succeeded in 1975 with the takeover of Laos by a
 Communist leadership almost totally responsive to Hanoi.
 Vietnam's troops remain in Laos. At the end of 1978, with the
 southern part of Vietnam still not fully absorbed into the
 Communist system based in Hanoi, Vietnam responded to border
 clashes with neighboring Kampuchea by invading that country
 with a force of 200,000 men, establishing a long-term military
 occupation of Kampuchea, and installing a puppet goverment
 which remained under Vietnamese control in 1983. As a result
 of its invasion of Kampuchea, Vietnam in early 1979 had to
 resist a brief military incursion in its northern region by
 China.
 Although Vietnam's invasion of Kampuchea deposed the Khmer
 Rouge regime, one of the most brutally oppressive governments
 in history, its continued occupation of that country consti-
 tutes a major violation of the Khmer people's right to
 self-determination and self-rule. Reported human rights
 violations by the Vietnamese-installed puppet government
 include forced labor, denial of legal process, forced
 relocation, and arbitrary arrest.
 Vietnam continues to control virtually all policies and actions
 of the regime in Phnom Penh and thus bears heavy responsibility
 for its human rights violations. In addition, according to
 refugee reports, its occupation forces have arbitrarily
 imprisoned and even executed Khmer suspected of cooperation with
 Khmer resistance forces; instances of rape and looting by these
 forces also have been reported. In addition to the 150-170,000
 Vietnamese troops remaining in Kampuchea, Vietnamese domination
 has been further extended through possibly as many as several
 hundred thousand Vietnamese settlers introduced principally
 since 1982.
 Vietnamese forces have used lethal trichothecene toxins
 (commonly known as "yellow rain") and other combinations of
 chemical agents in Laos and Kampuchea, frequently against
 civilian populations, in violation of international law and
 agreements. In Laos the use of prohibited toxic agents appears
 to have declined in 1983. In Kampuchea the use of prohibited
 toxic agents appears to be at the same level as in 1982.
 Vietnam's invasion of Kampuchea has prevented Vietnam from
 devoting resources to reconstruction to heal the wounds of its
 earlier struggle to conquer the South. Instead, it has poured
 resources and people into Kampuchea on a large scale. At the
 same time, Vietnam's dispute with China, resulting partly from
 its Kampuchean venture, forces Vietnam to maintain a large army
 on its northern border.

 Vietnam's antipathy toward its ethnic Chinese minority, seen as
 a potential fifth column, resulted in the expulsion of about
 450,000 Sino-Vietnamese in 1978 and 1979.
 The human rights violations which typify daily life in Vietnam,
 as well as the Government's neglect of economic development in
 favor of maintaining an enormous military machine, have also
 led hundreds of thousands of ethnic Vietnamese to flee the
 country. Such escapes continued to occur in 1983, most often,
 as with the expulsions, in life-threatening circumstances,
 sometimes overland but mainly in small boats on the high seas
 in areas subject to brutal piracy.
 Fear of dissent and the desire to remake southern Vietnam in
 the totalitarian mold of the North have led to expansion of the
 already vast internal security apparatus, which attempts to
 control every facet of people's lives throughout the country
 and subjects those suspected of deviation to arbitrary arrest
 and detention. At the same time, the low incomes and severe
 inflation that result from Vietnam's stagnated economy have
 stimulated pervasive corruption, making the internal security
 bureaucracy a double burden on the Vietnamese people.
 Vietnam's backward agricultural system, hobbled by
 ideologically-based constraints, is barely able to feed its
 population of 57,000,000 at a level near subsistence despite
 recent record harvests. Food is rationed or highly priced on
 the limited free market. Renewed efforts to impose a socialist
 economic system on the conquered population in the South, with
 a different value system and of questionable loyalty to the
 current regime, threaten further to lower productivity.
 Vietnam's industrial plant is small and its debt burden high.
 Hanoi has formally denied civil rights as well as working
 papers and ration coupons to many of its citizens deemed
 politically unacceptable; many "reeducation camp" (penal labor
 camp) returnees and others unable to obtain officially
 sanctioned jobs are forced to live precariously in an
 underground economy, as the only other option left to them is
 moving to undesirable "new economic zones" in remote areas of
 the country. Many in the South depend for their survival on
 aid from relatives abroad, but government measures imposed in
 1983 have sharply reduced such aid.
 The Vietnamese citizen today is subject to arrest either for
 past association with the former government or for espousal of
 ideas contrary to Communist ideology. He has the obligation to
 vote, but all candidates are selected by the party. Despite
 legally guaranteed freedom of religion, many religious leaders
 have been imprisoned. The press is completely owned and
 controlled by the regime.
 There was no significant improvement in the state of human
 rights in Vietnam in 1983, and some signs of deterioration,
 while tho situation in Vietnamese-occupied Kampuchea also
 worsened. A draft penal code was published in August which
 holds some promise of beginning to regularize the judicial
 system. However, it does not prohibit the most important
 current abuses of human rights in Vietnam, most notably long
 term detention and imprisonment without charge in "reeducation
 camps." The Government in 1983 did, however, permit an
 
 
 899
 increasing number of persons to leave Vietnam through an
 "Orderly Departure Program" first established in 1979. By
 providing a sanctioned means to leave Vietnam, this policy has
 unquestionably cut down on the number of deaths at sea of "boat
 people" fleeing the country. In addition, controls over
 internal travel were ostensibly eased in September 1983, with
 only identity cards now required. However, identity cards are
 not issued to those released from reeducation camps or persons
 without fixed addresses, such as those who fled the "new
 economic zones."
 On the negative side, greater official attention to alleged
 antigovernment activities, particularly those associated with
 religious groups, suggests stricter surveillance by internal
 security organs and possibly greater restrictions on religion.
 In fact, Protestant churches, although not accused of anti-
 government activity, were subjected to new restrictions and
 harassment beginning in 1983.
 Furthermore, during 1983, the regime took new steps to restrict
 or eliminate portions of the private economy--a sector which
 had received some encouragement under policies adopted after
 the disastrous years of 1978-79. These new measures involved
 arbitrary procedures and caused economic hardship.  For
 example, utilizing confiscatory taxation and other restrictive
 measures, the Government has moved against many urban private
 enterprises in northern as well as southern Vietnam where they
 are often owned by ethnic Chinese. This campaign has the
 potential for increasing the number of persons fleeing Vietnam
 by boat. The recently renewed emphasis on collectivizing
 agriculture in the South has the potential for leading to human
 rights abuses as well as increasing economic hardship, even
 though cadre have been warned to avoid forcing the peasants
 into cooperatives. In fact, recent redistribution of land,
 pending collectivization, has already involved the confiscation
 of property.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 The Government admits that some individuals whom it considered
 "war criminals" were executed in the wake of the 1975 takeover.
 There are reports from refugees that many more persons, perhaps
 numbering in the thousands, were detained in rural areas in
 mid-1975 and never heard from again. The refugees assume they
 were killed, but their fate is unknown. In its 1983 human
 rights report on Vietnam, Amnesty International expressed
 concern about "an apparent tendency by the courts to pass death
 sentences more frequently than before" in 1982. Those executed
 include political offenders, and former "reeducation camp"
 inmates have reported executions for escape attempts and, on
 occasion, for resistance to camp authorities. Attacks by
 ethnic Vietnamese and minority groups resisting Vietnamese
 Government authority usually target People's Army of Vietnam
 units. Assassinations of government officials by these groups
 may sometimes occur but are not widespread.
 
 
 900
 b. Disappearance
 Although authorities may wait months before notifying relatives
 of detained persons, abductions by official or nonofficial
 organizations have not been reported in Vietnam in recent years.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Political prisoners in the "reeducation camps" are regularly
 provided food rations below subsistence levels, denied medical
 care, and assigned to hard labor. Prisoners are punished
 severely for minor infractions of camp rules, for example, by
 several months' solitary confinement and by beatings. These
 practices result in acute suffering, permanent physical
 impairment, and sometimes death. The detainees have
 indeterminate sentences and face the prospect of indefinite
 penal labor. There is widespread agreement among the reports
 from refugees in various geographical locations as to the
 severity of the camps. Most reeducation camps contain common
 criminals, as well as former officials and military officers of
 the Republic of Vietnam, many of them aged,and persons arrested
 on political suspicions since the Communists took over in 1975.
 The last two categories include chaplains and clergy from both
 Buddhist and Christian sects, intellectuals, and former
 political leaders.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Government continues to hold large numbers of people
 without charge or trial in the "reeducation camps," including
 both those whose former associations the regime deems
 suspicious, such as officers, particularly high ranking ones,
 of the former South Vietnamese Government and armed forces, and
 those whose current political views are suspect. Estimates of
 those detained range from 10,000, according to Vietnamese
 officials, to over 100,000 according to some refugee sources.
 Interviews with persons who escaped or were released from camps
 revealed the continued existence of at least eight camps in
 1980-81 with a population of about 64,000. Based on the
 continued slow release of detainees over the last two years, a
 conservative estimate of the reeducation camp population is
 about 40,000 to 60,000, including additional persons detained
 after 1975. "Reeducation camps" are intended to remove
 dissident elements from society, especially competent and/or
 charismatic leaders, and to produce conformity through
 confinement, indoctrination, and hard labor. While several
 thousand prisoners, including some military officers up to the
 rank of colonel, have been released, a few have been
 rearrested. Amnesty International stated in its 1983 report
 that its greatest concern in 1982 was "the detention without
 trial of thousands of members of the former South Vietnamese
 Government in 'reeducation' camps."
 There are no legal requirements that the Government charge or
 release a detained person within a specific time. The Amnesty
 International 1983 report also expressed concern about
 prisoners of conscience being held in pretrial detention for an
 indefinite period despite the fact that the relevant decree
 provides for a maximum of one year's pretrial detention. The
 
 
</pre>
<pre>
 901
 draft penal code published in August 1983 contained no
 provisions for the protection of the individual against
 arbitrary or capricious treatment at the hands of the
 authorities. Bail for alleged offenders is not permitted, nor
 is the individual guaranteed a lawyer of his choice for his
 defense. Refugees report that the authorities occasionally
 wait months before notifying relatives of an individual's
 detention.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The arbitrary detention without charge, trial, or any form of
 legal proceeding of thousands of persons under the guise of
 "reeducation" has subverted the rudimentary legal system which
 exists. Even for those who are given a trial, for the most
 part those charged with nonpolitical crimes or specific
 prohibited political acts, the judicial process cannot be
 considered fair and will most likely result in conviction.
 Initially, a "people's committee", an administrative body,
 holds a preliminary hearing. Upon its recommendation, the case
 is passed to province-level courts where the case is tried
 before a jury of government officials. The court appoints an
 official for the defense whose duty is to explain to the
 defendant the legal aspects and proceedings. The newly-
 published draft penal code provides some guidance on the kinds
 of penalties to be implemented by the courts. In some
 instances, appeals or clemency can be granted.
 In general, the entire legal system operates as an agency for
 the enforcement of regime directives; it is not independent of
 political intervention. In addition to the detainees in
 "reeducation camps," some persons have been charged, tried, and
 executed or imprisoned for conspiring to overthrow the
 Government or for other political crimes. For example, Hanoi
 domestic radio on August 17, 1983, reported the trial of 33
 persons for subversive activities. The court sentenced two of
 them to death, four to life imprisonment, and the others to
 lesser sentences.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The system of population surveillance by party appointed block
 wardens, who use informants to keep track of each individual's
 political and economic activities, has been extended from
 northern Vietnam to Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) and other
 southern cities and rural areas. However, the system works
 imperfectly in the south, partly because of a shortage of
 trusted party workers. There have been reports of officials
 implanting incriminating evidence during searches of
 residences. There have also been reports of officials and even
 nonofficial security wardens conducting midnight searches of
 homes for draft-age males in order to fulfill draft quotas. No
 warrants were required. There continued to be reliable reports
 that the Ministry of the Interior inspects and sometimes
 confiscates international mail sent to Vietnam, particularly to
 politically suspect persons or those of Chinese origin.
 Outgoing mail is also subject to inspection and censorship.
 
 
 902
 The regime has spoken openly of its program to relocate
 millions of people to "new economic zones" in virgin or
 unproductive rural areas in order to expand agricultural
 production. Hundreds of thousands were resettled in these
 remote zones in the years following the fall of South Vietnam.
 The resettlement process has involved forms of coercion in most
 cases. The program targeted for resettlement those whose views
 and background made them politically suspect and often unable
 to find employment. Conditions in these zones are widely
 reported to range from poor to life-threatening with inadequate
 provision of basic services. Many of the relocated persons
 have departed, returning to the cities where they are forced to
 live on an already marginal economy, without the ration or
 neighborhood registration cards essential to procuring
 employment, food, and other essential services.
 Recent reports indicate that the Government is trying to revive
 this relocation program which has been moribund for several
 years. Officially, its goal is to promote increased economic
 production, particularly of cash crops such as coffee and
 rubber. According to the official press, the 1981-85 plan
 calls for the relocation of one million persons, although
 another report claiming that 97,000 persons had been relocated
 in the first nine months of 1983 suggests that the plan's quota
 may not be met. This resettlement often displaces tribal
 minorities, threatening their traditional customs and
 subsistence. Although the Government speaks of "volunteers"
 when discussing persons resettled in the "new economic zones,"
 it is clear that this resettlement arbitrarily interferes with
 the individual's right to live in a place of his own choosing.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. -Freedom of Speech and Press
 The rights of freedom of speech and the press do not exist in
 Vietnam. The Ministry of Culture and Information and organs of
 the party control all newspapers, books, and other
 publications, as well as all cultural exhibitions. The
 Government controls and censors all public sources of
 information and promotes "revolutionary culture" in the arts.
 Many prominent artists and writers have been arrested.
 Independent criticism of the party and Government is not
 permitted.
 The block surveillance system utilizes informants to monitor
 the attitudes of citizens. Public criticism of officials is
 not permitted, except in official media which may criticize the
 laxity of some officials or groups of officials who do not meet
 party norms. Such criticism is simply for purposes of
 exhortation by example.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Individuals are prohibited from meeting either publicly or
 privately to criticize or protest government actions or
 policies. Nongovernmental organizations, such as church
 groups, can meet for narrowly defined objectives, such as
 church services, but not for other purposes.
 
 
 903
 In lieu of independent labor unions, government-controlled
 unions have been set up under the Vietnam Federation of Trade
 Unions, one of the Communist Party directed organizations.
 Claiming 3 million members, the Federation's stated goal is to
 increase party control and production rather than to improve
 the welfare of the worker or to protect his rights. Other
 "mass organizations," such as women's federations, exist in
 other sectors of the population. They perform the same
 functions of control, propaganda, and policy dissemination
 within their respective sectors as do the labor organizations
 among workers. These organizations have links with parallel
 Soviet and East European organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Government tolerates the existence of religious groups and
 allows religious services but has attempted to divide and
 control the Catholic, Buddhist, and Cao Dai churches, the
 Muslim community, and other religious sects. The Government
 perceives religious groups as potential political opponents and
 has attempted to prevent their growth and inhibit proselytizing
 activities by prohibiting publication or import of religious
 materials. It has also restricted their contact with
 coreligionists abroad.
 Catholic priests are subject to police surveillance, and most
 priests and nuns are required by the authorities to work
 full-time in secular occupations, thus limiting their
 participation in religious activities. Over 100 priests
 reportedly remain in "reeducation camps." The teaching role of
 the Catholic Church has been severely restricted, and many
 churches and all but one Catholic seminary in the South have
 been closed. Sermons require government approval, and
 uncooperative priests are subject to confinement in remote
 villages or incarceration in "reeducation camps." Catholics
 are closely watched by the security forces, are required to
 attend political indoctrination sessions, and are discriminated
 against in employment. In central Vietnam, thousands of
 Catholics have been forcibly relocated and required to work on
 government construction projects. The Government has sharply
 curtailed the ordination of new Catholic clergy and restricted
 communication between rural parishes and their bishops. The
 conviction of several priests and Catholic lay persons during
 1983 for "counterrevolutionary" activities was evidently in
 part designed to intimidate other Catholics.
 Protestant churches in Vietnam have been similarly restricted.
 Those active among the highlands minorities have all been
 closed as was the sole Protestant college and theological
 seminary. There have been recent reports of harassment, new
 restrictions, and one closure among those evangelical churches
 which have been allowed--albeit within narrow limits--to
 continue to hold services in urban areas.
 Nearly all the 30,000 Vietnamese Muslims are members of the
 Cham minority, which the regime distrusts and harasses. The
 Government has abolished the position of Mufti, or Muslim
 religous leader, disbanded the organized Muslim association and
 broken links with overseas Muslim organizations. The regime
 forbids the religously required pilgrimage to Mecca and has not
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 58
 
 
 904
 given permission for the Muslim community to participate in the
 Koran reading contest held annually in Malaysia. Many Muslim
 schools have been closed, but most mosques are still open. The
 importation of Korans is forbidden and the printing house which
 previously published Korans has been closed.
 Vietnamese authorities have tried repeatedly since 1975 to
 suppress and intimidate the Mahayana Buddhist leadership. The
 authorities have closed temples and transformed them into
 public buildings. They have arrested monks intermittently
 since 1975 and hundreds remain in "reeducation camps." The
 government has forced Buddhist monks to work in addition to
 performing their religious duties. Monks at the formerly
 active An Quang, Xa Loi, and Vinh Nghiem pagodas rarely receive
 visitors and are under close government surveillance. Pagoda
 schools are closed. Monks throughout Vietnam need permission
 to travel and to stay overnight away from their home temples.
 Some reports allege that local authorities seek to control the
 community of Buddhist monks by forbidding the donation of food.
 The majority of pre-1975 monks in the south have been forced to
 leave the monkhood and few young men are allowed to join the
 community.
 The regime organized a conference in November 1981 to establish
 the Unified Vietnam Buddhist Church. The charter provides that
 it is "the only Buddhist organization representing Vietnamese
 Buddhism in all relations in the country and with other
 countries." Reports suggest that the new church has no appeal
 to most Buddhists who view it simply as a creature of the
 regime.
 The leadership of the Therevada Buddhists, most of whom are
 ethnic Khmer, similarly has been replaced by proregime clergy
 who represent the sect abroad. A number of former Therevada
 leaders have been imprisoned.
 Other religious groups have also been persecuted by the
 regime. The leadership of the Hoa Hao (a Buddhist sect) has
 reportedly been imprisoned as have leaders of the Cao Dai sect.
 The Government appointed religious leaders sympathetic to the
 regime in their place. According to the official press, other
 Cao Dai leaders using the Cao Dai Holy See in Tay Ninh City to
 establish an anti-Government subversive organization,
 broadcasting and printing anti-government messages and storing
 arms for an uprising.  Some leaders were arrested, tried, and
 executed, according to the Vietnamese media. One such trial of
 two leaders and 31 accomplices was publicized in August 1983.
 Since the regime views religion as a possible source of
 political opposition, adherence to a religious sect is
 incompatible with membership in the Communist Party.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation.*
 Government approval is required for all external travel, and
 one must have an identity card to travel internally. No one is
 allowed to change his residence or work location without
 permission from the authorities. Since public security cadre
 periodically check household occupants against the official
 
 
 905
 family register, unauthorized absences also subject families to
 surveillance and harassment. With few exceptions, only govern-
 ment officials or approved spokesmen for quasi-governmental
 organizations receive permission to travel abroad.
 A number of factors, in addition to the generally repressive
 political situation, have caused a mass exodus from Vietnam
 since 1975. Among them are ethnic and religous persecution,
 discrimination with regard to economic and educational
 opportunities, fear of incarceration or of forced resettlement
 in remote areas, and fear of conscription to fight in
 Kampuchea.
 In early 1978, the Vietnamese adopted a program to "facilitate"
 the departure of ethnic Chinese and others as refugees. The
 program was administered through special offices at the
 provincial level which charged large fees for exit permits and
 passage. At its height in the spring of 1979, the exodus,
 mostly of ethnic Chinese, reached over 40,000 a month by boat,
 with the "boat people" exposed to extreme hardships at sea, in
 many cases resulting in deaths.
 At the international conference on Vietnamese refugees held in
 Geneva in July 1979, the Government announced a moratorium on
 these refugee departures, and information from refugees who
 have left Vietnam since then indicates that the authorities are
 no longer officially assisting such departures (many do if
 sufficiently bribed) and are punishing people caught trying to
 depart clandestinely.
 In May 1979, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
 reached agreement with the Government on the legal departure of
 persons from Vietnam under the Orderly Departure Program. The
 program started slowly with only slightly more than 13,000
 departing Vietnam in the 27 months between July 1979 and
 October 1981. The Vietnamese then expanded the program, and
 over 12,000 left in the next year. During fiscal year 1983 the
 number of persons departing Vietnam under the program increased
 to 15,631.
 A significant number of persons departing in the Orderly
 Departure Program are ethnic Chinese who consistently find it
 easier than ethnic Vietnamese to be approved officially for
 departure. Another significant portion is composed of persons
 fathered by Americans in Vietnam, known as "Amerasians," who
 have suffered racial discrimination.
 During 1983, refugees continued to leave Vietnam clandes-
 tinely. However, Hanoi and provincial radio stations have
 broadcast reports of executions or of lengthy jail sentences
 for organizers of failed escape attempts, as well as
 punishments dealt to others implicated. Currently, male
 offenders can expect sentences ranging from three to fifteen
 years at hard labor--depending on their role in the departure
 attempt--while female offenders receive one to three months,
 with childless women often receiving longer sentences.
 "Reeducation camp" releasees who attempt flight can expect to
 be returned to the camps for an indefinite term. Property,
 often including the means of livelihood, is confiscated from
 those caught trying to escape, as is the property left behind
 by those who succeed.
 
 
 906
 Individuals reportedly must often bribe officials to be placed
 on Orderly Departure Program lists. Refugees from the Mekong
 Delta have reported that some persons have paid officials from
 $4,800 to $6,000 in gold per person to be placed on tentative
 lists with no guarantee as to when or if they would be
 permitted to leave. Persons who have applied for exit permits
 reportedly are subject to recurring security checks and
 harassment.
 Few have returned to Vietnam after having fled the country.
 Those who fled in the immediate aftermath of the fall of South
 Vietnam in 1975 and later returned were incarcerated in
 "reeducation camps." In only a few isolated cases has Hanoi
 allowed anyone to repatriate in recent years; in effect, those
 who emigrate lose their citizenship. Some who left Vietnam
 prior to 1975 and have acquired nationalities and travel
 documents of other countries have been permitted to return to
 Vietnam as visitors.
 Since the occupation of Kampuchea by Vietnam, large numbers of
 Vietnamese, possibly as many as several hundred thousand, have
 been encouraged or assisted by the Vietnamese authorities to
 settle in Kampuchea. Although many of these persons are former
 residents expelled by Kampuchea's former rules, a significant
 number are reportedly first time settlers.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 All authority and political power is vested in the Communist
 Party, and political opposition or advocacy of change in this
 system is not tolerated. The Politburo of the Central
 Committee of the Vietnam Communist Party is the supreme
 decisionmaking body in the nation, and the party's powerful
 Secretariat oversees day to day implementation of Politburo
 directives. The party leadership selects candidates for the
 Central Committee, and the National Party Congress merely
 ratifies the selection without any choice among the
 candidates. The Congress is made up of delegates from the
 party apparatus of each province, who are similary selected by
 higher levels.
 Ostensibly the chief legislative body, the National Assembly in
 fact always approves without dissent the policies set by the
 Communist Party Politburo. National Assembly elections are
 held in Vietnam every five years, most recently in 1981. Local
 elections are held more often. The electorate must participate
 in these elections in order to have ration cards validated.
 Voters do not have a real political choice. They may only
 strike out the names of candidates for whom they do not wish to
 vote from the single list which is presented to them.
 Although southerners have been appointed to some ministerial
 and National Assembly positions, the leadership's distrust of
 southerners, including some long-time Communist cadre or party
 members, is a significant factor in the assignment of political
 responsibilities.
 Gradual assimilation and cooption appear to be the Government's
 long-run strategy in regard to most minorities. The Government
 
 
 907
 has created special schools in the Hanoi area to train minority
 cadres who can be the "eyes and ears" of the party among their
 own people. Highland minorities in Central Vietnam are subject
 to repression if suspected of ties with resistance groups.
 Officially programmed settlement of ethnic Vietnamese into the
 highlands is designed to enhance lowlander control and to
 restrict minorities, some of which are being forced into
 settled agriculture. Southern minorities such as the Chinese,
 Indian, and Khmer have been encouraged to leave the country.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Vietnam is not a member of international human rights
 organizations, nor does it play an active role in attempting to
 ameliorate the human rights situation in other countries. In
 April 1983 Amnesty International issued an appeal to the
 government of Vietnam to release or bring to trial the
 thousands of persons held without trial, many since 1975. Both
 this appeal and previous Amnesty International reports as well
 as the 1983 annual report expressed concern over the violation
 of human rights by the detention of persons without trial in
 "reeducation camps" under harsh conditions over a period of
 years. Freedom House, in its report for 1983, classified
 Vietnam as "not free."
 Foreign delegations and journalists who have been allowed to
 visit "reeducation camps" have been shown model camps. Former
 prisoners have described extensive preparations to beautify
 camps prior to visits, temporary removal of most prisoners
 during the visit, and careful briefing of the remaining
 prisoners by Communist Party cadre on what to tell delegation
 members.
 The Government does not permit the existence of private groups
 in Vietnam concerned with human rights.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Vietnamese economic development continues to be hindered by
 attempts to eliminate or control private business and to
 collectivize agriculture in the South. There has also been
 loss of output due to the flight and expulsion of skilled and
 entrepreneurial workers. Persons with Western training and
 education are frequently denied official employment. The high
 cost of maintaining defenses against China and the occupation
 armies in Kampuchea and Laos divert resources and personnel
 needed for economic development.
 Production incentives have ameliorated agricultural production
 shortfalls to a degree. According to Hanoi, grain production
 reached nearly 17 million metric tons in 1983. Per capita
 consumption of foodgrains remained below adequate nutritional
 needs; however, the Government of Vietnam claims that it has
 now achieved minimum self-sufficiency in grain production and
 no longer has to import grain.
 Inflation (about 80 percent in 1982) has forced many city

 jobs and has led to increased corruption and crime. Corruption
 is now seen as a fact of life throughout the South, and is
 becoming more pervasive in the North. The average citizen
 must bribe officials to obtain public services and official
 documents. Wage levels have not kept up with inflation, and
 for many families the black market sale of goods received in
 packages from relatives abroad has become an essential
 component of their income. Hcwever, government measures taken
 in the spring of 1983 to restrict the amount of goods and money
 which families can receive from abroad, as well as other
 official moves against free market activities, have curtailed
 black market trading activities to a degree.
 Collectivization of the fishing industry and nationalization of
 most oceangoing vessels have lowered fishermen's income
 severely. According to some reports, 70 percent of the catch
 is taken in taxes. The fishing industry has been further
 crippled by severe government limits on the amount of fuel and
 water permitted on board. These measures have been adopted to
 prevent refugee escapes. Depletion of the fishing fleet
 through loss of boats to carry refugees has also hurt the
 industry.
 Primary education is claimed to be universal but some children,
 such as Amerasians, the children of Americans who served in
 Vietnam, are not allowed to attend school. Education above the
 elementary level, particularly at higher levels, is often
 restricted to those with approved backgrounds. The party
 committee in each school reportedly has the final determination
 of who graduates. Similarly, study abroad is restricted to
 politically acceptable persons.
 The ethnic Chinese are severely discriminated against through
 denial of officially sanctioned employment and educational
 opportunities. Former military officers of the Republic of
 Vietnam are systematically denied employment, and the children
 of former military and civilian officials are denied university
 education by a review of family background which culls Out
 "undesirable elements." Persons released from "reeducation
 camps" are formally denied their "civil rights" for an
 indefinite period and are thus subject to severe restrictions
 on employment and travel.
 The level of health care has declined since 1975. The severe
 shortages of medical facilities and medicines have been
 aggravated by the need to divert material and personnel for the
 care of soldiers wounded in Kampuchea. Only the most minimal
 facilities are available for the average worker. Ordinary
 peasants and workers must purchase medical prescriptions on the
 open market, unlike party cadre who have access to free or
 government-subsidized prescriptions. Those who are not
 employed by the state are not eligible for care at government
 medical facilities.
 At least 55,000 Vietnamese workers have been sent under
 contract to work in various occupations in the U.S.S.R. as well
 as Eastern Europe. There is little doubt that a significant
 portion of their wages is deducted to help pay for Vietnam's
 debts to these countries. Complaints about working conditions,
 including inadequate winter clothing, have been reported. It
 appears that many of the workers enter this work program in
 order to escape the poverty and unemployment of present day
 Vietnam. The potential for human rights abuse, however,
 remains a source of concern.
