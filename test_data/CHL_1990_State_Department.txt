 CHILE
 A civilian President, Patricio Aylwin, who had been freely and
 fairly elected on December 14, 1989, was sworn into office on
 March 11, 1990, ending almost 17 years of military rule.
 Thirty-eight Senators and 120 Deputies were also elected; 9
 Senators were appointed by the outgoing military Government
 and the judiciary. There is a separate judicial branch, but
 many crimes relating to state security continue to be heard in
 military tribunals. As a result of legislation passed in
 December, many long-pending cases involving politically
 motivated crimes will pass from military to civilian courts,
 as will cases involving "offenses against the armed forces."
 Although there is some tension in relations between the armed
 forces and the civilian Government, the leaders of the armed
 forces acknowledge and respect constitutional limits. The
 uniformed national police, the 28,000-man Carabineros, is
 under the-jurisdiction of the Minister of Defense and has
 primary responsibility for public order and safety, crime
 control, and border security. The 2,400-man Investigations
 Police, also under the jurisdiction of the Minister of
 Defense, is responsible for controlling and investigating
 serious crime. The National Information Center (CNI), which
 had been responsible for internal and external
 intelligence-gathering under the Ministry of the Interior, was
 dissolved early in 1990, and many of its staff and functions
 were absorbed into the army intelligence agency, DINE. The
 85,000-man armed forces assert a role as the ultimate
 guarantor of constitutional order and, in keeping with
 longstanding tradition and under the terms of the current
 election law, are responsible for ensuring the security of
 voting places during elections. The former President, General
 Augusto Pinochet, exercised his constitutional option to
 remain as Commander-in-Chief of the Army after the transition
 to civilian government; the Navy Commander-in-Chief retired
 and was replaced in March; and the Commander-in-Chief of the
 Air Force and the Director General of the Carabineros retained
 their positions at the request of President Aylwin.
 Chile's economy is largely based on free market principles and
 has a dynamic and growing export sector. Copper is the major
 source of foreign exchange, followed by fresh fruits and fish
 meal. For the seventh consecutive year there was positive
 real economic growth, despite lower rates of job creation and
 wage increases resulting from anti-inflation measures. Real
 wages have increased and unemployment, while high in urban
 areas, on the whole has decreased.
 The human rights environment continued to improve in 1990 with
 the return of democratic government. Legislation was passed
 to amend vaguely defined and far-reaching state security
 laws. In April President Aylwin appointed a nine-member
 Commission on Truth and National Reconciliation to investigate
 unresolved cases of serious human rights abuses committed
 during the military regime. Freedom of speech and press were
 largely unrestricted. However, there continued to be
 instances of human rights violations during the year. There
 were 19 charges of torture and 3 of politically motivated
 kidnaping. Twenty persons, including nine Carabineros (one of
 them retired), two army personnel, four terrorists, and five
 civilians (including four prison officials) were killed in
 terrorist-initiated incidents. Two former Air Force generals
 survived an assassination attempt. Seven cases involving the
 use of excessive force by Carabineros, resulting in death,
 were under investigation.

 On November 30 President Bush certified that Chile had made
 significant progress in complying with internationally
 recognized principles of human rights and had taken
 appropriate steps to bring to justice those indicted by a U.S.
 grand jury in connection with the 1976 murders in Washington,
 D.C. of opposition leader Orlando Letelier and his American
 associate Ronni Moffit. The United Nations Human Rights
 Commission (UNHRC) terminated its mandate for a Special
 Rapporteur.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Political and other extrajudicial killing continued in 1990,
 albeit in lower numbers than in previous years. The
 independent Chilean Human Rights Commission (CHRC) charged
 that seven civilians died as a result of the use of excessive
 force by Carabineros as of July 31. These included a member
 of the Communist Youth Party who was shot by a Carabinero
 while painting political slogans on a wall on June 26. The
 officer was dismissed and indicted by a military court. Six
 other civilians--four of them innocent bystanders--died during
 confrontations between police and suspected criminals,
 according to the CHRC. Investigations were under way at
 year's end to determine if excessive force was used.
 Two terrorist organizations, the dissident wing of the Manuel
 'Rodriguez Patriotic Front (FPMR/D) and the Lautaro Youth
 Movement (MJL), were responsible for most of the political
 violence in 1990. Retired Carabinero Colonel Luis Fontaine
 was assassinated on May 10 as he left his office; a
 self-described spokesman for the FPMR/D claimed
 responsibility. Fontaine had been acquitted on May 2 of
 charges of complicity in the death of a student in Valparaiso
 5 years earlier. The FPMR/D also took responsibility for the
 assassination attempt against former Air Force
 Commander-in-Chief and military junta member General Gustavo
 Leigh and his business partner, retired General Enrique Ruiz,
 on March 21; both men survived the attack. Nine Carabineros
 and two army officials were killed in attacks by the FPMR/D
 and the MJL. Four terrorists died in 1990; one was shot by an
 off-duty police officer during a supermarket hold-up in
 August, one died during an attack on a Carabinero bus in
 August, one was killed following his escape from custody in
 November, and one died in a confrontation with police after he
 was implicated in the death of a guard during a museum robbery
 in Talca. Five civilians were killed in terrorist incidents;
 four were prison officials killed in the terrorist's escape
 mentioned above, and one died when a bomb placed in a bat
 exploded during an.amateur baseball game.
 According to government records, leftwing terrorist groups
 caused 65 personal injuries in attacks which included 278
 bombings through December 31. Among the victims was a U.S.
 Embassy official who was seriously injured during the baseball
 bat explosion. There were 53 attacks, including bombings, of
 Mormon churches. Two bombs exploded and one was deactivated
 at U.S.-Chilean binational centers, and the U.S. Embassy annex
 was also bombed. Several offices of the center-right National
 Renewal (RN) Party and the independent Democratic Union (UDI)
 were bombed, as was.the home of UDI's Secretary General. An
 
 
 58
 CHILE
 apartment building where several judges reside was also
 bombed. A fake bomb was placed at the headquarters of the
 Christian Democratic Party. Threats against individuals,
 including congressmen and political party officials from both
 the right and left, journalists, judges, and government
 officials, increased sharply in 1990.
 The bodies of 76 victims killed by security forces following
 the 1973 military coup were discovered in clandestine graves
 in 1990. Of the 76, 23 had been executed by order of military
 tribunals, 16 had been shot allegedly while attempting to
 escape prison camps, 15 had been detained before disappearing,
 and 22 had died for undisclosed reasons. Nineteen bodies were
 unearthed at Pisagua, the first mass grave to be opened.
 Other graves yielded evidence of mass burials, but the remains
 had been moved to undisclosed locations prior to discovery of
 the sites. At the Government's request, special investigatory
 judges were appointed to oversee the opening of clandestine
 graves and exhumations of the remains, and to investigate the
 circumstances of the illegal burials. On November 16,
 however, the Supreme Court ruled that a military court, not a
 civilian court, had jurisdiction in the Pisagua case.
 On April 26, President Aylwin appointed a nine-member
 Commission on Truth and Reconciliation to investigate and
 expose human rights violations during military rule from
 September 11, 1973 to March 11, 1990. The Commission, called
 the Rettig Commission after its president, Raul Rettig, was
 given a 6-month deadline, with the possibility of one 3-month
 extension, to provide a comprehensive summary of human rights
 violations and terrorist activity; to identify the victims and
 describe their fates; to suggest compensation to them or their
 surviving relatives; and to recommend ways to avoid a
 recurrence of such human rights violations. The Commission
 has no subpoena or prosecutorial powers and is prohibited from
 identifying its interlocutors. As of June 28, when it
 concluded the stage of receiving information to identify human
 rights victims, approximately 3,000 violations had been
 reported; about 10 percent of these involved members of the
 armed forces killed in terrorist incidents. The Commission
 was directed to forward evidence of criminal wrongdoing to the
 courts.
 Carmen Gloria Quintana, who was seriously burned by a military
 patrol in 1986, and-the family of Rodrigo Rojas, who died of
 burns, filed a civil suit for damages after the Military-
 Tribunal confirmed manslaughter and serious injury charges
 against the patrol's commander in 1989. In January 1991, a
 higher military court sustained the manslaughter charge but
 overturned the serious injury finding. The decision will be
 appealed to the Supreme Court. There was little advancement
 in other outstanding cases against the Carabineros, including
 the 1986 "Calle Mamina" case. In this case, several people
 died after an exchange of gunfire with Carabineros, who
 attempted to characterize the lethal wounds as
 self-inflicted. The investigation into the 1989 assassination
 of Jecar Neghme, a spokesman for the political faction of the
 Movement of the Revolutionary left (MIR), was closed in
 February, allegedly for lack of evidence.
 b. Disappearance
 The CHRC reported two cases of politically motivated kidnaping
 by unknown persons in May, and a Carabinero reported he had
 been kidnaped and interrogated in June about the death of two
 
 
 CHILE
 Communist Party members in 1985. The last reported case of a
 person being detained by presumed members of the security
 forces, followed by a disappearance, was reported in'1987.
 Judicial investigation into this case and earlier instances
 appears to have been suspended, but the Rettig Commission
 included these cases in its investigation.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There was a significant reduction in credible reports of
 torture in 1990. According to the CHRC, there were 19 charges
 of torture and 93 charges of cruel treatment by Carabineros
 and Investigations Police as of November 30. Agreements
 concluded in 1987 by the Investigations Police, the CNI (now
 defunct), and the Carabineros with the International Committee
 of the Red Cross (ICRC) appear to have reduced the incidence
 of torture as well as lesser forms of police brutality. The
 agreements, which have generally been honored, allow the ICRC
 to visit anyone detained by the Carabineros and Investigations
 Police for violations of state security laws. The ICRC is
 notified immediately when persons are detained for politically
 motivated crimes, and it is allowed to visit the detainees
 after 24 hours of detention and before the detainees are
 released or brought before the courts. However, the ICRC is
 not allowed to visit detainees if the prosecutor in the case
 orders them held for the 10-day period of isolation provided
 for under the antiterrorist law. Although there were
 instances when periods of incommunicado detention were
 extended beyond 10 days, this practice was considerably
 reduced in 1990. The CNI, until its dissolution, continued to
 abide by the 1987 agreement with the ICRC to turn over persons
 it arrested to the Carabineros or the Investigations Police.
 In 1989, international agreements, including the United
 Nations and the Organization of American States (O.A.S.)
 Conventions on torture, signed by Chile in 1987 and ratified
 in September 1988 with reservations, were given the status of
 constitutional law.
 The Chamber of Deputies has a permanent Commission on Human
 Rights, Nationality and Citizenship to monitor respect for
 basic rights. Judicial investigations of torture have seldom
 been concluded, due in large part to the refusal of some state
 security organizations to comply with court orders to make
 security agents available to the courts for questioning.
 Early in 1990, Judge Rene Garcia Villegas, whose denunciation
 of the repeated failure of CNI officials to cooperate with his
 investigations into torture incidents was reported in last
 year's country report, received an "inadequate" rating from
 the Supreme Court for the second year in a row; he was forced
 to resign.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under Article 19 of the Constitution, civilian and military
 courts may order detention for 5 days and extend it up to 10
 days for suspected terrorist acts. In some cases under
 military jurisdiction, the detainees' access to lawyers was
 restricted.
 Ad hoc military prosecutors continue to hold open the
 investigations of four cases: the discovery of arms caches in
 1986, the attempted assassination of President Pinochet in
 1986, the kidnaping of an army colonel in 1987, and the 1986
 assault on a bakery in which a Carabinero official was
 
 
 540
 CHILE
 killed. Two members of the Vicariate of Solidarity who were
 charged with aiding one of the assailants in the latter case
 were absolved by the Supreme Court on June 18 after lengthy
 proceedings and several months in jail. However, a doctor who
 had failed to report promptly on the medical treatment he gave
 to an assailant was arrested and denied bail upon his return
 to Chile. These cases will pass to civilian courts as the
 result of legislation passed in December.
 The CHRC reported 15 arbitrary individual arrests and 105
 arrests from March, when the new Government was installed,
 until the end of November. Many of those detained under
 Article 19 of the Constitution are never charged and are
 released after several days. The apparent practice of using
 state security laws to harass the political opposition
 declined, but did not disappear. Once formally charged with
 or convicted of violations of state security laws, the accused
 are generally imprisoned separately from common criminals and
 have rights of visitation and communication with their
 families, friends, legal counsel, and representatives of the
 ICRC.
 During 1990, President Aylwin pardoned 51 persons who had been
 convicted of politically motivated crimes. Legislation to
 amend the Constitution to permit presidential pardons for
 those convicted of certain security and antiterrorist laws and
 to permit conditional release pending resolution of these
 cases was submitted to the Congress in December.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.
 First instance jurisdiction for the prosecution of proscribed
 political activities remains with the regular civilian courts,
 but broad interpretation of state security laws during the
 military government's regime greatly expanded military court
 jurisdiction. The Social Aid Foundation of the Christian
 Churches (FASIC) reported that, as of September 30, 220
 persons charged with violating state security laws prior to
 March 11 were in jail; over 80 percent of the cases were in
 the military court system. In at least one case, the
 investigation phase has lasted 9 years. Twenty-five members
 of the FPMR/D or the MJL who were arrested after March 11 on
 state security charges remained in jail at year's end.
 Legislation passed by the Congress in December enables
 security and antiterrorist cases initiated prior to March 11,
 1990, to be transferred from the military to the civilian
 courts.
 As in most civil law systems, trial is not by jury, reliance
 is on the written record rather than oral testimony, and the
 judge renders a verdict after directing the investigation.
 The investigation phase is considered secret, with limited
 access for the accused or his attorney to evidence or
 testimony developed by the judge. Secrecy has made it
 extremely difficult to ascertain if justice is being done.
 There is a well-developed, multistage appeal process leading
 ultimately to the Supreme Court.
 The courts made little progress during 1990 in investigating
 present and past human rights violations. Judges failed to
 investigate vigorously charges of human rights abuses under
 the former government. In September the Supreme Court ruled
 that the 1978 amnesty law prevented investigations into
 alleged abuses which occurred before that date.
 
 
 541
 CHILE
 f. Arbitrary Interference with'Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Searches of the home and interception of private
 communications are permitted by the Constitution, provided
 search warrants are issued by either a civilian or military
 court for specific locations. The 1984 antiterrorist law
 permits the surveillance of those promoting political views
 contrary to the Constitution or those suspected of terrorist
 crimes, and the interception, opening, or recording of private
 communications and documents in such cases. The legal reform
 package passed by the Congress in December continues to
 permit special surveillance in suspected terrorist cases but
 strengthens the court's supervision of it.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution recognizes freedom of speech and press.
 Restrictions, including self-censorship, that prevailed under
 the military regime have largely disappeared. There were,
 however, several charges of "offenses" against the Armed
 Forces or the President, which were brought before military
 courts in 1990. The armed forces brought such charges
 against, among others, the director and the general editor of
 the Communist Party newspaper El Siglo, the director of
 Analysis, and the general secretary of the journalists'
 association. The charges against the director of Analysis
 were dismissed by the military tribunal in October. The new
 Government itself filed charges of "offenses against the
 President" against a retired army general who called President
 Aylwin a hypocrite for attending the funeral services for
 former President Allende; the Government withdrew- the charge
 on September 18, Chile's national day, as a gesture of
 reconciliation and called on the armed forces to reciprocate
 by dropping their charges against journalists. The
 professional association of journalists has criticized these
 cases as examples of limitations on the press. With the
 judicial reform passed by Congress in December, most of these
 cases will pass from the military to civilian courts.
 Proposed legislation would more narrowly define offenses
 against the armed forces and would reduce penalties.
 All sectors of Chilean society enjoy access to the electronic
 media, and discussions have been broadened to include such
 formerly sensitive subjects as civilian-military relations.
 However, the seven-member National Television Council
 appointed by the military government for a 6-year term
 approves new licenses and also is charged with safeguarding
 public morals. The Council brought suit against the
 government television channel for "disrespect of forces of law
 and order (the Carabineros)" in one case, and for "indecency"
 in another. After a televised interview with the Director of
 Investigations Police in which he said General Pinochet should
 resign, the national television press chief was jailed for 4
 hours without charge by a military prosecutor. Many observers
 view these as nuisance suits and a form of pressure.
 As of December, the Congress was reviewing legislation to
 change the national television network and the national radio
 network from government-owned to publicly owned entities.
 Meanwhile, the privatization of other channels is under way;
 one new television channel commenced broadcasting in October.
 
 
 542
 CHILE
 Early concerns that adherents of one political segment would
 dominate private television channels dissipated by year's end.
 At year's end Congress was debating legislation that would add
 journalism to the list of recognized professions, thereby
 requiring a university degree in journalism, obligatory
 licensing, and possibly compulsory membership in the
 professional association, the Colegio de Periodistas.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There were few restrictions on peaceful assembly and
 association in 1990. Although official permission to hold
 rallies is not technically required, authorities must be
 notified in writing of planned public events. Carabineros
 used tear gas to disperse a violent demonstration orchestrated
 by elements of the extreme left on inauguration day. Human
 rights activists charged that the Carabineros used unnecessary
 force (tear gas and water cannon) to disperse demonstrators at
 a human rights rally in June to mark the discovery of remains
 at Pisagua and to disperse squatters in a poor section of
 Santiago in August. The Government generally supported the
 actions of the Carabineros at demonstrations as appropriate
 and necessary to preserve order. The Government agreed,
 however, to investigate charges that the Carabineros were more
 forceful in their handling of pro-Allende demonstrators than
 they were with pro-Pinochet demonstrators on the anniversary
 of the September 11 coup.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution provides for freedom of religion. Although
 Chile is predominantly Roman Catholic, there are no
 restrictions on religious practices and no official
 discrimination against any religious group. A number of
 Protestant denominations and other groups are active and
 report full freedom and tolerance, as does the local Jewish
 community. Religious belief-and adherence appear to have no
 effect on acceptability for government positions. The Mormon
 Church continued to be a target of leftwing terrorist groups,
 primarily the MJL, whose opposition appears to be based on
 political rather than religious grounds. Mormon churches were
 bombed frequently, and in September a U.S. citizen missionary
 was pistol-whipped by terrorists.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 By law Chileans are free to move within and to enter and leave
 their country. In September the Congress passed a bill
 establishing the National Office of Returnees to facilitate
 the reincorporation of returning exiles into Chilean society.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens.
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens have the right to change their government. In
 keeping with the terms of the 1980 Constitution, presidential
 and congressional elections were held on December 14, 1989,
 and the officials who ere elected assumed office on March 11,
 1990. Over 95 percent of registered voters cast ballots, and
 the elections were widely praised by national and
 international observers for fairness and orderliness. There
 is universal suffrage for citizens 18 years of'age or over,
 
 
 543
 CHILE
 and over 95 percent were registered to vote. Women are active
 in Chilean political life.
 A package of reforms agreed to by the military government to
 amend the 1980 Constitution was approved in a plebiscite on
 July 30, 1989. Approximately 92 percent of registered voters
 participated, and 85 percent voted for the reforms. Although
 the reforms were criticized as not being sufficiently
 far-reaching, they included provisions to make future
 amendments to the Constitution less burdensome; increased the
 number of elected Senators, thus diluting the power of
 appointed Senators; diminished the role of the National
 Security Council and equalized the number of civilians and
 militaryofficers within it (it had previously been weighted
 in favor of the military)-; and shortened the current
 presidential term of office from 8 to 4 years.
 Chile has a unique binominal system for congressional
 elections, in which political parties or groupings form pacts
 and present slates (two candidates per slate), from which two
 Senators and two Deputies are elected in each district. Both
 candidates from one slate are elected if their combined votes
 double the combined votes of the second slate. However, if
 one list fails to double the votes for another list, even
 though the candidates from the first list have the two highest
 personal totals, the highest vote getter in the second list is
 elected. Critics charge that this Pinochet regime innovation
 was designed to accord disproportionate representation to the
 right. The system is regarded as undemocratic by many who
 prefer Chile's former proportional representation system.
 Moreover, under the terms of the 1980 Constitution, as
 amended, 9 Senators were appointed by the outgoing Government
 and the judiciary to take office with the 38 elected Senators
 (I of the appointed Senators died in December). These
 appointed Senators are politically closer to the elected
 Senators from the parties of the right, the National Renewal
 Party and the Independent Democratic Union (UDI), which
 significantly strengthens the opposition in the Senate.
 Critics charge that the appointment of Senators circumvents
 the will of the majority; supporters maintain that it brings
 useful background and experience to the Senate. The
 Government's coalition of parties has an almost two-thirds
 majority in the Chamber of Deputies.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In April the UNHRC ended the mandate for a Special Rapporteur
 but requested that the Government report to a special session
 of the Commission in 1991 on its progress in the
 reestablishment of human rights and fundamental freedoms.
 The Government cooperates with the ICRC, which provides
 confidential reports to key government Ministries on the
 results of its visits to prisons, as provided for in the
 agreements signed in 1986 and 1987. The Government permits
 visits and investigations by private international human
 rights groups.
 The Catholic Church, which took the lead in denouncing human
 rights violations during the years of the military government,
 continued to supply legal counsel to those accused of
 politically related crimes and to victims of human rights
 
 
 CHILE
 abuses. However, the Vicariate of Solidarity ceased issuing
 factual monthly reports on human right violations in 1990,
 owing to the improved human rights environment and to the
 expanded coverage of alleged violations in the media. The
 Vicariate has cooperated with the Rettig Commission and
 pursues the exhumation of human rights victims illegally
 buried in the aftermath of the 1973 coup. CHRC, a private
 organization, continued to publicize reports of abuses and
 also cooperated with the Rettig Commission.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Minority groups do not suffer from any legal discrimination.
 The only significant racial minority, the Mapuche Indians in
 southern Chile, remains separated from the rest of society
 because of historical, cultural, educational, and geographical
 factors rather than official policy.
 Legal distinctions between the sexes still exist, despite a
 law passed in 1989 to reduce restrictions on women. Under the
 new law, for example, wives may now retain control over income
 earned independently from their spouses, although assets held
 at the time of marriage become community property controlled
 by the husband; decisions on where to live are to be jointly
 taken, whereas previously a woman was obliged to live where
 her husband decided. The legal retirement age for women is 5
 years lower than that for men. Inheritance laws provide
 strong protection for wives and protect female offspring.
 Available information indicates that, on average, women in _-
 industry earn 13 percent less than their male colleagues.
 A provision giving control of a woman's person to her husband
 was rescinded by the 1989 legislation, a change, however, that
 has not been matched by a change in attitude by police or the
 courts. In many cases, violence and other abuse of women
 continues to be tolerated or ignored. The National Women's
 Service (SERNAM), which in 1990 replaced the National Women's
 Secretariat, and whose director was accorded cabinet rank in
 December, estimates from polling data that approximately 30
 percent of women in the lower economic strata have experienced
 domestic violence. No estimate is available for women from
 middle-income or high-income families. Besides providing
 legal and medical information to abused women, SERNAM conducts
 courses on the legal, medical, and psychological aspects of
 domestic violence for Carabineros, most often the first public
 officials to intervene in such incidents. Proposed legal
 reform would expedite court proceedings to overcome the time
 and money disincentives for filing charges-of abuse. Because
 women are discouraged from filing charges by the prospect of
 losing family income if their spouse is fined or serves a jail
 sentence, the legal reforms would instead impose obligatory
 psychological counseling for abusiVe spouses.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 The return to democratic government has had a salutary effect
 on the status of labor and respect for worker rights in
 Chile. The new Government has taken positive steps to correct
 the situation that had provoked widespread international labor
 protests against the previous regime, including the submission
 of draft legislation revising aspects of the labor code which
 had been criticized by the International Labor Organization
 (ILO) for a number of years.
 
 
 545
 CHILE
 Workers in Chile have the right to form and join unions.
 Approximately 12 percent of the work force is organized. The
 Government in 1990 submitted legislation to amend the most
 contentious provisions of the Labor Code of 1987. By the end
 of the year, the Congress passed laws to legalize worker
 centrals (national confederations) and to end dismissal
 without cause. Legislation which would permit open-ended
 strikes and modify collective bargaining regulations was
 pending at year's end. Neither business nor labor
 organizations support all the changes, but representative
 groups participated in discussions with the Government before
 the legislation was sent to Congress. By openly consulting
 with the largest union organization, the Unified Workers
 Central (CUT), the Government gave it de facto recognition.
 The Government's failure to consult more closely with smaller
 centrals, including the divided Democratic Workers Central and
 the Chilean Workers Central, was strongly criticized by both
 groups and representatives of political parties in the
 opposition.
 Under current law, legally recognized unions do not need
 permission to hold union meetings or conferences. Unions
 cannot elect as an officer a person who is under indictment.
 Even before the national confederations were legalized, labor
 unions could and did maintain relations with international
 labor bodies in their fields. In a departure from the
 practice under the military government, the worker delegates
 to the conference of the 199a ILO were selected by the CUT.
 Under the terms of pending legislation, as modified by the
 Congress, there would be no limit to the duration of a strike;
 employers would retain the right to hire temporary substitutes
 during a strike if their last offer in collective bargaining
 procedures was equal to the existing contract plus cost of
 living increases. In 1990 the right to strike was restored to
 the workers at the largest government copper mine and other
 entities which had previously been included on a list of
 strategic services. There was no instance of massive
 dismissal of workers for striking during 1990, although unions
 charged that private companies, in apparent anticipation of
 changes to the provision allowing dismissal without cause,
 reduced staff before that right was frozen as part of the
 labor legislation passed by Congress. The Government promised
 that, as funds permitted, it would rehire teachers and mine
 workers who had been dismissed in the past for illegal strike
 action and who were subsequently blacklisted.
 Charges of disturbing the public order filed in April 1989 by
 the military Government against officials of the CUT were
 dismissed in 1990. There has been no further action taken
 against the President and Vice President of the teachers'
 association who failed to submit in 1989, as required by law,
 a Carabinero certificate stating they had no charges pending
 against them; both have charges outstanding in connection with
 their involvement in an allegedly illegal demonstration
 several years ago. Both were reelected by their association
 in elections in 1990. organized labor continued to press for
 a full investigation of the 1982 murder of labor leader
 Tucapel Jimenez, and on July 30 the case was reopened by the
 Special Investigating Judge (Ministro en Visita) and was being
 actively investigated at year's end.
 Chile has not ratified ILO Conventions 87 on Freedom of
 Association or 98 on Collective Bargaining. In its February
 1990 interim report, the ILO's Committee on Freedom of
 Association (CFA) noted that the Government had provided
 
 
 CHILE
 detailed information on most of the allegations pending
 against Chile and almost all had been settled.
 On December 24, 1987, Chile was formally suspended from the
 list of countries eligible to participate in the U.S.
 Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program because of
 failure to afford internationally recognized labor rights to
 Chilean workers. Because of the improved labor environment,
 and after Chile passed a law to protect intellectual property
 rights, USTR recommended that GSP privileges be restored.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Collective bargaining is strictly regulated, and the entire
 collective bargaining procedure can be nullified if any of a
 series of legally imposed deadlines is missed byeither the
 union or management. Further, a union does not have the
 option to delay the bargaining process in anticipation of a
 more propitious future bargaining atmosphere. A decision not
 to negotiate a new contract upon expiration of the former one
 results in automatically extending the current contract for a
 minimum 2-year period. Although Chilean law protects the
 right of workers to form unions, in practice such laws are not
 effective, especially in small workplaces.
 Despite the restrictions in the Labor Code, there were 1,095
 collective bargaining agreements signed in the first 6 months
 of 1990. Legislation to expand the right to organize and to
 bargain collectively was still pending at the end of 1990.
 There are no export processing zones or other special
 districts in Chile where different labor laws apply.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is implicitly prohibited in the
 Constitution and labor code, and there have been no complaints
 on this issue since the mid-1970's.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Child labor is regulated by law. Young people aged 14 and 15
 may be employed only with the permission of their parents or
 guardians and if they have completed their schooling, and then
 only in restricted types of labor. Those aged 15 to 18 can be
 employed in a larger variety of jobs and for expanded hours,
 but only with their parents' or guardians' permission. The
 Director General of Employment within the Ministry of Labor is
 responsible for enforcement of child labor laws. Enforcement
 of these regulations in the formal sector is good, but
 economic factors have resulted in many children seeking
 part-time and full-time employment in the informal economy
 which is largely unregulated.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational safety and
 health standards are regulated by law. The normal workweek is
 48 hours. The minimum wage is approximately $86 per month.
 It is not considered sufficient for a decent standard of
 living, but many households have two full-time wage earners.
 The law permits the hiring of apprentices, but pay may not be
 less than the minimum wage. Workers have the right to
 denounce employers who pay less than the minimum wage, and
 employers can be forced to pay back wages, but an employee who

 brings such a complaint risks losing his job for having done
 so. Laws covering wages and hours of work are difficult to
 enforce, and there are complaints that occupational health and
 safety laws are not adequately policed.
