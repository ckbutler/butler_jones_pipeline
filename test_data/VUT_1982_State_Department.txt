 VANUATU
 Vanuatu, governed by a single-chamber parliamentary system,
 celebrated its second anniversary of independence from France
 and Great Britain in 1982. It was formerly known as the New
 Hebrides. Its government, elected in 1979 prior to
 independence, published a five-year development plan this year
 which aims at economic self-sufficiency by 1987. That is an
 ambitious goal, but Vanuatu has been able to weather the
 current difficult economic circumstances more easily than other
 Pacific island states, in part because of increased tourism, in
 part because of external aid.
 Vanuatu's population of approximately 117,000 is overwhelmingly
 rural and continues to live in large measure according to
 traditional customs. Like its Melanesian neighbors, Vanuatu's
 indigenous inhabitants are divided by a variety of languages,
 by the more than eighty islands which make up the nation and,
 of course, by colonial experience. In addition, Vanuatu's
 uniquely inefficient colonial regime -- the Anglo-French
 Condominium -- left the new nation further divided by language
 (French and English).
 Despite these obstacles, the Vanuatu Government has made
 progress over the past year in creating a sense of nationhood.
 It introduced a national currency, the "Vatu"; it continued
 attempts to integrate the British and French schools into a
 national educational system; and it promoted Bislama (Vanuatu
 Pidgin) as a national lingua franca.
 By-elections were fiercely contested and successfully conducted
 in August 1982; the ruling Vanuaaku Party captured two of the
 three seats, its opposition the remaining seat. There have
 been no reports of human rights violations countenanced or
 allowed by the Vanuatu authorities. Amnesty International's
 1982 report expressed concern that in 1981 some of those
 imprisoned during the 1980 secessionist rebellion were
 inadequately housed and fed in prison. Reports suggest that
 this situation has been bettered by the release of nearly all
 prisoners charged during and after the rebellion. Apparently
 only the rebel leader, Jimmy Stevens, remains in jail; his term
 of imprisonment was lengthened after an abortive escape attempt
 in 1982.
 Foreign investors have expressed concern over the confusion
 surrounding Vanuatu's land tenure laws. Under the country's
 Constitution, all land is vested in its "custom,* i.e.
 traditional tribal, owners. Land may not be alienated to
 non-indigenous owners, and foreigners or non-indigenous owners
 may only lease property from the customary proprietors.
 Procedures for evaluating improvements made to property by
 former non-indigenous owners and for compensating them for land
 which a tribe has reoccupied are not always clear or have not
 functioned. The Vanuatu Government has, however, said that it
 plans to remedy these problems in 1983.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Killing
 There were no politically motivated murders in Vanuatu in 1982.
 b.   Disappearance
 
 
 821
 There were no reports in 1982 of disappearances, nor any
 reports of abduction or secret detentions.
 c.   Torture
 Torture is prohibited by the Constitution and is not practiced
 in Vanuatu.
 d.   Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment is
 forbidden by the Constitution and that injunction is honored in
 practice.
 e.   Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The Constitution requires that persons arrested be swiftly
 informed of the charges laid against them, that an interpreter
 be provided if required, and that their case be brought before
 a judge speedily. There were no reports of arbitrary arrests
 or capricious imprisonments in 1982.
 f.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for a fair public trial, including
 presumption of innocence until proof of guilt, prohibition
 against double jeopardy, and the right of appeal to the Supreme
 Court. The courts are independent of military or executive
 control and the national ombudsman has the power to investigate
 complaints against the Government. There were no reports this
 year of arbitrary or unfair exercise of judicial authority.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech and Press
 These rights are guaranteed by the Constitution and respected
 by the Government. However, the Government, under the
 emergency provisions of the Constitution, may restrict these
 rights for a limited period of time. There are a number of
 small newspapers and newsletters published by political and
 church groups, but the Government publishes the only national
 newspaper. There is no commercial radio or television; the
 Government runs the national radio station.
 b.   Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 There are no restrictions on the formation of political parties
 in Vanuatu. Vanuatu has a small but active trade union
 movement, recognized by the Government, with the right to
 organize, strike, and bargain collectively. Union membership
 is not large since the number of people who participate in the
 cash economy is itself small. As of 1980 there were 16
 registered trade unions and six employer associations.
 c.   Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of conscience is respected in Vanuatu and missionaries
 of various Christian denominations work without restriction.
 d.   Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 All Vanuatu citizens are free to travel abroad. Passport fees
 are reasonable. Some European residents have been declared
 undesirable immigrants and deported or not allowed to return
 after voluntary departure. Most of the proscribed Europeans
 were French settlers implicated in the 1980 rebellion against
 
 
 822
 the newly independent state. There are no refugees in Vanuatu,
 although the Government has indicated a willingness to receive
 Melanesian refugees.
 e.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 All citizens of Vanuatu are free to participate in the
 political process. The existence of a vocal opposition in
 parliament is evidence of the openness of the political
 system. Every citizen of Vanuatu who is at least 18 years old
 is entitled to vote. At independence, residents had the
 opportunity to opt for Vanuatu citizenship and any person born
 since independence who has at least one parent who is a citizen
 of Vanuatu is entitled to citizenship. There are also
 provisions for naturalization after ten years of residence.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 The Vanuatu Government has publicly expressed willingness to
 permit investigations from qualified and objective outsiders.
 Amnesty International has expressed concerns discussed earlier
 in this report; Freedom House's 1982 report classified Vanuatu
 as 'free.'
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Vanuatu is one of the poorest countries in the South Pacific,
 with a per capita income of approximately $530 per annum. Such
 figures do not mean as much as they might elsewhere, however,
 as the vast bulk of the population lives in a rural,
 subsistence economy. The level of health and nutrition
 compares favorably with other regional countries, and the
 Government is attempting to improve health services within the
 limits of its resources. One of the most difficult problems
 facing the Vanuatu Government is the integration of the British
 and French school systems into a single educational system
 focussed on the problems and needs of Vanuatu. Figures are not
 available on the percentage of the school age population
 enrolled, but there are many church schools and a significant
 portion of British and French aid is devoted to education. The
 population's growth rate is high and averaged 3.2% for the
 period 1970-79. Trade figures for the first half of 1981 --
 the latest available -- showed exports and imports at the same
 depressed level as 1980 and an unfavorable balance of trade of
 two-to-one. Economic assistance from Vanuatu's former colonial
 powers continues to be of great importance to the new state;
 tourism, largely from Australia, is growing and having a
 growing and favorable impact on Vanuatu's balance of payments.
