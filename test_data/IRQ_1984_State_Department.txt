 IRAQ
 Iraq was carved out of the former Ottoman Empire at the end of
 the First World War. It contains many disparate groups, most
 notably Shi'a and Sunni Arab Muslims, Kurds, Turcomans, and
 various Christian sects, predominantly Assyrians and
 Chaldeans. Periods of political instability and violence
 often involved rivalries among these groups. Since Iraq
 gained its independence from Britain in 1932, successive
 regimes were toppled until the Ba'ath Party came to power in
 1968.
 The country is governed by the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party of
 Iraq through a Revolutionary Command Council (RCC) which has
 both executive and legislative authority under the Provisional
 Constitution of 1968. Saddam Hussein holds nearly absolute
 power as President of the Republic and Chairman of the
 Council. The central Government appoints city mayors and the
 18 provincial governors, who have extensive administrative
 powers. A National Assembly, elected in 1980 and again in
 October 1984, has limited authority and is guided by Ba'ath
 Party views.
 Political rights are sharply limited. The news media are
 subject to censorship. Anti-regime activity is dealt with
 harshly, often by extralegal means employed by a large and
 feared internal security police force and the intelligence
 services. Summary executions may be carried out because of
 suspected active opposition to the Ba'ath Party, for factional
 reasons, or as punishment for poor performance in military
 operations.
 The human rights picture marginally improved in 1984.
 Arbitrary arrests and other repressive practices may have
 diminished somewhat following the removal of the former
 intelligence services chief in late 1983. The Ba'ath Party's
 ideological commitment to the equality of women and protection
 of religious minorities continued to be translated into
 practical action, including the doubling of the percentage of
 women elected to the National Assembly. Conflict between
 government forces and a major Kurdish dissident group
 decreased as the two sides sought a political accommodation.
 Also, Iraq apparently has maintained its distance from
 terrorist groups in 1984, including the 'Black June"
 organization, which had resided in or transited the country
 until Iraq expelled its leadership in 1983. Another terrorist
 group that had enjoyed Iraqi support, the May 15 group,
 apparently was suppressed before or during 1984.
 The war of attrition with Iran continued in 1984. Iraq
 strengthened its defense as Iran's offensive abilities
 weakened. Nonetheless Iran continued to reject Iraqi and
 international calls for a cease-fire, and to use both military
 action and terrorism in efforts to change Iraq's secular
 political system and national identity. The war has rallied
 popular support against Iran, in spite of the death or capture
 of over 125,000 Iraqi soldiers and the wounding of additional
 thousands. Even so, in the name of national security, the
 regime has imposed increased controls and further abridged
 individual rights. An August 1984 RCC decree prescribes the
 death penalty for anyone who damages the country's military,
 political, or economic position. Wartime travel restrictions,
 which prevent most Iraqis from departing the country, remained
 in effect throughout 1984.
 
 
 1248
 IRAQ
 Most fighting in 1984 was waged near the border, and civilian
 areas were hit on both sides. Iraq has attacked shipping
 serving Iranian ports, while Iran has attacked ships serving
 neutral ports in the Gulf. Iraq declared a week-long
 unilateral cease-fire on civilian centers in February, but did
 not extend it following Iranian air raids on Iraqi towns.
 However, a U.N.-sponsored moratorium on attacks on civilian
 centers went into effect in June and greatly reduced such
 attacks. Several Iranian ground offensives led to fierce
 fighting and considerable casualties. In March, independent
 investigators confirmed that Iraq had used prohibited chemical
 weapons to combat a renewed Iranian invasion attempt.
 Iranian prisoners of war (POWs) in Iraq are estimated at
 approximately 10,000. Most are believed to be registered with
 the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which
 visits the camps. Iraq has threatened to reciprocate Iranian
 treatment of POWs. In the past, POWs in Iraq were believed to
 have faced instances of physical mistreatment and inadequate
 diet, but the ICRC reported that treatment in 1984 has been
 more satisfactory. In December, Iraq successfully pressed for
 U.N. inspection of the conditions of POWs in both countries.
 The Government historically has devoted a large proportion of
 its oil export-based income to national development and
 improvement of social services. Reduced oil exports and
 wartime military expenditures have forced reduction, but not
 abandonment, of social welfare and development projects.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Execution has been an established method for dealing with
 perceived political and military opponents of the Government,
 particularly members of the outlawed Da'wa Party
 (fundamentalist Shi'a Muslim) and the Communist Party. In
 October 1983, Amnesty International stated that it had the
 names of 520 political prisoners reported to have been
 executed since 1978. Members of the political elite have also
 been executed as a result of factional conflict, although no
 such executions are known to have occurred since 1982. In
 1983, the military conducted aerial attacks on Kurdish
 villages suspected of supporting Iranian military incursions
 into Iraq or harboring anti-government guerrillas, resulting
 in unknown numbers of casualties. Also, mass executions were
 reported of members of Iraqi Kurdish tribes that fought with
 Iran against Iraq. By 1984, disciplinary demotions and
 cashiering appeared to have replaced the summary executions of
 ineffective military officers occasionally reported earlier in
 the war.
 Evidence, including that collected by a U.N. delegation to
 Iran in March, indicated that Iraq had used lethal chemicals
 to repulse an Iranian invasion attempt along the southern
 sector of the battlefront. Medical tests on Iranian soldiers
 in Japan and Europe tended to confirm Iranian allegations that
 Iraq had employed at least lethal blister agents in the
 fighting. Iraq denied that it had used chemical weapons.
 Iraq is a party to the 1925 Geneva protocol banning use, but
 not production, of lethal and incapacitating chemical
 
 
 1249
 IRAQ
 weapons. There are indications that Iraq continues to
 stocKpile lethal agents, but no evidence that Iraq has used
 chemical weapons since the February-March invasion attempt.
 Until 1983, terrorists or their associates who resided in or
 transited Iraq with the apparent acquiescence of the
 Government carried out assassinations and assassination
 attempts abroad. Two such groups were the Black June
 Organization led by Sabri al-Banna or "Abu Nidal," and the May
 15 Organization under Husayn Mohammed Al-Umari, or 'Abu
 Ibrahim.' However, Iraq evidently had withdrawn its support
 for these groups in or by 1983. In an October 1983 interview
 with French journalists, President Hussein said Iraq had
 ceased all financial and other assistance to Abu Nidal, among
 others. The Black June group was expelled from Iraq the
 following month. Likewise, the May 15 Organization has
 remained out of sight since late 1982, although it may have
 attempted an unsuccessful operation in 1983. It reportedly
 was suppressed by mid-1984.
 The Iraqis themselves have been the victims of terrorism
 supported by Syria and Iran. Iranian-backed terrorists bombed
 the Air Force headquarters and a broadcasting station in
 Baghdad in April 1983; attempted to hijack an Iraqi Airways
 passenger flight from Cyprus in September 1984; and bombed
 Iraqi diplomats' cars in Athens and a busy commercial district
 in Baghdad in December 1984. Iraq also reported that it
 prevented or broke up other planned terrorist attacks.
 b. Disappearance
 Iraqi emigrants have reported that some suspects, particularly
 those detained by the security police for subversion,
 disappear following detention. It is difficult in such cases
 to ascertain whether the suspect has been executed or has died
 while incarcerated. In October 1983 Amnesty International
 submitted to Iraq the names of 114 people whose whereabouts
 remain unknown since they were abducted between 1979 and 1982.
 In recent years anti-government Kurds in northern Iraq have
 kidnapped some foreign workers and businessmen, but the number
 of such kidnappings was believed to be small in 1984. Ransom
 demands have included money, a halt to Western economic
 cooperation with Iraq, and support for the release of
 prisoners in Iraq. Victims generally have been released
 following negotiations involving overseas Kurdish
 representatives, the victims' employers, and Iraqi security
 organizations.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Constitution prohibits torture and prescribes stiff
 punishment for it, and the Government rejects charges that it
 practices torture. Nevertheless, reliable reports make clear
 that both physical and psychological torture are used by the
 authorities, especially the security police. Given the rigid
 chain of command within the Government and security services,
 it is unlikely that torture could be practiced without the
 authorization of senior officials.
 According to former prisoners, persons detained by the
 security police for political or security-related matters are
 frequently tortured and mistreated. Treatment is reported to
 
 
 1250
 IRAQ
 be worst immediately following arrest and during the period of
 interrogation and investigation, which can last for months.
 Torture and brutal treatment are not limited to political
 cases. Security-related offenses include such routine
 criminal matters as currency violations.
 A 1981 medical investigation of released prisoners submitted
 to the U.N. showed a uniform pattern of torture. In a special
 human rights report on Iraq in 1983, Amnesty International
 said it had asked the Iraqi authorities to examine 23 deaths
 under torture reported since 1976. Among the torture
 practices cited were suspension from rotating ceiling fans,
 beatings, electrical shocks, and insertion of wires into the
 body. Psychological measures reported elsewhere included
 threats of mutilation to the prisoner and mistreatment of his
 family. Foreigners, including an American and several Arabs,
 also have suffered extreme physical and mental abuse while in
 prison or under detention. Although little reliable
 information on torture in Iraq is available for 1984,
 unconfirmed reports indicate that it may have diminished.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution and legal code guarantee the rights of
 citizens and place checks on police powers in such areas as
 arrest, detention, imprisonment, and search. These guarantees
 are generally respected in criminal cases, but have little
 weight in political or "national security" cases. Security
 police not only make arbitrary arrests but also secretly
 detain suspects, whose fate sometimes has become known only
 after execution. Charges have included espionage, treason,
 and conspiracy against Iraq or the Party and Revolution, often
 in collaboration with unnamed foreign foes.
 Over 30,000 Iranians and Iraqis of alleged Iranian descent
 were summarily expelled to Iran in April 1980 and tens of
 thousands more were reported expelled subsequently. While
 such deportations have ceased, those remaining live under the
 fear of deportation or incarceration. Many "Iranian' families
 have been in Iraq for generations. Some say their forebears
 were not from Iran but claimed the nationality to evade
 Ottoman military conscription. Citizens considered to be of
 Iranian origin bear special identification, often precluding
 desirable employment or impeding advancement.
 Iranian military deserters and civilians who fled to Iraq
 during the war have been detained and sometimes mistreated.
 Some are held incommunicado. Most of these people reportedly
 came to Iraq, after long and hazardous journeys through
 Kurdistan, in response to Iraqi propaganda promising good
 treatment and easy access to third countries. Many reportedly
 have been imprisoned as suspected spies and interrogated
 intensively. There have been frequent allegations that some
 have been shot or beaten with rubber hoses and metal cables.
 Some Iranian refugees reportedly have been coerced to
 collaborate with Iraqi propaganda despite the'danger to family
 members in Iran. When, after many months, these emigres are
 designated 'political refugees,' their treatment improves and
 outside organizations gain access to them.
 In recent years Amnesty International has reported the
 imprisonment or detention of large numbers of Kurds. Reliable
 figures are not available. However, there were reports in
 1983 that hundreds of relatives of Kurdish fighters who joined
 
 
 1251
 I RAQ
 Iranian invasion forces during an offensive that summer were
 arrested and detained in unknown locations outside of
 Kurdistan. Kurdish representatives abroad charge that the
 Government falsely accused 8,000 to 20,000 young men of
 cooperation with Iran, and detained them in desolate areas.
 Since the replacement of the head of the general intelligence
 directorate in late 1983, it is believed that the numbers of
 political prisoners and arbitrary arrests have declined and
 that most of those now detained are considered security
 threats. The Da'wa Party, a violent dissident Shi'ite group,
 is still proscribed, and its members are subject to
 incarceration and execution. The Government has arrested
 Da'wa suspects' family members, including women and children.
 In mid-1984, Iraqi emigres reported that over 100 Assyrians
 were arrested throughout Iraq. Family members have had no
 news about those arrested, who apparently were suspected of
 involvement in subversive activities.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials in civil, criminal, and religious courts are open.
 Defendants are entitled to counsel. A lawyer is provided if a
 defendant cannot afford one. Charges and evidence are
 available for review. Appellate courts hear cases not under
 the jurisdiction of the revolutionary courts. The
 revolutionary courts, which usually hold closed trials, hear
 such crimes as espionage, treason, smuggling, and drug
 trafficking. The right of defense in such courts reportedly
 is severely restricted. The "special courts' constituted by
 the Revolutionary Command Council for specific incidents, such
 as the reported conspiracy against the regime in 1979, are
 also closed. These special tribunals are apparently exempt
 from constitutional safeguards of defendants' rights. The
 right of defense is proscribed; defendants are held
 incommunicado, and confessions extracted by torture are used
 against the defendants. Appeals can be taken only to the
 Chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council, the President.
 However, the availability of this appeal may be ineffective,
 since there are reports that executions take place shortly
 after trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home,
 or Correspondence
 The Constitution provides protections for the inviolability of
 the home, and strong cultural values reinforce these
 protections. Police must obtain a search warrant before
 entering the home of a criminal suspect. Warrants are not
 required for the arrest of security suspects. While most
 arrests occur outside the home, there have been reports of
 forced entry and arrest by the security police, particularly
 of suspected members of the outlawed Da'wa Party.
 There is no legal protection against the monitoring of
 telephones, which many Iraqis believe to be a common
 practice. Likewise, all mail is believed subject to review by
 censors. Government security services and the Ba'ath Party
 are generally assumed to maintain pervasive networks of
 informers.
 Membership in the ruling Ba'ath Party is viewed as a key to
 advancement inside and outside the Government. Although the
 Ba'ath is an elitist party, recruitment can be aggressive.
 
 
 1252
 IRAQ
 Some emigrants have claimed that they joined the Party to
 avoid beatings or harassment or to enhance career prospects.
 Certain ethnic and religious groups within Iraq traditionally
 reside in particular areas of the country. Kurds, for
 example, have strong roots in the north. The Government has
 sometimes tried to force changes in settlement patterns. Mass
 relocations of Kurds took place in the mid-1970s. More
 recently, families and villages of the Barzani tribe were
 forcibly resettled following the participation by tribe
 leaders and members in Iran's 1983 invasion of northern Iraq.
 Rather than allow Iranian Kurds displaced by the war to remain
 in the northern mountainous terrain to which they are
 accustomed, the Government is holding this large population in
 detention camps elsewhere. One such camp, located in the
 desert west of Baghdad, is believed to contain up to 25,000
 people.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Government views political dissent as a security threat,
 and controls exercise of the rights of speech, press, and
 assembly. The Constitution prohibits "any act aimed at
 undermining the national unity of the people, provoking
 racial, sectarian, and regional bigotry, or violating gains
 and achievements of the country.' Nonetheless, the use of
 minority languages is unrestricted. Kurdish, an official
 language, is used with Arabic in schools and media in Kurdish
 areas.
 The Government owns and operates the press, radio, and
 television. The media do not criticize the Government and
 news reporting is strongly biased. Opposition viewpoints are
 not heard. Few foreign periodicals reach Iraq, and Western
 newspapers are not sold. Foreign visitors' newspapers,
 magazines, and cassettes can be confiscated at the airport.
 To control the dissemination of political leaflets,
 typewriters and photocopying machines must be registered.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Public meetings are organized only under the auspices of the
 Government or Ba'ath Party. Non-religious free association
 and demonstrations without government approval have met severe
 repression. Professional organizations are subject to control
 by the Ba'ath Party Central Vocational Bureau.
 Union workers do not represent a significant part of the total
 work force, comprised mostly of agricultural workers,
 shopkeepers, and government employees. Industrial workers,
 the most unionized, are only a small portion of the work
 force. Workers are organized in the Federation of Trade
 Unions under the control of the Ba'ath Party Central Labor
 Bureau. Unions may operate only under officially approved
 guidelines. Elections are held for union executive councils,
 which in turn select officers from among the council
 membership. Nominees are mainly party members. Workers
 legally have the right to strike after providing notice to the
 Labor Ministry, but no strikes have been reported since 1968.
 The unions initiate grievances, but a primary union function
 is to indoctrinate members with Ba'athist ideology. Union
 membership is a prerequisite for employment in some sectors.
 
 
 1253
 IRAQ
 In 1983-84, the International Labor Organization's Committee
 on Freedom of Association examined a complaint filed by the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions on behalf of
 a group calling itself the Workers' Democratic Free Trade
 Union Movement of the Republic of Iraq. The complaint alleged
 tnat a trade union movement isolated from the workers had been
 imposed in rigged elections, that trade union activities had
 become reserved solely for Ba'ath Party members, that trade
 union membership had become compulsory, and that union leaders
 had become government puppets. The Government denied the
 complaining group's existence, and stated that the Federation
 of Trade Unions in Iraq was created through free elections in
 which the majority of workers participated.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Iraq is an ethnically and religiously diverse society. Many
 non-Muslims, principally Jews and Christians, left Iraq under
 previous regimes. Members of religious minorities have
 expressed fear that they would again face persecution if Iran
 were to impose an Islamic regime in Baghdad. Ba'athism
 emphasizes the importance of secular government, but it is an
 anti-Communist ideology which acknowledges the central role of
 religion in Arab culture. Since its rise to power in 1968,
 the Ba'athist Government has enforced tolerance of religious
 diversity, seeking to submerge religious differences in the
 promotion of secular nationalism. However, the Government
 also works to unify the populace by attempting to hasten
 cultural assimilation. In some past instances, this has taken
 the form of trying to wean groups away from aspects of their
 cultural traditions, ethnic identities, and ways of life. The
 Sunni Muslim-dominated Government has relaxed implementation
 of this policy in most cases, and has more actively sought the
 support of ethnic and religious minorities and the
 underrepresented Shi'ite majority. In his Christmas-New Year
 message in December, President Hussein praised the
 contributions of Iraqi Christians in particular.
 A 1981 law gave the Ministry of Endowments and Religious
 Affairs the authority to promulgate laws and regulations
 governing places of worship, appointment of clergy, religious
 literature, and participation in religious councils and
 meetings. However, while the Government has assumed much
 greater authority in Islamic religious affairs since 1981, the
 law has not been invoked against Iraq's Christian sects.
 Religious leaders operate under close government supervision.
 Muslim leaders are considered government employees and receive
 their salaries through the Government. The Government
 administers the principal Muslim shrines and mosques and has
 increased allotments to refurbish and maintain them in an
 apparent attempt to win support from the devout.
 The Shi'a, who make up roughly 55 percent of the population,
 historically have been economically, politically, and socially
 disadvantaged. The Government has a declared policy to raise
 their living standards and equalize opportunities for economic
 and professional advancement. In recent years, the Government
 and Party have promoted Shi'a into prominent positions, and
 the economic and social status of the Shi'a has improved
 markedly. Nevertheless, the Government maintains a close
 watch against Iranian attempts to exploit dissatisfaction
 among Iraqi Shi'a, who share the same branch of Islam
 prevalent in Iran.
 
 
 1254
 IRAQ
 Over 500,000 Christians constitute nearly four percent of the
 population. Their freedom of worship in churches of
 established denominations is legally protected, but they are
 not permitted to proselytize or to hold meetings outside
 church premises. Convents and monasteries exist and some new
 churches are constructed, in some cases with government
 financial support. Although Christians sometimes allege
 discrimination in education and jobs, adherence to their
 religion has not prevented many from obtaining wealth and
 professional advancement. The Deputy Prime Minister and
 Foreign Minister, a Chaldean Christian, represented Iraq at
 the December meeting of foreign ministers of the Organization
 of the Islamic Conference. Other Christians hold important
 official and private positions. Many are successful
 businesspeople.
 The Jewish community is believed to have decreased from
 150,000 following World War II to about 400. It was severely
 persecuted in the past, but there is no evidence of recent
 persecution. In 1983 and in late 1984, Western journalists
 visited the last known synagogue in Baghdad and confirmed that
 it is still functioning. Only a handful of people, mostly
 older men, were seen attending services led by two rabbis.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Iraqis are generally free to travel within the country and to
 change their residences or work places. However, they are
 likely to be constrained by social, cultural, and religious
 traditions which define the areas occupied by the various
 ethnic and religious groups. Sensitive border and other
 security areas are off-limits. Civilian travel in the war
 zone is restricted. Curfews are in effect where Kurdish
 insurgents have been active. There are police checkpoints on
 highways and outside major towns, but most Iraqis and
 foreigners travel freely in nonrestricted areas. Foreign
 diplomats must obtain Foreign Ministry permits for travel
 outside of Baghdad, which are usually granted when requested
 sufficiently in advance.
 All Iraqis and most foreigners who have remained in the
 country for more than two weeks must obtain exit permission.
 Because of the war's drain on the economy, permission to
 travel abroad is restricted to a few categories of Iraqis,
 including officials, government-approved students, and persons
 needing medical treatment. Iraqis who have residences abroad
 may depart the country provided they originally had left
 before the war began. In general, a married woman must have
 the permission of her husband to travel abroad. The
 Government can require a prospective traveler to post a
 substantial oond to assure return. According to officials of
 the Higher Education Ministry, although Iraqi students abroad
 should get permission before accepting foreign scholarships or
 grants, they would not be punished upon return to Iraq for
 failure to have done so. If students on government
 scholarships abroad do not return, their families must repay
 the costs of the education.
 Even before travel restrictions went into effect, many Iraqis
 who wished to emigrate left the country surreptitiously.
 There is no specific ban on emigration nor special
 restrictions for members of minority groups; however,
 elaigration is discouraged. Prospective emigrants have had
 
 
 1255
 IRAQ
 travel permission delayed and have been harassed. Many
 emigrants leave behind substantial property because of the
 difficulty of exporting assets. Currency exchange violations
 are considered national security offenses, and penalties can
 be severe.
 A 1980 Revolutionary Command Council (RCC) resolution required
 alien spouses of Iraqi citizens who have resided in Iraq for
 at least five years (later shortened to three years) to become
 naturalized or leave Iraq. Many people, including several
 Americans, have thus been required to accept Iraqi
 citizenship. As Iraqi citizens, they are subject to the
 present travel restrictions. Therefore they are unable to
 leave unless they are in one of the privileged categories or
 receive special permission.
 In March 1984 another RCC resolution further reduced the
 residence period before naturalization to one year for the
 spouses of Iraqis employed at government offices. The Iraqi
 spouse faces penalties for noncompliance, including loss of
 job, a fine of approximately $10,000, and repayment of the
 costs of education.
 In recent years, the Government has instituted special
 programs to encourage repatriation of qualified
 professionals. Aliens of Iraqi origin can apply for a
 document permitting them to enter and exit Iraq without a
 visa. Former Iraqis can more easily obtain visitors' visas
 than other aliens, who generally must have an official sponsor.
 Other persons of Iraqi origin are permitted to return,
 including many individuals who were admitted to third
 countries as refugees. A number of such people, especially
 Assyrian Christians, have returned on temporary visits. They
 are free to come and go, within the limits of the present
 travel restrictions, since they are not considered to have
 violated Iraqi laws. However, those who emigrated only after
 the beginning of the Iran-Iraq war, including several U.S.
 permanent resident aliens, have been unable to depart Iraq.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Cnange Their Government
 The elitist Ba'ath Party, dominated by the President and the
 Party's Regional Command, rules Iraq. The Party reportedly
 has some 1.5 million adherents, representing about 10 percent
 of the population. However, only some 25,000 "active" or full
 members, less than 0.2 percent of the population, participate
 influentially in party activities. There are two other legal
 political parties, both Kurdish. They and the Ba'ath Party
 constitute the Patriotic and Progressive National Front,
 essentially a vehicle of support for the Government. The two
 non-Ba'ath parties carry on only limited activity. Members of
 the military or security services may engage in political
 activities only within the Ba'ath Party. Association with the
 Party is not required for appointment to senior government
 positions or military ranks or election to the National
 Assembly, but normally is necessary to attain political
 influence. Opposition groups, including various Kurdish
 groups and splinter parties, are severely repressed. The
 Comunist Party was removed from the National Front and
 declared illegal in 1979. In 1982 the Government amnestied
 Iraqi Communists both in Iraq and abroad, but the number
 released is unknown.
 
 40-387 0 - 85 - 80
 
 
 1256
 IRAQ
 The outlawed, Iranian-supported Da'wa (Islamic Call) Party has
 been a major target of persecution. It has claimed violent
 acts against the Government in Iraq and abroad, and was
 implicated in the December 1983 truck bombing of the U.S.
 Embassy and other U.S., French, and Kuwaiti targets in Kuwait.
 In October, general elections were held for the National
 Assembly, first elected in 1980. There had been no previous
 Assembly or elections since the overthrow of the monarchy in
 1958. Many candidates stood for the 250 seats in the 1980 and
 1984 elections, but the Government carefully screened all
 those nominated. Voter turnout among both sexes was heavy.
 Thirty-two women were elected in 1984, or twice as many as in
 1980. Official duties of the Assembly include ratification of
 the budget and international treaties; the right to question
 and relieve any cabinet minister of his post; the debate of
 domestic and foreign policies; the proposal and enactment of
 laws; and the supervision of state institutions. However, the
 Assembly thus far has exercised little real authority, in part
 because of the wartime centralization of power in the RCC.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Iraq has denied all charges of human rights violations. In
 its reply to Amnesty International's 1983 special report, the
 Government stated that there have been no political executions
 and that allegations of torture are false. It said the main
 aim of the allegations was 'to discredit the people of Iraq
 and its revolutionary government.' It offered to investigate
 allegations of torture made in a previous report if the
 victims, interviewed in exile, were identified and returned.
 The Human Rights Society, a semiofficial body of jurists and
 government officials, has an advisory role. It represents
 Iraq at international events and hosted a visiting Amnesty
 International delegation. There isno government office or
 official charged with investigating human rights and
 coordinating with other governments and international
 organizations on human rights.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) delegation
 based in Iraq has made regular visits to Iranian prisoners of
 war (POWs) since 1980 and has assisted in Iraq's unilateral
 repatriation of some of them, including 190 on January 29, and
 another 100 on October 20. Iraq has received the ICRC
 president and other delegates several times to discuss the
 treatment of POWs and the protection of civilians in the
 Iran-Iraq war. For several months following the ICRC's
 February 10 release of a memo on Iranian and Iraqi adherence
 to the Geneva Conventions and international humanitarian law,
 the Iraqi authorities refused to allow the ICRC to register
 and visit new prisoners, although the ICRC memo was more
 critical of Iran than Iraq. It noted that material conditions
 in POW camps in Iraq had improved and that the authorities had
 taken steps to end the random acts of brutality to which the
 ICRC had previously called their attention. However, the
 report expressed continued concern that the ICRC had been
 denied access to some prisoners held since the beginning of
 the war, and criticized Iraq's indiscriminate bombing of
 Iranian civilian areas. After meetings with ICRC President
 Alexander Hay in August, Iraq allowed the ICRC to continue its
 work generally unhindered. Iraq has threatened to reciprocate
 
 
 1257
 IRAQ
 Iranian abuse of Iraqi POWs, which includes killings,
 brainwashing, and denial of outside access. Following the
 ICRC's eyewitness report of Iranian killings of Iraqi POWs in
 October, Iraq called on the U.N. to investigate, and agreed to
 permit the U.N. team to first visit Iranian POWs in Iraq. The
 U.N. visit was scheduled for January 1985.
 At the request of the Government, in February the ICRC began
 to seek countries of permanent resettlement for Iranian
 civilian refugees. The Government has cooperated with the
 ICRC in these efforts, in the absence of the U.N. High
 Commissioner for Refugees, which the Government does not
 permit to operate in Iraq. More than 100 such refugees have
 left for several host countries, including the U.S.
 In its 1984 report, Amnesty International expressed concern
 about widespread arbitrary arrest of political suspects and
 their prolonged detention without charge or trial;
 disappearances; continued detention of civilians without legal
 proceedings in POW camps, apparently because of their ethnic
 origin; routine torture of detainees during interrogation and
 ill-treatment and detention of their families allegedly to
 exert pressure to cooperate during interrogation; and a large
 number of executions, mostly for political crimes. Freedom
 House calls Iraq "not free.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 During the first two years of the war, the Government largely
 isolated the people from its economic impact by pursuing an
 ambitious development program. However, the loss of Iraq's
 offshore export terminals and closure of its oil pipeline
 through Syria cut oil exports from a prewar high of 3.2
 million barrels to around 650,000 barrels per day. By late
 1982 Iraq's foreign exchange reserves were nearly exhausted.
 The Government instituted a strict austerity program and
 slashed civilian imports, putting Iraq on a sounder financial
 footing but reducing the availability of consumer goods and
 the varieties of food.
 Petroleum accounts for 95 percent of Iraq's export revenues.
 Consequently, the Government has given high priority to the
 restoration of oil export capacity. An expansion of the
 Turkish pipeline completed in July increased oil exports to
 approximately 1 million barrels per day. Iraq has contracted
 for a 500,000 barrel per day pipeline to connect with Saudi
 Arabia's Petroline and has signed a protocol for a new
 pipeline parallel to an existing one in Turkey. Both could be
 in place as early as 1986, greatly improving economic
 conditions.
 The Government exerts a high level of control over the
 economy. The State owns all major industries, including
 petroleum and banking. The small private sector is important
 in some industries. The regime has expanded the role of the
 private sector, particularly in agriculture.
 Per capita gross national product (GNP) almost quintupled
 during the 1970s, rising from $630 in 1970 to $3,021 in 1980.
 Much of this increase, however, represented a pro rata share
 of accumulated foreign exchange reserves resulting from higher
 oil prices. When oil earnings were cut sharply after the
 outbreak of war, per capita GNP declined dramatically to
 $1,742 in 1981. Per capita GNP probably has increased in

 nominal terms since then, largely as a result of price
 inflation and an artifically high exchange rate.
 Health care is free or provided at nominal cost. From 1968 to
 1980 government programs boosted the number of medical workers
 from 9,000 to over 40,000, and increased medical training
 institutions from 3 to 65. In 1980, there was 1 doctor for
 every 3,000 people. Serious shortages of qualified medical
 workers remain. Improvements in health care and access to
 safe drinking water helped raise life expectancy from 56.2 in
 1976-71 to 59.1 years in 1984, and decrease infant mortality
 to 80.7 per 1,000 live births. A 1984 law authorized highly
 cuncessional government loans to doctors to establish new
 private hospitals. The Minister of Health stated that the
 objective was to introduce private sector competition to
 contribute to a more efficient national health service.
 Iraq's population is estimated to approach 15 million, and its
 growth rate is about 3.3 percent. In 1975, 40 percent of the
 population was estimated to be below the absolute poverty
 level. Despite the hardships imposed by the war, this figure
 probably has declined as a result of higher oil prices and an
 ambitious economic development program undertaken since 1975.
 Education is free through the university level. The
 Government offers scholarships for advanced study abroad. The
 number of students studying abroad has decreased during the
 war. In the last 10 years, enrollment in primary and
 secondary schools has more than doubled. Female enrollment
 was largely responsible for the dramatic rise. The number of
 students in vocational schools and universities has increased
 markedly. According to the Government, implementation of the
 1977 Anti-illiteracy Law has raised the literacy rate to 70
 percent.
 The feudal system of land ownership came to an end with the
 overthrow of the monarchy. In April 1981, President Hussein
 abandoned a program to impose collective farms on the East
 European model and returned land to private ownership.
 Heavy migration from rural areas has resulted in substandard
 urban living conditions. Large-scale public housing projects
 are under construction. Subsidies and controls keep the
 prices affordable for most food staples, utilities, and
 transportation while other prices are rising.
 Since its founding outside Iraq in 1947, the Ba'ath Party has
 been committed to the equality of the sexes. The Ba'ath
 Party's Ninth Party Congress report of 1983 reiterated that
 the emancipation of women is a *natural and human right,' and
 an "essential condition for economic, social, and cultural
 development.'  A series of laws since the Ba'ath Party came to
 power in 1968 has steadily improved the status of women. Such
 laws have protected women from exploitation in the workplace;
 granted subsidized maternity leave; permitted women to join
 the regular army, Popular Army, and police forces; and
 equalized women's rights on divorce, land ownership, taxation,
 suffrage, and election to the National Assembly. In the
 1970s, the Government imposed legal penalties on families that
 opposed sending their women to literacy schools, and on men
 who were seen harassing women.
 The percentage of female students in elementary schools
 climbed from 37.4 percent in 1977-78 to 46.4 percent in

 1982-83. Secondary school female enrollment went from 29.2 to
 34.5 percent in the same period. About 32 percent of the
 students at universities and technical institutes are female.
 Women represent about 47 percent of agricultural workers and
 about 25 percent of the total work force. By 1977, women were
 reported to comprise 39 percent of teachers, 31 percent of
 doctors, 30 percent of chemists, 25 percent of physicists, 15
 percent of accountants, 15 percent of civil servants, and 11
 percent of factory workers. The war has accelerated the
 Government's drive to elevate the status of women, and some
 Iraqis believe that it has permanently broken cultural
 barriers to acceptance of women in traditional male roles.
 With official encouragement, women have become increasingly
 visible as architects, construction engineers, oil engineers,
 air traffic controllers, factory and farm managers, and Air
 Force pilots. Some 40,000 women reportedly were volunteers in
 the Popular Army in 1982.
 The General Federation of Iraqi Women (GFIW) was established
 in 1969, the regime's first year in power, to promote the
 Government's policies toward women. Membership in the GFIW
 does not require affiliation with the Ba'ath Party. The GFIW
 organizes conferences on women's issues, establishes training
 courses for women, implements programs to eradicate
 illiteracy, undertakes civilian war relief activities, and
 administers nurseries. It drew up a four-year plan (1983-86)
 to encourage women to work outside the home, and has opened
 four employment offices in Baghdad for women graduates.
