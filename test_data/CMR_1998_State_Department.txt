 CAMEROON
 Cameroon is a republic dominated by a strong presidency. Since independence, a
 single party, now called the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM), has
 remained in power and limited political choice. In October 1997 CPDM leader Paul
 Biya won reelection as President in an election boycotted by the three main opposi-
 tion parties and generally considered by observers to be marred by a wide range
 of procedural flaws and not free and fair. Although the Government legalized oppo-
 sition parties in 1990, after widespread protests, most subsequent elections, includ-
 ing the May 1997 legislative elections, which were dominated by the CPDM, were
 flawed by numerous irregularities. International and local observers generally con-
 sider the election process, which is controlled by the Government's Ministry of Terri-
 torial Administration, as not free and fair. No President has ever left office in con-
 sequence of an election. The President retains the power to control legislation or to
 rule by decree. In the National Assembly, government bills take precedence over
 other bills, and no bills other than government bills have been enacted since 1991,
 although legislation proposed by the Government sometimes has not been enacted
 by the Assembly. The President repeatedly has used his control of the legislature
 to change the Constitution. The 1996 Constitution lengthened the President's term
 
 
 of office to 7 years, while continuing to allow Biya to run for a fourth consecutive
 term in 1997. The Government has taken no formal action to implement other 1996
 constitutional changes that provide for new legislative institutions, including a par-
 tially elected senate and elected regional councils, and a more independent judici-
 ary, even though the President had announced in 1997 that most of these reforms
 would be implemented during 1998. Although the country's first local government
 elections were held in 1996, President Biya limited their scope by expanding the
 number of municipal governments headed by presidentially appointed "delegates"
 rather than permitting the election of mayors, especially in pro-opposition regions.
 The Government remained highly centralized. The judiciary is subject to political in-
 fluence and suffers from corruption and inefficiency, although it continued to show
 growing independence and integrity in some important respects.
 Internal security responsibilities are shared by the national police, the National
 Intelligence Service (DGRE), the gendarmerie, the Ministry of Territorial Adminis-
 tration, military intelligence, the army, and to a lesser extent, the Presidential Se-
 curity Service. The police and the gendarmerie have dominant roles in enforcing in-
 ternal security laws. The security forces, including the military forces, remain under
 the effective control of the President, the civilian Minister of Defense, and the civil-
 ian head of police. The security forces continued to commit numerous serious human
 rights abuses.
 Cameroon's population of about 14 million had a recorded mean per capita Gross
 National Product (GNP) of about $650. Following nearly a decade of economic de-
 cline, economic growth resumed in 1994 and has subsequently continued, due chiefly
 to large public sector salary cuts, a 50 percent currency devaluation, stabilization
 of terms of trade, and increased external preferential financing and debt relief. How-
 ever, economic recovery continues to be inhibited by a large inefficient parastatal
 sector, excessive public sector employment, growing defense and internal security
 expenditures, and by the Government's inability to collect internal revenues effec-
 tively, especially in economically important pro-opposition regions. Widespread cor-
 ruption in government and business also impedes growth. The civil service and the
 management of state-owned businesses have been dominated by members of the
 Beti and Bulu ethnic groups. The majority of the population is rural, and agri-
 culture accounts for 25 percent of GNP. Principal exports include timber, coffee,
 cocoa, cotton, bananas, and rubber. The Government also continued to receive sub-
 stantial assistance from international financial institutions.
 The Government's human rights record continued to be generally poor, and gov-
 ernment officials continued to commit numerous serious abuses. Citizens' ability to
 change their government remained limited. Security forces committed several
 extrajudicial killings and often beat and otherwise abused detainees and prisoners,
 generally with impunity. However, the Government began to prosecute some of the
 most egregious offenders; policemen were convicted and sentenced to prison terms
 for several extrajudicial killings, and in trials held in two prominent 1997 cases,
 both commissioners and policemen received prison sentences and fines. Conditions
 remained life threatening in almost all prisons. Security forces continued to arrest
 and detain arbitrarily various opposition politicians, local human rights activists,
 and other citizens, often holding them for prolonged periods and, at times, incommu-
 nicado. Security forces conducted illegal searches, harassed citizens, infringed on
 their privacy, and monitored some opposition activists. The judiciary remained cor-
 rupt, inefficient, and subject to political influence. The Government continued to im-
 pose some limits on press freedom. Although private newspapers enjoyed consider-
 able latitude to publish their views, journalists continued to be subject to official
 harassment, and the Government has increased its prosecutions of pro-opposition
 journalists under criminal libel laws. The Government obtained convictions against
 several journalists under these laws. A 1996 law revoked formal press censorship
 and moved supervision of the press from the administrative authorities to the
 courts, but the Government has not yet implemented a 1990 law designed to end
 its virtual monopoly of domestic broadcast media, and the Government continued
 to seize publications deemed threatening to public order, including newspapers. On
 several occasions, the Government restricted freedom of assembly and association.
 At times, the Government used its security forces to inhibit political parties from
 holding public meetings. Government security forces limited freedom of movement.
 Discrimination and violence against women remained serious problems. Female gen-
 ital mutilation persisted in some areas, despite government efforts to counter the
 practice. Discrimination against ethnic minorities was widespread and discrimina-
 tion against indigenous Pygmies continued. The Government continued to infringe
 on workers' rights, and child labor remained a problem. Slavery reportedly persisted
 in parts ofnorther Cameroon. Mob violence resulted in some deaths.

 In June, the Government launched a 6-month nationwide human rights aware-
 ness campaign via the government-controlled media, which was supplemented by
 seminars, parades, and other activities.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no confirmed reports of
 political killings. However, the security forces continued to use excessive, lethal
 force and committed several extrajudicial killings. On January 21, policemen from
 the Commissariat of the 12th arrondissement of Douala reportedly shot and killed
 28-year-old Serge Francois Massoma as he stepped out of his canoe in the Wouri
 River in Douala. According to his mother, the policemen previously had threatened
 to kill him. Three policemen reportedly were detained in connection with his death;
 their case had not been tried by year's end.
 In May three policemen were arrested on charges of having tortured and killed
 Lawrence Arrey. The police allegedly detained Arrey on suspicion of grand theft in
 Mbiako, a village near Edea, and interrogated him by.hanging him from a tree and
 physically abusing him in various ways until he died. The three policemen were
 charged, and in October were tried, convicted and sentenced to between 8 and 15
 years in prison.
 A policeman shot and-killed a 17-year-old male during the security forces' sup-
 pression of racial violence against white foreigners in June (see Section 5). The po-
 liceman, who claimed to have intended to shoot into the air, was questioned and
 provisionally released. The case remained under investigation at year's end.
 On June 20,, a policeman from the Douala Mobile Intervention Unit shot and
 killed truck driver Jean-Marie Penga at a roadblock. Eyewitness accounts state that
 the police initially gave Penga unclear signals to stop. Realizing that the police were
 hailing him, he slowed down and was shot in the back. The policeman responsible
 for the shooting was arrested a month later. The case was pending at year's end.
 On July 24, a policeman shot and killed Alain Thno Fossi, a 28-year-old Douala-
 based businessman, at a roadblock in the city as he pulled his car over. The police-
 man was arrested 4 days later. Fossi's funeral procession on July 30 was joined by
 about 2,000 Douala residents protesting police brutality. The case was said to be
 pending at year's end.
 On August 20, a policeman shot and killed a young street vendor named Leonard
 Ngono Fouda at the Mfoundi market in Yaounde for refusing to pay a 90 cent bribe
 and failing to remove his wares from the sidewalk. The policeman who shot Fouda
 later went to the hospital, dressed in civilian attire, to get an update on the victim
 (by then pronounced dead); he was recognized by the crowd and severely beaten.
 The policeman was tried and sentenced to up to 2 years in prison.
 In Dedember the Douala Court of First Instance sentenced policeman' Felix Nyem
 to 15 years in prison for shooting and killing a taxi driver in Douala, and ordered
 the police force to pay substantial damages to the family of the victim.
 Two high-profile cases of extrajudicial killing from the previous year were brought
 to a conclusion. On June 5, police officers Eroume A. Ngon and Alexandre Mvoutti
 were jailed for 5-year prison terms in connection with the November 1997 death in
 custody of mechanic Paul Njouomegni. The mechanic had died from beatings by the
 two arresting policemen, in part for having'resisted arrest and also allegedly over
 his later refusal to pay so-called "cell fees." The police commissioner responsible for
 Yaounde's fifth precinct, Bienvenue Motassie, received a 1-year suspended sentence
 in the case.
 On June 26, Police Commissioner Joseph Nsom Bekoungou, chief of Yaounde's
 third precinct, was sentenced to a 6-year jail term, and police inspector Jacques
 Bama received a 10-year sentence, in the November 1997 death of Emile Maah
 Njock, who was tortured to death while in their custody (see Section 1.c.). Njock had
 been arrested at home and charged with robbery. Interrogating officers beat him
 and applied an electric iron to his genitals and other parts of his body during a 3-
 day effort to extract a confession. Commissioner Bekoungou, who refused requests
 for Njock to receive medical attention, was dismissed from the force by executive
 order prior to conclusion of the trial.
 Credible reports by the press and the Movement for the Defense of Human Rights
 and Liberties (MDHRL), one of the few operating human rights organizations in the
 Far North province, describe an undetermined number of extrajudicial killings per-
 petrated by a newly established special antigang gendarmerie unit tasked with com-
 bating highwaymen ("coupeurs de route"). While some armed suspects were killed
 in firefights with the law-and-order forces, there were credible reports that others
 caught in the dragnet operations were executed summarily. The Maroua-based
 
 
 MDHRL estimated that over 300 persons were killed between April and July. At
 least one private newspaper, the Douala-based biweekly Mutations, also reported in
 August that security forces summarily executed hundreds of alleged highway rob-
 bers in northern Cameroon during recent years.
 Several prisoners died in custody due to abuse inflicted by members of the secu-
 rity forces or harsh prison conditions and inadequate medical treatment. Six detain-
 ees held after March 1997 attacks on government installations in Northwest prov-
 ince are reliably reported to have died from abuse or illness and inadequate care
 since their imprisonment (see Section 1.c.).
 Ongoing traditional conflicts in various areas resulted in several extrajudicial
 killings. Tribal wars opposing the fondoms (kingdoms) of Balikumbat and Bafanji,
 and te fondoms of Oku and Din, resulted in at least 15 deaths (13 and 2, respec-
 tively). Mob violence and summary justice directed against suspected thieves and
 those suspected of practicing witchcraft and other crimes resulted in a number of
 deaths and serious injuries, especially in large urban centers. The phenomenon be-
 came more prevalent in 1998 as banditry spread to rural areas.
 There were no developments in the 1997 killing of Faustin Fetsogo and in the
 case of the five persons killed in opposition politician Koulagne Nana's election cam-
 paign following a skirmish with the forces of a traditional ruler loyal to the ruling
 party.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no credible reports of politically motivated dis-
 appearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Penal Code proscribes torture, renders inadmissible in court evidence obtained
 thereby, and prohibits public servants from using undue force against any person;
 however, although President Biya also promulgated a new law in 1997 that bans
 torture by government officials, there were credible reports that security forces con-
 tinued to inflict beatings and other cruel and degrading treatment on prisoners and
 detainees. The authorities often administer beatings not in prison facilities but in
 temporary detention areas in a police or gendarme facility. Two forms of physical
 abuse commonly reported to be inflicted on detainees include the "bastinade," in
 which the victim is beaten on the soles of the feet, and the "balancoire," in which
 the victim, with his hands tied behind his back, is hung from a rod and beaten,
 often on the genitals. Nonviolent political activists have often been subjected to such
 punitive physical abuse during brief detentions following roundups of participants
 in antigovernment demonstrations or opposition phrty political rallies.
 Security forces subject prisoners and detainees to degrading treatment that in-
 cludes stripping, confinement in severely overcrowded cells, and denial of access to
 toilets or other sanitation facilities. Police and gendarmes often beat detainees to
 extract confessions and the names and whereabouts of alleged criminals. Pretrial
 detainees sometimes are required, under threat of abuse, to pay so-called "cell fees."
 Government officials at the Nkondengui and Mfou production prisons near
 Yaounde continued to inflict severe physcial abuse on the survivors of the as many
 as 75 Anglophones who were arrested in a security force dragnet following armed
 attacks in March 1997 on government facilities in the Northwest province. Fourteen
 of these detainees were released between February and November. At least six of
 the original detainees reportedly have died from abuse or lack of medical care: Em-
 manuel Konseh, Samuel Tita, Mathias Gwei, Neba Ambe, Mado Nde, and Richard
 Fomusoh Ngwa. As many as 56 reportedly remained in detention at year's end. Two
 individuals acquitted of the same charges by a military tribunal in 1997, and re-
 leased in March, stated that they had repeatedly been tortured, often by flogging,
 at the garrison of the Lakeside Gendarmerie Company in Yaounde; however, these
 allegations remained unconfirmed at year's end. Following a June visit to
 Nkondengui and Mfou prisons, Solomon Nfor Gwei, Chairman of the National Com-
 mission on Human Rights and Freedoms publicly criticized the conditions of these
 detainees. One reliable report described 28 detainees sharing a cell measuring 14
 square meters (about 140 square feet). At year's end, nine of the surviving detainees
 reportedly were in life-threatening medical condition due to lack of adequate medi-
 cal care. One of the surviving detainees, Derek Akwang, a former student from the
 University of Buea, was reportedly both mentally and physically ill due to the condi-
 tions of his confinement.
 On the night of January 3, soldiers of the 21st Reconnaissance Battalion broke
 into the St. Paul's Parish Hall in Nylon, near Douala International Airport, beat
 and stabbed the priest and several young people, raped young women, and stole
 funds. Thirty soldiers were reportedly arrested in connection with this incident. In
 October the Douala Military Tribunal reportedly began to try 25 soldiers allegedly
 involved. The case was not known to have been concluded by year's end.
 
 
 44
 On April 16-17, personnel of the 11th Navy Battalion went on a looting and pil-
 laging spree in -the Anglophone Southwest province towns of Ekondo Titi, Lobe, and
 Masore. Navy personnel beat villagers, raped women and schoolgirls, and stole pri-
 vate belongings. The commanding officers of the naval personnel involved reportedly
 were reprimanded and the troops involved reportedly were punished, but the nature
 of their punishment is not known.
 On June 16, during activities in Yaounde to commemorate a UNICEF-sponsored
 "African Day of the Child," gendarmes beat children, mostly between 6 and 15 years
 old, and lashed them with military belts, ostensibly to maintain order. The violence
 began when UNICEF staff began distributing free t-shirts and the children report-
 edly became unruly. A number of children required medical treatment. By year's
 end,.no charges were known to have been brought against the gendarmes involved.
 On June 19, gendarmes brutalized a number of persons in Ngoro, a small town
 in Center province, following a confrontation over labor contract conditions between
 inhabitants and the owners of a timber company.
 On October 10, a gendarme shot a Nigerian trader reportedly named Donatus
 Emelayo-Ume in the leg in the Mvog-Ava neighborhood of Yaounde. The victim re-
 portedly told journalists that he was shot after he refused to -pay a bribe to gen-
 darmes. The gendarme claimed that he tried to fire into the air. By year's end, no
 action was known to have been taken against this gendarme.
 On the night of November 14, about 20 navy cadets went on a looting spree in
 Limbe, a port town in the Anglophone Southwest province, stealing goods from
 shops and bars, beating civilians, allegedly raping women, and causing 30 people
 to require medical attention. At year's end, an investigation was in progress.
 Despite the unusual convictions of officials responsible for the fatal beatings of
 two individuals held in government custody (see Section l.a.), severe beatings of de-
 tainees continued to occur. On February 20, Philip Afuson Njaro, a journalist for
 the Engish-language newspaper, The Herald, was arrested by poice in Ekondo Titi,
 allegedly because he had written, several articles about the corrupt practices of the
 chief of the local border police and his men. Medical reports confirmed that he suf-
 fered serious trauma from blows to the head and jaw. The police chief was removed
 several months later after a series of other complaints. In November gendarmes se-
 verely beat Rene Dassie, a journalist for the-French-language Douala-based tri-
 weekly, Le Messager, while he was in their custody (see Section 2.a.).
 Prison conditions remained generally life threatening, especially outside major
 urban areas. Serious deficiencies in food, health care, and sanitation due to a lack
 of funds occur in almost all prisons, including those in the north operated by tradi-
 tional rulers. Several prisoners died due to harsh prison conditions and inadequate
 medical treatment. One credible source who spent time in Douala's New Bell prison
 indicated that an average of at least six persons per month died in 1998 due to such
 conditions. In December, 20 cases of tuberculosis reportedly were diagnosed at New
 Bell.
 In New Bell and other nonmaximum-security penal detention centers, families are
 permitted- to provide food and medicine to inmates. However, beatings are common.
 Prisoners reportedly are chained or flogged at times in their cells and often are de-
 nied adequate medical care. Juveniles and nonviolent prisoners often are incarcer-
 ated with violent adults. There are credible reports of sexual abuse of juvenile pris-
 oners by adult inmates. Corruption among prison personnel is widespread. Some
 high-profile prisoners are able to avoid some of the abuse that security forces rou-
 tinely inflict on many common criminals. Some are held in elite wings of certain
 risons, where they enjoy relatively lenient treatment. A 1997 report on prison con-
 itions indicated that Bertoua Prison, which was built to hold 50 detainees, housed
 over 700 persons. However, the Government permitted increased access to some
 prisons by some nongovernmental organizations (NGO's), religious groups and en-
 tertainers.
 In the north, the Government permits traditional Lamibe (chiefs) to detain per-
 sons outside the government penitentiary system. The places of detention in the pal-
 aces of the traditional chiefs of Rey Bouba, Gashiga, Bibemi, and Tcheboa have the
 worst reputations. Members of the National Union for Democracy and Progress
 (UNDP) party, which was in opposition until late 1997, have alleged that other
 UNDP members have been detained in these private jails and that some have died
 from mistreatment.
 Because of the Governments refusal to ensure that representatives of the Inter-
 national Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) have access to all detention centers,
 unofficial as well as official, the ICRC declined to visit any prisons from 1992 until
 December, although both the Cameroonian Red Cross and the National Human
 Rights Commission made frequent prison visits. However, in December the ICRC
 obtained written agreement from the Government to have access to all detention
 
 
 centers and prisons. The agreement followed a complete exchange, on November 24,
 of Cameroonian and Nigerian prisoners of war captured during conflicts since 1994
 over the Bakassi penninsula. The Cameroonian authorities granted the ICRC week-
 ly visits to the Nigerian prisoners of war during the entire period of their incarcer-
 ation according to the provisions of the Geneva convention, even though Nigeria did
 not reciprocate until shortly before the prisoner exchange.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Penal Code requires that detainees
 be brought promptly before a magistrate; however, security forces continued to ar-
 rest and detain citizens arbitrarily. Arbitrary, prolonged detention remained a seri-
 ous problem, as security forces often failed to bring detainees promptly before a
 magistrate and sometimes held them incommunicado.
 Police legally may detain a person in custody in connection with a common crime
 for up to 24 hours, renewable three times, before bringing charges. However, the
 law provides for the right to a judicial review of the legality of detention only in
 the two Anglophone provinces. Elsewhere, the French legal tradition applies, pre-
 cluding judicial authorities from acting on a case until the administrative authority
 that ordered the detention turns the case over to the prosecutor. After a magistrate
 has issued a warrant to bring the case to trial, he may hold the detainee in adminis-
 trative or "pretrial detention" indefinitely, pending court action. Furthermore, a
 1990 law permits detention without charge by administrative authorities for renew-
 able periods of 15 days, ostensibly in order to combat banditry and maintain public
 order. Persons taken into detention frequently are denied access to both legal coun-
 sel and family members. The law permits release on bail only in the Anglophone
 provinces, where the legal system includes features of British common law. Even
 there, bail is granted infrequently.
 On March 22, Brice Nitcheu, an opposition activist and member of the committee
 for the liberation of imprisoned journalist Pis Nawe (see Section 2.a.), was ar-
 rested without a warrant at Douaa International Airport prior to boarding an over-
 seas flight to campaign for Njawe's release. He remained in custody at the airport
 for 24 hours and later was released but required to report his presence to territorial
 surveillance police every 48 hours. On March 24, Aboubakar Oumarou Bongo, a
 businessman and former UNDP National Assembly deputy when that party was in
 opposition to the Government, was arrested in Maroua, detained on unspecified
 charges, held for 4 days and released. On April 29, Augustine Ndangamn, a member
 of the National Executive Committee of the opposition Social Democratic Front
 (SDF) party and vice chairman of a separate organization advocating greater auton-
 omy for Caieroon's Anglophone region, was arrested without a warrant in
 Bamenda. He was released on May 18 without any charges having been filed
 against him. Gendarmes arrested two civilian local government officials elected as
 candidates of the opposition SDF party, Kumba deputy mayor and SDF member
 Ferdinand Asabngu and Douala deputy imayor John Kumasa, on August 30 and
 September 7, respectively, on instructions from a military tribunal investigating the
 March 1997 violence in the Northwest province. The two deputy mayors were held
 without charges until September 14, when they were released for lack of evidence.
 In November two journalists were briefly detained without charges, and one was
 beaten by gendarmes while in custody (see Section 2.a.).
 On April 30, Moise Moubitang, a civil servant at the Ministry of Communications,
 was assaulted by the bodyguard of the Minister of Culture for not stopping his work
 when the visiting minister entered his work area. Moubitang was arrested but re-
 leased a few hours later, following an intervention by his own minister.
 Between February and November, the Government released 14 detainees held fol-
 lowing armed attacks against government installations in the Anglophone North-
 west province in March 1997 (see Section 1.e.). At year's end, as many as 56 detain-
 ees remained in prison awaiting trial by a military tribunal on charges of having
 participated in those attacks. Although the chairman of the government-established
 human rights organization publicly criticized .the conditions of their incarceration
 (see Section 1.c.), the Government did not respond to the report. In the absence of
 public trials to ascertain the facts, the circumstances of the March 1997 attacks re-
 mained unclear and were the subject of much speculation. For example, some ob-
 servers have suggested that the attacks, which were described in the government
 media as the work of Anglophone separatists, may have been instigated with the
 connivance of government authorities to discredit the Anglophone-led SDF opposi-
 tion party or to give the Government a pretext to impose additional security in a
 strongly pro-SDF province during the 1997 legislative elections.
 The Government does not practice forced political exile. Some opposition members
 who considered themselves threatened by the Government have left the country vol-
 untarily and declared themselves to be in political exile. In December a noted polii-
 
 
 cal cartoonist, Nyemb Ntoogue, also known as Popoli, fled Cameroon after being
 harassed and threatened by unknown persons (see Section 2.a.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary; however, the jutdiciary remains highly subject to political influence and cor-
 ruption. The court system remains technically part of the executive branch, subordi-
 nate to the Ministry of Justice. The Constitution specifies that the President is the
 guarantor of the legal system's independence. He also appoints judges with the ad-
 vice of the Supreme Council of the Magistrature. However, during the 1990's, ele-
 ments of the judiciary began to show some modest signs of growing independence.
 For example, in 1992 the Supreme Court publicly itemized numerous flaws in Presi-
 dent Biya's reelection. In 1996 courts voided 18 municipal elections that the Min-
 istry of Territorial Administration had declared won by ruling party candidates, and
 ordered the Ministry to hold them again (see Section 3). Since 1997, the courts re-
 peatedly have used powers given them under the 1996 press law to order the Min-
 istry of Territorial Administration to desist from seizing print runs of newspapers
 critical of the Government (see Section 2.a.).
 The court system includes the Supreme Court, a court of appeals in each of the
 10 provinces, and courts of first instance in each of the country's 58 divisions. Some
 politically sensitive cases never are heard.
 Military tribunals may exercise jurisdiction over civilians not only when the Presi-
 dent declares martial law, but also in cases involving organized armed violence,
 such as the armed attack on government facilities in the Northwest province shortly
 before the 1997 legislative elections. A law on the organization of the judiciary pro
 mulgated in April transferred jurisdiction over gang crimes, grand banditry and
 highway robbery to military tribunals.
 Traditional courts are important in rural areas. Their authority varies by region
 and ethnic group, but they are often the arbiters of property and domestic disputes
 and may serve a probate function as well. Most traditional courts permit appeal of
 their decisions to traditional authorities of higher rank.
 Corruption and inefficiency- in the -courts remain serious problems. Justice fre-
 quently is delayed or denied. Powerful political or business interests appear to enjoy
 virtual immunity from prosecution, while critics of the Government sometimes are
 jailed under libel statutes considered by observers as unduly restrictive of press
 freedom (see Section 2.a.). Prisoners may be detained indefinitely during pretrial
 proceedings.
 The legal structure is strongly influenced by the French legal system, although
 in the Anglophone provinces certain aspects of the Anglo-Saxon tradition apply. The
 Constitution provides for a fair public hearing in which the defendant is presumed
 innocent. Because appointed attorneys receive little compensation, the quality of
 legal representation for indigent persons is often poor. The Bar Association and
 some voluntary organizations, such as the Cameroonian Association of Female Ju-
 rists, offer free assistance in some cases. Trials are normally public, except in cases
 with political overtones judged disruptive of social peace.
 Titus Edzoa, former Minister of Health and longtime presidential aide, who had
 declared himself a candidate to oppose incumbent President Biya in the October
 1997 elections, remains incarcerated, together with Michel Atangana, his campaign
 manager. They were sentenced in 1997 to 15 years' imprisonment on embezzlement
 and corruption charges, for which Edzoa was arrested shortly after declaring his
 presidential candidacy (see Section 3). At year's end, Edzoa reportedly was still held
 in confinement at the maximum security gendarmerie headquarters, in cramped
 quarters with very limited access to visitors. His appeal, originally scheduled for Oc-
 tober, had been postponed indefinitely. As in previous years, there were no reliable
 estimates of the number of political prisoners held at the end of the year.
 f Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 preamble of the Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home, for the pro-
 tection against search except by virtue of law, and for the privacy of all correspond-
 ence. These, however, are subject to the "higher interests of the State." There were
 a number of credible reports that police and gendarmes harassed citizens, conducted
 searches without warrants, and opened or seized mail. Security forces frequently
 used roadblocks to extract bribes. The Government continued to keep some opposi-
 tion activists and dissidents under surveillance.
 The law permits a police officer to enter a private home during daylight hours
 without a warrant if he is pursuing an inquiry and has reason to suspect that a
 crime has been committed. The officer must have a warrant to make such a search
 after dark. However, a police officer may enter a private home at any time in pur-
 suit of a criminal observed committing a crime. An administrative authority may
 authorize police to conduct neighborhood sweeps in search of suspected criminals or
 
 
 47
 stolen or illegal goods without individual warrants. Such roundups are conducted
 freuently.
 Sweeps involving forced entry into homes occurred in Yaounde, Ekondo Titi,
 Maroua, and Kousseri at various times throughout the year. Typically, security
 forces seal off a neighborhood, search homes one after another, arrest persons with-
 out identification, and seize suspicious or illegal articles. In Douala, in January, sol-
 diers broke into a church parish hall, stabbed and beat up the parish priest and
 youths, raped young women, and stole money (see Section 1.c.). In towns in the
 Southwest province in April and in November, navy personnel looted and raped in
 private homes and shops that they entered without any legal justification (see Sec-
 tion 1.c.). At some airports, police officers occasionally prevented persons from trav-
 eling abroad with copies of local independent newspapers. The Government intensi-
 fied its restrictions on the reception of international cable and satellite television
 broadcasts (see Section 2.a.).
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion and of the press; however, the Government continued to impose some limits on
 these rights. The Penal Code's libel laws specify that defamation, abuse, contempt
 and dissemination of false news are offenses punishable by prison terms and heavy
 fines. These various criminal libel statutes are sometimes invoked by the Govern-
 ment to silence criticism of the Government and government officials.
 While 40 to 50 private newspapers are published sporadically, only about 15 were
 published on a regular basis uring the year. Most of these newspapers continued
 to be highly critical of President Biya, his Government, its corruption, and its eco-
 nomic policies. However, private journalists continued to practice greater self-cen-
 sorship than they did before the Government's 1994-95 crackdown on the private
 press.
 In 1996 the Government repealed the law that had authorized the Government
 both to censor private publications and extrajudicially to seize publications "dan-
 gerous to public order" or suspend newspapers' publication licenses. Previously, the
 Government often had taken these extrajudicial actions to inflict economic damage
 on newspapers critical of the Government, and had done so especially often during
 election years.
 Since 1997 formal censorship has ceased in fact as well as law. In addition, sei-
 zures of print runs of private newspapers and other interference with private news-
 paper distribution appear to have become less frequent. Nevertheless, the Ministry
 of Territorial Administration ignored some court orders to desist from seizing news-
 paper print runs in 1997, and government authorities seized print runs of private
 newspapers on at least three occasions during the year. Most recently, on December
 29 and 30, security forces in Yaounde seized copies of an edition of L'Expression de
 Mamy Wata, a private Douala-based satirical weekly, which contained cartoons in-
 sinuating that President Biya beat his wife for failure to accompany him to a soccer
 game. The Government is not known to have suspended or revoked the publication
 licenses of any newspapers during the year. After a 16-month suspension, La
 Nouvelle Expression, a private Douala-based weekly, resumed publication in June.
 The paper had been banned by the Minister for Territorial Administration in 1996
 for suggesting that the minister's family had had a role in the collapse of a local
 bank.
 In February, Nyemb Ntoogue, also known as "Popoli," a cartoonist affiliated with
 Le Messager, a Douala-based French-language triweekly, was beaten by bailiffs dur-
 ing their seizure of computer equipment belonging to that paper to satisfy damages
 awarded in a libel suit. Following his arrest on February 20, Philip Afuson Njaro,
 a journalist for the English-language newspaper, The Herald, was severely beaten
 on the head and jaw by police in Ekondo Titi, allegedly because he wrote about cor-
 rupt practices of the chief of the local border police and his men (see Section 1.c.).
 In November gendarmes arrested, detained and severely beat Rene Dassie, a jour-
 nalist with Le Messager, who was covering tribal violence at Makenene; however,
 he was released when the gendarmerie commander was made aware of his case.
 Since 1996, the Government has more frequently prosecuted its critics in the print
 media under the criminal libel laws. These laws authorized the Government, at its
 discretion and at the request of the plaintiff, to criminalize a civil libel suit, or to
 initiate a criminal libel suit in cases of alleged libel against the President and other
 high government officials.
 During 1998 or late 1997, the Government arrested, prosecuted or convicted a
 number of members of the press on criminal libel charges. On Christmas Eve 1997,
 the authorities detained Pius Njawe, a well-known human rights activist and pub-
 lisher of Le Messager, a private Douala-based triweekly, for publishing an article
 
 
 48
 speculating that President Biya may have had a heart attack. At the time, Njawe
 eady was awaiting review of appeals on two prior 1996 libel convictions. In Feb-
 ruary he was sentenced to a 2-year prison term and a fine of 500,000 CFA Francs
 (about $800). In April an appeals court reduced Njawe's prison sentence to 1 year
 and the fine to 300,000 CFA Francs (about $500), and in October, President Biya
 pardoned Njawe, who had spent 10 months in prison on all three libel charges.
 Michel Michaut Moussala, publisher of Aurore Plus, another private Douala-based
 weekly, was sentenced to a 6-month prison term and fined 1 million CFA Francs
 (about $1,700) in January. Moussala had been charged with libel by Jean Lavoisier
 Tchouta Moussa Mbatkam, then General Manager of the Cameroon Ports Authority,
 now a CPDM National Assembly member, whom Moussala described as being in-
 volved in illegal weapons importation. In September, Moussala was arrested at his
 home and began serving his sentence at Douala's New Bell Prison.
 In November Le Quotidien, a Douala-based French-language daily, suspended
 publication after a court fined it 25 million CFA francs (about $44,000) pursuant
 to criminal libel convictions for three articles. Le Quotidien's publisher, Benjamin
 Zebaze, appealed the decision-and reportedly hoped to resume publishing.
 On December 5, the Yaounde Court of First Instance reportedly sentenced
 Simplice Moussinga, a journalist for Mutations, a French-language biweekly, to 6
 months in prison and a small fine for a criminal libel conviction. The Court also con-
 victed Haman Mana, the publisher of Mutations, of criminal libel in the same case,
 and sentenced him to a small fine and a suspended prison term.'The Court also or-
 dered Mana and the owners of Mutations to pay 600,000 CFA francs (about $1,000)
 to the plaintiff, former Minister 'of Territorial Administration Jean Mengueme;
 Mutations had published an article alleging that Mengueme had embezzled funds
 intended for the victims of a natural disaster in 1986.
 In July Patrick Tchoua, publisher of Le Jeune Detective, was arrested for a June
 25 article in which he charged that the Minister of State for Finance had conspired
 to embezzle public funds with an accomplice at an overseas diplomatic mission. He
 was sentenced to a fine of 500,000 CFA francs (about $850) and an 8-month sus-
 pended sentence, but was released only on December 4 due to "administrative
 delays."
 Moreover, the Government's use of criminal libel laws to restrict press freedom
 is not limited to cases that are brought to trial. For example, in February, internal
 security officials briefly detained and interrogated Haman Mana and Alain Blaise
 Baongue, two journalists working for Mutations, questioning them about the sources
 of a recent Mutations article about government-attempts to monitor and control the
 Confederation of Cameroonian Trade Unions (CCTU) labor organization (see Section
 6.a.). Similarly, in October former Minister of Higher Education Peter Agbor Tabi
 accused three independent newspapers-L'Anecdote, Perspectives Hebdo, and The
 Herald--of libeling him in diverse ways. Government prosecutors subsequently
 questioned three journalists of these newspapers, asking them to reveal their
 sources. On November 3, Agbaw Ebai, a journalist affiliated with The Herald, was
 detained for several hours on this account, but there had been no arrests or prosecu-
 tions in any of these cases as of year's end. Also in October, the Ministry of Youth
 and Sports sent letters to three private newspapers-Le Messager, Aurore Plus, and
 L'Effort Cainerounais-warning that the Minister, Joseph Owona, might file crimi-'
 nal libel suits against them, if they did not desist from publishing reports on
 Owona's alleged mismanagement of the funds of Cameroon's national soccer team;
 no formal action had yet been taken at year's end, and the newspaper report's on
 Owona's alleged mismanagement continued. There were credible reports that gov-
 ernment ministers and other high officials commonly offered to drop criminal libel
 suits in exchange for cash payments from newspapers or journalists.
 In November Christopher Ezieh Andu, a journalist with The Herald, was arrested
 by order of the Governor of the Southwest province, Peter Acham Cho, on charges
 of disseminating false information. He was released two days later, and no charges
 were filed against him.
 On December 26, the Littoral Court of Appeals in Douala upheld a lower court's
 1997 criminal ibel conviction of Severn Tchounkeu, pubisher of the Douala-based
 French-langauge triweekly, La Nouvele Expression. Tchounkeu had published a re-
 port that the wife of Tchouta Moussa Mbatkam, then General Manager of the Na-
 tional Ports authority, had delivered a suitcase full of cash to a French intelligence
 officer at a Douala hotel in February 1997. The appeals court -ordered Tchounkeu
 and his newspaper to pay damages of 4 million CFA Francs (about $7,000), a sum
 seven times greater than the penrlty and damages awarded by lower court. The ap-
 peals court also gave Tchounkeu a suspended prison sentence of 3 months, which
 he might be required to serve if he were to be convicted of another criminal libel
 
 
 49
 charge during the following 3 years; the lower court had not imposed any prison
 sentence.
 In December the Government criminalized a libel suit filed against Tchounkeu,
 Nouvelle Expression reporter Henriette Ekwe, and SDF opposition party chairman
 John Fru Ndi. In October Fru Ndi, in an interview with Ekwe that Tchounkeu had
 published in Nouvelle Expression, reportedly stated that Basile Kandoum had em-
 ezzled party funds while serving as the SDF's coordinator for Center province sev-
 eral years earlier. Kandoum, who had run unsuccessfully for the position of sec-
 retary general of the SDF and subsequentlyhad left theparty, fied a civil libel suit
 agnst Tchounkeu, Ekwe, and Fr Nd in November. The state counsel initiated a
 ibel prosecution, and the criminal ibel trial opened in December in the Yaounde
 Court of First Instance. At year's end the trial remained inprogress.
 There were no developments in several other outstanding criminal libel cases
 against private journalists. Tietcheu Kameni and Paul Nyemb, who had been con-
 victed with Njawe in 1996, as well as Eyoum Ngangue, all remained at liberty
 awaiting the outcome of longstanding appeals of their prior libel convictions. The
 conviction of Vianney Ombey Ndzana, involving a 5-month prison term and suspen-
 sion of his license to publish Generations, a Yaounde-based newspaper, remained
 under appeal.
 The case of Patrice Ndedi Penda, publisher of Galaxie, who was sentenced in 1996
 to 2 years in prison and a large fine for having libeled the Minister of State for Agri-
 culture, remained under appeal. The 1996 cases of Samuel Eleme, publisher of the
 paper, La D6tente, and its correspondent Gaston Ekwalla also remain under appeal,
 and the paper remained suspended.
 Phillip Afuson Njaru, correspondent for a Younde-based English-language tri-
 weekly newspaper, The Herald, was subjected to sustained harassment by the local
 police commissioner in the Ndian Division of the Southwest province (see Section
 1.c.). He was detained and abused on several occasions.
 Nyemb Ntoogue, also known as "Popoli," the editor-in-chief and main cartoonist
 of the popular French-language Douala-based biweekly satirical newspaper, Le
 Messager Popoli, fled the country on December 14. In the December 29 issue of his
 newspaper, Ntoogue stated that he had fled following persistent death threats cul-
 minating in a December 11 attack on his Douala home by unidentified men who
 broke down the door with machetes and told his sister that they would "chop
 (Ntoogue) up into pieces."
 The Government publishes an official newspaper, The Cameroon Tribune. Govern-
 ment reporters rarely criticize the ruling party or portray government programs in
 an unfavorable light, but sometimes do so implicitly. In April Antoine Marie Ngono,
 deputy director of the state-owned broadcast media monopoly, reportedly was inter-
 rogated by prosecutors in Yaounde because he had insulted magistrates in an edi-
 torial on corruption.
 Moreover, the Government continues to operate almost all domestic broadcast
 media, and to determine the content of radio and television broadcasts, which reach
 far more citizens than the domestic print media. Because of their relatively high
 cost, as well as distribution problems, newspapers are not read widely outside the
 major cities. In 1990 and again in 1995, laws were enacted that provided for the
 licensing of private radio and television stations, but the Government has not ap-
 proved implementing regulations, despite repeated public promises to do so. Since
 1997 the Government for the first time has allowed limited exceptions to its monop-
 oly of broadcast media: it has licensed five low-power rural radio stations, which are
 not allowed to discuss politics, and a Catholic Church station in Yaounde whose
 service is limited to relaying the programs of Vatican Radio. However, the Govern-
 ment intensified its restrictions on the reception of international cable and satellite
 television broadcasts. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications reportedly re-
 moved several miles of privately installed television cables, and the government-ap-
 pointed chief executive of Yaounde's municipal government reportedly instructed
 cable and satellite television companies to cease operations pending implementation
 of the 1990 law to liberalize the broadcast media. Like The Cameroon Tribune, the
 government-controlled radio and television monopoly, CRTV, provides broad report-
 ing of CPDM functions, while giving relatively little attention to the political opposi-
 tion. At least until December, CRTV management continued to instruct CRTV staff
 to ensure that government views prevail at all times in CRTV broadcasts, and en-
 forced these instructions. In December the head of CRTV publicly criticized this
 practice, calling for reform.
 Television and radio programming include a weekly program, Expression Directe,
 which ostensibly fulfills the Government's legal obligation to provide an opportunity
 for all political parties represented in the National Assembly to present their views.
 The CRTV arbitrarily suspended the program at the start of the 1997 legislative
 
 
 50
 election campaign. After that election-when the SDF, the leading opposition party,
 for the first time became entitled legally to air its views on the program-Expres-
 sion Directs remained off the air until May 1998, when the CRTV resumed broad-
 casting the program under pressure from opposiion party members of the National
 Assembly. Howeve, in July and August, CRTV management refused to broadcast
 two contributions from the opposition SDF p arty that criticized President Biya's ab-
 sence from some international meetings and alleged mismanagement of government
 funds for the national soccer team.
 On December 18-19, SDF party activists injured some journalists in the course
 of breakirig up a party congress held by an SDF splinter faction purporting to rep-
 resent the party (see Section 2.b.). Among the injured was a journalist from the pri-
 vate newspaper, Le Messager, who suffered a dislocated jaw. The Secretary General
 of the SDF subsequently apologized publicly to members of the press caught up in
 the fracas.
 Although there are no legal restrictions on academic freedom, state security in-
 formants operate on university campuses. Many professors believe that adherence
 to opposition political parties can have an adverse effect on their professional oppor-
 tunities and advancement. Free political discussion at the University of Yaounde is
 dampened by the presence of armed government security forces.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for freedom
 of assembly, but the Government sometimes restricts this right in practice. The
 Penal Code prohibits public meetings, demonstrations, or processions without prior
 government approval. Over 150 poitical parties operaed legally together with a
 large and growing number of civic associations. Continuing its pattern throughout
 the 1990's of allowing opposition political parties greater freedom of assembly dur-
 ing nonelection years than during election years, the Government restricted freedom
 of assembly less in 1998 than it did in 1997. Public opposition party events were
 held more freely and more frequently in the southern provinces, including in the
 capital, where in some previous years security forces repeatedly used violence to dis-
 rupt opposition party meetings even on private property. However, in July the Gov-
 ernment prevented a round table conference organized by a reformist faction of a
 government-dominated labor union confederation from taking place at the Hilton
 Hotel in Yaounde, on the grounds that it might provoke public disorder.
 On December 16, in Yaounde, SDF party activists forcibly disrupted a party con-
 gress called by a small new SDF splinter faction, led by former SDF first vice presi-
 dent Souleymane Mahamat, that purported to represent the main body of the party.
 The SDF militants considered Souleymane's congress to be an illegal convention;
 their actions forced suspension of the proceedings.
 The law provides for freedom of association, and the Government generally re-
 spected this right in practice during the year. The conditions for government rec-
 ognition of a political p arty, a prerequisite for many poitical activities, were not on-
 erous. However, the Government was widely suspected of fomenting splits in the
 main opposition party, the SDF, as a pretext to withdraw official recognition from
 the main body of the party led by John Fm Ndi. In 1993, following a split in an-
 other opposition party, the Government had withdrawn official recognition from the
 main faction and conferred it on a smaller but more accommodating faction.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government generally does not restrict it in practice. Religious groups must be ap-
 proved and registered with the Ministry of Territorial Administration in order to
 function legally; there are no reports that the Government refused to register any
 Christian denomination. Christian churches of various denominations operate freely
 throughout the country. Muslim centers also operate freely throughout the country.
 During the 1997 presidential election campaign, government representatives ver-
 bally attacked the Catholic Church for being overly supportive of the political oppo-
 sition through its forthright criticism of corruption and mismanagement in govern-
 ment. On Sunday, March 15, security forces interrogated Ofon Ombaku Nyambi,
 pastor of a Presbyterian church in Santa, in the Northwest province, concerning a
 sermon Nyambi had preached earlier the same day. In his sermon, Nyambi report-
 edy blamed the Biya administration for the poverty that had led to the February
 looting of a Yaounde fuel depot that then exploded, killing about 200 persons.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law does not restrict freedom of movement within the country, but
 government security forces routinely impede domestic travel. Police frequently stop
 travelers to check identification documents, vehicle registrations, and tax receipts
 as security and immigration control measures. Police commonly demand bribes from
 citizens whom they stop at roadblocks or other points.
 Roadblocks and checkpoints manned by security forces have proliferated in cities
 and most highways and make road travel both time-consuming and costly, since ex-
 
 
 51
 tortion of small bribes is commonplace at these checkpoints. Violent and sometimes
 fatal confrontations have occurred repeatedly at such checkpoints when travelers
 would not or could not pay the bribes demanded by the security forces (see Section
 l.a.).
 The Government continued to use its passport control powers against some critics
 and political opponents. In March journalist Brice Nitcheu, a member of a commit-
 tee seeking to liberate imprisoned newspaper editor Pius Njawe (see Section 2.a.),
 was arrested at Douala Airport prior to flying to Europe to publicize calls for
 Njawe's release. His passport was confiscated.
 Two ministers who were dropped from the Government in a December 1997 cabi-
 net reshuffle had their official passports temporarily withdrawn. One of them,
 Dakole Daissala, former Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, claimed to have
 been prevented from travelling privately to France in May. However, he reportedly
 recovered his travel document a short time later and used it to go abroad.
 In February authorities at Douala International Airport prevented Norbert
 Ouendji, a journalist working with a private newspaper, Le Messager, from board-
 ing his overseas flight because he was carrying issues of that newspaper in his bag.
 In August Henri Fotso, another journalist with Le Messager, was detained briefly
 by police at Douala International Airport because he also was carrying copies of Le
 Messager, in addition to a copy of a book he had written on human rights. He was
 held for 2 hours and released after his flight had taken off.
 Cameroon has long been a safe haven for displaced persons and refugees from
 nearby countries. Although the Government occasionally returns illegal immigrants,
 there were no reports of forced repatriation of recognized refugees. Some illegal im-
 migrants have been subjected to harsh treatment, and to imprisonment.
 Cameroonian law contains provisions for granting refugee status in accordance
 with the 1954 U.N. Convention Regarding the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Pro-
 tocol. The Government cooperates with the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. The
 Government provides first asylum to persons who arrive at the border without docu-
 mentation but who can show a valid claim to refugee status. At year's end, there
 were about 47,000 refugees in the country for whom Cameroon was a country of
 first asylum. The majority of these persons are Chadians, whose total number was
 estimated to be more than 41,000. The remainder were principally from Rwanda,
 Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with small residual numbers
 from Liberia, Sudan, and Ethiopia. All but 44 refugees who arrived in Cameroon
 fleeing the 1997 civil war in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo, were repatriated in
 1998. The Government accepts for resettlement refugees who are granted refugee
 status by the UNHCR. Cameroon accepted a pproximately 34 Rwandan refugees
 from Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the year.
 In September 1997 government security forces arrested 12 former senior military
 officers of Equatorial Guinea who had been granted refugee status by the UNHCR
 and had lived in Cameroon for 4 years. These 12 officers, who were affiliated with
 an Equato-Guinean opposition party and included Alfonso Mba Nsogo, former head
 of the Equato-Guinean military, contested the Government's assertion that it had
 arrested them for their own protection. At year's end, the 12 officers remained in
 Cameroon under official detention at a security base near Yaounde. However, they
 have limited freedom of movement, subject to the condition that they inform the
 base commander of all trips made outside the base.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the constitutional right to change their government, but dominance
 of the political process by the President and his party limits the ability of citizens
 to exercise this right. President Paul Biya has controlled the Government since 1982
 and the ruling party since 1984. The 1992 and 1997 presidential elections and the
 1997 legislative contests were widely criticized and viewed as fraudulent by inter-
 national and domestic observers. In these elections, administered by the Ministry
 of Territorial Administration, members of largely pro-opposition ethnic groups and
 inhabitants of largely pro-opposition localities effectively were prevented from reg-
 istering or voting, registration and vote counting procedures were not transparent,
 public announcement of results was delayed, or votes cast in some progovernment
 areas exceeded the adult population.
 Elections are held by balloting that officially is described as secret but may permit
 voters to leave the polling place with evidence of how they voted. At polling places
 on election day, registered citizens receive a package of separate ballot cards, con-
 taining one card for each candidate. Each citizen votes by depositing into a sealed
 ballot box, alone inside a closed booth, an envelope containing one of these cards.
 
 
 52
 The voter also is given an opportunity to dispose of the unused ballots privately be-
 fore leaving the polling place, but polling officials rarely act to ensure that this is
 done, and they could not readily do so without discovering how some voters voted.
 This reportedly led to local abuses in the 1992 elections, but no such abuses are
 known to have been reported during the 1996 or 1997 elections.
 Following the flawed 1997 legislative elections, the majority of international ob-
 servers endorsed a series of reform measures, including the creation of a permanent
 and autonomous electoral, commission to replace the present system of elections run
 by the Ministry of Territorial Administration. The Governments control of the elec-
 toral process leads to a variety of abuses including preelection manipulation of voter
 registration lists.
 President Biya's October 1997 reelection was marred by serious procedural flaws
 as well as a boycott by the three major opposition parties. While the boycott made
 the outcome a foregone conclusion, most observers nonetheless considered the con-
 test to be neither free nor fair. Election irregularities were especially egregious in
 opposition strongholds, where boycotting opposition activists chose not to be present
 to monitor the voting count.
 The Biya administration has proven particularly intolerant of opposition from
 within its Beti/Bulu ethnic-regional base in southern Cameroon. Following the unex-
 pectedly strong showing of opposition parties in the region in the 1996 municipal
 elections, Titus Edzoa, a ruling CPDM member from southern Cameroon, a former
 Minister of Health, and a longtime presidential aide, declared himself a candidate
 to oppose incumbent President Biya in the October 1997 election. Edzoa and his
 campaign manager were arrested shortly after he declared his candidacy and before
 the election was held. They were sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment on embezzle-
 ment and corruption charges and remained incarcerated at year's end (see Section
 i.e.). Generations, a Yaounde-based newspaper, which was one of few very news-
 papers whose pubication icense remained suspended in 1998, was also one of very
 few newspapers that was both critical of the Government and run by a Beti,
 Vianney Ombe Ndzana.
 In December 1997, after the Supreme Court announced the official result, declar-
 ing President Biya the winner with 92.57 percent of the vote, much of the UNDP
 party, which previously had been in opposition, joined the CPDM in a coalition gov-
 enent. The new ruling coalition also included a faction of the UPC party that had
 articipated in previous CPDM-dominated coalition governments under President
 ilya.
 No significant positive reforms have been undertaken to correct the flaws in the
 electoral process. In February talks between the ruling CPDM party and the leading
 opposition party, the SDF, broke down over the issue of creating an independent
 electoral commission, as recommended by most international observers of the 1992
 and 1997 Presidential elections. The SDF demanded such a commission but the
 CPDM refused to grant this demand. Rather, the CPDM-dominated National As-
 sembly passed a few minor reforms to the 1991 electoral code, including increased
 discretionary power for the Minister of Territorial Administration to rule on the ad-
 missibility of candidacies.
 The President's control over the country's administrative apparatus is broad and
 deep. The President appoints all Ministers, including the Prime Minister, who serve
 at the President's pleasure. The President also directly appoints the governors of
 each of the 10 provinces. The governors wield considerable power in the electoral
 process, interpreting the laws and determining how these should be implemented.
 The President also has the power to appoint important lower level members of the
 58 provincial administrative structures, including the senior divisional officers, the
 divisional officers, and the district chiefs. The governors and senior divisional offi-
 cers wield considerable authority within the areas under their jurisdiction, includ-
 ing, significantly, the authority to ban political meetings that they deem likely to
 threaten public order. They also may den persons for renewable periods of 15
 days to combat banditry and other security threats.
 The 1996 amendments to the 1972 Constitution retained a strongly centralized
 system of power, based on presidential authority. However, the amendments im-
 posed a limit of two 7-year-(in place of unlimited 5-year) terms on the president.
 It provided for the creation of a partially elected (70 percent) and partially ap-
 pointed (30 percent) senate, along with the creation of a similarly constituted set
 of provincial assemblies with limited power over local affairs. Although promulgated
 by the President in January 1996, the senate and regional council amendments
 have not yet been implemented.
 Citizens' right to choose their local governments recently increased but remained
 circumscribed. In 1996 the Government held local government elections that were
 unprecedented in the Francophone region and the first such elections since the
 
 
 53
 1960's in the Anglophone region. These elections were for mayors or deputy mayors
 and council members in Douala, Yaounde, provincial capitals, and some division
 capitals. President Biya first promised such elections in 1992, but postponed them
 twice. In the meantime, the Government, in two steps, greatly increased the number
 of municipalities in which the chief executive officer of the local government was not
 a mayor who would subsequently be elected but rather a presidentially appointed
 "delegate." Delegate-run cities, which in 1992 comprised only four cities including
 Yaounde and Douala, by 1996 included all the provincial capitals and some division
 capitals in pro-opposition provinces, but not in the southern provinces that had
 tended to support the CPDM. In October a 60-member Committee on Good Govern-
 ance, created by the Government, publicly recommended that the Government elimi-
 nate the position of delegate in order to allow elected local officials to manage mu-
 nicipal governments more freely. Even in municipalities without delegates, local au-
 tonomy is quite limited, since elected local governments must rely on the central
 Government for most of their revenues and their administrative personnel.
 Like the 1992 National Assembly elections, the 1996 municipal elections were less
 flawed than other elections held in Cameroon since 1990. Foreign observers pro-
 nounced the elections largely free and fair, having detected few instances of malfea-
 sance during or after the voting, although opposition parties credibly alleged sys-
 tematic preelection government manipulation of the registration lists and arbitrary
 government disqualification of their candidates, especially in southern Cameroon.
 Goveent election authorities acknowledged that opposition candidates won 104
 of the 336 offices at stake. Ninety-six contests in which the Government declared
 the ruling party candidate the winner were appealed to the Supreme Court, which
 declared itself unqualified to adjudicate many of these complaints, but nullified the
 results of 18 elections, which it ordered the Government to hold again. As of year's
 end, the Government had not complied with any of these Supreme Court orders.
 During the year, the Biya Government brought to bear against its preeminent po-
 litical opponent the criminal libel prosecution tactic that it had used increasingly
 in recent years against its critics in the private press. In December the Government
 criminalized a civil ibel suit filed against SDF party chairman John Fru Ndi by a
 disgruntled former SDF official whom Fru Ndi reportedly had accused publicly of
 embezzing party funds (see Section 2.a.). According to credible reports, conviction
 and imprisonment on a felony charge, including a criminal libel charge, may render
 a citizen legally ineligible to hold public office. When the Government criminalized
 the libel suit against him, Fru Ndi-who in the eountry's only seriously contested
 presidential election in 1992 finished a close second to Biya despite serious flaws
 in the electoral process that favored the incumbent-remained the national leader
 and apparently the most popular politician of the country's largest opposition party.
 There are no laws that specifically prohibit women or members of minorities from
 participating in government, in the political process, or in other areas of public life.
 However, women are underrepresented in government and politics. Women hold far
 less than half of all positions in the cabinet (3 of 50 posts), in the National Assembly
 (10 of 180 seats), and in the higher offices of major political parties, including the
 CPDM.
 Many of the key members of the Government are drawn from the President's own
 ethnic group, as are disproportionately large numbers of military officers and CPDM
 officials. Members of other ethnic groups and regions hold 34 cabinet seats, com-
 pared with 16 cabinet positions held by members of the President's ethnic group.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Domestic and international human rights monitoring groups generally have con-
 siderable latitude to operate. A large number of independent human rights monitor-
 ing groups exist, although the activities of virtually all are limited by a shortage
 of funds and trained personnel. The Government generally did not prevent human
 rights monitors from operating, but allegedly has on occasion used its authority to
 approve or withhold official recognition of nongovernmental organizations (NGO's).
 The Government sometimes impedes the effectiveness of human rights NGO's by
 limiting access to prisoners and refusing to share information.
 Domestic human rights NGO's include the National League for Human Rights,
 the Organization for Human Rights and Freedoms, the Association of Women
 Against Violence, the Cameroonian Association of Female Jurists, the Cameroonian
 Association for Children's Rights, Conscience Africaine, the Movement for the De-
 fense of Human Rights and Liberties, the Human Rights Defense Group, and the
 Human Rights Clinic and Education Center. A number of these groups issued press
 releases or reports detailing specific human rights violations. Many held seminars
 and workshops on various aspects of human rights. During the year, the Govern-
 
 
 ment conducted a nationwide public awareness campaign on respect for human
 rights, through the state-owned media, public events and seminars for government
 and security force officials.
 The governmental National Commission on Human Rights and Freedoms, al-
 Though hampered by a shortage of funds, conducted a number of investigations into
 human rights abuses and organized several human rights seminars aimed at judi-
 cial officials, security personnel, and other government officers. While the Commis-
 sion never has published any results of its investigations, its reports have been sub-
 nutted to the office of the Prime Minister and the Presidency which have not re-
 leased them. In June its chairman, Solomon Nfor Gwei, publicly criticized the prison
 conditionsat Nkondengui for the detainees from the Northwest province who have
 been incarcerated for over a year without formal charges (see Section l.c.). He has
 also been outspoken about the need for Cameroon to improvement its human rights
 performance.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution does not explicitly forbid discrimination based on race, language,
 or social status. The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on sex and man-
 dates that "everyone has equal rights and obligations," but the Government does not
 effectively enforce these constitutional provisions.
 Women.-Violence against women remains at high levels. Women's rights advo-
 cates report that the law does not impose effective penalties against persons who
 commit acts of domestic violence against women. There are no gender-specific as-
 sault laws, despite the fact that women are the predominant victims of domestic vio-
 lence. Spousal abuse is not a legal ground for divorce. In cases of sexual assault,
 a victim's family or village often imposes direct, summary punishment on the sus-
 pected perpetrator through extralegal means ranging from destruction of property
 to beating. While there are no reliable statistics on violence against women, the
 large number of newspaper reports-a fraction of actual incidents-indicates that it
 is common.
 Despite constitutional provisions recognizing women's rights, women do not, in
 fact, enjoy the same rights and privileges as men. Polygyny is permitted by law and
 tradition, but polyandry is not. The extent to which a woman may inherit from her
 husband is normally governed by traditional law in the absence of a will, and cus-
 toms vary from group to group. In many traditional societies, custom grants greater
 authority and benefits to male than to female heirs. In cases of divorce, the hus-
 band's wishes determine the custody of children over the age of 6. While a man may
 be convited of adultery only if the sexual act takes place in his home, a female may
 be convicted without respect to venue. In the northern provinces, some Lamibe re-
 portedly prevent their wives and concubines from ever leaving the palaces.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which has been condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is not prac-
 ticed widely, but it is practiced in some areas of Far North and Southwest provinces.
 It includes the most severe form of the abuse, infibulation, and usually is practiced
 on preadolescent girls. An international workshop on eradicating FGM was held in
 the capital in May, and the Government has become increasingly outspoken in con-
 demning this practice..
 Children.-The Constitution provides for a child's right to education, and school-
 ing is mandatory through the age of 14. Nevertheless, in the wake of public sector
 expenditure cuts and a currency devaluation in 1993-94, increases in formal and
 informal school fees relative to disposable income have forced many families to fore-
 go sending their children to school. The Government has chosen to make public edu-
 cation bear a disproportionate amount of its fiscal retrenchment since 1993. Re-
 corded government spending on education shrank from 4.3 percent of recorded GDP
 in 1992/93 to an estimated 1.9 percent of recorded GDP in 1996/97. In August the
 Government ordered the closure of about 180 unlicensed private primary and sec-
 ondary schools, mostly in Douala and other pro-opposition areas, in which enroll-
 ment had grown to perhaps 50,000 pupils as the Government's schools deteriorated.
 The degree of familial child abuse is not known but is one of several targeted
 problems of children's rights organizations.
 . People With Disabilities.-A 1983 law and subsequent implementing legislation
 provide certain rights for persons with disabilities. These include access to public
 institutions, medical treatment, and education. The Government is obliged to bear
 part of a disabled person's educational expenses, to employ disabled persons where
 possible, and, as necessary, to provide them with public assistance. However, these
 rights in fact rarely are respected. There are few facilities-for disabled persons and
 little public assistance of any kind. Lack of facilities and care for the mentally dis-
 
 
 abled is particularly acute. Society tends to treat the disabled as tainted, leaving
 churches or foreign NGO's responsible for providing assistance. However, there is
 no widespread societal discrimination against the disabled. The law does not man-
 date special access provisions to buildings and facilities for persons with disabilities.
 Indigenous People.-A population of perhaps 50,000 to 100,000 Baka (Pygmies),
 a term that fact encompasses several different ethnic groups, primarily reside in the
 forested areas of the South and East provinces, of which Pygmies were the earliest
 known human inhabitants. While no legal discrimination exists, other groups often
 treat Pygmies as inferior and sometimes subject them to unfair and exploitative
 labor practices. There have been credible reports of Pygmies being forced out of
 their homes by logging companies and security forces following local protests against
 the companies. There have also been reports that Pygmies complain that the forests
 they inhabit are being logged without fair recompense for negative consequences for
 the Pygmies of the region.
 Religious Minorities.-Cameroon's northern provinces are largely Muslim and
 animist; its southern and western provinces are largely Christian and animist. In
 the northern provinces, especially in rural areas, societal discrimination by Muslims
 against animists is strong and widespread. Some Christians in rural areas of the
 north complain of discrimination by Muslims.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Cameroon's population is divided into more
 than 200 ethnic groups, among which there are frequent and credible allegations of
 discrimination. Members of virtually all ethnic groups commonly provide pref-
 erential treatment to fellow members when they are able to do so. Ethnic-regional
 differences continue to pose obstacles to political and economic liberalization.
 Members of President Biya's Bulu ethnic group and of closely related Beti groups
 of southern Cameroon are represented disproportionately and hold key positions in
 the Government, the civil service, state-owned businesses, the security forces, the
 military, and the ruling CPDM party. The large size and centralized character of
 the public sector has long been widely perceived to favor these groups. Prospective
 economic and political liberalization is widely perceived as being likely to harm
 these groups, and to favor other groups, such as the large Bamileke and Anglophone
 ethnic-cultural groups of western Cameroon, whose members tend to be more active
 in private commerce and industry and have tended to support the SDF since the
 legalization of opposition parties. Since 1990 natives of Cameroon's Anglophone re-
 gion, comprising the Northwest and Southwest provinces, have suffered dispropor-
 tionately from human rights violations committed by the Government and its secu-
 rity forces, have been underrepresented in the public sector, and widely believe that
 they do not receive their fair share of public sector goods and services. Since the
 flawed 1992 presidential election, which SDF Chairman John Frn Ndi, a native of
 the Northwest Province, accused Biya of having stolen from him, many residents of
 the Angophone region have sought to achieve greater freedom, greater equality of
 opportunity, and better government, it at least partly by regaining regional auton-
 omy rather than through nationwide political reform, forming several quasi-political
 organizations to pursue that goal.
 Northern Cameroon suffers from ethnic tensions between the Fulani, a Muslim
 group that conquered the most of the region 200 years ago, and the "Kirdi," the de-
 scendents of diverse animist peoples whom the Fulani conquered or displaced. Al-
 though some Kirdi subsequently have adopted Islam, the kirdy remain socially, edu-
 cationally and economically disadvantaged relative to the Fulani in the three north-
 ern provinces. The slavery still practiced in parts of northern Cameroon is reported
 to be largely enslavement of Kirdi by Fulani. Although the UNDP party is based
 largely in the Fulani community, the ruling CPDM party has long been widely per-
 ceived to represent Fulani as well as Beti-Bulu interests.
 During the 1990's, local-language broadcasts by government-controlled regional
 radio stations in southern Cameroon, as well as private French-language news-
 papers with close ties to leading government and CPDM figures, repeatedly have
 incited ethnic animosity against Bamilekes and Anglophones.
 Members of the country's large community of Nigerian immigrants often complain
 of illegal discrimination and even persecution by elements of the Government.
 Crackdowns on undocumented Nigerian immigrants repeatedly have been an-
 nounced by government officials; most recently, one was announced in the South-
 west province in October. In the same month, aftei a gendarme in Yaounde shot
 a Nigerian street trader (see Section l.a.), a mob of Nigerian residents of the city
 destroyed property at Nigerian embassy and the Nigerian ambassador's residence
 to protest the Government of Nigeria's perceived lack of vigor in protecting Nige-
 rians in Cameroon. Of 400 persons rounded up in 6 mass arrests aimed at smug-
 glers in Garoua in May, more than 300 were foreigners, many of them Nigerians.
 
 
 In June groups of young Cameroonians in Yaounde and Douala went on a ram-
 page against white foreigners, destroying property and beating and robbing a num-
 ber of persons. Although this violence was suppressed by Government security
 forces, who shot and killed 17- ear-old Marc Theophe Ekowel Man in Yaounde
 during these disturbances (see ection l.a.), it followed commentary in the govern-
 ment-monopolized broadcast media about unfair "white" refereeing in World Cup
 soccer games lost by the Cameroonian national team.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association,-The 1992 Labor Code allows workers to form and
 join trade unions of their choosing. The Labor Code permits groups of at least 20
 workers to organize a union but aiso requires registration with the Ministry of
 Labor. In practice, however, independent unions have found it extremely difficult to
 obtain registration. Registered unions are subject to government domination and in-
 terference. Provisions of the Labor Code do not apply to civil servants, employees
 of the penitentiary system, or workers responsible for national security. Instead of
 strikes, civil servants are required to negotiate grievances directly with the minister
 of the concerned department and with the Minister of Labor. Some sections of the
 Labor Code have never taken effect, as not all of the implementing decrees have
 been issued.
 There are two trade union confederations. In 1995 the Government encouraged
 the creation of a new labor confederation, the Union of Free Trade Unions of Cam-
 eroon (USLC), with which it maintains close ties. Previously, the sole labor confed-
 eration had been the Confederation of Cameroonian Trade Unions (CCTU), formerly
 affiliated with the ruling CPDM p arty under another name (the Organization of
 Cameroonian Trade Unions). While both organizations appear to be dominated or
 at least thoroughiy intimidated by the Government, the creation of the USLC was
 interpreted widely as an effort by the Government to create a rival trade union con-
 federation more firmly under its control.
 The CCTU split into two rival factions in January and largely has been ineffective
 since. On July 9, the Government banned a round table conference organized in
 Yaounde by the CCTU's reformist faction, headed by Emmanuel Bakot Ndjock, (see
 Section 2.b.).
 The Labor Code explicitly recognizes workers' right to strike but only afer man-
 datory arbitration. Arbitration proceedings are not enforceable legally and can be
 overturned by the Government. The Labor Code provides for the protection of work-
 ers engaged in legal strikes and prohibits retribution against them. There have been
 relatively few strikes since 1996.
 The CCTU is a member of the Organization of African Trade Union Unity and
 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. The USLC filed applications
 for membership with these organizations in 1995; it was still awaiting a response
 at year's end.
 b. The Right to Organiere and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Code provides for
 collective bargaining between workers and management in workplaces, as well as
 between labor federations and business associations in each sector of the economy.
 No sectoraJ collective bargaining negotiations have been undertaken in recent years.
 The Labor Code prohibits antiunion discrimination, and employers guilty of such
 discrimination are subject to fines of up to $2,000. However, employers found guilty
 are not required to reinstate the workers against whom they discriminated. The
 Ministry of Labor has reported no complaints of such discrimination during recent
 years.
 There is an industrial free zone regime, but the Government did not grant ap-
 proval to any firms to operate under it during the year. Free zone employers are
 exempt from some provisions of the Labor Code but must respect all internationally
 recognized worker rights.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution and the Labor
 Code prohibit forced or compuls orlabor, but it occurs in practice. Forced or bonded
 labor by children is not prohibited specifically. The authorities continued to allow
 prison inmates to be contracted out to private employers or used as communal labor
 for municipal public works.
 There were credible reports that slavery continued to be practiced in parts of
 northern Cameroon, including in the Lamidat of Rey Bouba, a traditional kingdom
 in the North province (see Section 5). In the South and East provinces, Baka (Pyg-
 mies), including children, continued to be subjected to unfair and exploitative labor
 practices (see Section 5).
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employmenti-The 1992
 Labor Code prohibits the employment of any child under the age of 14, even as a
 trainee, without a special waver from the Government. However, Ministry of Labor
 
 
 57
 inspectors responsible for enforcing the law lack resources for an effective inspection
 program. Moreover, the law does not include family chores, which in many instances
 are beyond a child's capacity to do. In the north of the country, there are credible
 reports that children from needy homes are placed with other families to do such
 work for money. The Constitution does not prohibit specifically forced or bonded
 labor by children, and there were reports of its practice. Pygmy children sometimes
 are subject to unfair and exploitative labor practices.
 In rural areas, many children begin work at an early age on family farms. Often,
 rural youth, especially girls, are employed by relatives as domestic helpers, while
 many urban street vendors are under 14 years of age. There are no special provi-
 sions limiting working hours for children. Primary education is compulsory through
 the age of 14.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Under the Labor Code, the Ministry of Labor
 is responsible for setting a single minimum wage applicable nationwide in all sec-
 tors. The minimum wage is approximately $40 (23,514 CFA Francs) per month. It
 does not provide a decent standard of living for an average worker and family.
 The Labor Code establishes a standard workweek of 40 hours in public and pri-
 vate nonagricultural firms, and 48 hours in agricultural and related activities. The
 code makes compulsory at least 24 consecutive hours of weekly rest. The Govern-
 ment sets health and safety standards, and Ministry of Labor inspectors and occu-
 pational health doctors are responsible for monitoring these standards. However,
 they lack the resources for a comprehensive inspection program. There is no specific
 legislation permitting workers to remove themselves from dangerous work situa-
 tions without jeopardy to continued employment.
