 ICELAND
 Iceland is a modern democratic social welfare state with a
 parliamentary institution--the Althing--which is the oldest
 elected parliament in the world. Iceland's highly literate
 and educated people take an active interest in politics and
 participate in high percentages in the country's regular
 elections. Iceland has no military forces or political
 security apparatus. There is a small, professional police
 force. Icelanders enjoy a fair and efficient civil and
 criminal justice system. Internally, Iceland's human rights
 practices are exemplary. Internationally, Iceland and
 Icelanders are strong defenders of individual human rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Politically motivated killings do not occur in Iceland.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been no known cases of disappearance of persons.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Coercive methods and harsh punishment are prohibited by law
 and do not occur in practice. Prison conditions are excellent
 by international standards. The number of prisoners confined
 in Iceland is numbered in the tens, most of whom are held
 under light security conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Due process of law is guaranteed in Icelandic legal codes and
 observed in practice. Habeas corpus exists and is honored.
 Any person detained by the authorities must be brought before
 a judge within 24 hours and charged, bound over, or released.
 There is no preventive detention.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair and public trials are standard. Icelandic courts are
 free of political control, though the lower court system is
 administered by the Ministry of Justice. The Supreme Court
 carefully guards its complete independence. There are no
 special or military courts. Right to counsel is guaranteed,
 and the state pays attorneys' fees when defendants cannot.
 Juries are not normally used, but multiple-bench courts are
 common, particularly on appeal. The small population allows a
 relatively informal administration of justice, but due process
 is rigorously observed. There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Icelandic law and practice are based on longstanding regard
 for the autonomy of the individual and the impropriety of
 government interference with the personal rights of citizens.
 Judicial warrants are required for entry into homes, except in
 cases of hot pursuit. Arbitrary intrusions by official

 bodies, political organizations, or any other organized group
 into the personal liberties of Icelanders have not occurred.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Restrictions on personal speech and the press are unknown in
 Iceland. The country's many newspapers are owned either
 independently or by the political parties and engage freely in.
 criticism of the Government and each other. Radio and
 television, a government monopoly, are expected to be
 nonpartisan and to maintain standards of professional ethics.
 Public boards representing all political parties, as well as
 other interests, have been established to supervise state
 broadcasting. Censorship is applied to print and film
 materials to control public display of pornography and
 violence, but there is no government censorship of any media.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Individuals in Iceland are free to join together formally or
 informally to promote nonviolent causes or to protest
 government policies or actions. An active web of voluntary
 organizations plays a large part in the social and political
 life of the country. All such organizations are free to
 maintain international contacts.
 The labor movement is highly organized and democratic. It
 permeates the entire work force and spans the political
 spectrum. Labor unions are active and influential in national
 economic and political life and in the development and
 administration of a comprehensive social welfare system.
 However, labor friction arose over the Government's 1983 move
 to preempt the unions' traditional role in setting wage policy
 and came to a head in October 1984 when government and
 municipal workers declared a strike after renewed wage
 negotiations reached an impasse. Among labor's international
 contacts, those with Nordic regional labor bodies are
 especially strong.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Lutheran Church is the established church of Iceland, and
 the vast majority of Icelanders are nominally Lutheran. There
 is complete freedom for other faiths. Religious affiliation
 is not a significant factor in political or social life.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Icelanders have complete freedom to travel at home and abroad,
 emigrate, and return to Iceland at will.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The political system is a fully functioning parliamentary
 democracy with a high level of individual participation in
 politics. A wide range of voluntary organizations and
 interest groups represent diverse political interests and
 interact with the formal parliamentary structure. The last
 national election, in April 1983, resulted in the orderly
 transfer of power to a new coalition government in May 1983.

 Voter turnout is high for all elections. The use of party
 primaries, proportional representation in multimember
 districts, and a cultural insistence on representation of the
 views of all parties in public affairs contribute to an active
 formal and informal political life, while also insuring in
 practice the continuation of coalition governments in Iceland.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no known allegations of human rights violations in
 Iceland. Iceland is represented on the European Human Rights
 Commission of the Council of Europe and has provided a judge
 to the European Human Rights Court. Several human rights
 organizations in Iceland, including Amnesty International,
 take an active interest in international human rights
 questions. Amnesty International did not comment on Iceland
 in its 1984 report, and Freedom House rates Iceland "free.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Icelanders enjoy a standard of living and the benefits of a
 social welfare state on the Scandinavian model. Per capita
 gross national product in 1982 was approximately $9,580,
 according to the Icelandic Central Bank.
 National policy stresses full employment. Education through
 the university level is free. Food, shelter, health care, and
 education are available to all inhabitants without
 discrimination.
 The population of 236,000 is ethnically homogeneous. No forms
 of discrimination exist in the provision of services, the
 exercise of rights, or participation in public life.
 Icelanders are fiercely egalitarian. Full participation in
 political life has traditionally been overwhelmingly a male
 preserve. In 1983, for the first time since 1918, a national
 women's list contested parliamentary elections and succeeded
 in electing 3 women to the Althing, which now has 9 women out
 of a total membership of 60. Late in 1983, women committee
 members of the predominantly rural-based Progressive Party
 served notice on that party's leadership that unless an
 increased allocation of party positions were guaranteed to
 women, they too would consider the formation of independent
 women's election lists for Progressive Party women. Iceland's
 chief of state is a woman.
