 GUATEMALA
 The Guatemalan Constitution which took effect in January 1986
 provides for a democratically elected president, a 100-member
 unicameral legislature, and an independent judiciary. Free
 and fair elections brought a civilian government to office in
 January 1986, and nationwide municipal elections were held in
 April 1988. Elements across the political spectrum are
 represented in Guatemalan politics, -and the Governmeft and its
 policies are widely criticized.
 Since August 1988, the Ministries of Interior and Defense have
 begun to coordinate the efforts of their three separate
 security forces under a Civil Protection System (SIPROCI).
 Members of the security forces work together in combined or
 coordinated operations to combat common crime and threats to
 national security. The National Police and the Treasury
 Police are under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of
 Interior. The Ministry of Defense controls the Mobile
 Military Police.
 Changes in the judiciary and the police, as well as increased
 professionalism in the military, have had a positive impact on
 respect for human rights. The Government has demonstrated a
 commitment to reducing human rights violations by the security
 forces by prosecuting members of the National Police and ex-
 members of civil defense patrols who committed abuses. The
 Guatemalan military pursued violators of the law and punished
 them through courts martial or administrative sanctions, for
 crimes ranging from rebellion to homicide.
 An economic recovery begun in 1987 translated into slightly
 higher per capita incomes for Guatemalans in 1988, as moderate
 growth continued. Estimates indicate unemployment has fallen
 steadily since 1986. Despite higher government outlays, the
 budget deficit was modest, and inflation was under control. A
 history of a badly skewed income distribution and of past
 inattention to needed social services has slowed the spread of
 the benefits of the economic recovery to lower income groups.
 Despite deep social divisions and a history of violent
 resolution of disputes, adherence to democratic principles
 continued to improve. The situation at year's end had
 improved both economically and politically, since L986 when
 the elected civilian government took office. The generally
 free environment encouraged the broader exercise of individual
 rights. Most Guatemalans, including the leadership of the
 armed forces, rejected an attempt by dissident officers to
 overthrow the Government in May 1988. Although the Government
 undertook prosecution of both civilian and military
 participants in the coup attempt, the Congress subsequently
 enacted an amnesty law, primarily directed at the decades-old
 armed insurgency, which covered all the participants in the
 abortive coup. However, most of the military participants
 were dismissed from active duty or reassigned to positions of
 little consequence. The number of violent crimes reported
 rose noticeably over the last year, but there was no evidence
 that the Government pursued a policy of political killing.
 The overall improved human rights climate was reflected in the
 return to Guatemala of a growing number of self-exiles during
 the year. Two leftist leaders of the United Representation of
 the Guatemalan Opposition (RUOG), Rigoberta Menchu and Rolando
 Castillo, visited Guatemala.

 The United Nations advisory expert for Guatemala, Hector Gross
 Espiel, who is also a judge of the Inter-American Court of
 Human Rights, noted progress in the human rights situation,
 and found no evidence of Government policy condoning human
 rights violations. He concluded that the abuses which still
 occur are a product of criminal activity in the country. The
 annual report of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights
 (IACHR) of the Organization of American States (OAS) concluded
 that although violations of the right to life remain
 alarmingly great, it also observed in many respects major
 progress in the human rights area.
 Important human rights problems remain in Guatemala, involving
 the use of force and abuses by political extremists and some
 individual and former members of the security forces. These
 problems are aggravated by a legacy of violence, vigilante
 justice, and rising crime, with which the judiciary and
 democratic institutions have thus far developed only a limited
 capacity to cope.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 The level of known killings in which a political motive could
 not be ruled out remained unchanged in 1988, reaching 44 for
 the months January through June--and is a dramatic decline
 from the high levels of political killing in the early 1980's.
 It is not known how many of these deaths were, in fact,
 politically motivated or, if so, which group or faction was
 responsible. Homicides attributed to common crime, including
 cases of suspected vigilante justice by private citizens,
 continued at a high rate in 1988. National Police statistics
 showed an average of 188 killings each month. Differentiating
 cases of common crime from those that are politically
 motivated is often difficult.
 A prominent example is the September 11 confrontation of land
 reform advocate Father Andre Giron and three companions with
 30 to 35 heavily armed men on an isolated road. Giron's
 bodyguard was shot and killed, but Giron was allowed to
 continue unharmed. The identity and motive of the attackers
 was not established. Human rights activists assert that the
 murder was designed to intimidate followers of Father Giron.
 The case remains unresolved.
 The Government continued its efforts to eliminate official
 involvement in political killings through reorganization and
 improved training of police and military forces, and also by
 prosecuting military and police officers on criminal charges.
 The former chief of police of Quetzaltenango, Catalino Valiente
 Alonso, and seven former police officers were found guilty on
 July 22 and sentenced to 30 years in prison for the October
 1987 kidnaping and murder of university student leaders
 Danilo Sergio Alvarado Mejia and Rene Haroldo Leiva Cayax.
 Two former commanders of the civil defense patrol of
 Chijtinimit in Chichicastenango, El Quiche, Miguel Batz Aj and
 Manuel Guarcas Colaj were charged with the 1983 murders of 23
 persons described as former guerrillas who had obtained
 amnesty. The Congressionally appointed Human Rights Ombudsman
 
 
 578
 GUATEMALA
 investigated the massacre based on a formal complaint submitted
 to his office by a member of the Mutual Support Group (GAM), a
 group of relatives of missing persons. A mass grave was
 uncovered in February by the Office of the Ombudsman. After
 lengthy judicial procedures, the two were found not guilty for
 lack of evidence by the Quetzaltenango Appeals Court on
 Novembver 17.
 Allegations of death-squad type activities in 19a8 continued,
 with press reports indicating that the activity of ultraright
 terrorist groups has been increasing. The number of reported
 kidnapings and murders in which there are similarities to
 death-squad methods of previous years has been rising. The
 Government denies any military or police involvement in
 death-squad like killings.
 A Christian Democratic mayor of Quezaltepeque, Chiquimula was
 ambushed and shot dead by three masked men in October after
 only 2 1/2 months in office. The mayor, Francisco Javier
 Landaverry Guerra, had previously served in that office during
 1980-1982 as a member of the rightwing MLN party. The
 Government is investigating and has not ruled out political
 motives.
 Eusebio Ajcalon Piof and Domingo Ajcalon Matzul were reportedly
 abducted on the evening of May 29 by two armed men in olive
 green uniforms. Early on May 30, the bodies of the two men
 were found on the land of Jose Yot in the small village of
 Mocolixot, Patzun. Eusebio Ajcalon had been a member of the
 local development council in Mocolixot Bajo, and some people
 assert he was politically active in his community. The
 murders remain unsolved.
 Twenty-two villagers from San Andres Itzapa were kidnaped and
 executed between November 22 and 24, apparently by the leftist
 insurgent Revolutionary Organization of the People in Arms
 (ORPA). The motive for the killings remains undetermined.
 The bodies of a civilan assistant to the Military Commissioner
 of Chimaltenango, who had disappeared while looking for a
 stray animal, and relatives and friends who had gone to search
 for him, were found in communal graves. The corpses reportedly
 showed signs of strangulation and torture. Members of the
 villagers' search party who managed to escape the guerrillas
 stated that ORPA was responsible for the killings. On
 November 27, the Government denounced the brutal massacre and
 called upon the international community to condemn the
 guerrillas. From their headquarters in Mexico City, the
 insurgents' propaganda organ CERIGUA denied that that ORPA was
 responsible and alleged that the military carried out the
 massacre. Nevertheless, on November 28, in a press release
 from Mexico City, CERIGUA claimed that ORPA had inflicted 25
 casualties on the Guatemalan Army in two ambushes carried out
 one after another at San Andres Itzapa, Chimaltenango military
 zone on November 25. The guerrillas' report tracks closely
 with the facts of the massacre.
 b. Disappearance
 Although disappearances occured in Guatemala in 1988 at a rate
 greatly reduced from that of the early 1980's, the National
 Police still reported an average of 27 kidnapings per month,
 nearly three times the rate at which kidnapings were reported
 during the previous 2 years. Almost 50 percent involved
 persons under the age of 16, a phenomenon that has swelled the
 number of disappeared since the last quarter of 1987. While
 
 
 579
 GUATEMALA
 some of the kidnapings are presumed to have been politically
 motivated, this alarming increase, particularly in the 16 and
 under age group, appears to reflect an increase in kidnaping
 for profit.
 Among notable disappearances were those in February of Remigio
 Gomez Quisquina, his four brothers, his father, a cousin, and
 a friend in San Lucas Toliman. They never returned after
 allegedly going out to look for firewood. Reportedly the
 family first believed that they had been abducted by the
 military, but they later thought that the guerrillas, who were
 known to be looking for recruits in that area, may have
 waylaid the men. The disappearances remained unsolved.
 Particularly troublesome cases were the following: Ana
 Elizabeth Paniagua Morales was abducted in Guatemala City on
 February 9 by three men in jogging outfits who forced her into
 a white van. Her body was found with knife wounds 2 days
 later. The National Police announced that Ms. Paniagua had a
 prison record for crimes such as assault, robbery, and murder.
 They also noted that her family was not cooperating with the
 police investigation. In a case of similar modus operandi,
 University of San Carlos agronomy student Jose Albino Grijalva
 Estevez was kidnaped at a bus stop in Guatemala City on
 February 16 and taken away, also in a white van. His body was
 found with knife and gunshot wounds the next day in Barberena,
 Santa Rosa. The GAM denounced both murders and seized on the
 cases as examples of officially sponsored violence. In June
 the National Police presented documentation to the courts
 which alleged that Treasury Police agents were responsible for
 these abductions and murders, as well as others. The accused
 were subsequently released from pretrial custody by the
 presiding judge, purportedly for lack of evidence. These
 cases remain unsolved. Little information concerning further
 police investigation has come to light.
 The judge presiding over the Paniagua and Grijalva abductions
 and murders was himself detained. Judge Anibal Trejo Duque
 and Carlos Moran Arriaga were abducted on July 20. The
 discovery of Trejo's abandoned vehicle led to an investigation
 of the apparent kidnaping. Moran was found dead on the
 morning of July 22. Trejo was freed that evening and stated
 that his captors did not ask him any questions about the case
 he was prosecuting, though some observers believe the abduction
 was related to the case. Trejo reported that he was treated
 well and told that his abduction was a mistake. He also
 insisted that Moran was not with him when he was abducted.
 Shortly thereafter Judge Trejo released all the accused
 Treasury Police agents from pretrial custody.
 On July 1, during her first visit back to Guatemala in 7
 years, Maria Elena Gaspar Xuncax, a Kanjobal Indian who is a
 legal permanent resident of the United States, was detained by
 uniformed police officers. She had been denounced as an active
 guerrilla by a villager in Barrillas, Huehuetenango. According
 to her own account of the incident, she was taken by
 plainclothesmen to a nearby military camp and allegedly
 threatened during repeated interrogations. Ms. Gaspar was
 freed on July 6, and the military brought her back to San
 Miguel, where she had been staying with relatives. Her family
 in Barillas had received no confirmation of her whereabouts.
 According to government sources, the army formally apologized
 to Ms. Gaspar stating that the case was one of mistaken
 identity. Ms. Gaspar had no further problems during the
 remainder of her visit to Guatemala.

 GUATEMALA
 Salvadoran citizen Rafael Vega Castillo disappeared in January
 after driving into Guatemala and carrying a large amount of
 currency with which to purchase computer equipment. Police
 agents privatel told the Vega family that he was seen in a
 military police prison, where he was held under another name.
 Military authorities deny that he was ever held by them. The
 National Police report that the bodies of Vega and another man
 were found on February 18 in Esquintla. Vega died from a head
 fracture and a gunshot wound. Vega was positively identifed
 on March 17 by his uncle, with whom he had lived in El
 Salvador. This case remains unsolved.
 Efforts to locate or account for missing persons from previous
 years continued in 1988. GAM is the most vocal private
 Guatemalan organization to demand investigation into these
 disappearances. The Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman, in
 operation since August 1987, continued to investigate alleged
 human rights abuses, including disappearances. It is expected
 to issue a report in January 1989. Similar concern was
 expressed by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 During 1988 reports of torture attributable to the military or
 police forces were infrequent. The National Police, under the
 coordination of the Interior Ministry, have stated that they
 are attempting to end all such abuses. Through training and
 foreign assistance programs from several countries, including
 the United States, Spain, Venezuela, and the Federal Republic
 of Germany, the National Police have begun to be
 professionalized through improved investigative and forensic
 laboratory techniques. There have been some cases of prisoners
 being murdered while they are in prison, but the Government
 has not been blamed for them.
 The case of Antonio Melendez Bouscayrol, detained by police on
 May 23 for allegedly shooting a police officer in Guatemala
 City, was significant to the issue of abuse. After his
 detention in the National Police's Seventh Precinct, Melendez
 died from cranial trauma. The Seventh Precinct attempted to
 cover up the crime by stating that Melendez had been found
 dead by police agents. Subsequent investigation by the
 National Police determined that Melendez died as a result of
 violence, and six police agents and the subchief of the
 Seventh Precinct were arrested. On two occasions, the latest
 being December 27, the Guatemalan courts have ruled that there
 is sufficient evidence to justify the continued detention of
 five of the policemen charged. Determination of their guilt
 or innocence was expected to be made in January 1989.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Allegations of arbitrary arrest are infrequent in Guatemala.
 Under the Constitution, a person cannot be held for more than
 6 hours without being brought before a judge and formally
 charged with a crime.
 Other procedural safeguards include the need for an arrest
 warrant from the criminal court where the accusation is
 presented when the accused is not apprehended in the actual
 commission of a crime. The law also stipulates that the time
 limit for incarceration during completion of the investigatory
 phase and sustainment or dropping of the charge is 20 days.
 Additionally, the law incorporates a constitutional protection
 
 
 581
 GUATEMALA
 against illegal detention and requires the personal appearance
 of any person who is illegally detained or whose freedom is
 threatened in any way. These safeguards are generally
 observed.
 Involuntary exile is not used as a punishmentby the
 Government, and there have been no known instances in which
 government critics were arrested for political reasons. There
 were no known cases in 1988 of persons being imprisoned for
 political reasons or for nonviolent exercise of basic human
 rights.
 With regard to forced or-compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. -Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution provides for an independent judiciary,
 operating under the civil law tradition, and strengthens the
 judiciary's independence by allotting it a set percentage of
 the national budget. In practice, however, such a budgetary
 level is not always reached. The Constitution establishes a
 Supreme Court, a Court of Appeals and several courts of
 particular jurisdiction. Civilians are subject to the formal
 civilian judicial system; military courts have jurisdiction
 only over military personnel. Despite government attempts to
 strengthen the judicial system, it still shows some vestiges
 of the inefficiency, corruption, and intimidation by outside
 elements that has characterized it in the past.
 All accused are allowed a public trial, once the investigatory
 phase is complete. The right to legal counsel is provided for
 by law and made available by the State to indigents. State
 funded legal services are usually provided by law students.
 Since the majority of the nation's lawyers live in or near
 Guatemala city, it is sometimes difficult to obtain legal
 counsel in the countryside. Defendants may be released at the
 discretion of the magistrate after posting bail. Cumbersome
 judicial machinery results in many defendants spending several
 months in prison before their cases are brought to trial. All
 cases are granted an automatic appeal upon conviction and
 reviewed in the Court of Appeals.
 The Guatemalan judiciary is working to improve the
 effectiveness of its legal system and to acquire needed
 training and equipment, with the assistance of the U.N.
 Institute for the Prevention of Crime and Treatment of
 Criminals (ILANUD) and other donors.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home,
 personal correspondence, and private papers. Instances of
 authorities violating the privacy of the home and engaging in
 criminal acts against individuals and property are isolated.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and
 expression. Guatemala's print and broadcast media actively
 criticize the Government and leading civilian officials.
 Newspapers carry paid advertisements placed by the illegal
 Communist Party and the umbrella guerrilla group that is
 
 
 582
 GUATEMALA
 waging war against the Government. Guerrilla press releases
 provide the insurgent version of clashes with the military,
 and in-depth interviews with guerrilla leaders have recently
 appeared in the nation's leading print media.
 Despite the more open atmosphere, journalists continue to
 exercise a degree of self-censorship in reporting on military
 matters and personalities. Media organs that have given
 interview space to guerrilla leaders have been careful to give
 equal time to army spokesmen. Journalists remain wary of
 investigating charges of malfeasance or corruption in the
 military. The last year has seen increased tension between
 the Government and much of the nation's news media. Extremely
 jealous of their prerogatives, the media are quick to react to
 anything they interpret as pressure from the Government.
 In the wake of the failed May 11 coup attempt, a number of
 incidents occurred that ran counter to the general tendency
 towards greater freedom of expression. These events raised
 questions about the Government's ability to maintain and
 guarantee the progress made towards greater openness. In late
 May, the Government closed one of the nation's four commercial
 television channels which carried a stridently antigovernment
 news program run by an unsuccessful 1985 presidential
 candidate. The courts ordered the station to be allowed back
 on the air after a 12-day period. The Government complied and
 the news program was broadcast for a few days until its
 contract with the television channel expired in early June.
 The news program's management charged that its contract was
 not renewed due to government pressures on the channel's
 management. Both the channel and the Government deny this
 charge.
 On May 19 the residence/office of the representative of the
 Soviet news agency Tass was damaged by a terrorist bomb attack.
 The Tass representative left Guatemala shortly after this
 attack, and the representative of the Cuban news agency Prensa
 Latina closed his office about the same time, reportedly after
 receiving death threats. While Tass and Prensa Latina
 representatives have traveled to Guatemala on trips
 subsequently, neither organization has reopened its office
 there.
 On June 10 a left-leaning weekly newspaper, La Epoca, was the
 object of a predawn terrorist bomb attack. The attack,
 conducted against the newspaper's editorial and administrative
 offices, was also aimed at the ACEN-SIAG news agency, an
 organization owned and operated by the same persons who
 publish La Epoca. A witness to the attack was kidnaped, held
 and interrogated by the bombers for 30 hours. Although
 material damage was extensive, no one was seriously injured.
 The Government condemned the attack, and the director of the
 Government's daily newspaper publicly offered the temporary
 use of its facilities to insure no break in publication. La
 Epoca's publisher, after vowing to reopen immediately, changed
 his mind and left the country. He attributed his change of
 heart to death threats directed at him and the members of his
 staff. He publicly charged "elements of the state security
 apparatus" for the attack. -Although no evidence was produced
 to prove this accusation, it is widely believed by local
 observers. The publisher returned to Guatemala in September.
 Foreign films, books, magazines, and newspapers circulate
 freely in Guatemala. The Government does not jam foreign
 
 
 583
 GUATEMALA
 radio or television broadcasts. Foreign correspondents are
 able to report without government interference.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The rights of peaceful assembly and political association are
 provided for in the Constitution, and the Government attempts
 to assure that these rights are exercised freely. According
 to the Constitution, the Government must grant formal
 organizations the legal status which is common in Latin
 America, but the lack of such status has not been an impediment
 to peaceful association. Organizations without legal status
 function freely, and the Government meets with their
 representatives.
 Leftist leaders who maintain ties with guerrilla support groups
 outside the country returned to Guatemala in April, and they
 were allowed to address public rallies and march in the May Day
 parade. Despite provocations during the parade, the police
 acted with restraint and, as in other public demonstrations
 during the past 3 years, the parade ended peacefully.
 On September 2, a bomb exploded on the campus of the Catholic
 University. 'There were no injuries. A previously unknown
 terrorist group claimed responsibility for the blast, which
 was widely viewed as a rightwing response to an announced
 seminar on liberation theology. The Government condemned the
 attack.
 International groups who have investigated human rights
 practices in Guatemala allege that opposition leaders have
 been subject to harrassment and violence. However, there have
 been major improvements in this regard since Guatemala
 established a democratic government. The Union of Guatemalan
 Workers' Unions (UNSITRAGUA), a labor confederation which is
 the heir to an organization which sent recruits to the
 guerrillas in the 1970's, emerged with a clandestine
 leadership in the mid-1980's. In 1988, its leaders held
 public meetings and filmed press conferences making
 inflammatory accusations against the Government for its
 economic policies. While there were reports of anonymous
 threats, UNSITRAGUA leaders themselves acknowledge that the
 Government protected their right to dissent.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Guatemala has no state religion. More than 70 percent of the
 population is Roman Catholic, but all religious denominations
 have the right to practice freely in Guatemala. Many Indians,
 who comprise roughly 50 percent of the nation's total
 population, mix native beliefs with Catholic practices. Over
 25 percent of Guatemalans now adhere to Protestant
 denominations, most of which are evangelical in nature. There
 are also small communities of Jews, Mormons, Baha'is, and
 Buddhists.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no legal restrictions on freedom of movement within
 the country or travel abroad. A number of prominent leftists
 who fled Guatemala in the early 1980's have returned, some to
 
 
 584
 GUATEMALA
 visit temporarily and others to live permanently. Leaders of
 the insurgents' umbrella organization, the Guatemalan National
 Revolutionary Union (URNG), announced to the National
 Reconciliation Commission that they wished to return to
 Guatemala to participate in the national dialogue. The
 Government responded that they could return to Guatemala only
 if they laid down their arms and accepted the amnesty.
 Guerrillas who have accepted the amnesty are documented by the
 Government and allowed to live where they choose,
 The model village program of the former military government
 was tranferred from the Ministry of Defense to the Ministry of
 Development after civilian rule was reestablished in 1986.
 Since then, it has been government policy not to develop
 additional model villages.
 Guatemala generated thousands of refugees and displaced
 persons in the early 1980's. Refugees are now repatriating as
 security and living conditions improve in areas of conflict.
 The number of returnees has increased each year since the
 inauguration of the civilian Government, reaching about 3,000
 in 1988 (three times the number that returned in 1987).
 Nearly 4,500 displaced persons returned to areas under
 Government control in 1988. Although those who return from
 refuge in or outside the country or from service with the
 guerrillas may find that their land is now being farmed by
 others, the Government guarantees that returning refugees will
 receive either their own land or land in newly settled areas.
 This has not always proven to be possible in practice, and a
 few repatriated refugees have sought to return to their
 country of asylum.
 Guatemala continues to receive refugees from Nicaragua and El
 Salvador. Estimates of the number of Nicaraguans living in
 Guatemala vary between 7,000 and 20,000, most of whom are in
 the country illegally. There are also thousands of Salvadorans
 who came to Guatemala, some as temporary laborers and others
 to escape guerrilla warfare. Many of these displaced persons
 obtain assistance from church groups and other charities.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 President Vinicio Cerezo took office in January 1986 after
 free and fair democratic elections in 1985 following 20 years
 of military rule. The President and a majority of
 Congressional Deputies are members of the Christian Democratic
 Party. The 100-member unicameral Congress currently contains
 11 political parties which range across the political spectrum.
 The President and Congressional Deputies were elected to 5-year
 terms in 1985 and new national elections are scheduled for
 1990. Nationwide municipal elections were held in April 1988,
 and by all-accounts they were free and fair. Lower than
 expected voter turnout was attributed to the elimination in
 the new Constitution of the previous law which imposed a fine
 on citizens who did not vote.
 Seven women were elected to the National Congress, and there
 are two female Cabinet members.
 
 
 585
 GUATEMALA
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The continuing activities of the constitutionally mandated
 Human Rights Ombudsman, named in August 1987, are part of a
 wider effort to ensure respect for human rights. The Ombudsman
 opened offices in 5 of Guatemala's 22 departments, and
 processed (e.g., investigated, referred for action, or
 dismissed) nearly 700 of the 850 cases put before him through
 August 1988.
 The Government has welcomed international human rights
 delegations. Though not many international groups have
 permanent offices in Guatemala, many have representatives in
 the country or visit fairly frequently. Amnesty International
 and Americas Watch issued reports in 1988 that were critical
 of the human rights situation in Guatemala, although they did
 note improvements. Representatives of both groups have visited
 Guatemala since the democratically elected Government came to
 power in January 1986.
 Hector Gross Espiel, mentioned previously as the United
 Nations human rights expert for Guatemala and a judge of the
 Inter-American Court of Human Rights, visited in August and
 consulted with the Governm&nt on human rights issues. Gross
 Espiel said that the human rights situation in Guatemala has
 improved, and that significant progress had been made because
 there is no longer a policy of human rights violations carried
 out by government officials. When he returned to Guatemala in
 November, Gross Espiel stated that those human rights
 violations which still occur are a product of the wave of
 criminal activity in the country. He urged the Government to
 move from a policy of not violating human rights to taking a
 more effective role in preventing human rights abuses in the
 society.
 The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) of the
 Organization of American States (OAS) visited Guatemala in
 January 1988 to investigate and to express to the Government
 of Guatemala its concern over reports of forced disappearances.
 In its 1987-1988 Annual Report, the IACHR stated its
 appreciation to the Government of Guatemala for its cooperation
 with the work of the Commission. It also noted that Guatemala
 has submitted to the obligatory jurisdiction of the IACHR.
 The Commission concluded that, even though violations of the
 right of life in Guatemala remained alarmingly great, there
 was major progress, including a significant number of
 Government institutions dedicated to the promotion, protection
 and defense of human rights. It described the country's
 domestic legislation on human rights as among the most
 advanced. The IACHR report commended the attitude of the
 Government in redoubling its efforts to put an end to a long
 record of uncontrolled violence, which it noted had more than
 once imperiled the stability of the constitutional order. The
 Commission called for continuation of efforts to consolidate
 the democratic process and to protect and defend human rights.
 A locally managed Red Cross, with no connection to the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), has operated
 freely in Guatemala for many years. In January 1988, the ICRC
 opened an office in Guatemala. However, by year's end, the
 Government and the ICRC had not yet reached formal agreement
 on the status of the organization as an international mission.
 While this caused the ICRC to delay initiation of full
 
 
 586
 GUATEMALA
 operations within Guatemala, the organization was engaged in
 evaluating the situation of displaced persons and providing
 human rights education for the Guatemalan Army.
 The GAM, a group of relatives of missing persons, continued
 its efforts to locate those who have disappeared, although its
 demonstrations have been less well attended than in previous
 years. The group is most active in rural areas. The GAM
 continues to receive international support, and in 1988 it
 received an award from a Protestant church of the Federal
 Republic of Germany.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Stark cultural differences between the ladino middle and upper
 classes and the large number of indigenous Mayan groups, who
 comprise approximately 50 percent of Guatemala's population,
 have historically created tensions between the two groups. In
 an attempt to bring the indigenous people into national life,
 the Government is providing medical attention as well as
 bilingual education in Spanish and native languages to those
 who live in the most distant rural areas. Indians living near
 towns have had access to these benefits. Citizens of Indian
 descent have the same legal rights as other Guatemalans, and
 several have been elected as members of the National Congress
 and as mayors.
 Women are making significant contributions in the Government
 and in the private sector. In addition to the women in the
 Cabinet and the National Congress, six of Guatemala's
 ambassadors are women, as is the person appointed to the
 *notable person" position on the National Reconciliation
 Commission, formed pursuant to the Esquipulas II Agreement.
 Despite this progress, centuries-old stereotypes still exist.
 The Government established a National Office of Women (ONAM)
 to address the needs of women in the work force. Staff and
 resource limitations restrict its ability to coordinate
 activities with 56 Guatemalan women's organizations. Among
 the issues ONAM is attempting to address are employer
 discrimination against married and pregnant women, the
 inability of professional women to find employment, and the
 lack of sufficient daycare centers for the children of working
 women.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers have a right under the Constitution to associate. As
 do other organizations, unions must obtain recognition from
 the State to have legal status. Prior to 1984, this
 requirement was used to frustrate organizing activity, and
 only about 2 percent of the labor force was unionized. The
 new Constitution extends the right to strike even to public
 sector unions, and the number of organized workers has grown
 rapidly, now constituting about 8 percent of the labor force.
 The Labor Code establishes labor courts that form the core of
 a complex system designed to settle labor disputes. The
 Ministry of Labor has the authority to arbitrate strikes, and
 most parties prefer to negotiate rather than go to the
 backlogged Labor Courts.
 Although strikes are technically illegal unless all the steps
 in the Labor Code are followed, employers, including state
 
 
 GUATEMALA
 agencies, have made concessions to unions to settle strikes
 that were illegal on those grounds. By law, union jurisdiction
 must be limited to one company. Labor federations may assist
 individual unions, but there is no industrywide bargaining.
 More unions have acquired legal status in the past 2 years
 than at any time in the previous 30 years. Yet there are also
 scores of unions awaiting legal recognition. Obtaining
 recognition can still be time-consuming and cumbersome, and
 some have alleged that political influence or ideological
 orientation plays a role in the process. For example, although
 the law states it should take unions 90 days to register with
 the Government, some union leaders have reported delays of up
 to 2 years. Nevertheless, all of the unions receive more
 favorable treatment than they did in the past. A number of
 unions are operating without legal recognition, and this denies
 them some protections under the Labor Code, but collective
 bargaining pacts which have the same legal force as contracts
 with recognized unions are still negotiated by these unions.
 Guatemalan unions are members of international labor
 organizations and in 1988 the largest union chose the worker
 delegate to the International Labor Organization (ILO). At
 its November.1988 session, the ILO Governing Body accepted
 final conclusions and recommendations of its Committee on
 Freedom of Association (CFA) in a case brought against the
 Government of Guatemala by the Guatemalan Trade Union
 Confederation (CUSG). In its conclusions the CFA: acknowledged
 the Government's cooperation; recommended further steps,
 including revision of the law to facilitate registration of
 unions; and asked to be apprised of future developments.
 There is an active Solidarismo movement in the country. While
 leaders of the Solidarismo movement claim that it is a
 legitimate form of worker organization, the AFL/CIO, and the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and
 other international trade union organizations contend that
 Solidarismo is an employer-inspired alternative to independent
 trade unions.' The Ministry-of Labor has thus far refused to
 registei Solidarismo organizations as unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The 1985 Constitution guarantees workers the right to organize,
 even in the public sector, and there has been a high level of
 organizing activity in recent times. The Labor Code, which
 predates the Constitution, establishes a complex system to
 settle labor disputes and gives the Minister of Labor power to
 arbitrate. Unions have been more successful in raising wages
 through collective bargaining at the plant level than in
 raising overall wages through public protests.
 When a worker is a union official, the law provides that he
 cannot be fired, and this protection extends for 2 years after
 he leaves office. While union officials complain that the law
 is not implemented effectively, the major impediment to
 organizing is employer resistance, not the law.
 There are no zones in Guatemala where legal protection for
 workers does not apply. Labor organizing is legal but still
 difficult in areas where there was revolutionary violence in
 the late 1970's, particularly in the Indian highlands.

 GUATEMALA
 Union members became concerned about a possible politically
 motivated assasination when Carlos Martinez Godoy, a low-
 ranking offical in a bank employees union, was murdered in
 October in front of his house. However, officials in the
 Federation of Bank Unions (FESEBS) indicated that Martinez
 Godoy had no connection with a dispute then under way with the
 Army Bank and acknowledged that the union he represented had
 just completed successful contract negotiations with its own
 management. In November a National Police agent-was detained
 and brought before the courts as the suspected murderer. No
 political motive was apparent; the killing was considered to
 be a crime of passion.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution provides the right of workers to freely choose
 their work, and the practice of compulsory labor is prohibited
 by law. However, there have been frequent complaints that
 persons are forced to participate in the civil defense patrols
 under threats and intimidation, especially in areas of
 conflict, and are compelled to perform unrelated tasks without
 compensation. This would be illegal under the Constitution,
 although the U.N. Convention on Forced Labor allows
 conscription into military service and community service
 projects. In response to questions which arise regarding the
 voluntary nature of civil defense patrols, the Government
 presented the Human Rights Ombudsman with a formal written
 declaration that service is strictly voluntary, and the
 Ombudsman has disseminated copies of the declaration to all
 civil defense patrols.
 American Embassy officers visiting areas of conflict have
 found that service on the patrols is viewed as an obligation
 to community service and a sign of social status. Civil
 defense members see themselves to be protecting their
 community so that the military need not patrol there.
 Guatemala had a tradition of forced labor by indigenous
 workers, the Encomienda system, which was outlawed in the
 1930's. Vagrancy laws in effect until the 1950's allowed for
 the imprisonment of persons who did not have employment. This
 history still influences attitudes in some rural areas.
 However, the Government is seeking to eliminate abuses when
 they occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Constitution prohibits the employment of children under
 the age of 14, and this restriction, generally observed in the
 formal economy, is enforced by the Ministry of Labor through a
 system of labor inspectors and labor courts. Although
 enforcement is not always effective in the more informal
 economy, child labor is generally not a widespread abuse. In
 the informal economy, particularly in rural areas, whole
 families work, with children assisting their parents.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The minimum wage is $1.20 dper day in rural areas and $1.50 in
 urban areas. Ministry of Labor data shows that 85 percent of
 Guatemalan families do not have enough income to meet their
 basic needs and that 72 percent live in extreme poverty. Its
 Commission on Wages, which includes union representatives,
 recognizes that it must encourage the creation of employment
 when setting minimum wages. Minimum wages were raised in 1988
 
 
 589
 GUATEMALA
 for the first time this decade. The Constitution provides for
 a 44-hour workweek. There are occupational safety and health
 regulations, but they are not always effectively enforced.
