 BRUNEI
 Brunei, a small Muslim Sultanate with a substantial Chinese
 minority, is located on the north coast of Borneo. It has one
 of the highest per capita incomes in the world, based on its
 considerable oil production and small population (214,000 in
 1984). A hereditary and traditional monarchy, Brunei has been
 ruled by the same family for more than 500 years, but for the
 century preceding independence on January 1, 1984, it was a
 British protectorate. Brunei became internally self-governing
 in 1959, with Defense and Foreign Affairs remaining British
 responsibilities until the end of 1983.
 A Constitution was promulgated in 1959, the first sharing of
 political power by the Sultan. It provided that the Sultan
 could override the decisions of legislative and executive
 bodies in most instances. The first local election in Brunei
 was held in 1962. As a result of increased tension with the
 Sultan at that time, the opposition fomented an armed uprising
 in December 1962. After British troops had been brought in
 and quickly put down the uprising, the Sultan invoked an
 article of the Constitution under which he could assume
 emergency powers for a period of two years. This state of
 emergency has been renewed every two years since and is still
 in force. Although the Constitution is not suspended, the
 state of emergency allows the Sultan great latitude to rule by
 orders.
 Since 1962 there have been no disturbances or agitation in
 Brunei. Economic factors have much to do with the general
 sense of well-being that prevails in Brunei. Oil revenues are
 sufficient to permit the Government to provide free medical
 care and free education (by government scholarship abroad at
 the university level). A large proportion of the Malay
 population of working age is employed by the Government at
 salaries permitting a higher standard of living than in
 surrounding countries. Government employees are also eligible
 for low-interest or no-interest loans to purchase homes,
 automobiles, and appliances. The only other major employer,
 Brunei Shell Petroleum, provides comparable benefits.
 Although the great majority of the substantial Chinese
 minority in Brunei are not citizens, being either permanent or
 temporary residents following the loss of-their status as
 British-protected persons, the Chinese community is
 prospering. Most of the commercial activity of Brunei is in
 Chinese hands.
 Islam is the state religion of Brunei, but the Constitution
 guarantees freedom of worship for other religions, and this
 right is freely exercised. The status of women in Brunei is
 substantially the same as in neighboring countries where
 Muslims are in the majority. Women are not under pressure to
 observe strict Muslim standards of dress and behavior. Trends
 in this direction reflect personal and family conviction.
 Women are widely employed in the Government, primarily in
 clerical and secretarial positions but a few hold professional
 level senior positions.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no known instances in 1984 of politically motivated
 killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known disappearances in 1984 nor evidence of
 persons being abducted, secretly arrested, or clandestinely
 detained.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There were no known instances in 1984 of persons being
 subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There were no allegations nor known instances of people
 detained, punished, or tried for expression of views critical
 of or different from those of the Government in 1984 or any
 recent year. There are, however, a few detainees from the
 insurrection of 1962 who have not been released (several other
 were released at the beginning of 1984 at the time Brunei
 resumed full independence). Several leaders of the 1962
 insurrection live abroad. They have not been sentenced to
 exile, a concept which does not exist in Brunei, but may still
 fear that they would be incarcerated should they return.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The legal system in Brunei is in most respects derived from
 the British system. Criminals and those suspected of criminal
 activities are detained, tried, and punished in a manner
 consistent with respect for their human rights. Lacking a
 senior judiciary of its own, the Brunei high court when in
 session has a British judge, seconded from Hong Kong. There
 were no known instances of interference with the judiciary by
 the Government in 1984 or in any other recent year.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 While the Government has considerable latitude allowing it to
 intrude into the privacy of individual persons, families, and
 homes, in practice it does not do so.
 In the latter half of 1983, the distribution in Brunei of a
 weekly overseas magazine was suspended. While it published
 more than one article about Brunel just before its suspension,
 it is not clear exactly what prompted the Government's
 action. There was also at least one case in 1984 of
 suspension of distribution of a foreign publication for a
 single issue.

 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 In the absence of an organized political opposition, there
 have been no challenges to the Government which would have
 tested the Government's tolerance in the political arena. The
 single television station is Government-owned and consistently
 avoids controversial issues. There is no daily newspaper, and
 the single weekly newspaper, while usually avoid avoiding
 controversial issues, frequently reports matters that could be
 embarrassing to the Government. At least one foreign
 journalist has been among a small number of aliens whose
 non-resident permits have been summarily withdrawn.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government permits the formation of associations for many
 kinds of private economic, recreational, or other purpose
 without interference. Since there is no political activity,
 the degree to which the Government would tolerate political
 assemblies or associations is unknown. The formation of a
 labor union requires only seven persons with a common trade.
 Any such group has the right to have its union rigistered as
 such with the Labor Department. At present, there are only
 three unions registered, only one of which is believed to be
 active. There are no urgent labor issues in Brunei,'mainly
 because there are only two major employers, Brunei,'Shell
 Petroleum and the Government, both of which provi3de
 substantial employee benefits. The existing unions have no
 political role. with Government permission the9 may maintain
 relations with recognized international bodies
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the official state religion of Brunei, but people are
 free to practice the religion of their choice and do so.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens have no restrictions on freedom of movement within
 the country or abroad.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Under the continuing state of emergency, provisions of the
 Constitution that provide for a measure Of representative
 government have been suspended since 1962. There are no
 political parties. The only area of government where citizens
 can exert some influence is at the local level, by working
 through appointed village headmen and district officers who
 meet regularly with their constituents.
 Section 4 Government Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Since there have been no known attempts at such investigations
 since Brunei regained independence, it is not known what the
 Government's attitude would be, should a request to make such
 an investigation be received. There are no known domestic
 human rights organizations. The Amnesty International 1984
 
 
 711
 BRUNEI
 Report expressed concern about the continued detention of
 people held without trial for their alleged involvement in the
 rebellion of December 1962, and about approximately 20 others
 believed being held without trial after being arrested for
 political reasons during the 1970's. Freedom House's 1984-85
 report lists Brunei as 'not free.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 As an oil-rich state with a small population, Brunei can
 afford to provide the economic benefits of a modern welfare
 state. In the fields of health, education, and nutrition, the
 Government has spared little expense in assuring that the
 needs of the whole population, not just the elite, are met.
 The generally high cost of food is lowered by government
 subsidies of the price of rice, which is nearly all imported.
 Oil, which constitutes 75-80 percent of gross domestic
 product, results in a GNP per capita of approximately
 US$17,800. The high income level means that despite high
 cost, the population is well-fed and, for the standards of the
 area, well-housed. Citizens enjoy free education and medical
 care. Civil servants, a large segment of the working
 population, have access to subsidized loans and a
 non-contributory pension program. Resident non-citizens pay
 only a nominal fee for medical care and can attend public
 schools for a reasonable fee. Life expectancy at birth in
 Brunei was 73.7 years in 1984.
