 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a federation of seven emirates established in
 1971. None has any democratically elected institutions or political parties. Each
 emirate retains control over its own oil and mineral wealth and some aspects of de-
 fense and internal security, although the Federal Government asserts primacy in
 most matters of law and government. Traditional rule has generally been patriar-
 chal, with political allegiance defined in terms of loyalty to tribal leaders. Citizens
 may express their concerns directly to their leaders via traditional mechanisms,
 such as the open majlis, or council. In accordance with the 1971 provisional Con-
 stitution the seven emirate rulers comprise a Federal Supreme Council, the UAE's
 highest legislative and executive body. The Council selects a President and Vice
 President from its membership; the President in turn appoints the Prime Minister
 and Cabinet. The Council meets occasionally, although the leaders meet frequently
 in more traditional settings. The Cabinet manages the Federation on a day-to-day
 basis.
 Each emirate maintains its own police force, but only the Federal Government
 and the Emirate of Dubai have internal security organizations.
 The UAE has a free market economy based on oil and gas production, trade, and
 light manufacturing. The Government owns the majority share of the petroleum
 production enterprise in the largest emirate, Abu Dhabi. The four emirates with
 small or nonexistent petroleum resources are dependent on federal government sub-
 sidies for such essential services as health, electricity, water, and education. The
 economy provides citizens with one of the world's highest per capita incomes but is
 heavily dependent on foreign workers who comprise 80 percent of the population.
 A number of human rights continued to be restricted in 1994. The main problems
 included the denial of the right of citizens to change their government and limita-
 tions on the freedoms of speech, press, assembly, association, and worker rights.
 Women continue to make progress in education and in the work force, but some
 types of discrimination persist. The press continued to avoid direct criticism of the
 Government and exercised self-censorship on topics sensitive to the Government.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial illing.-There were no reports of political or
 extrajudicial killing.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no reports of torture in 1994Thehe Constitution prohibits torture or de-
 ding treatment. Shari's, or Islamic, courts frequently impose flogging on Muslims
 fond guilty of adultery, prostitution, and drug and alchol abuse. According to
 press accounts, punishments for adultery and prostitution have ranged from 80 to
 200 lashes. In several cases, Muslims convicted of drunkenness have been sentenced
 to 80 lashes. Non-Muslims may also be sentenced to such punishments, but the Fed-
 
 
 1189
 eral Supreme Court ruled in 1993 that convictions do not require the imposition of
 Shari'a penalties on non-Muslims. In 1994 several non-Muslims were reportedly
 sentenced to lashing after their convictions for adultery and prostitution. There was
 no indication that the punishments were carried out. No amputations were known
 to have been carried out.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arrest, search,
 detention, or imprisonment except in accordance with the law. The laws of each
 emirate prohibit arrest or search without probable cause.
 Under the Criminal Procedures Code, the police must report arrests within 48
 hours to the Attorney General who must determine within the next 24 hours wheth-
 er to charge, release, or order further detention pending an investigation. The Attor-
 ney General may order detainees held for up to 21 days without charge. After that
 time, the authorities must obtain a court order for further detention without charge.
 The authorities bring detainees to trial reasonably expeditiously, although the
 Code does not specify a right to a speedy trial. There is no formal system of bail,
 but the authorities may temporarily release detainees who deposit money or an im-
 portant document such as a passport. The law permits incommunicado detention.
 The Constitution prohibits exile, and it is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial-The UAE has a dual system of Shari'a (Islamic)
 and civil (secular) courts. The nature of the case determines the venue. The civil
 courts are generally part of the federal system and are answerable to the Federal
 Supreme Court in Abu Dhabi. The Shari'a courts are administered by each emirate
 and are also answerable to the Federal Supreme Court. The court systems in the
 emirates of Duba and Baa al-Khaimah ar independent of the federal system, al-
 though they apply the Civil Procedure Code. Each court system has an appeals proc-
 ess. Death sentences may be appealed to the President. Legal procedures are uni-
 form in both Shari'a and civil courts. Defendants are presumed innocent until prov-
 en guilty.
 The Constitution provides for the independence of the judiciary under the Su-
 preme Court which has the power of judicial review and has original jurisdiction
 over disputes between emirates and between the Federal Government and emirates.
 The Constitution designates the Shari'a as the basis of all legislation. Judicial proce-
 dures reflect a mixture of Western and Islamic models.
 In February the President decreed that the Shari'a courts, and not the civil
 courts, would have the authority to try virtually all criminal cases. The decree did
 not affect the emirates of Dubai, Umm Al-Quwain, and Ras al-Khaimah which have
 lower courts independent of the federal system. Nevertheless, despite the decree,
 judges in criminal cases involving non-Muslims may decide to impose civil court
 penalties, and appeals courts may overturn or modify Shari'a penalties imposed on
 non-Muslims by lower courts.
 Legal counsel may represent defendants in both court systems. Under the new
 Criminal Procedures Code, the accused has a right to counsel in all cases involving
 a capital crime or possible life imprisonment. Only the Emirate of Dubai has a pub-
 lic defender's office. If the defendant is indigent, the Government will provide coun-
 sel. The Supreme Court ruled in 1993 that a defendant in an appeal case has a
 "fundamental right" to select his attorney and that this right supersedes a judge's
 power to appoint an attorney for the defendant.
 There are no jury trials. A single judge normally renders the verdict in each case,
 whether in the Shari'a or civil court system. All trials are public, except national
 security cases and those deemed by the judge likely to harm public morality. Most
 judges are foreign nationals, primarily from other Arab countries; however, the Min-
 istry of Justice has begun to train UAE citizens as judges and prosecutors.
 The military has its own court system based on Western military judicial practice.
 Military tribunals try only military personnel. There is no separate national security
 court system.
 There are no known political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits entry into homes without the owner's permission, except in
 accordance with the law. Although the police may enter homes without a warrant
 and without demonstrating probable cause, an officer's actions in searching prem-
 ises are subject to review, and he is subject to disciplinary action if he acts irrespon-
 sibly. Officials other than a police officer must have a court order to enter a private
 home. Local custom places a high value on privacy, and entry into private homes
 without the owner's permission is rare. There is no known surveillance of private
 correspondence.
 
 
 1190
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution provides for freedom
 of speech, most people, especially foreign nationals, refrain from criticizing the Gov-
 ernment in public.
 Many of the local English- and Arabic-language newspapers are privately owned,
 but receive government subsidies. Foreign pubiations are routinely subjected to
 censorship before distribution. Journalists censor themselves regarding reporting on
 government policy, the ruling families, national security, religion, and relations with
 neighboring states.
 In May the Government banned distribution of the Arabic-language daily Al-
 Sharq Al-Awsat for 1 week after the newspaper commented on a memorandum from
 the Minister of Economy and Commerce on the UAE's possible inclusion on the
 United States Trade Representative's "priority-watch" list.
 All television and radio stations are government owned and conform to govern-
 ment reporting guidelines. Satellite receiving dishes are widespread and provide ac-
 cess to international broadcasts without apparent censorship. Censors at the Min-
 istry of Information and Culture review imported newspapers, periodicals, books,
 films, and videos and ban any material considered pornographic, violent, derogatory
 to Islam, favorable to Israel, unduly critical of friendly countries, or critical of the
 Government or the ruling family. Authorities may confiscate material written in He-
 brew.
 The case of the 11 Indian nationals convicted in 1992 and 1993 by Shari'a court
 for producing and performing in a play that allegedly insulted Islam and Christian-
 ity drew to a close in 1994.Four of the defendants, who had been serving various
 prison terms, were released in December and reportedly departed the country. Of
 the remaining seven defendants, six apparently departed the country in 1993 after
 an appeals court overturned their convictions. The seventh defendant was tried in
 absentia.
 The unwritten but generally accepted ban on criticism of the Government also re-
 stricts academic freedom, although in recent years academics have been more open
 with their criticism.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-These freedoms are tightly re-
 stricted. Political organizations are prohibited. Organized public gatherings require
 a government permit. Each emirate determines its own practice on publc gather-
 ings. Some are more tolerant of seminars and conferences on sensitive subjects.
 Citizens normally confme political discussions to the numerous assemblies or
 "majlises," held in private homes. There are no restrictions on such gatherings.
 However private associations must follow the government's censorship guidelines if
 they pubish any material.
 P.Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the official religion. UAE citizens are predomi-
 nately Sunni Muslims, but Shi'a Muslims are also free to worship and maintain
 mosques, except in the Emirate of Ras al-Khaimah. According to a press report, the
 Emirate of Dubai in 1993 placed private mosques under the control of its Depart-
 ment of Islamic Affairs and Endowments. This gave the Government greater control
 over the appointment of preachers and was reportedly intended to prevent the
 spread of what it considers religious extremism.
 Non-Muslims are free to practice their religion but may not proselytize publicly
 or distribute religious literature. The major cities have Christian churches and
 Hindu and Sikh temples, some built on land donated by the ruling families. The
 Government permits the foreign clergy to minister to expatriate congregations. It
 also allows non-Muslims to engage in private charitable activities and to send their
 children to private schools.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no limitations on freedom of movement or relocation within
 the country, except near defense and oil installations.
 Unrestricted foreign travel and emigration are permitted to male citizens except
 those involved in financial disputes under adjudication. However, a husband may
 bar his wife and children from leaving the country without his permission. All citi-
 zens have the right to return. There is a small population of stateless residents,
 many of whom have lived in the UAE for more than one generation. They are Bed-
 ouins or the descendants of Bedouins who are unable to prove that they are of UAE
 origin. The Government does not issue them passports.
 Citizens are not restricted in seeking or changing employment. However, foreign
 workers, except for primarily professional ones, may not change employers without
 first leaving the country for 6 months. This law is often not enforced.
 The Government does not have any formal procedure for accepting refugees. It
 may detain persons seeking refugee status, particularly non-Arabs, while they await
 resettlement in a third country. There is no formal procedure for naturalization, al-
 
 
 1191
 though foreign women receive citizenship by marriage to a UAE citizen, and anyone
 may receive a passport by presidential fiat.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The UAE has no formal democratically elected institutions, and citizens do not
 have the right to change their government or even to form political parties. Al-
 though there are consultative councils at the federal and emirate levels, most execu-
 tive and legislative power is in the hands of the Federal Supreme Council. The
 seven emirate rulers, their extended families, and those peruons and families to
 whom they are allied by historical ties,  marriage, or common interest wield most
 political power in their own emirates. Decisions at the federal level are generally
 made by consensus of the sheikhs of the seven emirates and their leading families.
 A federal consultative body, called the Federal National Council (FNC) consists
 of advisers appointed by the rulers of each emirate. The FNC has no legislative au-
 thority but may question ministers and make policy recommendations to the Cabi-
 net. I ts sessions are usually public.
 The choice of a new emirate ruler falls to the ruling family in consultation with
 other prominent tribal figures. By tradition, the rulers and ruling families are pre-
 sumed to have the right to rule, but their incumbency ultimately depends on the
 quality of their leadership and their responsiveness to their subjects' needs. Emirate
 rulers are accessible, in varying degrees, to citizens who have a problem or a re-
 quest.
 Tradition rather than law has limited the role of women. Women are free to hold
 government positions, but there are few women in senior positions because they are
 relatively new to government service and because there is pressure in many families
 against women entering the workplace. Although the small Shi'a Muslim minority
 has enjoyed commercial success, few Shi'a Muslims have top positions in the Fed-
 eral Government.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no local human rights groups. Government restrictions on freedom of
 press and public association would make it difficult for such groups to investigate
 and publicly criticize the Government's human rights performance.
 Nonetheless, a few informal public discussions of human rights have taken place
 in recent years, such as a seminar in December 1992 and an international sympo-
 sium in late 1993. Foreign and domestic academics, jurists, government officials,
 and a representative of an international human rights organization participated in
 this symposium. These events, along with some press coverage of local human rights
 issues, have led to a modest increase in public awareness of human rights issues.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Women.-Most women play a subordinate role in society because of the frequency
 of early marriage and traditional attitudes about women's activities. As noted in
 Section 2.d., husbands may bar their wives and children from leaving the country,
 and married women may not accept employment without their husbands' written
 consent. Islamic law is applied in cases of divorce. The woman receives custody of
 children until they are 7 years of age. Children older than 7 years live with their
 fathers unless judicial authorities decide otherwise. In divorce cases in which the
 mother is a non-Muslim or a foreigner, the court usually grants custody to the fa-
 ther regardless of the child's age. A woman who remarries forfeits her right to the
 custody of children from a previous marriage. Islamic law permits polygamy for
 men, but they rarely practice it. Women are restricted from holding majority shares
 in most businesses. Women who work outside the home generally receive equal pay
 for equal work, but do not receive equal benefits such as housing.
 Women continue to make rapid progress in education. They constitute 70 percent
 of the student body at the UAE University, largely because women rarely study
 abroad. Opportunities for women have grown in government service, education, and
 health services. Women are officially encouraged to continue their education, and
 government-sponsored women's centers provide adult education and technical train-
 ing courses. The armed forces accept women volunteers. There is a special military
 training course for women which started after the Gulf War.
 Spousal abuse is rarely reported. When reported, the local police authorities may
 take action to protect women from abuse. The laws protect women from verbal
 abuse or harassment from men. Violators are subject to criminal action. There con-
 tinue to be credible reports of abuse of female domestic servants by both UAE and
 foreign employers (see ection 6.e.).
 
 
 1192
 The law prohibits cohabitation by unmaried couples. The Government may im-
 prison or deport noncitizen women if they bear children out of wedlock. In the event
 that courts sentence such women to prison, the local authorities will hold the new-
 born children in a special facility until the mothers' release and deportation. Chil-
 dren may remain in this facility longer in the event of a custody dispute.
 Children.-The Government is committed to the welfare of children. Children re-
 ceive free health care, free education, and guaranteed housing. There is no pattern
 of societal abuse of children.
 National Racial lEthnic Minorities.-Discrimination based on national origin,
 while not legally sanctioned, is prevalent (see Section 2.d.). Employment, immigra-
 tion, and secrity policy as well as cultural attitudes towards foreign workers are
 conditioned by national origin.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no federal legislation requiring provision of ac-
 cessibility for the disabled. However, the Ministry of Labor and Soda Affairs spon-
 srs handicapped centers, which provide facilities and services to the disabled. Serv-
 ices range from special education and transportation assistance to sending a team
 to the Special Olympics.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-There are no unions and no strikes. The law does
 not grant workers the right to organize unions or to strike. Foreign workers, who
 make up the bulk of the work force, risk deportation if they attempted to organize
 unions or strike.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law does not grant work-
 ers the right to engage in collective bargaining, and it is not practiced. Workers in
 the industrial and service sectors are normally employed under contracts that are
 subject to review by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs. The purpose of the
 review is to ensure that the pay will satisfy the employee's basic needs and secure
 a means of living. For the resolution of work-related disputes, workers must rely
 on conciliation committees organized by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs or
 on special labor courts. Labor laws do not cover domestic servants and agricultural
 workers, who have difficulty in obtaining any assistance to resolve their labor dis-
 putes.
 In the Jebel All free zone in Dubai Emirate, the same labor laws apply as in the
 rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is iMle-
 gal and not practiced. However, some unscrupulous employment agents bring for-
 eign workers to the UAE under conditions approaching indenture.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Labor regulations prohibit employ-
 ment of persons under age 15 and have special provisions for employing those aged
 15 to 18. The Department of Labor enforces the regulations. Other regulations per-
 mit employers to engage only adult foreign workers. In 1993 the Government pro-
 hibited the employment of children as camel jockeys and of jockeys who do not
 weigh more than 45 kilograms. The Camel Racing Association enforces the new
 rules. Otherwise child labor is not permitted.
 e. Acceptable Nonditions of Work.-There is no legislated or administrative mini-
 mum wage. Supply and demand determine compensation. However, according to the
 Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, there is an unofficial, unwritten minimum
 wage rate which would afford a worker and family a minimal standard of living.
 As noted in Section 6.b., the Labor and Social Affairs Ministry reviews labor con-
 tracts and does not approve contracts that stipulate a clearly unacceptable wage.
 The standard workday and workweek are 8 hours a day, 6 days a week, but these
 standards are not strictly enforced. Certain types of workers, notably domestic serv-
 ants, may be obliged to work longer than the mandated standard hours. The law
 also provides for a minimum of 24 days a year of annual leave plus 10 national and
 religious holidays. In addition, manual workers are not required to do outdoor work
 when the temperature exceeds 45 degrees Celsius (112 degrees Fahrenheit).
 Most foreign workers receive either employer-provided housing or a housing allow-
 ance, medical care, and homeward passage from their employers. Most foreign work-
 ers do not earn the minimum salary of approximately $1,370 a month required to
 obtain a residency visa for their families. Employers have the option to petition for
 a 1-year ban from the work force against any foreign employee who leaves his job
 without fulfilling the terms of his contract.
 The Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, municipalities,
 and civil defense units enforce health and safety standards. The Government re-
 quires every large industrial concern to employ a certified occupational safety offi-
 cer. An injured worker is entitled to fair compensation. Health standards are not
 uniformly observed in the housing camps provided for foreign workers. Workers' jobs
 
 
 1193
 are not protected if they remove themselves from what they consider to be unsafe
 working conditions. However, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs may require
 employers to reinstate workers dismissed for not performing unsafe work. All work-
 ers have the right to lodge grievances with ministry officials, who make an effort
 to investigate  all complaints. However, the Ministry is understaffed     and
 underbudgeted so that complaints and compensation claims are backlogged.
 Complaints may be appealed to the Ministry and ultimately to the courts. How-
 ever, many workers do not protest for fear of reprisals or deportation. There have
 been reports, some published in the local press, of abuses suffered by domestic serv-
 ants, particularly women, by their employers. Allegations have included excessive
 work hours, extremely low wages, and verbal and physical abuse.
