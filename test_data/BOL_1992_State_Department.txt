 BOLVIA
 Bolivia is a multiparty democracy with an elected President and bicameral legisla-
 ture. Because no presidential candidate received a majority of the popular vote in
 the elections of May 1989 the Congress, in a procedure mandated by the Constitu-
 tion, selected Jaime Paz Zamora as President. The executive, legislative, and judi-
 cial powers are separate. Municipal elections held in December 1991 were perhape
 the most open in Bolivian history, in part due to electoral and judicial reforms in-
 cluding the establishment of an impartial electoral court in 1991.
 The police and the armed forces are generally responsible to and controlled by the
 civilian Government, but there continued to be incidents of human rights abuses by
 the security forces in 1992. According to the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament
 Agency, total military expenditures for 1989 were $182 million. While the Govern-
 ment is not making a conscious effort to reduce military spending through legisla-
 tion the defense budget has steadily eroded as a percentage of the gross domestic
 product and of the total budget and will probably continue to do so.
 Bolivia is rich in minerals and hydrocarbons (petroleum), which account for the
 bulk of its export earnings, but is still one of the poorest countries in the Western
 Hemisphere. Its economy only began to show consistent growth in 1987-88 after
 years of severe contraction. The Government has emphasized debt reduction, export
 development, foreign investment, privatization, and a freer banking system to
 strengtLhen Bolivia's economic base and accelerate development. The economy grew
 4.1 percent in 1991 and an estimated 3.3 percent in 1992.
 Respect for human rights is mandated by the Constitution and generally prac-
 ticed. Human rights abuses in 1992 included instances of mistreatment of detainees
 and prisoners (generally with impunity or leniency for the perpetrators), sub-
 standard prison conditions, an overburdened and often corrupt judicial system, pro-
 longed incarceration of detainees, and discrimination and violence against women
 and indigenous people. Bolivia is involved in an extensive counternarcotics effort
 against well-entrenched and increasingly violent foreign and domestic drug traffick-
 ers. Government attempts to stem the flow of narcotics (principally cocaine-related)
 have resulted in allegations of police abuses. While some of these allegations, such
 as invasion of privacy and illegal confiscation of private property, seem credible,
 more serious allegations have not been substantiated.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extra judicial Killing.-There were no cases of political
 killings in 1992 by the Government, but several prisoners die each year as a result
 of manutrition or inadequate medical care. A bomb left at a gas pipeline near Sucre
 by the Tupac Katari Guerrilla Army (EGTK) terrorist groupkilled two children. In
 addition, Colombian narcotraffickers carried out several killings. Five members of
 the Armed Forces of Liberation-Zarate Willka (FALZW) were sentenced in August
 to terms ranging from 3 to 30 years in prison for the 1989 murder of two American
 Mormon missionaries.
 Two Bolivian police officers, charged with the execution of an alleged Peruvian
 terrorist, Evaristo Salazar, were dismissed in 1991 and charged with negligent
 homicide and coercion (the use of undue force in interrogation). They were sentenced
 to 4 years in prison, but the Government appealed, asking only 2-year sentences.
 A senior police official claimed that 'extenuating circumstances* justified the appeal,
 adding that the Government did not want to demoralize the antiterrorist police.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no known politically motivated disappearances
 during 1992.
 Judicial proceedings in the case of former dictator General Garcia Meza, being
 tried in absentia for involvement in disappearances during his rule in 1981-82, are
 now in their sixth year. The prosecution rested its case, but the court did not render
 a decision before the end of 1992. Amnesty International representatives observed
 the final stages of the case. Human rights groups and other individuals accused the
 Government of protecting Garcia Meza; the Government denied the allegations and
 pledged to capture Garcia Meza before it leaves office in August 1993.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture, but there continue to be occasional allegations
 of torture and credible charges of cruel and degrading treatment of detainees and
 prisoners by police officers and prison personnel. Security personnel are rarely tried
 and punished for such acts due to lack of evidence.
 Between January and April, the Government captured 16 leading members of the
 EGTK terrorist group. Some of the detainees claimed they were tortured; represent-
 
 
 340
 atives of the Bolivian Permanent Assembly on Human Rights (APDHB) who visited
 them endorsed the claims. Government officials denied that the prisoners had been
 tortured, but the police admitted to depriving them of sleep during the interrogation
 process.
 Conditions in most Bolivian jails remain very poor, as they have been for years.
 Overcrowding, corruption, malnutrition, unsanitary conditions, and drug and alcohol
 abuse are common, For example, the San Pedro jail in La Paz, which was con-
 structed to hold no more than 200 inmates, has a population of more than 1,300.
 Overrow      is so severe that 5 persons may be confined to a small cell with the
 result that the occupants sleep sitting up because there is not enough space to lie
 down. The new Chonchocro prison tt opened in the spring is a model prison,
 with modern facilities and efficient management, but its capacity is only 300, and
 will offer little relief to overcrowding at San Pedro.
 Under Bolivian law, children up to 6 years old may live in prison if the incarcer-
 ated pa rent so desires. Currently, approximately 750 children are in jails through-
 out Bolivia. In Santa Cruz, several family members (up to 17 in one case) hive in
 jail with the inmate because they have nowhere else to go.
 There were allegations by human rights groups of sexual abuses within the wom-
 en's prison; prison administrators denied these allegations.
 There are several prison deaths every year related to malnutrition and poor medi-
 cal care. For example, in August inmate Dolly Romero died as a result of inadequate
 medical care in the Obrajes women's prison. According to family members, she had
 asked for medical care several times during an 8-mnth period but was refused by
 the judge assigned to her case. Her death spurred a hunger strike by 71 of the 240
 inmate, and demands for prison reform. There was a similar hunger strike in the
 San Pedro jail after a 60-year-old man died of malnutrition and untreated asthma.
 The Minister of the Interior formally testified on prison poblem before the Human
 Rights Commission in the Chamber of Deputies.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution require a court order
 for an arrest; detainees must be charged or released within 48 hours. In practice,
 many detainees remain incarcerated for months, or even years, before comning to
 trial. The Constitution also provides for a judicial determination of the legality of
 detention, and prisoners are usually released if a judge rules that they have been
 detained illegally. After the initial detention, prisoners may consult a lawyer of their
 choice. Prvisions for bail exist, except in certain narcotics cases, and bail is gen-
 erally granted.
 Exile is not used as a punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public   r  The constitutional right to a fair public trial is
 adhered to in most respects, with one important exception delays commonly result
 in protracted judicial procedures lasting 3 to 4 years without sentencing. As a re-
 sut about 80  rnt of the prison population is unsentencd. Investigation, trial,
 and arp peal procedures are so protracted that some prisoners eventually serve mere
 time than the maximum snense for the crime for which they were charged.
 Defendants have the right to an attorney, to confront witnesses, to present evi-
 dence and toappealajudicial decision. These rights generally are upheld in prac-
 tice. Although the law provides for a ceourt-appinted defense attorney at public ex-
 pense if necessary, one may not always be available due to shortages of  a  an
 qualified personnel. In June a public defenders' office was established in La Pa to
 provide counsel in criminal cases for people who cannot afford a lawyer. The office
 currently has 10 lawyers who handle an average of 20 cases at a time. It hopes to
 increase the case load to 80 per lawyer.
 Corruption and intimidation in the judicial system remain serious problems.
 Judes and prosecutors are poorly paid, making them uceptible to bribery. Cor-
 ruption is also endemic in the national police system, marked by a highly publicized
 police corruption scandal in Setember. Senior polic and government officials
 purged some corrupt police and improved oversight mechanisms, but appeared to
 have only limited success in. combatting corruption. With the average police officer
 earning only 50-60 per month, police officials acknowledge that preventing corrup-
 tion is a daunting challenge.
 Narcotics traffickers otren bribe judicial and other officials to release suspected
 traffickers and their aircraft, return captured drugs, and purge incriminating ile.
 Surrendered narcotraffickers received extremely low sentences ranging from 3 to 7
 and most were not even charged with narcotics offenses. The sentences were
 a result of poor prosecution and possibly of bribing judges. Three judges from
 the special narcotics court were prosecuted for corruption. The Government has
 taken steps to try to discipline Bolivia's judicial system; the Supreme Court formed
 a commission to investigate charges of cmrption i district courts. In August a pe-
 
 
 341
 cial council on judicial reform and modernization presented a draft law of judicial
 organization which aims to reform the judicial system.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 sanctity of the home and the privacy of citizens' lives are protected by the Constitu-
 tion and usually respected in practice. However there were credible allegations of
 abuses by the rural counternarotics polie (UM6PAR) operating in the Chapare re-
 gion where moat of Bolivia's illegal coca is grown. Campesino leaders claimed there
 were several incidents of UMOPAR police entering homes in the middle of the night
 under the pretext of sarching for money or goods related to narcotrafficking. The
 Interior Ministry formed a human rights commission with government and non-
 gvrmntal representatives to investigate the allegations. At least six police were
 from t  special counternarctic force as a result of the commission's in-
 vestigations. The commission declared there was no evidence to cnfir m many al-
 leged abuses, and that there had been a large decline in allegations of abuses since
 its investigation began.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-There are no legal or institutional barriers to
 freedom of speech and press in Bolivia. Both state-owned and private radio and tele-
 vision stations operate in Bolivia. All newspapers are privately owned, and meat of
 them generally adpt antigovernment positions. There continue to be numerous
 crediui charges of politicians and drug traffickers bribing journalists for greater
 and more favorable coverage; the professional and union organizations deny such
 charges.
 The Government respects academic freedm Public universities enjoy autonomous
 status by law, _and that status is respected. However, various umversity-based
 Marxist-oriented groups continue efforts to deny academic freedom and to impose
 their political agenda on the education process.
 s.Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The rights of peaceful assem-
 bly and association are provided for by law and are respected in practice. The year
 was marked by almost daily demonstrations and rallies carried out by a wide vari-
 ety of labor, political and student organizations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-RomanCathoicism predominates in Bolivia; the Con-
 stitution recognizes it as the official religion. Catholic bishops receive a nominal sti-
 pnd from the State and the Government has designated the Catholic Church as
 the coordinator of all official public ceremonies. However, citizens are free to prac-
 tice the religion of their choice. An estimated 400 religious groups, msetly Protes-
 tant, are active. Missionary groups--usually evanglical Christians-are required to
 register with the Foreign Ministry as nongovernmental organizations (NGO's).
 There is no indication that missionary groups have been treated differently from
 other NGO's, and no registrations have been    rove
 d. Freedom of Movenent Within the County, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Ther are no restrictions on travel within Bolivia or a road. The Gov-
 ernment does not impede emigration and uarantees departing citizens the right to
 return. Citizenship is not revoked for political reasons.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Bolivia is a multiparty democracy with an elected president an a functioning,
 independent, bicameral ei slature. Opposition groups ranging from the far lef to
 the right function freely. The December 1991 municipal elections were free and fair,
 resulting in a peaceful, constitutional change of local governments.
 Suffrage is universal and obligatory. There are no legal impedimenta to women
 or members of indigenous ups voting, holding political office, or rising to leader-
 ship in the Government. Nevertheless,thhe number of women who have attained
 prominent positions in politics is still small, and indigenous groups have little rep-
 resentation in the Government.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government is sensitive to the opinions of domestic and international human
 rights organizations and is willing to discuss human rights concerns with them.
 Both chambers of Congress have committees responsible for monitoring the observ-
 ance of human rights. The Catholic Church, APDHB, labor organizations, and the
 press have been aggressive monitors of human rights and comment frequently on
 relevant issues and developments. International groups such as Amnesty Inter-
 national and the Washington Office on Latin America also observe human rights in
 Bolivia and have visited the country.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Lan e, or Social Status
 Although the law contains an advanced family code passed in the 1970's, Bolivian
 women generally do not enjoy a social status equal to that of men. Many rural and
 poor women are unaware of their rights under the law, and traditional prejudices,
 social conditions, and limited political influence remain major obstacles to advance-
 ment for women. In rural families, women contribute significantly to economic activ-
 ity and often control the family finances but nonetheless are considered socially and
 politically subordinate. In urban settings, women are slowly achieving a greater role
 in business and professional life, as their participation in cooperatives, community
 affairs, and education increases. In both rural and urban settings, women are more
 likely than men to be illiterate and employed in low-level or domestic jobs.
 There are no reliable or complete statistics indicating the extent of violence
 against women in Bolivia. However, many women and some women's rights groups
 have made credible charges that this is a serious problem. Violence against women
 is a criminal offense in Bolivia, and legal sanctions are regularly applied when cases
 come to the attention of the authorities. There is no penalty, however, for domestic
 violence that results in "mild wounds" if the family members involved live together.
 Women are reluctant to bring charges in cases of domestic violence, and abuse such
 as wife beating is underreported. Legal counseling is available for women on a lim-
 ited basis through private organizations. The Center for Investigation and Develop-
 ment of Women, along with other organizations such as the "Platform for Women,'
 is working through Congress to change the Penal Code in order to extend better pro-
 tection for women from violence.
 Although prohibited by the Constitution, discrimination against people of indige-
 nous background continues. The Aymaraand Quechua-speaking Indian majority of
 the po ulation remains at the lower end of the country's socioeconomic scale and
 is disadvantaged in terms of health, life expectancy, education, income, literacy, and
 employment. Government programs, including infrastructure projects sponsored by
 the social investment fund such as schools, health clinics, and water systems, di-
 rectly benefit some of the disadvantaged.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Bolivian workers may establish and join organiza-
 tions of their own choosing. The Labor Code requires previous authorization Tor the
 establishment of a trade union, restricts more than one union from establishing it-
 self at a given enterprise, and allows the Government to dissolve trade unions by
 administrative act. However, the Government does not enforce these provisions of
 the law and has used none of these powers in recent history. The Labor Code also
 denies civil servants the right to organize and prohibits strikes in all public services,
 including banks and public markets. Nevertheless, virtually all government workers
 are unionized.
 Workers in the private sector possess and frequently exercise the right to strike.
 The International Labor Organization's (ILO) Committee of Experts has criticized
 the requirement in the Labor Code that strike votes require the approval of three-
 fourths of employees actually in service instead of a simple majority. Solidarity
 strikes are illegal, but the Government has never prosecuted those responsible for
 such strikes. The only significant strike in 1992 was a public schoolteachers' strike
 which had wide civic support and resulted in a pay raise for teachers.
 Unions are not truly independent of the Government and political parties. All
 unions are underfinanced and depend on outside support. The political parties all
 have labor committees that attempt to influence union activity, but they have been
 only partially successful in recent years. The Government places no restrictions on
 a union's right to join international labor organizations. The Bolivian Labor Confed-
 eration (COB) became an affiliate of the Communist-dominated World Federation of
 Trade Unions in 1988.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Bolivian workers have the
 legal right to organize and bargain collectively. The law does not extend this right
 to government workers, but the distinction is largely ignored in practice, as virtually
 all government workers are organized. Consultations between government rep-
 resentatives and labor leaders are common but there are no collective bargaining
 agreements as the term is normally used. In state industries, the union issues a list
 of demands, and the Government concedes some points. Private sector employers
 normally use public sector settlements as guidelines for their own adjustments, and
 some private sector employers even exceed what the Government grants. However,
 the Government, conscious of International Monetary Fund guidelines, rarely grants
 wage increases that exceed the rate of inflation. As in the public sector, there is no
 real collective bargaining and no signed agreements.
 
 
 The law prohibits discrimination by employers against union members and orga-
 nizers. Complaints are referred to the National Labor Court, which often takes a
 year or more to rule on a question. Labor activists say that a problem is often moot
 by the time the court rules.
 In July the Minister of Labor rescinded the 'trade union leave' of two union lead-
 ers. This leave guarantees the right of workers to function as labor leaders and still
 receive their salaries. Apparently one of the reasons for rescinding this leave was
 that the two leaders worked witi the American Institute of Free Labor Develop-
 ment. After the US. Ambassador protested the Labor Minister's act, the two leaders
 were fired from their jobs at the petroleum workers' social security clinic. The Labor
 Minister then ordered them reinstated in their jobs, but the employer refused to let
 them return to work, despite a provision in the Bolivian Constitution that guaran-
 tees freedom of association. To date, neither the jobs nor union positions have been
 restored.
 There are seven special commercial or industrial duty-free zones in Bolivia, and
 labor law and practice are the same in these zones as in the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor and the law is generally complied with and enforced. No cases of
 forced or compulsory labor were reported during 1992.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law prohibits the employment
 of persons under 18 years of age in dangerous, unhealthy, or immoral work. Boliv-
 ia's labor code is ambiguous on the conditions of employment for minors from age
 14 through 17 years ofage, and it permits apprenticeship for children between the
 ages of 12 and 14. This practice has been repeatedly criticized by ILO committees,
 to which the Government responded that it would present legislation reforming this
 and other provisions of the Labor Code by the end of the year. Responsibility for
 enforcing child labor provisions lies with the National Office of Minors which is part
 of the Government's Social Action Group for the Presidency. Existing legal provi-
 sions concerning employment of children are generally not enforced; young children
 can be found on the streets hawking goods, shining shoes, and assisting transport
 operators. They are not usually employed in factories or businesses. Bolivia has
 compulsory education through the elementary level. In practice, all urban children
 receive elementary education while only a half of rural children do. Less than 30
 percent of Bolivian children       be yon  ementary school.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work -  he Government, both by statute and   resi-
 dential decree, has established a minimum wage and system oJbnuses and
 benefits. A worker earning only the minimum wage would not be able to sustain
 a decent standard of living, let alone support a family. However, workers in most
 occupations earn more than the minimum wage. Though the minimum wage is well
 below the prevailing wage in most occupations, it is significant because certain
 fringe benefits are pegged to it. Approximately 20 percent of the urban work force-
 street vendors, shoe polishers, and lottery ticket sellers, for example-are not cov-
 ered by the minimum wage.
 In urban areas, only half the labor force enjoys an 8-hour workday and a work-
 week of 5 or 5Y2 days. Like many other labor laws, the maximum legal workweek
 of 44 hours is not enforced. Responsibility for the protection of worker's health and
 safety lies with the Labor Ministrys Bureau of Occupational Safety. Labor laws that
 provide for the protection of workers' health and safety are not adeuately enforced.
 Although the state-owned mining corporation Comibol has a special office charged
 with mne safety, the mines, often old and operated with antiquated equipment, are
 particularly dangerous and unhealthy.
