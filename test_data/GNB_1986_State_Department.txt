 GUINEA-BISSAU
 The Republic of Guinea-Bissau adopted a constitutional form of
 government in May 1984, when the 4-year old Revolutionary
 Council, established after the 1980 coup d'etat, was
 abolished. Following the promulgation of the Constitution,
 elections were held for the National Popular Assembly, which in
 turn elected General Joao Bernardo Vieira to a 5-year term as
 President of the Council of State. The 150-member Assembly
 also chose the other members of the Council. Despite adoption
 of the Constitution, effective control remains in the hands of
 President Vieira, who serves as Head of State, Commander in
 Chief, and general secretary of Guinea-Bissau's sole political
 party, the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and
 Cape Verde (PAIGC).
 Political opposition is forbidden. The party selects all
 candidates for office, who run unopposed at all levels of
 government. The 1984 Constitution nominally guarantees the
 equality of all citizens, the rights of man, and the rule of
 law. The Government generally accords these rights, but the
 rigidity of the single party system clearly limits individual
 political freedom. The Government cites national security to
 crack down on activities it views as a threat to its
 authority. The armed forces (FARP) are responsible for state
 security, both internal and external, as mandated by the
 Constitution. Persons accused of political crimes are tried by
 military tribunals.
 Economically, Guinea-Bissau remains one of the world's poorest
 and least developed nations, dependent upon foreign aid for its
 survival. The Government's postinzdependence efforts to
 exercise Soviet-style control over the economy resulted in
 chronic shortages of the most basic commodities, high
 unemployment, and a worthless currency. In 1986 the Government
 continued reforms initiated in 1983 aimed at stimulating the
 private sector, shifting ownership of the means of production
 from state to private hands, and bringing the moribund economy
 back to life.
 The Government's human rights record was marred by several
 events during 1986. Six of the 50 persons arrested in October
 1985 for plotting to oust President Vieira were tried for
 treason and executed in July. Another five of the accused died
 mysteriously in prison while awaiting trial. Incidents of
 religious persecution and suppression of freedom of the press
 also occurred in Guinea-Bissau during 1986.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killing.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Five persons accused of plotting to overthrow the Government
 died in prison between February 12 and June 1, before they
 
 
 141
 GUINEA-BISSAU
 could be brought to trial. The official explanation of their
 deaths is that four died of natural causes, and the fifth was
 shot while trying to escape. It is widely believed, however,
 that four died as a result of beatings received in prison. The
 families of four of the five victims were not allowed to view
 the bodies. In the fifth case, the family saw the body only
 from a distance, but claimed that they could see discolorations
 and an indentation on the side of the head.
 The Constitution prohibits cruel and inhuman punishment.
 However, prison conditions are unsanitary and cramped, and
 interogation methods are severe. Prisoners' families routinely
 bring them food and medical supplies. Capital punishment is
 forbidden in civil criminal cases but allowed in cases before
 military tribunals.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arrests in Guinea-Bissau are frequently arbitrary, as arrest
 procedures are undefined and the use of arrest warrants is the
 exception rather than the rule. Traditional law still prevails
 in most rural areas. The legal system inherited from the
 Portuguese colonial regime, but modified by the Constitution,
 functions in the capital, Bissau, and other urban centers. It
 includes important procedural rights, such as the right to
 counsel and the right to a judicial determination of the
 legality of detention. Bail procedures are observed
 erratically. The Government has the legal right to exile
 prisoners but did not do so in 1986.
 There is no forced or compulsory labor in Guinea-Bissau.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judicial system is based on the Portuguese model, with some
 exceptions. Intervals between arrest and trial are often
 lengthy. All defense lawyers are court appointed, as private
 legal practice is prohibited. The judiciary is part of the
 executive branch. Trials involving state security are not open
 to outside observers and are conducted by military tribunals.
 FARP members are tried by military courts for all offenses.
 The Supreme Court is the final court of appeal for both
 civilian and military cases except those involving national
 security matters, in which cases the Council of State reviews
 all decisions.
 Former Vice President Paulo Correia, former Deputy Minister of
 Justice Viriato Pa, and four others who had been arrested in
 October 1985, were charged with plotting a coup, tried before a
 military court in June 1986, and subsequently sentenced to
 death. They were executed by firing squad on July 17, 1986,
 despite appeals for clemency by Presidents Mitterand of France
 and Soares of Portugal, the Pope, Amnesty International, and
 all Western Chiefs of Mission accredited to Bissau. Six others
 who were sentenced to death had their sentences commuted to 15
 years of hard labor. President Vieira justified the executions
 as necessary to preserve national security, declaring that
 former Vice President Correia had attempted a coup once before
 and that all of those executed had sought to incite ethnic
 divisions within the society to overthrow the Government.
 Forty-five other defendants in the treason trial were sentenced
 to varying prison terms.

 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution guarantees the inviolability of domicile,
 person, and correspondence. These guarantees are not always
 respected in cases of serious crimes or state security where,
 for example, the use of search warrants is rare. International
 and domestic mail is subject to surveillance and/or censorship.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of intellectual, artistic,
 and scientific expression, with the significant exception of
 cases in which these rights are exercised in a manner "contrary
 to the prom6tion of social progress." In fact, the Government
 controls all information media and views the press as a vehicle
 of the party. Self-censorship by journalists is common.
 However, some criticism and questioning of policies is
 permitted, although never of individual officials. In June the
 Government expelled a Portuguese journalist, who had written of
 local corruption and human rights violations, when he refused
 to reveal his sources.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of assembly and
 association, and government approval is not required for
 peaceful assemblies and demonstrations. However, all existing
 organizations and associations are linked to the Government or
 the party, including the sole labor union, the National Union
 of the Workers of Guinea-Bissau (UNTG). The UNTG is affiliated
 with the Communist-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions
 and is a member of the Organization of African Trade Union
 Unity. Strikes, while not specifically forbidden, do not
 occur. Manufacturing is extremely limited and all major
 enterprises are state owned. Thus, the overwhelming majority
 of salaried workers are employees of the state, and the union
 is forbidden to organize these public workers.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Religious freedom is guaranteed by the Constitution and has
 been respected. Christians, Muslims, and animists worship
 freely, and proselytizing is permitted. However, a new and
 growing religious movement known as the Yanque-Yanque has
 emerged and its practices have caused the Government concern.
 This movement, founded a few years ago by a woman who claims to
 receive visions and to have healing powers, finds its support
 mainly among young Balantas (the same ethnic group from which
 most of the coup plotters came). Yanque-Yanue is a
 monotheistic religion which rejects traditional animist,
 Christian, and Muslim values and is charactized by unusual and
 sometimes violent rituals which include the taking of a locally
 produced narcotic mixture. These rituals have occasionally
 caused physical harm to participants and even to individuals
 outside the movement, Moreover, the Yanque-Yanque reject
 modern social and economic structures including, by
 implication, the Government. At this time Yanque-Yanque does
 not constitute a political movement. Nevertheless, the
 Government has questioned, detained, and occasionally arrested
 several Yanque-Yanque leaders, often on narcotics charges. The
 occasional taking of drugs, without any legal repercussions, is
 a characteristic of the rituals of some other local religions.

 GUINEA-BISSAU
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government introduced several steps to ease restrictions on
 freedom of movement within the country, emigration, and foreign
 travel. President Vieira abolished the network of roadblocks
 set up to control smuggling, and Guinea-Bissauans can now
 travel freely throughout the country. The President also made
 it easier for citizens to obtain passports and, though the
 Government does not encourage emigration, spoke of his
 understanding of the economic conditions which have compelled
 thousands to emigrate. He also invited all Guinea-Bissauans
 living abroad to return home without fear of retribution.
 While sympathetic to the principle of asylum, Guinea-Bissau
 does not host significant numbers of refugees.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Guinea-Bissau is led by the PAIGC party and military (FARP)
 elite, headed by President Joao Bernardo Vieira. By the terms
 of the Constitution, all political activity must take place
 within the party/state structure. The 1984 electoral slates
 for the National Popular Assembly at the district, regional,
 and national levels were party-prepared lists. Write-in or
 opposition candidacies were not permitted. The President,
 members of the Council of State, and National Popular Assembly
 deputies are elected to 5-year terms. There are provisions for
 revision of the Constitution and national referendums. Change
 occurs through Presidential decisions supportad by the Council
 of State. No single ethnic group dominates party/government
 positions, but the fact that the city of Bissau is located in a
 Papel and creole (mixed-race) inhabited zone guarantees these
 two groups disproportionate representation within the
 Government. Women have legal equality with men and hold some
 influential jobs within the party and the Government. The
 current Secretary of State for Labor and Social Security and
 the President of the National Assembly are both women.
 Foreigners residing in Guinea-Bissau are entitled to the same
 rights as citizens, except for the right to vote and hold
 public office.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 President Vieira welcomed the visit of an Amnesty International
 team during the coup plot trials in June, pointing out that
 such a visit would not be allowed by many African nations. The
 Amnesty team, however, was tightly scheduled and had little
 time for making independent contacts while in Bissau. The team
 observed the trials for 1 day. President Vieira continues to
 invite international delegations to visit and inspect human
 rights conditions in Guinea-Bissau. There are no local human
 rights groups operating in the country.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The population of Guinea-Bissau comprises diverse tribal groups,
 each with its own language, customs, and social organization.
 The Fula, Mandinga, Balanta, and Papel are important groups.
 The underdevelopment of the country precludes any one ethnic
 group from asserting itself economically or politically, as all
 groups are desperately poor. Creoles enjoy a somewhat
 
 
 144
 GUINEA-BISSAU
 advantageous position within the society, due to their
 generally higher level of education and their links to Portugal
 and Cape Verde. However, this has not resulted in economic or
 political domination. President Vieira has spoken repeatedly
 of the need for creating a stronger sense of nationhood. His
 public statements concerning the July executions of coup
 plotters reflect his belief that they were seeking to divide
 the society in order to assure the domination of the Balanta
 ethnic group. The Balanta group is the largest in
 Guinea-Bissau but does not constitute a majority of the
 population. There is no evidence of any strong dissatisfaction
 among the Balanta, other than the general disaffection over
 economic conditions which is common in Guinea-Bissau.
 Discrimination against women, while officially prohibited,
 continues within certain ethnic groups, especially the Muslim
 Fulas and Mandinkas of the north and east. Among those groups
 female circumcision is still practiced, despite official
 prohibition and educational campaigns against this custom.
 Women enjoy higher status in the societies of the Balanta,
 Papel, and Biagos groups living mainly in the southern coastal
 region.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 In an overwhelmingly rural and agricultural society,
 traditional division of labor practices, both between sexes and
 age groups, continue to prevail. Children in all rural
 communities work in the fields and at home for no pay. The
 Government does not attempt to discourage this practice and, in
 fact, delays the opening of schools until the rice-planting
 season has ended. Even in the small modern sector, labor laws
 are ill-defined and unevenly enforced in Guinea-Bissau, due
 primarily to the extreme economic underdevelopment of the
 society. However, there are government regulations covering
 such matters as job-related disabilities and vacation rights;
 and the Government is soon expected to approve the draft of a
 new labor code, which will set a minimum age of 14 for general
 factory labor and of 18 for heavy or dangerous labor, including
 all labor in mines. The normal work week is 39 hours. There
 is no minimum wage.
