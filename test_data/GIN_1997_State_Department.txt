 GUINEA
 President Lansana Conte took office as head of state of the Republic of Guinea
 in 1994, after multiparty elections in which the Government dominated the electoral
 process. Guinea he d its first multiparty legislative elections in 1995, delivering
 more than 60 percent of Parliament's seats to President Conte's Party of Unity and
 Progress (PUP). The PUP is one seat short of the majority required to make con-
 stitutional amendments. Opposition leaders, some international observers, and seg-
 ments of the citizenry voiced suspicion of PUP's considerable victories in both par-
 liamentary and municipal elections. Although the PUP continues to dominate all
 three branches of government, opposition parties have on occasion persuaded PUP
 members of Parliament, including the National Assembly leadership, to vote with
 the opposition on specific legislative matters. The judiciary is subject to executive
 influence, particular  in politically sensitive cases.
 The gendarmerie and the national police share responsibility for internal security
 and sometimes play an oppressive role in the daily lives of citizens. The Red Be-
 rets-autonomous presidential guards-are accountable to almost no one except the
 President. Members of all the security forces, which many citizens view as corrupt,
 ineffective, and even dangerous, frequently commit human rights abuses.
 About 85 percent of the countys 7 million people engage in subsistence agri-
 culture. Annual per capita gross domestic product is about $750. More than 90 per-
 cent of export earnings come from mining, particularly bauxite, gold, and diamonds.
 Additional exports include coffee and fruit.In July 1996, President Conte appointed
 
 
 a new government, including the country's first Prime Minister, which emphasized
 economic reform.
 The Government continued to circumscribe human rights. The Government's tight
 control over the electoral process and the lack of an independent electoral oversight
 mechanism, and a prohibition on nongovernmental broadcast media, call into seri-
 ous doubt the ability of citizens to change the government. Major human rights
 abuses include: disappearances; police abuse of prisoners and detainees; use of tor-
 ture by military personnel; inhuman prison conditions and frequent deaths due to
 these conditions and lack of medical care; instances of arbitrary arrest and deten-
 tion; governmental failure to ensure access by attorneys to clients in prison; the ex-
 ecutive branch's influence over the judicial system and the electoral process; occa-
 sional instances of vigilante justice by unidentified uniformed personnel; infringe-
 ment on citizens' privacy; restrictions on freedom of speech and the press; restric-
 tions on freedom of assembly; societal discrimination and violence against women;
 and prostitution and genital mutilation of young girls.
 The Government dominated the electoral process. However, the PUP head of the
 National Assembly and the leaders of the opposition called for the creation of an
 independent electoral commission. The independent press criticized the Govern-
 ment, but met with a broad range of restrictions, including the arrest of journalists.
 The Government owns and operates the electronic media, the major medium for
 reaching the vast majority of the public.
 The Ministry of Justice, the National Assembly and local nongovernmental orga-
 nizations (NGO'S) attempted to educate the citizenry about the judicial process and
 individual rights. The Ministry of National Defense also sponsored a series of semi-
 nars to teach the armed forces and gendarmes about human rights. The Inter-
 national Committee of the Red Cross, trained Ministry of Security officials and cus-
 toms officers on humanitarian law.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of targeted
 political killings.
 Relief organizations reported scattered rebel incursions into refugee camps to
 steal livestock and other goods. In contrast to previous years, no one was reported
 killed in the attacks. In June unknown members of the security forces shot and
 killed a Sierra Leonean refugee and wounded his brother while the boys were fish-
 ing near the Kolomba refugee camp. The Government reportedly investigated the
 incident, but has not released results from the investigation.
 Security forces committed extrajudicial killings during the February 1996 mutiny.
 Between 30 and 50 persons, mostly civilian victims of stray gunfire, were killed by
 military forces and mutineers during the 2-day uprising. The Government made nu-
 merous arrests of mutinous soldiers following the mutiny. Local NGO's reported
 that in March and April, the Government released approximately 60 of the soldiers
 detained in the 1996 mutiny. Several arrests also were made following the mutiny-
 related killing of Colonel Seny Bangoura, commander of the Alpha Yaya military
 camp in Conakry, by uniformed soldiers in March 1996. The suspects were charged
 with voluntary assassination, threatening state security, destruction of state prop-
 erty, and dereliction of duty. The suspects remained incarcerated, awaiting trial
 with the alleged ringleaders of the February 1996 mutiny. In June the Government
 activated a State Security Court to try the remaining 30 to 40 alleged mutiny ring-
 leaders still in prison awaiting trial (see Section i.e.). At year's end there had been
 no trial.
 Deaths in custody due to inhuman prison conditions and inadequate medical
 treatment are frequent (see Section 1.c.).
 No investigation has been conducted into the deaths in 1996 of two detainees,
 Dian Oury Kante and Mahamed Diallo, who were awaiting trial for murder and rob-
 bery in Telimele.
 There has been no investigation into the January 1995 deaths of 16 civilian pris-
 oners while in custody. There has been no further action in the case of the police-
 man arrested for killing a youth at a rally in Conakry in 1995 or in the case of two
 police charged with killing a civilian in 1996 in Kissidougou. The Guinean Organiza-
 tion for the Defense of Human and Citizen Rights (OGDH) disputes the official tally,
 claiming that 24 people actually died while in police custody. A former inmate at
 the prison reported that the dead were buried in a clandestine cemetery in the pris-
 on courtyard.
 Government authorities also blocked separate efforts by human rights gups and
 nongovernmental organizations to investigate political killings that took place in the
 
 
 145
 1970's under then-president Sekou Toure and to protect victims' burial plots from
 urban encroachment. Two NGO's representing the victims of those who died in
 Camp Boiro, the Conakry prison where hundreds of political prisoners and members
 of the intelligentsia were detained or killed, held a memorial service on April 3 to
 call attention to their cause. A memorial to the victims is being erected at the site.
 Vigilante action by victims or others sometimes resulted in the beating to death
 of suspected criminals (see Section i.e.).
 b. Disappearance.-Opposition leaders, local NGO', and the independent press re-
 ported cases of temporary disappearances that ended with the eventual release of
 the prisoners who had been held by security forces.
 In the months after the February 1996 mutiny, hundreds of soldiers and civilians
 disappeared during neighborhood sweeps conducted by armed members of the secu-
 rity forces, who were often masked to bide their identities. Some of these individuals
 were subsequently released; others continue to be held awaiting trial. The Guinean
 Organization for the Defense of Human and Citizen Rights (ODH) reports that
 people were taken from their homes in the middie of the night and incarcerated.
 After interrogations dozens of soldiers were transferred to judicial authorities for
 legal proceedings related to the mutiny, but in August 1996 prosecutors released 63
 detainees for lack of evidence. Baba Sarr, a relative of the mutiny ringleader Major
 Gbago Zoumanigui, remained missing since his detention following the February
 mutiny.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Penal Code and the Constitution prohibit torture and cruel, inhuman, or de-
 grading treatment. However, both civilian and military security forces often use
 beatings to extract confessions and employ other forms of brutality, including hold-
 ing prisoners incommunicado without charges and under inhuman conditions. Local
 human rights organizations and former detainees said some prisoners are bound
 and hung by their feet before being beaten. There were no reported judicial proceed-
 ings against officers suspected of committing abuses.
 Unidentified uniformed personnel acting as vigilantes used torture, beatings, un-
 sanitary conditions, and restrictions of food in secret prisons to obtain confessions
 from those suspected of involvement in the mutiny and any cases considered as "na-
 tional security" (see Section 1.d.).
 There were reports of sexual assaults by soldiers on refugees, and some soldiers
 demanded sex in exchange for entry into the country (see Section 2.d. and Section
 5).
 Prison conditions are inhuman and life threatening. Family members and friends
 are responsible for feeding prisoners. Guards often demanded bribes in exchange for
 letting food through to those incarcerated. Standards of sanitation remained poor,
 and there were several dozen deaths due to malnutrition and disease. A former in-
 mate held in the central prison in Conakry reported being housed with between 60
 to 80 prisoners in I cell, with 1 toilet and no beds. Prisoners reported threats, beat-
 ings, and harassment by guards. There are credible reports from prisoners that fe-
 male inmates are subject to harassment and sexual assault by guards.
 The OGDH determined that prisoners in at least one major prison, located in
 N'Zerekore, suffered more from neglect and lack of resources than from mistreat-
 ment. According to the OGDH, the N'Zerekore prison is a converted grain ware-
 house built in 1932 for 70 prisoners, but currently houses 120. There is no elec-
 tricity or running water.
 The independent press, a local human rights organization, and a former prisoner
 reported that inmates are routinely beaten and subjected to other forms of abuse
 at the prison in Koundara in northern Guinea.
 A member of a political opposition party, a soldier, a local human rights organiza-
 tion, and former prisoners reported that the Government houses political prisoners
 considered a threat to state security at Kassa prison, allegedly located in a former
 French colonial structure on an island off the coast of Conakry. The Government
 denies the existence of the Kassa prison and states that prisoners identified as polit-
 ical detainees have been incarcerated for criminal acts and are located in other pris-
 ons.
 Although the Minister of Justice denounced inhuman prison conditions during
 televised visits to prison facilities in 1996, no concrete action was taken to improve
 conditions. The Government, however, does permit visits by local humanitarian and
 religious organizations, which offer medical care and food for those in severe need.
 A former prisoner reported that without this assistance, those who do not have fam-
 ilies or friends would starve to death.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Arbitrary arrest remains a persistent
 threat despite procedural provisions in the Penal Code designed to safeguard detain-
 
 
 ees. In practice administrative controls over the police are ineffective, and security
 forces rarely follow the Penal Code.
 The Penal Code requires that the Government issue a warrant before an arrest
 can be made and charge detainees before a magistrate within 72 hours. However,
 many detainees are incarcerated for longer periods of time before being charged.
 After being charged, the accused may be held until the final outcome of the case,
 including a period of appeal. Release on bail is at the discretion of the magistrate
 who has jurisdiction. The Constitution proscribes incommunicado detention. The law
 provides for access by attorneys to their clients, but authorities frequently do not
 respect this provision.
 The Government detained about 30 to 40 alleged mutiny ringleaders following the
 February 1996 uprising, which involved some 2,000 soldiers who had protested low
 salaries and benefits. The mutiny evolved into an attempted coup d'etat that nearly
 toppled the Government, during which an estimated 30 to 50 people in Conakry,
 mostly civilians, were killed.
 Bar Association attorneys, the independent press, and government sources de-
 scribe a parallel system of justice run by unidentified uniformed personnel who con-
 duct midnight arrests, detain suspects, and use torture in secret prisons to obtain
 confessions before transferring detainees to prosecutors. Unidentified security forces
 had rounded up hundreds of soldiers and civilians suspected of involvement in the
 mutiny. The Government subsequently charged a total of 43 soldiers with murder,
 looting, armed robbery, and abandonment of post in connection with the mutiny and
 detained the rest without charges. A government prosecutor released 63 detained
 soldiers for lack of evidence in August 1996 and security forces allegedly released
 60 more detainees in March and April. Judicial authorities denied any responsibility
 for the arrests, yet took custody of dozens of detainees transferred by security forces.
 The Government continues to detain two members of the Rally of the Guinean
 People following trial for killing a policeman during a demonstration in 1995 that
 became violent.
 The Government does not practice forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TDial.-The Constitution provides for the judiciary's inde-
 pendence; however, judicial authorities routinely defer to executive authorities and
 the executive branch in politically sensitive cases. Magistrates are civil servants
 with no assurance of tenure. Due to corruption and nepotism in the judiciary, rel-
 atives of influential members of the Government are above the law. In 1996 the
 Cabinet stated that it would pursue those who violate the law but avoid punishment
 due to judicial corruption, including autonomous Red Berets; however, no action was
 taken. Judges often do not act independently and their verdicts are subject to out-
 side interference. Influential persons often intervene on behalf of their relatives to
 prevent a negative judgment from being carried out.
 The Judiciary includes courts of first instance, two Courts of Appeal, and the Su-
 preme Court, the court of final appeal. Since 1988 civilian courts have rendered all
 judgments involving civilians under the Penal Code. A military tribunal prepares
 and adjudicates charges against accused military personnel, to whom the Penal
 Code does not ap ly.The armed services, however, made no use of a military tribu-
 nal following the February 1996 mutiny and transferred dozens of detained soldiers
 to the judiciary (see Section 1.d.). The Government announced in September 1996
 the creation of a Discipline Council for dealing with civil servants who abuse their
 positions as government employees, but at year's end, the Council had not pros-
 ecuted any cases.
 In June Minister of Justice Maurice Zogbelemou Togba activated a Special State
 Security Court to try the 30 to 40 alleged mutiny ringleaders who remained in cus-
 tody following the attempted uprising in February 1996. Togba has defended the
 Special Courts legality, citing statutes predating the 1992 Constitution. Members
 of political opposition parties and the independent press maintain that the Court
 is unconstitutional, arguing that the Fundamental Law of 1992 superseded related
 statutes. They also maintain that because the State presents evidence as well as
 makes final judgment, the Court infringes on the prisoners' due process rights be-
 cause the judiciary is beholden to the executive and lacks real independence.
 The judicial system is plagued by numerous problems, including a shortage of
 qualified lawyers and magistrates and an outdated and restrictive penal code. The
 enal Code provides for the presumption of innocence of accused persons, the inde-
 pendence of judges, the equality of citizens before the law, the right of the accused
 to counsel, and the right to appeal a judicial decision. Although in principle the Gov-
 ernment is responsible for funding legal defense costs in serious criminal cases, in
 practice it rarely disburses these funds. The attorney for the defense frequently re-
 ceives no payment. The Government provided counsel for dozens of soldiers charged
 
 
 in connection with the February 1996 mutiny and the quasi-independent Bar Asso-
 ciation started a permanent legal defense fund.
 Defense lawyers for the soldiers incarcerated in connection with the 1996 mutiny
 complained that they had difficulty obtaining permission to meet with their clients,
 particularly after President Conte activated the Security Court in June. They also
 reported that prison guards eavesdropped on their conversations, denied family vis-
 its to the detainees, and that the Government reduced their clients' salaries by as
 much as 60 percent to pay for prison meals.
 Many citizens are wary of judicial corruption and prefer instead to rely on tradi-
 tional rules of justice at the village or urban neighborhood level. Litigants present
 their civil cases before a village chief, a neighborhood leader, or a council of wise
 men. The dividing line between the formal and informal justice systems is vague,
 and authorities may refer a case from the formal to the traditional system to ensure
 compliance by all parties. Similarly, if a case cannot be resolved to the satisfaction
 of all parties in the traditional system, it may be referred to the formal system for
 adjudication. The traditional system discriminates against women in that evidence
 given by women carries less weight (see Section 5).
 Many victims of crime fear that they may never achieve justice because of judicial
 corruption and may resort to exacting their own form of retribution through vigi-
 lante violence. Some suspected criminals, notably thieves and rapists, are beaten to
 death or burned after being soaked with a flammable liquid by their victims or by
 others, even though there may be insufficient evidence that a crime has actually
 taken place. OGDH reported a Conakry driver, falsely accused of theft, was beaten
 to death in 1996 by an angry mob after his car broke down. Police authorities rarely
 intervene to rescue victims of vigilante justice.
 The Government holds less than a dozen political prisoners. Such prisoners are
 individuals incarcerated for allegedly politically motivated acts, such as protests,
 meetings and campaigns; but arrested and convicted under criminal laws such as
 those applying to creating disorder, inciting violence, and corruption. Some of these
 individuals consequently received disproportionately harsh punishment due to their
 political affiliation.
 The Government denies holding any political prisoners. Members of political oppo-
 sition parties and a local human rights organization dispute this claim, saying that
 dozens of political prisoners are being detained or have disappeared.
 In June four leaders ofthe main opposition party, the Rally of the Guinean People
 (RPG), received 2-year prison sentences. The four opponents were arrested for al-
 leged criminal acts in November 1996 and charged with voluntarily causing injury
 to others following a rally to welcome their leader, Alpha Conde, back to Guinea.
 During an impromptu parade en route to Conde's residence, RPG supporters clashed
 with students, several of whom were injured. The students responded by attacking
 the nearby RPG headquarters and were joined by local residents who together
 looted and burned what remained of the offices.
 In September 1996, a circuit court settled the cases of 35 RPG detainees held in
 N'zerekore in a military camp without charges since August 1995. The authorities
 originally imprisoned the RPG activists after violence broke out during a general
 strike. One policeman was killed in the clashes. In September 1996, the court re-
 leased 33 of the activists, sentenced one person to 5 years in jail and another person
 to 3 years in jail with a fine of $1,000.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home, and judicial search warrants
 are required by law. However, police frequently ignore these procedures. Police and
 paramilitary police often ignore legal procedures in the pursuit of criminals. Private
 citizens are frequently detained at nighttime roadblocks set up by police and the
 military for purposes of security and extortion (see Section 2.d.).
 It is widely believed that security officials monitor mail and telephone calls.
 Local businesses, especially expatriate companies, often complain of intimidation
 and harassment by public officials and authorities.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of expres-
 sion, subject to certain limitations; however, despite government statements in sup-
 port of free speech and a free press, the Government employs a broad range of re-
 strictions that vitiate any real protection. The Governmentprohibits what it consid-
 ers seditious talk or chants in public, has established defamation and slander as
 criminal offenses, and prohibits communications that personally insult the Presi-
 dent, or incite violence, discrimination, or hatred, or that disturb the public peace.
 The Government publishes the official newspaper, Horoy, and operates the offi-
 cial television and radio (ORTG) stations. Reporters for the official press, who are
 
 
 148
 government employees, practice self-censorship in order to protect their jobs. Several
 younger broadcast journalists reported critically about the Government and posed
 critical questions at official press conferences.
 There is a vocal independent press that is critical of the President and the Gov-
 ernment. For example, the weekl satirical newspaper Le Lynx publishes front page
 cartoons lampooning the Head of State and senior government officials. The govern-
 ment-controlled daily (Horoya) and five weekly newspapers (Le Lynx, La Lance,
 L'Oeil, L'Independant, and L'Independant Plus) publish regularly in Conakry, and
 up to 10 other publications publish sporadically, although hampered by technical
 and financial difficulties. One newspaper, L'Espoir, is affiliated with the governing
 political party (PUP), and several other newspapers are affiliated with opposition
 parties. Other papers offer news and criticism of both the Government and the oppo-
 sition.
 The Government maintains control of the electronic media, and national radio
 serves as the most important means of reaching the public. The Government author-
 ized in 1996 the temporary FM transmission of Africa Number One, a private Gabo-
 nese radio station and promised a permanent license, but the license was not issued
 and the station is no longer broadcasting. Many citizens listen regularly to foreign-
 origin short-wave radio, and some have access to foreign television satellite broad-
 casts.
 The Government occasionally detains journalists. Police arrested editor-in-chief,
 Louis Celestin, and publisher, Ousmane Camara, of the independent weekly news-
 paper L'Oeil on Augut 1 after the Minister of Justice filed a complaint accusing
 the two men of libel and publishing false information. The newspaper had printed
 an article criticizing Justice Minister Togba and his attempts to stifle the country's
 independent press. The journalists were released on August 11 with no formal
 charges filed.They were detained again on August 25, after the paper printed a fol-
 low-up story again criticizing the Justice Minister, but subsequently released.
 Ismael Bangoura, publishing manager of L'Oeil, was sentenced in January to a
 month in jail, and was fined after conviction a token sum of 1 Guinean franc for
 "publishing false information and for illegal publication." The Justice and Security
 Ministers leveled the charges against Bangoura after the paper published an article
 criticizing a government meeting.
 On April 25, President Conte fired Minister of Information and Culture Michel
 Kamano. Kamano, a senior ranking cabinet minister, was a vocal proponent of es-
 tablishing independent radio.
 Political tracts occasionally circulate in Conakry and other urban areas. Some
 tracts support the Government, while others specifically criticize senior officials.
 Foreign publications, some of which criticize the Government, are often available.
 The Ministry of National Education and Scientific Research exercises limited con-
 trol over academic freedom through its influence on faculty hiring and control over
 the curriculum. In general, teachers are not subject to classroom censorship.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law restricts freedom of
 assembly, and the Government exercises its power to thwart unwanted political ac-
 tivity. The Penal Code bans any meeting that has an ethnic or racial character or
 any gathering "whose nature threatens national unity." The Government requires
 notification 72 hours prior to public gatherings, otherwise the events are considered
 illegal.
 The Government bans all street marches except for funerals. Pursuant to this
 statute, local authorities may cancel a demonstration or meeting if they believe that
 it poses a threat to public order. They may hold event organizers criminally liable
 if violence or destruction of property ensues.
 Union organizers of a nationwide teacher strike in April reported being harassed
 by youths they believed had been recruited by local government officials (see Section
 6.b.).
 Freedom of association is protected by law, but there are cumbersome require-
 ments to obtain government recognition. Political parties must provide information
 on their founding members and produce internal statutes and political platforms
 consistent with the Constitution before the Government recognizes them. There are
 approximately 46 legally recognized political parties; deputies of 9 different parties
 are represented in the National Assembly.
 There were credible reports of harassment and oppression of the Rally of the
 Guinean People (RPG) party (See Section i.e.).
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion and
 permits religious communities to govern themselves without state interference. The
 Government generally respects these rights in practice. The quasi-governmental Na-
 tional Islamic League represents Guinea's Muslims, who make up 85 percent of the
 population. The League states that it supports peaceful coexistence with other reli-
 
 
 gious denominations, and actively attempts to facilitate dialogue to eliminate ethnic
 and religious tensions. Although the Government and the National Islamic League
 have soken out aginst the proliferation of Shi'ite fundamentalist sects, which they
 allege d were "generating confusion and deviation within Guinean Islam, they have
 not restricted these groups. Foreign missionaries and church-affiliated relief agen-
 cies operate freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-~
 patriation.-The Constitution provides citizens with the right to travel freely within
 the country and to change their place of residence and work. The Government re-
 quires all citizens to carry a national identification card, which they must present
 on demand at security checkpoints. Travelers face harassment by police and at mili-
 tary roadblocks, particularly late at night. The independent press and local NGO's
 reported that travelers are often pressured into paying bribes to allow free passage.
 On April 22, President Conte announced the shutdown of the infamous "Kilometer
 36," a manned check point on the only rad leading from Conakry to the interior of
 the country. The checkpoint bad been the scene of rampant corruption and harass-
 ment. The Government reduced security force presence at the checkpoint, however,
 it later reestablished the checkpoint at full strength and established new ones as
 well throughout the country following the May 25 coup in neighboring Sierra Leone.
 Government officials state the corruption is being perpetrated by a few rogue sol-
 diers. Abuse, however, at official checkpoints is systematic.
 The Government permits foreign travel for its citizens, although it retains the au-
 thority to limit it for political reasons. The Government officially closed its land bor-
 ders with Sierra Leone and Liberia for security reasons related to a May 25 coup
 in Sierra Leone and for the July elections in Liberia and the border with Sierra
 Leone remains closed. Commerce authorities restricted overland trade in August
 1996 of some products in an effort to improve tax collection and these restrictions
 continue.
 In June President Conte, concerned about internal security, barred Sierra
 Leoneans from entering Guinea without proof of onward travel plans. Officials from
 the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said
 that refugees continued to move relatively freely into Guinea, however, due to po-
 rous borders.
 The Government permitted Liberians to return to their country to vote in national
 elections in July. However, these persons were not officially permitted to reenter
 Guinea as asylum seekers.
 The Government cooperates fully with the UNHCR, the World Food Program,
 other humanitarian organizations, and donor countries to assist refugees. The Gov-
 ernment provides first asylum in accordance with United Nations and Organization
 of African Unity conventions. According to a 1997 census report, the Government
 provided asylum to more than 400,000 refugees, primarily from Liberia and Sierra
 Leone. Refugees account for half or more of the populations of the Forest region
 cities of N'zerekore, Gueckedou, and Macenta. According to -the UNHCR, approxi-
 mately 40,000 additional refugees entered the Forecariah region following the May
 25 coup in Sierra Leone. Many of the approximately 30,000 Sierra Leonean refugees
 already in Forecariah and an additional 170,000 Sierra Leonean refugees living in
 the Forest region were scheduled for repatriation, but the May coup forestalled this
 effort.
 There were some reports of forced repatriation. An international NGO reported
 that refugees were loaded onto military trucks to be returned to Sierra Leone follow-
 ing the coup. The UNHCR reported that about 20 Sierra Leoneans fleeing coup vio-
 lence were detained at the border but eventually released to UNHCR workers. The
 UNHCR also received unconfirmed reports that boatloads of Sierra Leonean refu-
 gees were turned away by the Government at the port of Conakry.
 The Government has provided school buildings, access to local medical facilities,
 and land for farming to assist those designated as refugees. However, relief organi-
 zations report that some local authorities have demanded portions of donated fuel
 and food from delivery convoys.
 While the Government has generally been hospitable toward refugees, several
 NGO's reported that local police and border patrol guards often demanded bribes
 before allowing refugees into the country. Some border officers demanded sex in lieu
 of money from women who had insufficient funds to pay bribes.
 International NGO's said that refugees are subject to arbitrary arrests, but the
 harassment is not specifically targeted at refugees. The UNHCR reports that detain-
 ees, often held for having insufficient identification or being suspected rebels, are
 charged before a magistrate within 72 hours as required by law. A UNHCR official
 said that a refugee prisoner died in custody in Lela in 1996, but at year's end there
 had been no reported government action or investigation. Unknown members of the
 
 
 150
 security forces killed one refugee and wounded another in June (see Section L.a.).
 A World Food Program official reported that refugees are not receiving their com-
 plete meal rations donated by the organization.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Although the 1990 Constitution provides for a popularly elected president and a
 multiparty parliament, the ability of citizens to exercise effectively this provision is
 restricted. The Government's tight control of the electoral process and lack of an
 independent electoral oversight mechanism call into serious doubt the ability of citi-
 zens to change the Government.
 President Conte took office in 1994 after multiparty elections in December 1993
 in which the Government dominated the electoral process. In 1995 the President's
 party, PUP, won 62 percent of the legislative seats (one seat short of the majority
 required to make constitutional amendments) and 56 percent of the municipal va-
 cancies. The International Commission of Jurists reported seeing no seals on the
 legislative ballots, results envelopes left open, and various means of intimidation
 used at some polling places. The African-Aimerican Institute said that the National
 Electoral Commission-the supposed "moral guarantor of electoral fairness'--had
 only a marginal role.
 Opposition leaders deemed the entire process an "electoral masquerade" and "a
 comedy," and openly questioned the credibility and legitimacy of PUP's municipal
 and legislative landslide victories. Shortly after results were announced, nine oppo-
 sition parties joined forces to form an umbrella organization, CODEM, dedicated 'to
 act, organize, and combat together to make Guinea a land of liberty." These parties'
 deputies took their seats in the National Assembly and played an active role in
 budgetary and general sessions. Government radio and television provided live cov-
 erage of same legislative sessions in 1996, but not in 1997.
 President Conte consolidated control of several key government operations in
 March. He issued a presidential decree that gave him new, direct control over the
 central bank, major public works, and the State Inspector Goneral, enabling the
 President to bypass his ministers. The decree also curtailed the authority of Prime
 Minister Toure, whose portfolio had further been stripped of economic matters.
 On June 17, President Conte decreed personnel changes in the administration of
 the country's interior. The 38 new secretaries general (deputies to governors and
 prefects) are all members of the PUP with strong ties to the President, thereby
 threatening the autonomy of elected mayors as secretaries general control city budg-
 ets. The President already appoints the governors and prefects to administer regions
 and subregions respectively, and they supervise the secretaries general who are em-
 ployees of the Minister of the Interior. Opposition party officials and the independ-
 ent press have charged that this action signals that the Government is using public
 funds to build its electoral base within traditional opposition strongholds in antici-
 pation of the 1998 presidential elections. Conte was also criticized by members of
 his own party for quashing the democratic process within the PUP during leader-
 ship elections at a party congress this year.
 During the April-May session of the National Assembly, a majority of deputies
 once again rejected the Minister of Territorial Administration's efforts to appoint,
 rather than elect, neighborhood councils, as he attempted in 1996. No neighborhood
 council elections have been scheduled.
 Women are underrepresented in the Government. The President appointed a Cab-
 inet in July 1996 and reduced the number of women who hold positions in the 23-
 member Cabinet from 4 to 2. Women head the low profile ministries of Social Affairs
 and Youth, Sports, and Civic Education. There are only 9 female deputies in the
 114-member National Assembly. There are few women at senior levels below min-
 ister and no women among senior military ranks. Women also play a minor role in
 the leadership of the major political parties.
 The Cabinet and armed forces leadership include representatives of all major eth-
 nic groups. However, a disproportionate number of senior military officers are
 Soussou, the President's ethnic group.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local NGO's primarily interested in human rights issues include: the Guinean Or-
 ganization for the Defense of Human Rights; the Guinean Human Rights Associa-
 tion; the Children of the Victims of Camp Boiro; S.O.S. Burial Grounds; the Associa-
 tion of Victims of Repression; Humanitarian Assistance for Prisons; Defense of Pris-
 oners' Rights; Women Jurists for Human Rights; the Committee for the Defense of
 Civic Rights; and the Coordinating Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting
 
 
 Women's and Children's Health. Government officials are generally cooperative and
 responsive to their views; however, various officials have blocked private efforts to
 memorialize victims of the Sekou Toure regime.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that all persons are equal before the law regardless of
 gender, race, ethnicity, language, beliefs, political opinions, philosophy, or creed, but
 the Government does not uniformly enforce these provisions.
 Women.-Violence against women is common, although estimates differ as to the
 extent of the problem. Wife beating is a criminal offense and constitutes grounds
 for divorce under civil law; however, police rarely intervene in domestic disputes.
 Although the Government has made regular statements in the media against sex-
 ual harassment, women working in the formal sector in urban areas complain of fre-
 quent sexual harassment. There are credible reports from prisoners that female in-
 mates are subject to harassment and sexual assault by guards. The social stigma
 attached to rape prevents most victims from reporting it. The Government has not
 vigorously pursued criminal investigations of alleged sexual crimes.
 Refugees from Liberia and Sierra Leone report that some soldiers demand sex in
 exchange for entry into Guinea. There are also reports of sexual assaults on refu-
 gees. In February UJNHCR reported that a refugee was raped by two men in mili-
 tary garb. No arrests were made. The UNHCR r       d that a refugee was raped
 by two members of the military in N'zerekore in November 1996. Military officials
 told the UNHCR that one soldier was arrested but he later escaped. Two male refu-
 gees raped a female refugee in Yomou in June. Security officials detained the men
 and placed them under the supervision of refugee camp officials. At year's end, pros-
 ecution was reportedly proceeding, but they had not come to trial.
 The Constitution provides for equal treatment of men and women, and the Min-
 istry of Social Affairs and Women's Protection works to ensure such equality.
 Women face discrimination, however, particularly in rural areas, where opportuni-
 ties for women are limited by custom and the demands of child-rearing and subsist-
 ence farming. Women are not denied access to land, credit, or businesses, but inher-
 itance laws also favor male heirs over females. Government officials acknowledge
 that polygamy is commonly practiced, although it is prohibited by law. Divorce laws
 generally tend to favor men in awarding custody and dividing communal assets.
 Legal evidence given by women carries less weight than that given by men (see Sec-
 tion 1.c.). The Government has affirmed the principle of equal pay for equal work,
 but in practice, women receive less pay than men in most equally demanding jobs.
 Children.-The Constitution provides that the Government has a particular obli-
 gation to protect and nurture the nation's youth, and the Government allocates a
 siguilicant percentage of the budget to primary education. The President appoints
 a cabinet minister to defend women's and children's rights and a Minister of Youth.
 Total enrollment in primary education is just over 580,000, 34 percent of whom
 are girls. Approximately 35 percent of all eligible students are enrolled in primary
 schools, but the ratio is much smaller for secondary schools. The proportion of girls
 enrolled in secondary schools is much lower than the percentage in primary schools.
 The Government spent 5 percent of its gross domestic product on education in 1996.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is nearly uni-
 versal. It is practiced in all regions andamong allreligious and ethnic groups. FGM
 is performed on girls and women between the ages of 4 and 70. FGM is illegal under
 the Penal Code and senior officials have spoken against the practice, but there have
 been no prosecutions for violations of the Code. Exact figres on this procedure are
 difficult to establish due to its private nature. Expert estimates vary between 65
 and 90 percent. The lower figure, if accurate, would represent a decline over the
 past decade due to education of the population by woman's rights groups about the
 ealth risks involved with the practice. However, infibulation, the most dangerous
 form of FGM, is still performed in the Forest region. Despite diseases resulting from
 crude and unsanitary surgical instruments and deaths resulting from the practice,
 the tradition continues, seriously affecting women's lives. FGM also increases the
 risk of HIV infection since unsterilized instruments are shared among participants.
 The Government has made efforts to educate health workers on the dangers of
 this procedure and sup rts the efforts of the Committee on Traditional Practices
 Affecting Women and Children (CPTAFE), a local NGO dedicated to eradicating
 FGM and ritual scarring. The CPTAFE reports high rates of infant mortality an
 maternal mortality due to FGM.
 In March, working in collaboration with the World Health Organization's regional
 efforts, the Government initiated a 20-year strategy to eradicate FGM.
 
 
 A growing number of men and women oppose the practice. Urban, educated fami-
 lies are opting increasingly to perform only a slight symbolic incision on a girl's
 genitals rather than the complete procedure. Those who perform FGM oppose its
 eradication since it is quite lucrative for them.
 The CPTAFE, in conjunction with the Government, local journalists, and inter-
 national NGO's, is promoting an education campaign to discourage underage mar-
 riage. Although such marriages are prohibited by law, parents contract marriages
 for girls as young as age 11 in the Forest region.
 Prostitution exists in the informal economic sector and employs girls as young as
 age 14. The Government does not take action even if prostitution of minors is
 brought to its attention and does not actively monitor child or adult prostitution.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution provides that all persons are equal be-
 fore the law. There are no special constitutional provisions for the disabled. The
 Government has not mandated accessibility for the disabled, and few disabled peo-
 ple work, although some develop opportunities in the informal sector.
 National/RaciallEthnic Minoritis.-While the Constitution and the Penal Code
 prohibit racial or ethnic discrimination, ethnic identification is strong. Mutual sus-
 picion affects relations across ethnic lines, in and out of government. Senior govern-
 ment levels and the highest military ranks below the President include representa-
 tives of all three major ethnic groups.
 President Conte, however, reserved the majority of recent senior promotions in
 the armed forces for Soussous, his own ethnic group. Opposition leaders contend
 that Soussous are overly represented in high-level cabinet positions.
 In March ethnic tensions sparked violence in Koule, a small town in the Forest
 region. Members of the Malinke and Gorze ethnic gups clashed following an al-
 leged rape of a Gerze woman by a Malinke man. Military personnel reported that
 at least three Gerze were killed in the violence. Several hundred villagers from beth
 ethnic groups were seen fleeing the area by an NGO delegation, observed the town
 center empty of residents, numerous dwellings burned and sacked, and dozens of
 armed soldiers patrolling the streets.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of employees
 to form independent labor unions and prohibits discrimination based on union affili-
 ation. Only an estimated 5 percent of the work force is unionized. Most union mem-
 bers are employees of the Government, national utilities (electric, water, and tele-
 phone companies), or foreign-controlled companies.
 The Labor Code states that all workers, except military and paramilitary person-
 nel, have the right to create and participate in organizations that defend and de-
 velop their individual and collective rights as workers. It requires elected worker
 representatives for any enterprise employing 25 or more salaried workers.
 The National Confederation of Guinean Workers (CNTG) was the sole trade union
 before the Labor Code was enacted. Although there are now other trade unions and
 labor confederations, the CNTG remains the largest confederation.
 The CNTG is indirectly funded by the State, although dissident members seek to
 increase the Confederation's freedom from government control. Independent unions
 and confederations have gained popularity, such as the Free Union of Teachers and
 Researchers of Guinea and the National Organization for Free Trade Unions of
 Guinea. Several disgruntled groups within the CNTG left the Confederation in 1996
 citing corruption of among leadership. These groups joined with some independent
 unions to form the United Syndicates of Guinean Workers.
 The Labor Code grants salaried workers, including public sector civilian employ-
 ees, the right to strike 10 days after their representative union makes known its
 intention to strike. It prohibits strikes in sectors providing "essential services" (hos-
 pitals, radio and television, army, and police).
 A nationwide public-school teachers strike immobilized the education sector for
 2 weeks beginning on April 14. Union leaders ended the strike after President Conte
 promised to reinstate an 8 percent pay raise for all state employees.
 Members of the independent union, Free Union of Educators and Researchers of
 Guinea (SLECG), and the government affiliated union, Professional Union Federa-
 tion for Education (FSPE), went on strike to restore a previously ageed wage in-
 crease as well as cost of living adjustments. Union leaders reported harassment by
 the Government and its supporters, including the arrest of eight teachers, mob at-
 tacks on teachers' homes, cutting of phone lines, burning of tires in front of union
 headquarters by youths armed with rocks and clubs, threatening phone calls, and
 refusal by police to intervene. In August the teachers received an 8 percent salary
 increase (the same increase was also given to all other civil servants). Teachers also
 received the right to claim seniority benefits for any past training or internships.
 
 
 Unions may freely affiliate with international labor groups. The Government con-
 tinues to designate the CNTG to represent workers in the International Labor Orga-
 nization conference.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Under the Labor Code, rep-
 resentative workers' unions or union groups may organize in the workplace and ne-
 gotiate with employers or employer organizations. The law protects the right to bar-
 gain collectively concerning wages and salaries without government interference.
 ork rules andwork hours established by the employer are developed in consulta-
 tion with union delegates. The Code also prohibits antiunion discrimination. Union
 delegates represent individual and collective claims and grievances with manage-
 ment. Individual workers threatened with dismissal or other sanctions have the
 right to a hearing before management with a union representative present and, if
 necessary, to take the complaint to the Conakry Labor Court, which convenes week-
 ly to hear such cases. In the interior, civil courts hear labor cases.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code specifically for-
 bids forced or compulsory labor, and there is no evidence of its practice. The Labor
 Code specifically forbids forced and bonded labor by children and the Government
 enforces this prohibition effectively.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-According
 to the Labor Code, the minimum age for employment is 16 years. Apprentices, how-
 ever, may start at 14 years of age. Workers and apprentices under the age of 18
 are not permitted to work at night, nor for more than 12 consecutive hours, nor on
 Sundays. The Labor Code also stipulates that the Minister of Labor and Social Af-
 fairs must maintain a list of occupations in which women and youth under the age
 of 18 cannot be employed. In practice enforcement by Ministry inspectors is limited
 to large firms in the modern sector of the economy. A 1997 study by the Ministry
 of Planning states that approximately 66 percent of children between the ages of
 7 and 14 were employed in the rural sector, the rate jumped to 91 percent in the
 15 to 19 age group. In urban areas, approximately 19 percent of children between
 the ages of 7 and 14 are employed. The rate jumps to 50 percent for children be-
 tween the ages of 15 and 19. Child labor in factories is not a prevalent problem be-
 cause of the low level of manufacturing.
 The Government prohibits forced and bonded child labor and enforces this prohi-
 bition effectively (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code provides for the establishment
 by decree of a minimum hourly wage, but the Government has not done so. There
 are also provisions in the Code for overtime and night wages, which are fixed per-
 centages of the regular wage. According to the Labor Code, regular work is not to
 exceed 10-hour days or 48-hour weeks, and there is to be a period of at least 24
 consecutive hours of rest each week, usually Sunday. Every salaried worker has the
 legal right to an annual paid vacation, accumulated at the rate of at least 21/2 work-
 days per month of work. In practice the authorities enforce these rules only in the
 relatively small modern urban sector.
 The Labor Code contains provisions of a general nature regarding occupational
 safety and health, but the Government has not elaborated a set of practical work-
 place health and safety standards. Moreover, it has not issued any of the ministerial
 orders laying out the specific requirements for certain occupations and for certain
 methods of work that are called for in the Labor Code. The Ministry of Labor and
 Social Affairs is responsible for enforcing labor standards, and its inspectors are em-
 powered to suspend work immediately in situations hazardous to health. However,
 enforcement remained more a goal than a reality. Labor inspectors acknowledge
 that they cannot even cover Conakry, much less the entire country, with their small
 staff and meager budget.
 Under the Labor Code, workers have the right to refuse to work under unsafe con-
 ditions without penalty. Nevertheless, many workers fear retaliation should they
 refuse to work under unsafe conditions. Employees in high-risk professions, such as
 night guards, drivers, and police, have protested conditions.
