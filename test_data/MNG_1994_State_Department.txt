 MONGOLIA
 During 1994 Mongolia showed steady-if sometimes uneven-progress in its tran-
 sition from a highly centralized Communist-led state toward a full-fledged
 multiparty democracy. The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP), the lin-
 eal descendent of the former ruling Communist a     , dominates the unicameral
 legislature. In 1992 parliamentary elections, the MPRP garnered 71 of the 76 seats
 in the State Great Hural (SGH), even though opposition parties received over 40
 percent of the popular vote. Owing to this imalance, a lingering sense of disenfran-
 chisement continues amng the political opposition. The Prime Minister is nomi-
 nated by the President and approved by the SGH. The President and Prime Min-
 ister together nominate cabinet officers, who must also receive SGH approval.
 Security forces remain under civilian control. The Mongolian military continued
 its downsizing in 1994. The newly named and reorganized Mongolian Central Intel-
 ligence Agency (MCIA) is responsible for internal security. Its head has ministerial
 status and reports directly to the Prime Minister. There were no reports of human
 rigphts abuses by the MCIA during the year.
 The economy continued to progress steadily, if unevenly. Despite increasing indus-
 trialization and urbanization, a large portion of the population is still engaged in
 agriculture, with an emphasis on livestock raising and related light industry. After
 decades of nearly total dependency on the former Soviet Union, Mongolia is increas-
 ing its trade with other countries and making the difficult transition to a market
 economy. The new Constitution lays the groundwork for this transition by establish-
 ing the right to private property and to conduct private commercial activity. A short-
 age of capital and a slowdown in economic growth constrained reform efforts.
 The human rihts record remains generally good. Human rights problems in-
 cluded the lack o laws to codify human rights provisions contained in the Constitu-
 tion, occasional violence against prisoners and detainees by security forces, lack of
 access to defense attorneys for pretrial detainees, monitoring of telephone lines by
 security forces, some limitations on access to government-owned media, and violence
 against women. A short, bitter strike at a major joint venture textile company em-
 ph asized the still problematic status of labor law in this rapidly changing country,
 the necessity for clarifying workers' rights, and the need for new industrial safety
 legislation.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated abductions or
 disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution forbids these abuses. However, there were credible reports that po-
 lice and prison officials sometimes beat and otherwise physically abuse prisoners
 and detainees. Mongolian detention facilities are Spartan, and conditions in them-
 including insufficient food and heating-may on occasion pose a threat to the health
 of detainees.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides that no person
 shall be searched, arrested, detained, or deprived of liberty except by law, but these
 
 
 652
 protections have not been codified. Under the Legal Code, police may arrest those
 caught committing a crime and hold them for up to 72 hours without a warrant.
 A warrant must be issued by a prosecutor for incarceration of longer duration, or
 when the actual crime was not witnessed. A detainee has no statutory right under
 the current Code to see an attorney, and defense attorneys are routinely denied ac-
 cess to their clients before trial.
 e. Denial of Fair Pub/ic Tria!.-The courts system consists of local ("people's")
 courts, provincial courts, a Constitutional Court, and the Supreme Court. The courts
 are independent, and there is no evidence that they discriminate against any group
 or that decisions are made for political reasons.
 The Supreme Court is at the apex of the judicial system; its members, appointed
 for 4-year terms, hear appeals from lower courts. The local courts hear mostly rou-
 tine criminal and civil cases; provincial courts hear the more serious cases, includ-
 biag those of murder, rape and grand larceny, and also serve as the appeals court
 for local court decisions. he President nominates, and the SGH approves, justices
 to the Supreme Court for 4-year terms. Lower court judges are chosen by the Chief
 Justice of the Supreme Court, based on the recommendation of the members of the
 Supreme Court, ir 4-year terms also.
 All accused porsns are guaranteed due process, legal defense, and a public trial,
 although closed proceedings are permitted in cases involving crimes against the
 State, rape cases involving minors, and particularly brutal murders.
 The Constitutional Court has sole jurisdiction in matters involving constitutional
 issues and in corruption and other criminal charges levied against high government
 officials. In late summer, after a lengthy investigation the court charged well-known
 opposition Member of Parliament Ebegdoj with having revealed state secrets in a
 public speech. Elbegdorj was acquittedof all charges in a 1-day closed trial. Both
 he and some of his supporters contend that the charges and subsequent trial con-
 stituted harassment for his political views.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides that the State shall not interfere with the private beliefs and
 actions of citizens, and this is generally respected. The head of the MCIA may, with
 the knowledge and consent of the Prime Minister, direct the monitoring and record-
 ing of telephone conversations. The extent of such monitoring is unknown.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-oThe Constitution provides for the rights of free-
 dom of speech and expression, and the Government generally respects them.
 A growing range of newspapers and other publications represent major political
 party viewpoints as well as independent views. Although in the past the Govern-
 ment controlled access to news print, all newspapers now buy newsprint directly
 from private suppliers, and neither party-afiefliated nor independent media report
 difficulty securing an adequate supply. The Government now plays no role in the
 allocation of newsprint. Due to transportation difficulties, uneven postal service, and
 the fluctuations in the amount of newsprint available, however, in outlying regions
 access to publications is somewhat restricted.
 In April, after several months of charges and counterharges of corruption by bth
 pposition and prgovernment forces, the Monglan Democratic Union (MDU)
 A    for a hunger strike in Ulaanbaatar's central square. Reminiscent of a similar
 MDU action that had helped spark the predemocracy movement in 1990, the 2-week
 action drew the support of several opposition political parties and others concerned
 about basic social and economic issues. President Ochirbat helped mediate an end
 to the strike with a promise to introduce new legislation codiesing the constitutional
 right of free expression. The strike and a counteratrike by government supporters,
 ended when the three parties represented in Parliament agreed to discuss new legis-
 lation dealing with press freedom and the rights of assembly. As the year ende
 such legislation was still in the drafting stage.
 There is a single, government-iranced television station with countrywide recep-
 tion, as well as several radio stations. The latter are particularly important as the
 major sources of current news in the countryside. Government-financed television
 and radio tations report beth opposition and government views. In response to a
 1993 threat by opposition politica forces to leave the Hural (Parliament), the Gov-
 ernment briefly granted opposition parties limited access to both broadcast and
 print media. Revocation of this access was one of the factors leading to the 2-week-
 long hunger strike discussed above.
 Academic freedom is evident, although there continues to be a shortage of teach-
 ing materials.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Assoiation.- he Constitution provides for
 peaceful assembly and association, and this is generally respected in practice. An
 
 
 653
 additional cause of the April hunger strike, however, was the first reported denial
 of a meeting permit by police forces, which opposition forces claimed was made on
 political grounds. The President promised to introduce legislation delineating these
 rights, and clarified that the permit process is a public order and safety measure,
 not a means of controlling the expression of political criticism. By year's end, no leg-
 islation had been passed.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides only for the right both to wor-
 ship and not to worship and explicitly recognizes the separation of church and state.
 However, the Constitution's prvision for regulation of church and state relations
 led to the pass  in late 1993 of a law that appeared to make distinctions between
 the three "traditional" Mongoian    beief systems--i.e., Buddhism, Islam, and
 Shamanism-and all others. The three most discriminatory provisions of the law
 were struck down by the Constitutional Court in January. The decision left intact
 several prvisions which could lead to abuse of the freedom of religion. The most
 controversial are the provision that allows the State to supervise and limit, if it de-
 sires to do so, the number of priests, monks, and other religious authorities, as well
 as the locations of individual religious establishments, and the provision recognizing
 the "predominant" or "preeminent" place of Buddhism in Mongolia. The law pro-
 hibits the use of state-owned buildings for religious purposes in a country where
 most buildings are state owned. Nevertheless, since the decision, several Christian
 churches have successfully registered and found places to worship. Except for a sin-
 gle, unconfirmed charge of discrimination levied by one congregation, there is no
 credible evidence that the Government has used this law or any other to limit or
 interfere with religious freedom. Proselytizing is allowed, although a Ministry of
 Education directive bans the mixing of foreign language or other training with reli-
 gious teaching or instruction. Contacts with coreligionists outside the country are
 allowed.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens move freely within the country and may change their work-
 place and residence without government restriction. The Government does not arbi-
 trarily restrict travel abroad.-There have been no reports of forced expulsion of those
 having a valid claim to refugee status.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens the right to change their government through
 periodic, free elections via secret ballot, with universal suffrage. However, as noted
 above, the plurality-takes-all election law, combined with a multiplicity of can-
 didates in each constituency, led to an overwhelming MPRP victory in the 1992 elec-
 tions. The MPRP the successor party to the Communist party that controlled politi-
 cal life in Mongofia for 70 years, dominates a unicameral chamber (70 of 76 seats),
 even though opposition party candidates won more than 40 percent of the popular
 vote. They have consistently complained that the current SGH composition does not
 reflect the will of the electorate.
 Several new political parties were formed in 1994, bringing the recognized total
 to 19.
 There are no legal impediments to the participation of women in government and
 politics, but they are under represented in the highest levels of government and the
 judiciary. Although there are significant numbers of women in various midlevel min-
 istry positions, there are no women in the Cabinet or in either the Supreme or Con-
 stitutional Courts, and only three in the legislature. Under representation of women
 at the highest levels of government and the professions has several causes, includ-
 ing tradition and some degree of discrimination by the virtually all-male web of
 leadership.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 In late 1994 the Human Rights Committee, which was founded in 1990, merged
 with two smaller human rights groups to become a local affiliate of Amnesty Inter-
 national. They continued to operate without government restriction.
 The Government welcomed visits by representatives of several international
 human rights organizations, and a representative of the International Committee of
 the Red Cross is resident in Mongolia.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that       no person shall be discriminated against on
 the basis of ethnic origin, language, race, age, sex, social origin, or status" and that
 
 
 654
 "men and women shall be equal in political, economic, social, cultural fields, and
 family affairs."
 Women.-Women comprise about half the work force, and a significant number
 are the primary earners for their families. By law and practice, women receive equal
 pay for equal work and have equal access to education. They comprise a majority
 of the work force in the legal and medical professions and are well represented in
 middle-level management of government, education, and research institutions.
 Growing numbers of women are involved in the creation and management of private
 compames such as trading and manufacturing. Women are, however, almost totally
 absent from the highest ranks of government and the professions.
 There is growing public discussion of domestic violence, includi  spousal and
 child abuse after many years of government and societal denial. The large economic
 and societal changes under way have created new stresses on the family, including
 loss of jobs, inflation, and lowered spending for social and educational programs.
 These factors, coupled with the serious problems caused by extremely high rates of
 alcohol abuse, have led to increased instances of abuse and abandonment and added
 to the ranks of single-parent families, most of which are headed by women. There
 is no known police or government intervention in cases involving violence against
 women beyond prosecution under existing assault laws when formal charges are
 filed.
 Children.-Increased stress on the family structure and in society has had direct
 effects on many children. There are growing numbers of infants and small children
 orphaned by maternal deaths and desertion, and in the major urban centers, par-
 ticularly Ulaanbaatar, growing numbers of street children. The Government is com-
 mitted in principle to children's rights and welfare, but lacks the resources to go
 beyond minimal support for shelters and programs which require additional private
 donations to operate. The few orphanages and shelters are hard pressed to accom-
 modate all the children who need temporary or permanent placement and to raise
 sufficient funds from government and private sources to sustain their activities. It
 appears difficult for many Monglians-rared in a culture that values children and
 in which extended families and multiple caregivers have always been the rle--to
 recognize or admit the gravity of this relatively new problem.
 People With Disabilities.-People with disabilities receive government benefits ac-
 cording to the nature and severity of the disability; those who have been injured
 in industrial accidents have the right to be reemployed when ready to resume work.
 The Government also provides tax benefits to enterprises which hire the disabled,
 and some firms do so exclusively. There is no government legislation mandating ac-
 cess for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution entitles all workers to form or join
 union and professional organizations of their own choosing. Union officials estimate
 that the combined membership in all unions now totals over 470,000, close to half
 of the work force. During 1994 there was a government-mandated registration of all
 workers' organizations, and almost 600 separate unions were recognized. Most of
 these are affiliated with the Mongolian Trade Unions Confederation (MTUC), for-
 merly a part of the MPRP, but now officially separate. The newer Association of
 Free Trades Unions (AFTU) has a growing number of affiliates. Both organizations
 am developing contacts with international labor organizations and confederations in
 other countries. Membership figures may be rather unreliable as many companies
 and institutions undergo privatization and restructuring and as many workers
 change occupations. There are no arbitrary restrictions on who may be a union offi-
 cial; such officers are elected by secret ballot.
 Union members, with the exceptions of civil servants and employees in essential
 services, have the right to strike. The Government defines essential services as
 those critical for national defense and safety, including police, employees of power
 plants, water works, public transportation, public communications, and certain rail-
 way employees. Articles 6 and 7 of the Law of Labor Conflict Resolution state that
 the court can punish organizers if it finds the strike was illegal because either the
 industry was an essential service or there was "insufficient cause" for the strike. A
 strike at a major joint venture textile company ended in a court ruling that failed
 to clarify this provision or other aspects of the country's labor code.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Amendments to the existing
 Labor Law passed in 1993 provide for collective bargaining, but its current applica-
 tion remains unclear. In theory, wage levels and ot  employment issues are de-
 cided in tripartite contract negotiations between employer, union, and government
 representatives; the Government's role is limited to ensuring that the contract
 meets legal requirements as to hours and conditions of work. In practice, wages and
 
 
 other conditions of employment still are set mainly by the employer whether that
 employer is a private firm or the Government. Most industrial concerns have now
 been privatized, although the Government still controls some major infrastructure
 enterprises, including mines and the communications system.
 There are no export processing zones in Mongolia.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law specifically prohibits
 forced or compulsory labor. However, virtually all of the military forces are required
 to help with the fall harvest.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law prohibits children under
 the age of 16 from working, although those age 14 and 15 may do so with parental
 consent. Those under 18 years of age may not work at night, engage in arduous
 work, or work in dangerous occupations, such as mining and construction. Enforce-
 ment of these prohibitions, as well as all other labor regulations, is the responsibil-
 ity of state labor inspectors assigned to regional and local offices. These inspectors
 have the authority to order and, reportedly, compel immediate compliance with
 labor legislation. Enforcement is limited due to the small number of labor inspectors
 who must monitor a growing number of small enterprises.
 A significant number of children continue to leave school early to work, both in
 the cities and in the countryside. In rural areas, this appears to be partly attrib-
 utable to the closure of some schools and a growing shortage of teachers; the chil-
 dren often leave to help care for newly privatized herds.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In September the minimum wage was raised
 to about $0.12 (33 tugrks) per hour, or approximately $25.00 a month. This level
 applies to public sector employees only, and it is enforced by the Ministry of Popu-
 lation Policy and Labor. However, this is the lowest wage for manual labor, such
 as janitorial work, and virtually all civil servants make more than this amount.
 Those employed in private businesses generally earn considerably more. The mini-
 mum wage alone is insufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker
 and his family.
 Labor law sets the standard legal workweek at 46 hours and establishes a mini-
 mum rest period of 42 hours between workweeks. For those under 18 years of age
 the workweek is 36 hours, and overtime work is not allowed. Time off is given equa
 to the number of overtime hours worked or, by law, compensated at double the
 standard hourly rate. Pregnant women and nursing mothers are prohibited by law
 from working overtime.
 Laws on labor, cooperatives, and enterprises set occupational health and safety
 standards, and the Ministry of Population Policy and Labor provides enforcement.
 According to the Labor Law, workers have the right to remove themselves from dan-
 gerous work situations and still retain their jobs. Mongolia's near total reliance on
 outmoded machinery and continuing problems with management and maintenance
 lead to frequent industrial accidents, particularly in the mining power, and con-
 struction sectors. Effective enforcement of existing occupational health and safety
 standards is difficult because the Labor Ministry has only 37 full-time inspectors
 to cover all firms, including a growing number of small enterprises. Some of the
 major industrial sectors, however, have part-time inspectors.
