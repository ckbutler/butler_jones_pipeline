 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 Equatorial Guinea is ruled by a military government, under
 Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, which took power as a military
 government in the 1979 coup that overthrew President Francisco
 Macias Nguema and ended the latter's 11-year, state-sanctioned
 policy of terror. A national Constitution was adopted in
 1982, national and local assemblies were chosen, and the-
 military government declared itself a civilian government. In
 December 1986, a single political party, the Democratic Party
 of Equatorial Guinea (DPEG), was established by government
 decree, with the President as its titular head. Only members
 of the DPEG may vote and hold public office, but all adult
 citizens, even those who are not party members, are required
 to pay party dues. The legislative and judicial branches of
 government are subordinate to the presidency. Members of the
 Fang tribes of Rio Muni, principally the Esangui, of which the
 President and most of his closest advisors are members, hold
 disproportionate power in the Government.
 The civilian police and internal security forces fall within
 the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Territorial Administration
 and National Security. They are augmented by a 300-man
 presidential guard provided by the Moroccan Government. The
 army is the predominant element of the Guinean military
 forces. In practice, many members of the police and security
 forces also hold military rank. Most human rights abuses in
 Equatorial Guinea are attributable to members of these
 services.
 Most of the population (an estimated 350,000) live by
 subsistence agriculture, fishing, and hunting, with per capita
 annual income approximately $300. The small wage economy,
 based on cocoa, lumber, and coffee, was devastated during the
 Macias years, and by the death or exodus of thousands of
 trained and educated citizens. The economy remains extremely
 .fragile, despite substantial foreign aid and attempts at
 reform, which include entry into the West African Franc Zone,
 foreign debt rescheduling, and efforts to attract much needed
 foreign investment, especially from France and the European
 Economic Community. A major barrier to economic development
 is the lack of a clear rule of law to protect and encourage
 plantation agriculture. Large. plantations, which form the
 base of the economy, were abandoned by their Spanish owners
 during the Macias regime, then arbitrarily expropriated in
 1984 and transferred under very favorable terms to influential
 members of the current Government.
 While much improved since the end of the Macias regime, the
 human rights situation in 1988 was nevertheless characterized
 by continued reports of arbitrary arrests, citizen harassment
 by poorly paid police and military personnel, discrimination
 against minority groups and migrant workers, and the use of
 forced labor. In August upward of 80 persons were detained on
 suspicion of planning to overthrow the Government. In the
 third major coup trial in 5 years, a military court sentenced
 10 of the 80 (including 7 civilians) in September to
 punishments varying from death (commuted to life imprisonment)
 to 12 years' imprisonment. Defendants in this trial had only
 minimal access to legal counsel and no right to appeal their
 verdicts. National Assembly and local elections in 1988
 featured multiple DPEG candidates--thus giving the electorate
 some choice. The elections also returned delegates from
 various ethnic groups.

 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reported incidents or allegations of political
 killings in 1988.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known disappearances in 1988.
 c. ,Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Police methods are harsh and often include beatings of
 prisoners either to extract information or to punish offenders
 for alleged insolence or disrespect. The Government appeared
 little inclined to curb such abuses. Arbitrary police
 beatings of politically powerless people, such as expatriate
 Nigerian and Cameroonian workers and members of Bubi and
 certain other indigenous tribes, continued in 1988. At least
 one of the persons detained in August as an accomplice in the
 alleged coup plot suffered broken limbs as a result of his
 detention and interrogation. One defendant stated at the
 court-martial that his alleged confession was provided only in
 the hope of halting nearly 2 weeks of torture.
 Mistreatment of prisoners in more routine cases was condemned
 officially but in fact was tolerated. Prisoners are dependent
 on their families for food. Prison conditions are unhealthful,
 and medical care is almost nonexistent. Prisoners often are
 forced to sleep and sit on the floor, occasionally are denied
 exercise, and are required to work on private plantations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Despite constitutional provisions, there was no enforcement of
 the right of a person in detention to be charged or released
 within a certain period of time, to have access to a lawyer,
 or be released on bail. Arbitrary arrests by security forces
 or police were commonplace, often on spurious charges in order
 to extort money. Many of the persons detained in August were
 taken at night from their homes with no explanation of the
 accusations against them. Many were held incommunicado
 throughout their interrogations, even though they were not
 subsequently formally charged or tried.
 There were no known cases of any citizens being stripped of
 their citizenship or exiled abroad in 1988. With regard to
 forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Ministry of Justice made little progress in 1988 in
 establishing a fully functioning legal system, and the
 executive branch acted with little fear of judicial review.
 The justices on the highest court, the Supreme Court, serve at
 the pleasure of the President. Of 12 Supreme Court positions,
 only 3 had been filled by the end of 1988. The tribunal
 provided for by the Constitution to decide constitutional
 issues has never been established. Under the Constitution,
 military tribunals hear all civil criminal capital offenses.
 
 
 103
 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 The current court system, which often uses local customary
 law, is a combination of traditional, civil, and military
 justice, and operates in an ad hoc manner for lack of
 established procedures and experienced judicial personnel. It
 is not known how frequently people are denied trials, since
 many detainees deal directly with the arresting authorities
 and resort to bribes to gain their freedom. Most trials are
 brief. In cases of petty theft or civil disputes, all-parties
 are brought before a judge for trial. In civil and criminal
 cases, the judge often levies a'fine in lieu of imprisonment.
 In cases involving senior officials, exclusion from public
 office and confinement to traditional villages are common
 means of punishment. Most of Equatorial Guinea's estimated 20
 lawyers work at least part time for the Government and
 consequently are unable to challenge government actions
 effectively.
 Laws are enacted by decree and are not published or otherwise
 effectively promulgated. As there are no legal libraries or
 independent resource facilities, citizens are seldom able to
 determine the laws in effect or whether they have been charged
 with a bona fide offense.
 The most important case in 1988 was the 3-day public trial in
 September of 10.persons (1 in absentia) accused on various
 counts of plotting to assassinate the President and other
 senior officials; espionage; dereliction of official duties;
 fraud; and undermining internal and external security. The
 single defense attorney was unable'to cross-examine
 prosecution witnesses or call upon witnesses for the defense.
 Of the nine defendants present, the tribunal sentenced two to
 death and the remainder to prison terms varying from 12 to 30
 years. By a presidential decree signed the following day, the
 two death sentences were commuted to life imprisonment. The
 speed of the judicial process, the questionable legal basis of
 the charges brought, the doubtful jurisdiction of the military
 tribunal, the lack of independent defense counsel, and the
 absence of appeal procedures raised serious doubts whether the
 defendants received a fair trial. Many local observers
 concluded that the defendants were charged and convicted on
 the basis of having political beliefs at variance with the
 Government's, rather than on the basis of the charges against
 them.
 The exact number of political prisoners was unknown but was
 believed to be small. The Government does not admit to
 holding any political prisoners. There was still no
 information available on. the fate of 26 persbns tried in July
 1983 on charges stemming from a coup attempt in May 1983. One
 person, whose death sentence was commuted to life
 imprisonment, was interviewed on local television in November
 to dispel rumors he had been killed in prison. Otherwise,. the
 Government reported only that the majority of the accused
 received sentences varying from 5 to 10 years.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There were reports of arbitrary interference with privacy,
 including pressure by authorities to join the sole political
 party (DPEG) and to participate in "spontaneous" government-
 sanctioned celebrations. Persons deemed suspicious were
 sometimes placed under surveillance, and there was a general
 belief that telephone conversations were routinely monitored,
 although correspondence remained sacrosanct. Search warrants
 
 
 104
 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 were not normally used, even though they are required by the
 Constitution. There was no forced resettlement of population
 and no interference with the right to marry and to have
 children.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Open criticism of the Government is not permitted. The media
 that exist in Equatorial Guinea are government owned and
 operated. The two national newspapers (published
 sporadically) are in fact government bulletins. The radio and
 television stations transmit only official government
 bulletins and other programs that are approved in advance.
 In general, the Government does not permit the sale or
 distribution of publications openly critical of its conduct.
 Foreign newspapers containing articles critical of the
 Government are sometimes confiscated from citizens upon
 arrival at Malabo's international airport. A quarterly
 publication of the Spanish-Guinean cultural center in Malabo
 was suppressed until an article about the status of women in
 Equatorial Guinea, which was offensive to one member of the
 Government, was removed from all copies.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Citizens are not free to associate publicly with others to
 discuss political or -economic matters at variance with
 government policy, notwithstanding constitutional guarantees
 to the contrary. The Government stated repeatedly that it
 would not permit opposition political organizations nor
 tolerate unsanctioned political rallies and assemblies.
 Private nonpolitical groups, such as professional
 organizations, churches, and sports groups generally require
 government approval and licensing.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Until late 1985, there had been complete freedom of religion
 in predominantly Roman Catholic Equatorial Guinea. In
 December 1985, the Jehovah's Witnesses and several small
 Pentecostal groups were banned, and their churches and meeting
 houses closed, ostensibly due to their proselytizing
 activities. In 1986 and 1987, church members were placed
 under house arrest, harassed, and reportedly forced to do
 manual labor despite the fact that they had not been convicted
 or charged with any crime. After several unsuccessful
 appeals, 10 noncitizen Witness missionaries were expelled from
 the country in late 1987, and 80 local Witnesses were
 forbidden to practice their religion. During 1988 foreign
 clergy and missionaries of several other faiths were still
 active and had government permission for their activities.
 Training clergy in the approved denominations and religious
 education was permitted. In general, active proselytizing by
 Protestant denominations is discouraged, but conversions are
 permitted. All denominations are allowed to be active in
 charitable activities. With the exceptions noted above, there
 was no job discrimination on the basis of religious faith.

 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There were no explicit restrictions on travel within the
 country. However, a person found without a job in any part of
 the country except his own town or village could be picked up
 by the police and subjected to a short period of forced labor,
 followed by obligatory return to his place of origin.
 There were no reports of any additional Guinean refugees
 fleeing the country in 1988, but a large number of refugees
 from the former regime continued to reside in Spain, France,
 Cameroon, and Gabon. Many of them voiced fear of repression
 from the current Government if they returned, and alleged that
 their passports were restricted to prevent travel back to
 Equatorial Guinea. The poor state of the economy was believed
 to be the main reason why many remained abroad.
 The Government proclaimed repeatedly that returnees need not
 fear persecution, but they could engage in political
 activities only within the sanctioned one party system. In
 July the Government sponsored the repatriation of
 approximately 2,000 of its citizens from neighboring Gabon,
 where many had been arrested and ordered deported for visa
 violations. Brought back to the island of Bioko aboard
 Equatorial Guinea's sole merchant ship, many of the indigent
 Guineans remained in temporary shelters for several weeks
 until they could make passage back to the mainland.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the right to change their government by
 democratic means. President Obiang Nguema Mbasogo took power
 in 1979 in a military coup that toppled the Macias regimu. He
 then used the 1982 plebiscite, which involved only approval or
 disapproval of the Constitution, to declare himself
 President. He will face reelection in 1989 upon completing
 the present 7-year term established by the Constitution.
 Members of the National Assembly, some of whom are elected and
 some appointed, are chosen for 5-year terms. While the
 Assembly includes members of minority groups and is
 theoretically the legislative branch of government, it is
 powerless to take any action not sanctioned by the President
 or his Council of Ministers. According to the Constitution,
 the President has the power to suspend virtually all rights
 provided for in the Constitution when a threat to national
 security or a national emergency exists, and the President
 himself determines when such a threat exists.
 Only members of the DPEG may hold public office, and the party
 controls the selection of all candidates. In 1987 a
 presidential decree mandated that all adult citizens of
 Equatorial Guinea should pay dues to the party, whether or not
 they are members. Deductions of 3 percent were made from
 adults' wages and salaries for deposit into the party's
 treasury.
 Elections were held throughout 1988 to select local and.
 provincial leaders as well as members of the National Assembly
 for new 5-year terms of office. Although all candidates are
 required to be members of the DPEG, there were multiple
 candidates for most positions. Candidates opposed to current
 government policies were not allowed to contend for office.
 
 
 106
 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 In late 1988, President Obiang Nguema Mbasogo was elected as
 head of the DPEG.
 Women have played only a minor although increasing role in
 politics. They made gains in the 1988 elections. The highest
 government positions held by women are the deputy ministers of
 labor and of health, the mayors of two towns, 5 members (out
 of 60) of the National Assembly, 1 ambassador overseas, and
 the Presidential Advisor for Public Health and Social Action
 (who is also the wife of the President). Women now hold
 approximately 5 percent of the public positions, elective and
 appointive.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The current Government has denounced and reversed the
 widespread savagery of the previous regime. It also has been
 willing to discuss human rights issues with international and
 nongovernmental organizations. It allowed a United Nations
 human rights team to visit Equatorial Guinea in 1986. (The
 U.N. report had still not been released by the end of 1988.)
 A group from Amnesty International visited Equatorial Guinea
 in February 1988 at the request of the Government and was
 granted free access to citizens and government officials.
 There are no local human rights gToups in Equatorial Guinea.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The law states that both sexes and all tribal groups are equal
 and entitled to the same rights and privileges. Members of
 the Fang clans, principally the Esangui, comprise more than 70
 percent of the population and dominate life in Equatorial
 Guinea, including the allocation of top government positions.
 The Bubi tribe comprises approximately 15 percent of the
 population and has historically been the majority on the
 island of Bioko, where the capital is located. The Bubis
 often are subjected to arbitrary discrimination by lower level
 police, military, and other government officials, including
 verbal and physical abuse. They and other tribal groups such
 as Playeros, Fernandinos, and less favored Fang clans are
 similarly discriminated against in opportunities for economic
 and social advancement.
 For a variety of historical, cultural, and economic reasons,
 women are accorded a lower social status than men, and have a
 correspondingly lesser influence in society and government.
 Social tradition, and the fact that women produce and market
 most of the basic staple food items, have kept most women
 engaged in agricultural or domestic work. Many more males
 than females enter and graduate from secondary school. In
 some of the country's ethnic groups, property ownership and
 inheritance are matrilineal. Although bridal dowries are
 given, women have the same freedom as men to choose their
 marriage partners.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Equatorial Guinea is a member of the International Labor
 Organization. Labor unions, although not specifically
 prohibited by the Constitution, do not exist in Equatorial
 
 
 107
 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 Guinea. The right to strike is forbidden. There are several
 cooperatives (for farmers, taxi drivers, and individual market
 entrepreneurs), which have a limited voice in establishing
 licensing and transportation fees.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 These rights are not enshrined in law or practice, nor are
 there mechanisms to promote voluntary worker-employer
 negotiations. There are no export processing zones in
 Equatorial Guinea.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Government continued to round up so-called vagrant illegal
 aliens (particularly Ghanaians, Nigerians, and Cameroonians)
 and force them to engage in compulsory labor. These roundups
 were a means of obtaining free labor and'were often linked to
 seasonal needs on the plantations of important government
 officials, the preparation for'national holidays, or the
 arrival of visiting dignitaries. This was also widely
 practiced by officials against Equatorial Guinean citizens
 detained (but not subsequently charged or convicted) on minor
 offenses. These actions are not provided for in the law, but,
 given the benefits to senior government officials, there has
 been no move to abolish this practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment is 16, but there was little
 enforcement of this law. Traditionally, children assist their
 parents in raising crops and marketing produce on a part-time
 basis.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is only a small industrial sector in the country. Most
 salaried employment is provided by the Government, construction
 companies, businesses providing retail goods and services, and
 the plantation agricultural sector. Equatorial Guinea had a
 statutory minimum wage of approximately $35 per month and an
 average monthly wage of approximately $70 in 1988. Only a
 small percentage of the population had regular salaried
 employment. Of those who did, the majority were required to
 supplement this income by other paid employment or farming to
 provide a decent living for themselves and their families. By
 law, working conditions included a maximum 48 hours workweek
 with a full day of rest each week plus regularly scheduled
 national holidays. There was no effective monitoring of
 workhours or labor conditions outside the Government.
