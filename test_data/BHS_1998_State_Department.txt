 BAHAMAS
 The Commonwealth of the Bahamas is a constitutional, parliamentary democracy
 and a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. Queen Elizabeth II, the nominal
 head of state, is represented by an appointed Governor General. Prime Minister Hu-
 bert A. Ingraham's Free National Movement (FNM) has controlled the Government
 and Parliament since August 1992. The judiciary is independent
 The police and the small Bahamas Defence Force answer to civilian authority and
 generally respect laws protecting human rights. However, there continue to be re-
 ports that police occasionally abuse detainees.
 The economy depends primarily on tourism, which accounts for nearly two-thirds
 of the gross domestic product. Financial services, particularly offshore banking and
 trust management, are also a major source of revenue. While some citizens enjoy
 relatively high income levels, there is considerable underemployment and poverty.
 According to the Governmenfs most recent survey, the unemployment rate fell to
 about 9.5 percent.
 Citizens enjoy a wide range of democratic freedoms and human rights. The prin-
 cipal human rights problems include reports of occasional police abuse of detainees,
 continuing harsh conditions in the only prison, occasional arbitrary arrests, lengthy
 pretrial detention and delays in trials, violence and discrimination against women,
 and violence against children.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings.
 
 
 In January bank robbery suspect Bradley Taylor died in police custody. The police
 contended that Taylor's wounds resulted from officers' use of measured and appro-
 priate force to subdue him when he attempted to escape. However, others, including
 Taylor's family, accused the police of fatally beating him, citing blunt abdominal
 trauma, which appears to have been the cause of death. In September a seven-mem-
 ber jury cleared the police of wrongdoing in Taylor's death.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture and other cruel and degrading treatment or pun-
 ishment, but corporal punishment-abolished in 1984-was reinstated in 1991.
 Human rights monitors and members of the general public continued to express
 concern over instances of police abuse against criminal suspects. Many of the
 charges of abuse involved beatings in order to extract confessions. Police officials
 continued to deny that there have been violations of defendants' rights. According
 to the officials, these rights are protected by the trial judge, who determines the ad-
 missibility of the defendant's statement as evidence at trial.
 The Police Complaints and Discipline Unit, which reports directly to senior police
 officials, is responsible for investigating allegations of police brutality. This unit de-
 termines if enough evidence of abuse or misconduct exists in a particular case to
 warrant discipline within the police system or, in some instances, criminal prosecu-
 tion by the Attorney General. Local human rights observers doubt the police force's
 ability to investigate itself impartially in cases of alleged abuse and misconduct and
 believe that many incidents of improper police behavior go unreported. Police offi-
 cials insist that their investigations are fair and thorough. They note that of the 137
 complaints received in the first half of the year, 6 led to disciplinary action against
 officers and 100 were still under investigation at year's end.
 Conditions at Fox Hill, the only prison, continued to improve, but remain harsh
 and overcrowded. The men's maximum     security block, originally built in 1953 to
 house 400 to 600 inmates, holds nearly 800 of the prison's total of roughly 1,400
 inmates. The remaining prisoners are housed in medium and minimum security
 units and in the women's unit, where conditions are far less crowded. The prison's
 female population is around 45 inmates, considerably less than the female unit's full
 capacity. Male prisoners are crowded into poorly ventilated cells that generally lack
 running water and adequate sanitation facilities. There are no separate facilities for
 inmates being held on remand, although some eventually are segregated in a me-
 dium security wing after being processed through maximum security. Prison offi-
 cials estimate that about 7 percent of the incoming prison population is infected
 with the HIV virus. Most prisoners lack beds. Many of them sleep on concrete floors
 and are locked in their cells 23 hours per day. Facilities for women are less severe
 and do have running water. Organizations providing aid, counseling services, and
 religious instruction have regular access to inmates.
 In January migrants from Cuba and the Dominican Republic rioted at the Car-
 michael Road Detention Center to protest their incarceration in the dilapidated,
 often crowded facility (see Section 1.d.).
 The Government has provided funds for improvements in prison facilities and
 prisoner rehabilitation programs. Modern training facilities for prison officers and
 -staff are equipped with new computers and additional personnel, and the prison of-
 fers some educational and literacy programs for prisoners. The prison is construct-
 ing a new 80-cell maximum security building. This building, which is to have larger
 cells and more extensive plumbing, should provide some relief of the overcrowding
 in the existing block. Prison officials plan to renovate the current maximum security
 unit once the new building is in service.
 Local and international human rights groups were able to visit the prison during
 the year.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention. The authorities conduct arrests openly and, when required, ob-
 tain judicially issued warrants. However, police sometimes deviate from prescribed
 procedures and act arbitrarily. The Government respects the right to a judicial de-
 termination of the legality of arrests.
 Serious cases, including those of suspected narcotics or firearms offenses, do not
 require warrants where probable cause exists. Arrested persons appear before a
 magistrate within 48 hours (or by the next business day for cases arising on week-
 ends and holidays) to hear the charges against them. They may hire an attorney
 of their choice, but the Government does not provide legal representation except to
 destitute suspects charged with capital crimes. Some local legal professionals and
 human rights observers believe that this lack of representation risks hasty convic-
 tions on the basis of unchallenged evidence, particularly in the case of poor or illit-
 
 
 erate defendants. However, there is no statistical evidence to indicate that this is
 more than an occasional problem.
 The Bail Actprohibits bail for repeat offenders and those accused of certain vio-
 lent crimes. Judges tend not to grant bail to foreign suspects, particularly on more
 serious offenses, since the authorities consider foreign offenders more likely to flee
 if released on bail. Judges sometimes authorize cash bail for foreigners arrested on
 minor charges, but in practice, foreign suspects generally prefer to plead guilty and
 pay a fine rather than pursue their right to defend themselves, given possible delays
 m court cases and harsh conditions in the prison. Attorneys and other prisoner ad-
 vocates continue to complain of excessive pretrial detention.
 The authorities detain illegal migrants, primarily Haitians and Cubans, at the
 Carmichael Road Detention Center until arrangements can be made for them to
 leave the country or they obtain legal status. Conditions at the detention center are
 Spartan, but the authorities do not hold most detainees for an excessively long pe-
 riod of time. One local advocate for the Haitian community who frequently visits the
 detention center estimates that detainees rarely spend longer than 6 months in the
 center, and that most are processed out in a matter of days or weeks. Illegal mi-
 grants convicted of crimes other than immigration violations are held at Fox Hill
 Prison and remain there for weeks or months after serving their sentences, pending
 deportation. Prisoners who can arrange and finance their repatriation generally are
 deported much more quickly. In January a small number of Cuban detainees rioted
 in the detention center, but the authorities quickly contained the disturbance, and
 no serious injuries were reported.
 Exile is illegal and is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is independent.
 The justice system derives from English common law. The Governor General ap-
 points judges on the advice, in most cases, of the independent Judicial and Legal
 Services Commission. Magistrate's courts are the lowest level courts and only han-
 die crimes with a maximum sentence of 5 years. Trial by jury is available only in
 the Supreme Court, which is the trial court that handles most major cases. Its deci-
 sions may be appealed to the Court of Appeal, with the Privy Council in London
 being the final court of appeal.
 Trials are fair and public. Defendants enjoy the presumption of innocence and the
 right to appeal. Defendants can confront and question witnesses against them and
 present evidence on their own behalf. The judicial system is plagued by a large
 backlog of cases, and delays reportedly can last as long as 2 years. To reduce the
 backlog, the Government has begun the process of streamlining appeals, computeriz-
 ing court records, and hiring new judges, magistrates, and court reporters. The Su-
 preme Court established a task force to recommend further reforms in the court sys-
 tem.
 Despite these measures to improve efficiency, complaints persist of excessive pre-
 trial detention, outdated record-keeping, and delayed justice for victims. There were
 isolated complaints of deviations from normal, fair court proceedings-particularly
 in civil matters-but there were no indications that this was a widespread problem.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits arbitrary entry, search, or seizure, and the Government gen-
 erally respects these prohibitions in practice. The law usually requires a court order
 for entry into or search of a private residence, but a police inspector or more senior
 police official may authorize a search without a court order where probable cause
 to suspect a weapons violation exists. Such an official may also authorize the search
 of a person (that extends to the vehicle in which the person is traveling) without
 a court order, should probable cause exist to suspect drug possession.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Government respects the constitutional pro-
 vision for the right of free expression, and the political opposition criticizes the Gov-
 ernment freely and frequently. Three daily and several weekly newspapers, all pri-
 vately owned, express a variety of views on issues of public interest, including vary-
 ing degrees of criticism of the Government and its policies. Foreign newspapers and
 magazines are readily available.
 There is a government-run radio station and three privately owned radio broad-
 casters. The country's sole television station, the state-owned Broadcasting Corpora-
 tion of the Bahamas (ZNS), presents a variety of views, although opposition politi-
 cians claim with some justification that their views do not receive as extensive cov-
 erage as those of the Government. In May ZNS management sent a set of guidelines
 to its journalists, instructing them how to cover the introduction of bills and other
 parliamentary procedures. The opposition claimed, with some justification, that
 
 
 these guidelines limit media coverage of its role in Parliament. ZNS management
 maintained that the guidelines were simply an effort to make coverage of Par-
 liament more concise and denied any political bias. In a conciliatory gesture, the
 Government instructed ZNS in November to broadcast several sessions of the oppo-
 sition's party congress without charge. However, the debate over ZNS coverage of
 parliamentary activity continued.
 The Government does not restrict academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, and the authorities respect these rights in
 practice. The law permits private associations, but groups must obtain permits to
 hold public demonstrations. The authorities grant such permits almost without ex-
 ception.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice. The Government cooperates with the office of the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organi-
 zations in assisting refugees.
 There is no legislation to govern the processing of asylum seekers, and applica-
 tions for political asylum are adjudicated on a case-by-case basis at the cabinet
 level. Through the end of 1997, the UNHCR conducted extensive interviews of ille-
 gal aliens who sought political asylum and made recommendations to the Govern-
 ment. However, the UNHCR has scaled back its involvement significantly since the
 beginning of the year, leaving the screening of asylum applicants to trained immi-
 gration officials. Since this development, local and international human rights ob-
 servers have criticized the Government for failing to screen potential asylum appli-
 cants adequately. In August and September, human rights organizations claimed
 that some Cubans with legitimate fears of persecution were repatriated without first
 having the opportunity to make a claim for asylum. In the wake of this criticism,
 the authorities reviewed their interview procedures and strengthened cooperation
 with the UNHCR. There was no evidence that Cubans or others faced forced repatri-
 ation when a legitimate fear of persecution existed. No persons received first asylum
 in 1998, but several cases were still pending cabinet review at year's end.
 Although the repatriation agreement between the Bahamas and Haiti expired at
 the end of 1995, the Government continued to repatriate illegal Haitian immigrants
 based on the terms of that agreement. The Government signed a repatriation agree-
 ment with Cuba in June. In the first 8 months of the year, the authorities repatri-
 ated 361 illegal Cuban immigrants, many of them under the terms of the new agree-
 ment.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 The Bahamas is a constitutional, parliamentary democracy with two major politi-
 cal parties and general elections at least every 5 years. An elected Prime Minister
 and Parliament govern. The political process is open to all elements of society, and
 citizens 18 years of age and older are eligible to register and vote; voting is by secret
 ballot. The two principal political parties are the ruling Free National Movement
 and the opposition Progressive Liberal Party (PLP). The PLP led the country for 6
 years of internal self-government from 1967 to 1973 and held power from independ-
 ence in 1973 until 1992. The FNM won general elections in 1992 and 1997. The
 FNM holds 35 of 40 seats in the House of Assembly, and the PLP holds 5. Both
 the ruling party and the opposition name members to the upper house, the Senate,
 in compliance with constitutional guidelines. Although it does pass legislation, the
 Senate is primarily a deliberative body that serves as a public forum to discuss na-
 tional problems and policies.
 The Parliament has six elected female members, including the speaker of the
 House, and five appointed female Senators, including the government leader in the
 Senate. The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Janet Bostwick, also directs the Bahamian
 Bureau of Women's Affairs. Women also head the Ministry of Education and the
 Ministry of Labor, Immigration, and Training. The Chief Justice of the Supreme
 Court is a woman.
 
 
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Individual human rights monitors and several local human rights groups, as well
 as representatives of international human rights organizations, operate freely, ex-
 pressing their opinions and reporting their findings on alleged human rights viola-
 tions without government restriction. Thd Government allows them broad access to
 institutions and individuals.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Government generally respects in practice the constitutional provisions for in-
 dividual rights and freedoms regardless of race, place of origin, political opinion,
 creed, or sex. However, the Constitution and the law contain certain provisions that
 discriminate against women.
 Women.-Violence against women continues to be a serious, widespread problem.
 Government crime statistics do not separate domestic violence from other incidents
 of violence; however, many women sought shelter at a private, but government-sup-
 ported, crisis center in Nassau. The center offers counseling as well as shelter to
 many victims of domestic violence. The Government established a nationwide toll-
 free hot line, with two trained volunteers on each of the inhabited islands who are
 on call to respond in the event of a crisis. Throughout the year, the Government
 and private women's organizations conducted a public awareness campaign to com-
 memorate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, promoting "women's rights
 �as human rights," and highlighting the problems of abuse and domestic violence.
 The Domestic Court, which deals exclusively with family issues such as spousal
 abuse, maintenance payments, and legal separation, continued to receive a high vol-
 ume of cases. The court can and does impose various legal constraints to protect
 women from abusive spouses or companions. However, advocates for women's rights
 see a need to improve the effectiveness of enforcement of the court's orders. They
 cite a general reluctance on the part of law enforcement authorities to intervene in
 domestic disputes and a lack of police training and sensitivity in dealing with do-
 mestic violence. While police training includes some presentations on domestic vio-
 lence, law enforcement authorities admit that the problem has not been a top prior-
 ity in training or resource allocation.
 The Constitution discriminates against women by not providing them with the
 same right as men to transmit citizenship to their foreign-born spouses. Addition-
 ally, the law makes it easier for men with foreign spouses to confer citizenship on
 their children than for women with foreign spouses. Some inheritance laws also
 favor men over women. For example, when a person dies without a will, the estate
 passes to the oldest legitimate son, or in cases where there is no son, the closest
 egitimate male relative. Prominent women of all political persuasions continue to
 push for an amendment to the Constitution and related laws to redress this situa-
 tion.
 Women participate fully in society and are well represented in the business and
 professional sectors, as well as in the judiciary and government (see Section 3).
 Children.-The Government places priority on maintaining adequate expenditures
 for child welfare and education. Public education is compulsory for children through
 the age of 16. However, child abuse and neglect remain serious problems, and statis-
 tics from Nassau's main hospital show that cases of sexual abuse involving children
 age 14 and under are on the rise. The law requires that persons who have contact
 with a child they believe to be sexually abused must report their suspicions to the
 police. However, the same reporting requirement does not apply to cases of physical
 abuse, which health care professionals believe occurs quite frequently. The police
 refer reported cases of sexual and physical abuse to the Department of Social Serv-
 ices, which investigates them and can bring criminal charges against perpetrators.
 The Department may remove children from abusive situations if the court deems
 it necessary.
 People With Disabilities.-Very few buildings and public facilities are accessible
 to the disabled. Although the 1973 National Building Code mandates certain accom-
 modations for the physically disabled in new public buildings, the authorities rarely
 enforce this requirement. However, the code fails to mandate accommodation in new
 private buildings, which often lack accessibility as well. Advocates for the disabled
 complain of widespread job discrimination and general apathy on the part of private
 employers and political leaders towards their needs for training and equal oppor-
 tunity. They note that there is no overarching legislation to implement and enforce
 equal opportunity policies in the workplace, educational institutions, or elsewhere.
 The Disability Affairs Unit of the Ministry of Social Development and National
 Insurance works with the Bahamas Council for Disability, an umbrella organization
 
 
 496
 of NGO's that offer services for the disabled, to provide a coordinated public and
 private sector approach to the needs of the disabled. A mix of government and pri-
 vate residential and nonresidential institutions provide a range of education, train-
 ing, counseling, and job placement services for both physically and mentally dis-
 abled adults and children. In December the Government announced plans to con-
 struct 20 additional housing units in Nassau designed specifically for the disabled,
 to be completed by the end of 1999.
 NationallRacial/Ethnic Minorities.-Unofficial estimates suggest that at least 20
 percent of the country's roughly 250,000 inhabitants are Haitians or Bahamians of
 Haitian descent, making them the largest and most visible ethnic minority in the
 islands. While 30,000 to 40,000 Haitian citizens reside in the Bahamas legally, some
 observers believe that similarly large numbers are in the country illegally. Although
 Haitians and Bahamians of Haitian descent are generally well integrated into soci-
 ety, interethnic tensions and inequities persist. Some members of the Haitian com-
 munity complain of discrimination in the job market, and resentment of continued
 Haitian immigration is widespread. However, reports of ethnic violence or blatant
 discrimination against legally resident Haitians are scarce. Leaders of the Haitian
 community approve of the Government's humane approach to the repatriation of il-
 legal migrants and point to the high number of ethnic Haitians in the publii service.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides labor unions with the
 right of free assembly and association. Private sector and most public sector workers
 may form or join unions without prior approval. Members of the police force, defense
 force, fire brigade, and prison guards may not organize or join unions. Workers exer-
 cise the right of association extensively, with almost one-quarter of the work force
 (and one-half of the workers in the important hotel industry) belonging to unions.
 Three major umbrella labor organizations, the National Workers Council of Trade
 Unions and Associations, the Trade Union Congress (TUC), and the National Con-
 gress of Trade Unions, along with individual labor unions, all function independent
 of government or political party control.
 The Industrial Relations Act requires that, before a strike begins, a simple major-
 ity of a union's membership must vote in favor of a motion to strike. The Depart-
 ment of Labor must supervise the vote. Unions threatened several work stoppages
 against both public and private employers during the year. In order to resolve trade
 disputes more quickly, Parliament amended the Industrial Relations Act in 1996 to
 establish an industrial tribunal. According to the act, labor disputes are first filed
 with the Ministry of Labor and then, if not resolved, are turned over to the tribunal.
 The tribunal follows normal court procedures for the admission of evidence, direct
 examination, and cross examination. The tribunal's decision is final and only is ap-
 pealable in court on a strict question of law. Some employers complain that the in-
 dustrial tribunal is biased unfairly in favor of employees. In August the Tertiary
 Educators of the Bahamas complained of political interference when the Labor Min-
 istry referred a dispute to the industrial tribunal.
 All labor unions have the right to maintain affiliations with international trade
 union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Workers freely exercise their
 right to organize and participate in collective bargaining, which the law protects.
 Unions and employers negotiate wage rates without government interference. The
 Constitution and the Industrial Relations Act prohibit antiunion discrimination by
 employers. The act requires employers to recognize trade unions, and it requires the
 reinstatement of workers fired for union activities. Employers may dismiss workers
 in accordance with applicable contracts, which generally require some severance
 pay. The Government enforces labor laws and regulations uniformly throughout the
 country.
 Freeport is a specially designated free trade zone. Labor law and practice in this
 zone do not differ from those in the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor by all persons, including children, and such labor does not exist
 in practice.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 prohibits the- employment of children under the age of 14 for industrial work or
 work during school hours. Children under the age of 16 may not work at night.
 There is no legal minimum age for employment in other sectors, and some children
 work part time in light industry and service jobs. The constitutional prohibition of
 forced and compulsory labor, including that by children, is respected in practice (see
 Section-6.c.).
 
 
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Fair Labor Standards Act permits the cre-
 ation of a Wages Council to recommend the setting of a minimum wage, but the
 Government never has established such a council or a general minimum wage. How-
 ever, in 1996 the Government established a specific minimum wage of $4.12 per
 hour for all hourly and temporary workers throughout the public sector. In view of
 the high cost of living, this wage alone would not provide more than a subsistence
 living for a worker and family. The act limits the regular workweek to 48 hours,
 rovides for one 24-hour rest period, and requires overtime payment (time and a
 affor hours beyond the standard.
 The Ministry of Labor, responsible for enforcing labor laws, has a team of inspec-
 tors who conduct on-sit visits to enforce occupational health and safety standards
 and investigate employee concerns and complaints, but inspections occur infre-
 quently. The Ministry normally announces inspection visits in advance, and employ-
 ers generally cooperate with inspectors to implement safety standards.
 The national insurance program compensates workers for work-related injuries.
 The Fair Labor Standards Act requires employers to find suitable alternative em-
 ployment for employees injured on the job but still able to work. The law does not
 provide a right for workers to absent themselves from dangerous work situations
 without jeopardy to continued employment.
