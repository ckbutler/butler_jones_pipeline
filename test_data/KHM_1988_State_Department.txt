 CAMBODIA
 The People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) is ruled by a puppet
 regime headed by Heng Samrin, which was installed by the
 Vietnamese Army after it drove the Khmer Rouge Communist
 regime out of Phnom Penh. Vietnam, through the Heng Samrin
 regime and its own occupation forces, controls most of
 Cambodia by force of arms. Widespread abuses of human rights
 in Cambodia stem largely from its occupation by at least eight
 Vietnamese army divisions and an indigenous, Communist,
 countrywide, civil-military control apparatus which together
 maintain the Heng Samrin regime in power. This control is
 challenged by a three-part Khmer resistance movement, the
 Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK), which
 occupies Cambodia's seat at the United Nations. The
 resistance is waging a guerrilla war throughout much of
 Cambodia from areas along the Thai-Cambodian border.
 Vietnam has attempted to develop Cambodian political and
 economic institutions following the Vietnamese model. Power
 is wielded by the Communist Kampuchean People's Revolutionary
 Party (KPRP), backed by the Vietnamese Army. Vietnam has
 declared that its army will leave Cambodia by 1990. However,
 dissatisfaction with Vietnamese control and persistent PRK
 weakness raise doubts that the Heng Samrin regime will be able
 to sustain itself in the foreseeable future without Vietnamese
 troops.
 The CGDK was formed in 1982, when two non-Communist resistance
 (NCR) groups joined with the Khmer Rouge in a loose alliance.
 While in power from 1975-1979, the Khmer Rouge compiled one of
 the worst records of human rights violations in history as a
 result of a thorough and brutal attempt at restructuring Khmer
 society. The number of Khmer who died was probably at least 1
 million. Despite claims to the contrary, the Khmer Rouge top
 leadership from 1975-79 remains in place. In a number of
 recent incidents, the Khmer Rouge continued to act with
 brutality, and there are reliable reports indicating that they
 retain their ultimate goal of regaining exclusive power in
 Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge currently has between 30,000 and
 40,000 men under arms.
 The Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF), which
 reportedly has approximately 7,000 to 10,000 armed men, is the
 older of the two NCR groups. It is led by former prime
 minister Son Sann and espouses a parliamentary form of
 government. It was formed in 1979 with the merger of several
 existing NCR groups, many led by former soldiers from the
 period of the pre-1975 Khmer Republic. Lack of discipline in
 the KPNLF ranks resulted in acts of banditry against some Thai
 villagers and Khmer and Vietnamese refugees in the Thai-
 Cambodian border areas. However, the departure from the
 border in early 1988 of the two most insubordinate and lawless
 KPNLF commanders in the field improved discipline
 significantly. Incidents of criminal attacks, extortion, and
 other crimes attributable to KPNLF personnel decreased sharply
 during the year.
 The other NCR group and the third group in the coalition is
 the National United Front for an Independent, Neutral,
 Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia (FUNCINPEC), headed by
 Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who ruled as hereditary king and
 later head of state until 1970. The appeal of this
 organization-derives from the Prince's international stature
 and his popularity within Cambodia. The civilian border camp
 
 
 752
 CAMBODIA
 affiliated with Prince Sihanouk (Site B) has generally been
 free of the banditry and human rights abuses that have
 afflicted camps of the other two groups. The Sihanoukist
 National Army (ANS) has 11,000 to 14,000 armed soldiers.
 Systematic violations of human rights continued in Cambodia.
 The Vietnamese army continued forced labor work projects in
 support of combat operations in western Cambodia, although on
 a smaller scale than in previous years.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the'Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Reports of political killing in the Vietnamese-controlled
 areas of Cambodia have declined in recent years, but Khmer
 resistance groups and refugees at the border continue to
 report instances of Vietnamese and Heng Samrin officials
 killing suspects during interrogations. Death in captivity
 due to torture or other mistreatment by Vietnam/PRK security
 and military elements is common, according to the testimony of
 former prisoners.
 Accounts of killings by units of the KPNLF, which appear to
 have been more often associated with black market activities
 than with political motives, declined during 1988. There have
 been sporadic unconfirmed reports of executions by both KPNLF
 and ANS elements composed of persons suspected of being Heng
 Samrin agents.
 Civilians continued to be killed during attacks by the Khmer
 Rouge on lines of communication and other economic targets.
 Khmer Rouge radio frequently claimed credit for attacks on
 urban areas by agents who lob grenades at the "enemy" in movie
 theaters, markets, and other gatherings. It appears that an
 important aspect of Khmer Rouge strategy is to destroy through
 terror tactics any faith the people may have in the ability of
 the regime to protect them.
 NCR operations have not to date involved targets likely to
 cause civilian casualties, and the NCR groups claim that
 avoidance of civilian casualties is a high priority in their
 planning. There is no credible evidence that chemical or
 biological agents have been used in the conflict, despite
 vociferous accusations from both sides, and none of the
 parties to the conflict has yet targeted or attempted to
 blockade civilian food supplies or other necessities.
 The emphasis by the Khmer Rouge on the establishment of
 control over rural Cambodian villages (their "liberation")
 exposed increasing numbers of Cambodian civilians in 1988 to
 Khmer Rouge tactics which range from bribery through armed
 intimidation to the summary execution of village leaders and
 other representatives of the Phnom Penh regime. As in
 previous years, there are many reports to indicate that
 disobedience of the authorities in Khmer Rouge encampments
 often draws severe punishment, sometimes including execution.
 This is most often the case in the smaller, less accessible
 Khmer Rouge camps, but there were instances reported during
 1988 in the large, relatively open Khmer Rouge camp of Site 8
 as well. In one case, the circumstances strongly suggest that
 
 
 753
 CAMBODIA
 a Khmer Rouge soldier who had resisted returning to the front
 after visiting his wife in camp was summarily executed.
 Khmer Rouge defectors report that civilians and prisoners from
 Khmer Rouge jails have been killed by mines while performing
 forced labor, such as transporting supplies for guerrilla
 forces in Cambodia. Prisoners allege that some of these
 deaths are deliberate, with those accused of serious offenses
 sent to work in areas where the Khmer Rouge have planted
 landmines. One former prisoner of the Khmer Rouge said this
 punishment was called "being sent to cut a tree"--with the
 tree having mines planted around the base. Such deaths are
 described by Khmer Rouge authorities to outsiders as
 accidental. Attempts to flee Khmer Rouge-operated camps for
 those run by the NCR can also be dangerous, with the risk of
 being shot by Khmer Rouge guards.
 b. Disappearance
 There have been unconfirmed reports that Heng Samrin security
 officials are responsible for the disappearance of persons
 suspected of being opponents of the regime.
 c. Totture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Little new information on conditions in Cambodia emerged
 during the year. In past years, physical torture by the
 SRV/PRK authorities has been reported both from rural areas
 and from Phnom Penh prisons. There is a legal prohibition
 against torture, but there are no known cases of anyone being
 prosecuted under this law. According to reports gathered by
 Amnesty International (AI) in 1986, people suspected of being
 involved with the resistance run the highest risk of torture.
 This category is often defined by the authorities to include
 people alleged to have expressed opinions critical of the Heng
 Samrin regime's policies or the role of the Vietnamese, as
 well as those thought to be trying to leave or return from
 areas under the control of the resistance. Torture has been
 reported to take place throughout the country at facilities
 under the control of both the Ministry of Interior (and its
 subordinate civil police forces) and the armed forces,
 including jails run by the Ministry of Defense in Phnom Penh.
 Vietnamese "experts" are reported to have participated in or
 been present during torture at these r-nters, especially those
 at the provincial level and above. Such "experts" are also
 reported to have tortured political suspects in centers run
 exclusively by the Vietnamese military. These include jails,
 run by the propaganda and education brigades in the provinces
 and by the head offices of their corps of "experts" in Phnom
 Penh.
 According to AI, a variety of tortures are reported to have
 been inflicted on political suspects detained for
 interrogation. The most commonly cited are lengthy and
 repeated beatings and whippings. Detainees are said to have
 been punched and kicked on the body, head, and extremities;
 struck with pistol and rifle butts, truncheons, wooden staves
 with sharpened edges, and bamboo or iron bars; and whipped
 with electrical or steel cables, chains, rubber hoses, or wet
 gunny sacks. The victim may be tied during these assaults or
 blindfolded and hung upside down from the ceiling by ropes.
 There are credible reports that many other forms of torture
 are also used, including being buried alive, being burned with
 
 
 754
 CAMBODIA
 powdered limestone or heated instruments, and the insertion of
 nails through the thigh muscles to the bone.
 Both Al and the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights note that
 detainees undergoing interrogation in centers higher than the
 district level are generally held incommunicado in small and
 completely lightless solitary confinement cells that are
 poorly ventilated and unsanitary. They are constantly
 immobilized by shackles on both legs; sometimes they also are
 handcuffed. They are allowed no bedding or mosquito netting.
 Detainees whose ill-treatment during interrogation is being
 intensified are also deprived of food and water to undermine
 progressively their physical strength and resistance to
 illness. They may not bathe or go outside their cells to
 relieve themselves and are permitted no medication or medical
 attention.
 The aim of this cruel treatment is usually to compel detainees
 to confess to crimes and to inform on other suspects or on
 people considered opponents by the authorities. Although it
 is rarely reported that a suspect has been killed during the
 actual interrogation, there are frequent reports of detainees
 dying during the indefinite period of detention without charge
 or trial that usually follows interrogation. Such deaths
 reportedly occur even though the torture is over and
 conditions have improved. The causes appear to be a
 combination of internal injuries sustained during torture,
 unattended diseases contracted during or after torture, and
 inadequate diet. Suicides have also been reported, as well as
 cases of detainees having become insane after torture and
 ill-treatment.
 According to a prisoner who escaped the Battambang Provincial
 prison in 1987, new prisoners are immediately sent to the
 interrogation office. Interrogation lasts as long as
 necessary to obtain a confession and, according to this
 source, techniques include kicking and beating the prisoner
 with a stick, suffocating him by putting a plastic bag over
 his head, and the use of electric shock. He reported that
 prisoners occasionally died as'a result of the torture. After
 interrogation, a prisoner is normally transferred to a maximum
 security cell, usually for at least a year, until he is
 considered sufficiently reliable to be transferred to quarters
 with less stringent controls. Under maximum security,
 prisoners are stripped down nightly to their undershorts and
 their hands and legs shackled. Once prisoners are transferred
 to new quarters, they are assigned manual tasks either within
 the prison compound or in public areas near the prison.
 Another prisoner who escaped from prison in July 1988
 confirmed the same pattern of treatment. He was arrested by
 Heng Samrin authorities in Sisophon in 1986 on suspicion of
 involvement in resistance activities and transferred to the
 Battambang Provincial prison for interrogation. He reported
 that torture was a routine technique of interrogation. His
 interrogation consisted of hitting, kicking, and the use of
 electric shock to elicit a confession. He was later
 transferred to the political section of the T-3 prison in
 Phnom Penh, and subsequently to a provincial prison in Svey
 Rieng Province near the Vietnamese border, ftom which he was
 able to bribe his way out.
 
 
 755
 CAMBODIA
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Heng Samrin authorities often detain, interrogate, and
 jail resistance sympathizers for extended periods of time
 without formal charges. Indeed, this seems to be the rule
 rather than the exception. AI stated in 1987 that "analysis
 of all the available information indicates that prisons in the
 PRK have held several thousand political prisoners during
 recent years." This estimate does not include so-called
 "misled people restricted by the PRK for reeducation." Of the
 more than 400 political prisoners on which AI had compiled
 information by early 1987, almost half had been confined for
 at least 7 years. In April 1988, AI issued a report noting
 the public announcement of an additional 126 political arrests
 by PRK~authorities during the latter part of 1987, and the
 lack of any subsequent information on the fate of those
 arrested. An American citizen who was detained in 1987 after
 illegally entering Cambodia from Thailand was held for over a
 year without any indication of formal charges. It was more
 than 6 months following his arrest before the regime even
 admitted it was.holding him.
 Separate sections within the Heng Samrin police are
 responsible'for the investigation of activities by the
 non-Communist (KPNLF and ANS) and Communist Khmer Rouge
 resistance groups. The Ministry of Interior maintains at
 least three prisons in Cambodia in which suspected supporters
 of the resistance are held without formal charges. Provincial
 police and joint Vietnamese/Heng Samrin military internal
 security units maintain additional detention and interrogation
 centers. Regulations of the Heng Samrin regime call for the
 arrest and "reeducation" of "any person carrying out
 propaganda campaigns to sabotage internal unity and
 Kampuchea-Laos-Vietnam solidarity." Such "reeducation" means
 indefinite detention to force a change in political values.
 Combined with brutal treatment of suspected resistance
 collaborators, the Heng Samrin regime also operates an amnesty
 program for those resistance soldiers who voluntarily
 surrender with their weapons to the regime. According to an
 official of the program who defected in 1986, returnees are
 debriefed and returned to their home villages. Informers in
 the village then determine over a period of time whether the
 returnee is an authentic defector or still works for the
 resistance, in which case he would be rearrested. According
 to PRK Prime Minister Hun Sen, returnees are allowed to return
 to their home villages "after a short period of reeducation."
 Khmer at the border describe the standard period of returnee
 reeducation as 3 months, which is sometimes carried out in the
 returnee's home village. Considerable publicity is given to
 this program by the regime, which claims that large numbers of
 "misled" persons are continuously surrendering to PRK
 authorities, at least half of them with weapons.
 There is a virtual absence of legal process under the Heng
 Samrin regime for those detained. Detainees are almost never
 informed of the charges against them, nor are they given
 access to lawyers or informed of any rights or legal
 protections. There is no requirement that officials notify
 anyone of a prisoner's arrest, if they deem it is not in the
 interest of the investigation. According to AI, the same PRK
 authorities are responsible for arrests, interrogation,
 decisions on a subject's guilt or innocence, and prison
 administration.
 
 
 756
 CAMBODIA
 Since 1981 the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
 has sought permission from the Phnom Penh authorities without
 success to visit prisoners captured in combat. It has also
 had no success in persuading Thai authorities to allow it
 access to Vietnamese prisoners held in Thai prisons, nor in
 persuading the PRK authorities to allow it access to Thai
 prisoners reportedly held in Cambodian prisons. Nevertheless,
 the ICRC has pursued a program to disseminate information
 about the proper treatment of prisoners of war and the role
 the ICRC traditionally plays during conflicts.
 Neither of the NCR factions is known to hold prisoners of war
 or political prisoners. The KPNLF has a jail at its civilian
 camp at Site 2, which is used to house a small number of
 people accused of civil offenses in the camp, usually for
 relatively short periods of time, although at least one
 offender has been there for a year. Living conditions are the
 same as in the rest of the camp, and the prisoners regularly
 see their families and friends. There are no jails
 acknowledged at the ANS civilian camp at Site B, although
 there are rumors of one. A nearby ANS military facility is
 known to have a small detention facility. The ICRC has been
 allowed to visit both the KPNLF jail and the ANS facility.
 The Khmer Rouge are known to run several jails, apparently
 containing numerous prisoners at any given time. Most of
 these are offenders against the many strict Khmer Rouge rules,
 or camp residents who refuse to portage war supplies to the
 Khmer Rouge military in the interior, or residents who
 attempted to escape camp. Former prisoners have reported
 being allowed to use the toilet only once a day, having their
 legs shackled at night, being put to work cutting wood and
 clearing mines, and sometimes being intentionally ordered into
 minefields if their offenses were considered serious enough.
 The Khmer Rouge have allowed no outsiders to inspect their
 jails.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A 1982 law on court organization provides the right of counsel
 only with prior approval of the court. The 1981 Constitution
 provides for public trials but allows for closed sessions.
 Political prisoners under the Heng Samrin regime are regularly
 denied fair trials. Estimates of the number of political
 prisoners in Cambodia range from the hundreds to the
 thousands. Reliable figures are not available.
 The Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, as well as AI, also
 reported the existence of prisons run by what it termed the
 Vietnamese "special branch," such as the one designated 7708
 in Phnom Penh. This is in fact the designation of one of at
 least 20 propaganda/civic action units of the Vietnamese army
 which work with Heng Samrin authorities in each of the 4
 military "fronts" and special zones in Cambodia to maintain
 internal security. The Lawyers Committee estimated that
 political prisoners number in the thousands overall.
 The Heng Samrin regime has reestablished courts and begun to
 develop a legal system, though there have been fewer trials in
 recent years. However, trials are used primaiily for purposes
 of propaganda or public intimidation, with the verdict already
 decided. There are few procedural rights for defendants.
 According to a former prisoner who arrived at the Thai border
 
 
 CAMBODIA
 in 1986 and had gone through a Heng Samrin trial, defendants
 are required to memorize carefully and rehearse in advance all
 the questions and answers to be presented in court. Several
 police officials who had left the country and were interviewed
 by AI said that as of 1984 most cases were decided by the
 interrogators without reference to any tribunal. According to
 one source, important cases might be referred to the tribunal,
 but "the tribunal does not have the right to reject the
 judgment of the interrogators. It only pronounces the
 sentence." A prisoner who escaped in 1988 said that sometimes
 trials were held for detainees whom the interrogators had
 already decided to release. He also described the requirement
 to memorize carefully the proper.answers to the questions, and
 said that if these defendants satisfactorily recited their
 testimony as rehearsed, they were released. A former inmate
 of the Battambang prison reported that in April 1987, very few
 of the approximately 900 prisoners in the facility, most of
 whom were arrested by PRK authorities for alleged cooperation
 with the resistance, were incarcerated as a result of judicial
 proceedings, but rather because they confessed to their crimes
 under interrogation.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Cortespondence
 Heng Samrin authorities search whenever and wherever they
 wish. Networks of informers report to the secret police, and
 Vietnamese personnel are assigned to monitor all levels of the
 Heng Samrin internal security apparatus. Refugees arriving at
 the border in 1986 also reported the development of tightly
 controlled fortified villages in areas of resistance
 activity. Access to these villages is controlled by Heng
 Samrin or Vietnamese troops, and people are forcibly relocated
 into them to prevent contact with resistance forces.
 According to arrivals at the border in 1987, and to one
 Western journalist who accompanied guerrilla forces into
 Cambodia, almost all villages close to the Thai-Cambodian
 border in the northwest provinces have been relocated to the
 other side of a border security strip, especially those near
 known infiltration points. Heng Samrin authorities also began
 in 1986 to require that families in contested areas account
 for missing family members. Failure to explain adequately
 their absence results in the assumption that they are with the
 resistance and the relocation of the family to a fortified
 village. There are also numerous reports, confirmed by former
 PRK district officials, that the regime confiscates the
 majority of rice and other foodstuffs from villagers in an
 effort to prevent cooperation with the resistance.
 In most of their camps along the border, the Khmer Rouge
 maintain strict control on the social activity of those under
 their control. In camps with little access by outsiders (all
 except Site 8), rules appear to differ little from those under
 the Pol Pot regime of 1975-78. For instance, the Khmer Rouge
 punish people who marry without permission, have unauthorized
 contacts with foreigners, or listen to unauthorized radio
 broadcasts. Relief workers who visit these camps report that
 people require permission to come to the health clinics run by
 voluntary agencies near the camps. Permission is also
 required, and virtually never given, for the medical
 evacuation of seriously ill or injured patients to the ICRC's
 surgical facility at Khao I Dang. In several cases during
 1988, it was quite likely that the refusal of Khmer Rouge
 authorities to allow such transfers resulted in the deaths of
 the patients concerned.
 
 
 758
 CAMBODIA
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 In Heng Samrin areas, the press and radio are wholly
 controlled by the regime. Criticism of the regime is not
 tolerated, nor are foreign books and periodicals permitted,
 except those officially distributed. There have been reports
 of arrests for listening to foreign radio broadcasts. A
 similar situation exists in the Khmer Rouge camps. The
 non-Communist groups do not have similar restrictions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The only associations permitted by the Heng Samrin regime are
 those created to support the regime, such as those for
 farmers, women, and youth, which are usually headed by ranking
 party or government officials.
 For a discussion of'freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Heng Samrin regime has permitted the return of religious
 practices, but has not reinstated Buddhism as a state
 religion, nor does it actively encourage it. In general, the
 Heng Samrin authorities attempt to use Buddhism as one of a
 number of organizations for "mass mobilization" to implement
 party policies. The number of Buddhist temples (wats) is far
 fewer today than before 1970, and there are generally only two
 to four monks per wat, again far fewer than before the war.
 It is forbidden for men under 50 years of age to be ordained.
 Religious affairs are overseen by the National United Front
 for Construction and Defense, the same government agency that
 seeks to organize women, youth, workers, and religious groups
 to support the State. Communities that wish to construct a
 wat must apply to the local Front committee for permission.
 Christian groups are harassed by the Heng Samrin regime. The
 Protestant and Roman Catholic communities in Phnom Penh
 reportedly are not authorized to meet. Muslims, most of whom
 are ethnic Chams rather than Khmer, have been encouraged by
 the Heng Samrin regime to renew their religious community, and
 at least one senior member of the PRK leadership is Muslim.
 When in power in Phnom Penh, the Khmer Rouge disestablished
 Buddhism as the state religion. Since being driven from
 power, the Khmer Rouge have tried to give the impression of
 reform. This is most noticeable in the large Khmer Rouge
 civilian camp at Site 8, which has been accessible to
 international organizations and relief workers since it was
 established as an evacuation site in 1985 for people fleeing
 the Vietnamese offensive that year. A temple and monks are
 available in the camp, which functions as a showpiece for the
 Khmer Rouge. However, defectors from other Khmer Rouge camps,
 and those relief workers occasionally allowed into those
 camps, report that Buddhism is still discouraged by Khmer
 Rouge authorities outside of Site 8. Christianity and Islam
 were even more ruthlessly suppressed by the Khmer Rouge when
 they controlled the country and are not known to have been
 revived in Khmer Rouge-controlled areas.
 
 
 CAMBODIA
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Heng Samrin regime tries to control tightly all travel
 within the areas under its control. A system of neighborhood
 surveillance, modeled after the Vietnamese system, was
 introduced in 1981. A system requiring family registration
 and identification books was begun in 1980, and in 1983 the
 registration effort was placed under the police in each local
 administrative unit. Complex regulations govern movement of
 families and individuals within Cambodia. Passes are required
 for internal movement between villages. Checkpoints are
 ubiquitous, and bribes as well as passes are required to pass
 them, although checkpoiits can often be dodged by avoiding
 roads. Permission from the authorities is required to travel
 abroad; and it is rarely granted except for those on official
 government business. Other Khmer seeking to leave the country
 flee to the Thai border in order to escape the conflict or in
 the hope they can enter U.N.-supported refugee camps in
 Thailand. The Heng Samrin regime routinely imprisons those
 caught attempting to flee, as well as those believed to be
 returning from border encampments affiliated with the CGDK.
 The Heng Samrin regime has agreed in principle to accept
 returning displaced persons from camps in Thailand, but has
 taken only one elderly woman so far because it has put off
 reaching an agreement with the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on the mechanics of
 repatriation. In August 1988, the UNHCR announced that it
 would repatriate 14 Khmer with the cooperation of the Heng
 Samrin Government, but this has not yet materialized. Most of
 the Khmer allowed refugee status in Thailand have been
 approved for resettlement and departed for Western countries.
 Over 20,000 Khmer approved for refugee status remain at the
 Khao-I-Dang holding center in Thailand. Another 300,000 Khmer
 who have not been accorded refugee status in Thailand remain
 as displaced persons in camps on Thai territory near the
 border.
 The Khmer Rouge also tightly control movement within their
 zone and determine whether non-Communist forces will be
 permitted to operate in, or cross, what they consider their
 "liberated areas" in Cambodia. In 1988 they began what
 appears to be an effort to close areas under their control to
 NCR forces. The civilian population in Khmer Rouge border
 camps is not allowed to leave the camps. Those attempting to
 escape to Cambodia or to an NCR camp run the risk of being
 shot by Khmer Rouge soldiers outside the camps. The Khmer
 Rouge also limit access by international organizations and
 voluntary agency personnel to monitor conditions in camps
 under their control in Thailand. Negotiations by the U.N. and
 the ICRC for more extensive monitoring continue. However,
 most of the civilian population in one Khmer Rouge camp (Ta
 Luan), to which the U.N. had access, were moved closer to the
 border and out of reach of outsiders in 1988. The population
 of another Khmer Rouge camp (Huay Chan), to which the U.N. had
 suspended assistance, was moved closer to the border as well.
 There are indications that these moves may be only interim
 steps to the Khmer Rouge objective of transferring its captive
 population back into Cambodia to avoid international
 monitoring and pressure to cease their human rights abuses
 against these people.
 Freedom of movement is less restricted in the non-Communist
 camps, although still difficult. Those residents wishing to
 move to a camp controlled by a different faction must obtain
 
 
 760
 CAMBODIA
 the permission of the camp leadership or attempt to move on
 their own. Military force is not deployed to stop them,
 although bandits, mines, and other hazards make such efforts
 dangerous. International organizations and voluntary agencies
 have good access to NCR-affiliated camps in Thailand.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Khmer people do not enjoy the fundamental right of
 self-determination. The KPRP, a party which acknowledges a
 serious shortage of members, controls political life in areas
 controlled by the Heng Samrin regime. Major policies are
 approved by Vietnam, and many day-to-day administrative
 decisions, especially in internal security matters, are made
 unilaterally by Vietnamese officials.
 Political aspirants in Heng Samrin areas must study the
 current political dogma, which centers on acceptance of the
 Vietnamese explanation for Hanoi's dominant position in
 Cambodia. Middle- and high-level Heng Samrin officials must
 attend political schools in Phnom Penh and in Vietnam.
 Relatively few Heng Samrin officials are considered reliable
 by the Vietnamese. The highest positions of trust are given
 to Khmer loyal to Hanoi prior to 1975, followed by pre-1978
 defectors from the Khmer Rouge, other former Khmer Rouge
 cadre, nonpolitical "intellectuals" (including many pre-1975
 schoolteachers), and low-ranking officials of pre-1975
 governments, in that order. While attempting to build an
 indigenous Communist party and government structure in
 Cambodia, Vietnam itself maintains considerable control.
 Elections in Heng Samrin areas do not allow genuine political
 participation, but rather are staged by the regime to attempt
 to demonstrate legitimacy and to underscore the relative
 status of leaders by varying reported percentages of the
 "vote." Although National Assembly members are supposed to
 serve terms of 4 years (the second round of elections should
 have been held in 1986), no elections have been held since
 1982. Instead, the existing National Assembly was extended
 for another 4-year term. The 15th session of the first PRK
 National Assembly was held in June 1988.
 The Khmer Rouge Communist Party of Kampuchea was ostensibly
 dissolved in December 1981, but is widely thought to continue
 to exist in areas controlled by the Khmer Rouge. The party,
 in which power is concentrated in the hands of fewer than 10
 people, controls all political, economic, and military life in
 those areas. No opposition is possible. Although Pol Pot
 purportedly "retired" in 1985, and assumed an advisory
 position on national security, defectors from the Khmer Rouge
 report that power continues to be held by the pre-1979
 leadership, and Pol Pot himself is reported to be the most
 powerful military commander of the Khmer Rouge and the de
 facto commander-in-chief.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Human rights violations in Cambodia have been the subject of
 intense international attention since 1978, when the United
 Nations Human Rights Commission and its subcommission on the
 Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities
 began investigating the problem. In February 1988, the
 Commission adopted the latest in a series of resolutions on
 
 
 761
 CAMBODIA
 Cambodia, reiterating its condemnation of persistent
 violations of human rights in Cambodia and reaffirming that
 the continuing occupation of Cambodia by foreign forces
 deprives the people of Cambodia of their right to
 self-determination. Authorities in the areas controlled by
 the Heng Samrin and Khmer Rouge have not permitted
 investigation of charges of human rights violations. Requests
 by the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights and AI to visit
 areas controlled by the Heng Samrin regime have elicited no
 response from Phnom Penh authorities. Persistent requests by
 the ICRC to visit prisoners of war, or any other prisoners
 under PRK control, have never been granted. The Heng Samrin
 regime and the Khmer Rouge areas have local Red Cross
 organizations, but neither they nor any other groups in those
 areas have a role in the protection of human rights.
 The Lawyers Committee did visit the Thai-Cambodian border
 region and published a report on the human rights situation
 there in early 1987. The report was critical of human rights
 abuses committed by the Khmer Rouge, bandits who had deserted
 from the KPNLF, and some active duty KPNLF troops against
 Cambodian refugees in Thailand. During 1988, in response to
 international pressure, the KPNLF removed some of the military
 leaders who were the worst human rights violators, and the
 Thai reorganized their military commands responsible for
 guarding the civilian camps, with the result that the
 incidence of violence and human rights abuses declined
 considerably. Unlike most of the Khmer Rouge camps, the
 non-Communist camps along the Thai-Cambodian border have a
 substantial daytime presence of voluntary and international
 organization staff who have intervened to secure better
 treatment of minorities, such as Vietnamese refugees among the
 Khmer.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Directives issued by the Heng Samrin regime in 1982 seemed to
 accord a privileged status to Vietnamese immigrants vis-a-vis
 Khmer residents, and there have been reports of Vietnamese
 taking advantage of their privileged status to force Khmer out
 of desirable occupations or land. Khmer arriving on the
 .border in 1988 frequently reported that Vietnamese in the
 cities continued to supplant Khmer merchants, and this
 privileged status appeared to be backed by the Phnom Penh
 authorities. However, matching the apparent decline of
 discrimination against ethnic Chinese in neighboring Vietnam,
 there were few reports in 1988 of PRK policies or actions that
 affected Chinese unfairly. Reports from border travelers
 indicate that many Vietnamese have moved into Cambodia to join
 other returning residents who had been expelled during the
 Khmer Republic or Khmer Rouge periods. Most are traders or
 fishermen, but a large group of Vietnamese farmers have
 settled on rich marshland in Takeo Province.
 There is no specific information available on discrimination
 of other types.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Organized labor is totally under the regime's control, and
 industries have organized branches of the official "Trade
 Union for National Salvation." Workers have no right to
 
 
 762
 CAMBODIA
 establish and join organizations of their own choosing. The
 "Kampuchean Federation of Trade Unions" is an official mass
 organization headed by Communist Party politburo member Mat
 Ly. As an indication of the role assigned organized labor by
 the regime, Phnom Penh radio reported that Mat Ly's speech at
 an October 1988 trade union congress in Phnom Penh "expressed
 satisfaction with the development, both in quantity and
 quality, of the trade union organization, which has spread
 throughout the country rallying all Cambodian workers around
 the KPRP to achieve all the tasks assigned by the party and
 State."
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Collective bargaining is unheard of. There are no economic
 incentive zones or special industries where labor standards
 differ from those elsewhere in the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor by the PRK regime and directly by the Vietnamese
 is common, although it is not primarily used as a sanction or
 a means of racial, social, or other discrimination. Although
 the use of forced labor appeared to decrease in 1988, the
 regime still conscripted thousands of laborers to construct
 infiltration obstacles, clear brush, and build roads. The
 laborers suffered frequent loss of life from mines, malaria,
 and other diseases in the remote border areas. Their forced
 participation placed their lives at risk when Vietnamese or
 resistance military actions occurred nearby. Many observers
 also believe the vast numbers of forced laborers sent to the
 malarial regions near the border over the past 3 years were
 responsible for the serious increase of malaria in the central
 regions of Cambodia where it had previously been rare. The
 decrease in the number of forced laborers during 1988 appeared
 to result from the completion of much of the system of border
 obstacles, or the decision to suspend work on the remainder.
 The Khmer Rouge also require labor from all persons under
 their control. Khmer Rouge civilian defectors continued to
 report in 1988 that they were forced to carry supplies and
 ammunition into the interior of Cambodia in support of
 military operations, saying they were punished if they failed
 to comply.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 There is no known minimum age for the employment of children.
 Children are regularly employed as soon as they are physically
 able to perform the tasks required, either in agriculture or
 industry.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 No attention appears to have been given by authorities to
 ensure acceptable conditions of work, and there is little
 information on this subject. Wage scales for the few
 industrial and government workers are set by the State and are
 universally regarded as insufficient, forcing employees to
 supplement their wages in some other manner.

 EDITORIAL NOTE
 
 This volume continues the series first published in a reprinted
 edition in 1982 and containing Country Reports on Human Rights
 Practices from -1977 through 1980 (except 1978 when no such report
 was prepared), and the less regular Reports on Human Rights Prac-
 tices in Countries Receiving United States Aid for 1976 and 1978.
 The practice of the Department of State to submit to Congress the
 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices on an annual basis has
 continued through the 1980s and into the 1990s. This does not seem
 to be the case with the Reports on Human Rights in Countries
 Receiving United States Aid. The last of these reports was submitted
 by the Department of State to Congress in 1979.
 This reprint series continues to publish these reports for the later
 years as they become available.
