 INDIA
 India is a longstanding parliamentary democracy with a bicameral parliament.
 Prime Minister I.K. Gujral, whose Janata Dal Party was part of the 16-party United
 Front (UF) coalition, took office in April and heads the Government. President R.K.
 Narayanan, who was elected by an electoral college made up of Members of Par-
 
 
 1637
 liament and members of state assemblies, is Head of State and also has special
 emergency powers. President Narayanan dissolved the lower house of Parliament on
 December 4. Elections are scheduled for February and March 1998. The judiciary
 is independent.
 Although the 25 state governments have primary responsibility for maintaining
 law and order, the central Government provides guidance and support through use
 of paramilitary forces throughout the country. The Union Ministry for Home Affairs
 controls most of the paramilitary forces, the internal intelligence bureaus, and the
 nationwide police service; it provides training for senior police officers for the state-
 organized police forces. The armed forces are under civilian control. Security forces
 committed significant human rights abuses, particularly in Jammu and Kashmir
 and in the northeastern states.
 India is in a transition from a government-controlled economy to one that is large-
 ly market-oriented. The private sector is predominant in agriculture, most non-
 financial services, consumer goods manufacturing, and some heavy industry. Eco-
 nomic liberalization and structural reforms begun in 1991 continue, although mo-
 mentum has slowed. The country's economic problems are compounded by rapid
 population growth of 1.7 percent per year with a current total above 950 million.
 Income distribution remained very unequal. Forty percent of the urban population
 and half the rural population live below the poverty level.
 There continued to be significant human rights abuses, despite extensive constitu-
 tional and statutory safeguards. Many of these abuses are generated by intense so-
 cial tensions, violent secessionist movements and the authorities' attempts to re-
 press them, and deficient police methods and training. These problems are acute in
 Jammu and Kashmir, where the judicial system has been disrupted by terrorist
 threats, by judicial tolerance of the Government's heavy handed antimilitant tactics,
 and by the refusal of security forces to obey court orders. Separatist insurgent vio-
 lence in the northeastern states increased, along with reported incidents of security
 force abuses.
 Serious human rights abuses include: Extrajudicial executions and other political
 killings and excessive use of force by security forces combating active insurgencies
 in Jammu and Kashmir and several northeastern states; torture and rape by police
 and other agents of government, and deaths of suspects in police custody throughout
 the country; poor prison conditions; arbitrary arrest and incommunicado detention
 in Jammu and Kashmir and the Northeast; continued detention throughout the
 country of thousands arrested under special security legislation; lengthy pretrial de-
 tention; prolonged detention while under trial; legal and societal discrimination
 against women; extensive societal violence against women; female bondage and
 prostitution; discrimination and violence against indigdnous people and scheduled
 castes and tribes; widespread intercaste and communal violence; child prostitution,
 trafficking, and infanticide; and widespread exploitation of indentured, bonded, and
 child labor.
 During 1997 India made further progress in resolving human rights problems. In
 Punjab serious abuses of the early 1990's were acknowledged and condemned by the
 Supreme Court. The Supreme Court's investigation of serious abuses in the Punjab
 in the early 1990's continues. Continuing International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICRC) prison visits in Jammu and Kashmir demonstrated some government trans-
 parency on human rights problems. However, researchers for international human
 rights organizations like Amnesty International (Al) and Human Rights Watch
 (HRW) were not permitted to visit Jammu and Kashmir or the northeast. The Gov-
 ernment's signing of the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other
 Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment was welcomed by human
 rights activists. However, its decision not to accept Articles 20, 21, and 22 of the
 Convention means effectively that the U.N. Human Rights Commission will not be
 able to investigate allegations of torture in India. However, insurgency-related
 deaths were slightly higher than last year, due largely to an increase in violent en-
 counters in the Northeast. The proportion of civilian deaths increased slightly ap-
 parently due to militant efforts to disrupt the newly elected government in Jammu
 and Kashmir.
 Separatist militants were responsible for numerous, serious abuses, including
 extrajudicial executions and other political killings, torture, and brutality. Separat-
 ist militants were also responsible for kidnaping and extortion in Jammu and Kash-
 mir and northeast India.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Political killings by government
 forces (including deaths in custody and faked encounter killings), progovernment
 countermilitants, and insurgents continued at a high level in the state of Jammu
 and Kashmir and the seven northeastern states, where separatist insurgencies con-
 tinued. Security forces offered bounties for wanted militants brought in dead or
 alive.
 Security forces committed an estimated 100-200 extrajudicial killings of suspected
 militants in Jammu and Kashmir. Although well-documented evidence to corrobo-
 rate cases and quantify trends is lacking, most observers believe that the number
 of killings attributed to regular Indian forces declined slightly from the previous
 year. According to press reports and anecdotal accounts, those killed typically had
 been detained by security forces, and their bodies, bearing multiple bullet wounds
 and often marks of torture, were returned to relatives or were otherwise discovered
 the same day or a few days later. In early March, for example, three leaders of the
 Hizbul Mujahadin militant group were arrested in Srinigar by the Special Oper-
 ations Group of Jammu and Kashmir state police; they were later found dead. Al-
 though the arrest took place in the presence of eyewitnesses, police claimed that the
 killings occurred in an armed encounter. Nongovernmental organizations (NGO's)
 active in Jammu and Kashmir reported that the bodies of two youths taken into
 custody by the Special Operations Group on March 22 were found shortly thereafter
 in Bemina; the bodies bore the marks of torture and bullet wounds. On June 5, the
 bodies of three young men arrested by soldiers in Chanpora were later found
 dumped in a nearby village; in this case too, their bodies bore the marks of torture.
 Security forces claim that these killings, when acknowledged at all, occur in armed
 encounters with militants. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has di-
 rected that all deaths in encounters be immediately investigated by an independent
 agency, but members of the security forces are rarely held accountable for these
 killings. The NHRC itself may inquire into alleged human rights abuses by security
 forces in Jammu and Kashmir, but does not have the statutory power to investigate
 such allegations if it is not satisfied with the responses to its inquiries. Authorities
 have generally not reported so-called encounter deaths occurring in Jammu and
 Kashmir to the NHRC.
 Security forces also held persons in incommunicado detention; on occasion, as in
 the 1996 case of human rights activist Jalil Andrabi, such missing persons were
 later found dead (see Section 1.b.).
 Impunity has been and remains a serious problem in Jammu and Kashmir. Secu-
 rity forces have committed thousands of serious human rights violations over the
 course of the conflict, including extrajudicial killings, disappearances, and torture.
 Yet, during the period January 1, 1990 to June 30, 1997, only ten members of the
 security forces were tried and sentenced to 10 or more years imprisonment for viola-
 tions of human rights in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab (separate figures for
 Jammu and Kashmir are not available.) An additional fourteen received sentences
 of between 1 and 10 years, and 73 received sentences of less than 1 year. During
 the same period, 42 members of the security forces were dismissed or compulsorily
 retired and 20 were reduced in rank or seniority following conviction on charges of
 human rights violations. Seventy-one members of the security forces who are alleged
 to have committed human rights violations are currently under investigation, ac-
 cording to the Ministry of Home Affairs. Scrutiny by the NHRC and international
 human rights organizations, when permitted, and the persistence of individual mag-
 istrates have resulted in greater accountability of the security forces in Jammu and
 Kashmir over the years. However, the vast majority of violations by security forces
 have gone and continue to go uninvestigated and unpunished.
 There were many allegations that military and paramilitary forces in the north-
 east engage in arbitrary detention, abduction, torture, and extrajudicial execution
 of militants, as well as rape (see Sections 1.c. and 1.g.). The Armed Forces Special
 Powers Act of 1958 and the Disturbed Areas Act remained in effect in several
 states, i.e., in Jammu and Kashmir, Nagaland, Manipur, Assam and parts of
 Tripura. Human rights activists remain concerned about the reports of deaths that
 are described as having occurred during "encounters" between insurgent groups and
 security forces. Several activists allege that the "encounters" are staged and that
 those insurgents reported dead were killed after beingdetained by security forces.
 In March an Amnesty International report concluded tat the pattern of killings in
 the Northeast point to an official policy sanctioning extrajudicial killing. It noted
 that "a pattern of apparently unlawful killings of suspected members of armed oppo-
 sition groups (in Manipur) has resulted from the systemic use of lethal force as an
 
 
 1639
 alternative to arrest by the security forces." The report, Official Sanction for Killings
 in Manipur, cited the following examples of killings carried out with impunity by
 police and security forces inManipur: the killing of Mayanglambam Ibotombi and
 ondam Muhindro, two forest officers, on 26 December 1996; the killing of Ms.
 Kehtrumayum Ongbi Prabhahmi Devi and injury to her daughter on 3 May 1996;
 the killing of Ms. Oinam Ongbi Amina Devi and injury to herbaby on 5 April 1996;
 the killing of Netaji on 28 February 1996; and the killingof nine civilians at the
 regional medical college hospital in the state capital, Imphal, on 7 January 1995.
 However, precise information on human rights violations in this relatively remote
 region is rare.
 Throughout the country, numerous accused criminals continue to be killed in en-
 counters with police. In March police shot and killed two businessmen and another
 individual in downtown New Delhi after mistakenly identifying the unarmed busi-
 nessmen as wanted criminals. The Delhi Police Commissioner was transferred and
 the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is pursuing murder charges against 10
 police officers involved in the incident. The most recent statistics, for 1995, show
 that 525 civilians and 159 police died in exchanges of gunfire involving police.
 While extrajudicial killings continued in areas buffeted by separatist insurgencies,
 the press and judiciary continued to give attention to deaths in police custody and
 faked encounter killings elsewhere. According to NHRC statistics, 201 persons died
 in police custody in 1996. Many such persons were tortured (see Section 1.c.). The
 NHRC has focused on torture and deaths in custody. It has directed district mag-
 istrates to report all deaths in police and judicial custody and stated that failure
 to do so would be interpreted as an attempted coverup. Magistrates appear to be
 complying with this directive. However, the NHRC has no authority directly to in-
 vestigate abuses by the security forces, and security forces are therefore not re-
 _quired to-and do not-report custodial deaths in Jammu and Kashmir or the
 Northeast. In early March, two former Ahmedabad officials, including a district su-
 perintendent of police, received unprecedented life sentences for their involvement
 in a June 1996 custodial death incident. Four New Delhi policemen were suspended
 and face charges of negligence in connection with the death of an inmate in Tilak
 Nagar Police Station on April 23. In December 1996, the Supreme Court placed
 tiglhter controls on arrest and interrogation procedures. According to NHRC report-
 ing, more than 700 persons died in prison between April 1996 and March 1997,
 many from natural causes, in some case aggravated by poor prison conditions (see
 Section 1.e.).
 Killings  and  abductions of suspected   militants  and  other persons by
 progovernment countermilitants continued as a significant pattern in Jammu and
 3as mir. Countermilitants are former separatist militants who have surrendered to
 government forces but have retained their arms and paramilitary organization. Al-
 though precise numbers are unavailable, progovernment countermilitants may have
 committed 100 to 200 extrajudicial killings in Jammu and Kashmir during of the
 year. Human rights groups believed that the number was slightly lower than in
 1996. Government agencies fund, exchange intelligence with, and direct operations
 of countermilitants as p art of the counterinsurgency effort. Countermilitants are
 known to screen passersby at roadblocks and guard extensive areas of the Kashmir
 Valley from attacks by militants. In sponsoring and condoning countermilitant activ-
 ity, which takes place outside the legal system, the Government cannot avoid re-
 sponsibility for killings, abductions, and other abuses committed by these irregulars.
 Perhaps as many as 3,000 continue to operate in Jammu and Kashmir, particularly
 in the countryside outside major towns. During the year, the Government took
 steps to organize kashmiri counter-militants as a battalion in the paramilitary
 forces as a means of bringing them under enhanced control and military discipline.
 Extensive, complex patterns of violence continued in the seven states of north-
 eastern India. The main insurgent groups in the northeast include two factions of
 the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN) in Nagaland; Meitei extremists
 in Manipur, the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) and the Bodo Security
 Force in Assam; and the all Tripura Tiger Force (ATTF) and the National Liberation
 Front of Tripura (NLFT) in Tripura. The proclaimed object of many of these groups
 is to break out of the Indian union, creating new, independent nations. Their stated
 grievances against the Indian Government range from charges of neglect and indif-
 ference to the endemic poverty of the region, to allegations of active discrimination
 against the tribal and non-tribal peoples of the region by the center. The oldest of
 these conflicts, involving the Nagas, started with India's independence in 1947. On
 August 1, a ceasefire between the Government and the ISAC-Muivah faction of the
 NSCN went into effect and has been largely observed by the Government and all
 insurgent groups in the state. However, factional feuds among rival Naga insurgent
 groups claimed an estimated 120 lives during the first 3 months of the ceasefire.
 
 
 1640
 The Government extended the ceasefire for another 3 months on November 1, uni-
 laterally including even those armed groups in Nagaland which had not been party
 to the original ceasefire.
 According to the Union Home Ministry, 918 civilians, 189 members of the security
 forces, and 1,114 militants were killed in Jammu and Kashmir during the period
 January I to December 15. In 1996 the totals were 1,214 civilians, 94 security force
 personnel and 1,271 militants, according to reliable press reports. NGO and other
 sources agree that civilian deaths attributed to security forces have decreased. Press
 reports indicate that the increase in civilian deaths is attributable to militant efforts
 to disrupt the new government.
 Since 1980 clashes between police and Naxalite Maoist revolutionaries of the Peo-
 ples' War Group (PWG) have taken place in northwestern Andhra Pradesh. Over
 the past few years, hundreds of policemen and suspected Naxalites have been killed,
 according to press reports and human rights organization. As of September police
 had killed 102 Naxalites in approximately 80 "encounters." Seventeen years of guer-
 rilla-style conflict have led to serious human rights abuses by both sides. Human
 rights groups allege that "encounters" are usually faked by the police to cover up
 the torture and subsequent murder of Naxalite suspects, sympat izers, or inform-
 ers. These groups cite as evidence the refusal of police to handover corpses of sus-
 pects killed in encounters," which are often cremated before families can view the
 odies. Villagers in PWG-dominated areas complain of regular harassment and arbi-
 trary detention by police. Police officials are rarely if ever held accountable for
 human rights abuses.
 The Disturbed Areas Act has been in force in a number of districts in Andhra
 Pradesh for more than a year. It gives police extraordinary powers of arrest and de-
 tention. Human rights groups allege that security forces have been able to operate
 with virtual impunity in parts of Andhra Pradesh under the act. They further allege
 that Andhra police have contributed to the establishment of an armed vigilante
 group known as the "Green Tigers," whose mission is to combat Naxalite groups in
 the state. The NHRC is investigating some 285 reported cases so-called "fake en-
 counter deaths" allegedly committed by the Andhra police in connection with anti-
 Naxalite operations. Amnesty International reported that T. Puroshotham, joint sec-
 retary of the Andhra Pradesh Civil Liberties Committee and a lawyer, was attacked
 and beaten on May 27 by persons he believed to have been plain-clothes police. The
 Green Tigers group claimed responsibility for this attack a few days later. Amnesty
 also reported that on April 6, Gadder, who had been campaigning against the police
 practice of cremating as "unidentified" the bodies of suspected Naxalites killed in
 'encounters" with police, was shot five times at his home in Andhra Pradesh. Again
 the Green Tigers claimed responsibility for this attack, alleging that Gadder and
 APCLC activists were "Naxalite sympathizers."
 As of September, Naxalites had killed 44 police personnel and 202 civilians.
 Naxalites killed two senior BJP party workers in September, and some politicians
 have given up campaigning in Naxalite areas because of the security threat. On No-
 vember 17, about 150 armed members of the Maoist Communist Center (MCC) over-
 powered Bihar military police (BMP) patrolling a cattle fair, killing three BMP
 members and one assistant sub-inspector of police. On March 2, suspected Naxalites
 shot dead a ruling Telegu Desam party leader, Bhimreedy Mohan Reddy, outside
 his residence in Chautuppal in Nalgonda district, Andhra Pradesh. In areas under
 their control, Naxalites dispense summary justice in "people's courts" which in some
 cases condemn to death suspected police informers, village headmen, and others
 deemed to be "class enemies" or "caste oppressors." The Naxalites extort money
 from business firms, and railway services in one area had to be canceled in July
 and August due to PWG destruction of stations, track and signaling equipment. The
 MCC and the CPI(M-L) Party Unity and Liberation factions are essentilly engaged
 in caste warfare. Their victims, in addition to police and local government officials,
 include suspected police informers, village headmen, and landlords whom they ac-
 cuse of oppressing scheduled caste members.
 Insurgency and increased ethnic violence took a heavy toll in the northeast and
 in the case of Assam, led to the installation of a "unified command" of civilian, mili-
 tary and paramilitary forces in the state.
 While there were numerous allegations of human rights violations directed
 against security forces, public attention began to focus on the actions of insurgents.
 The kidnaping of NGO environmental activist Sanjay Ghosh in July and his death
 at the hands of his United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) captors led to wide
 public criticism. On August 6, the ULFA confirmed that Ghosh died in captivity; he
 had been "arrested and tried" by the ULFA on July 4. The Chief Minister of Assam
 and a High Court judge in Meghalaya survived attempts to kill them during the
 year. According to the Union Home Ministry's 1996-97 report, a total of 201 persons
 
 
 1641
 were killed in Assam between April 1996 and March 1997. The ULFA was respon-
 sible for 107 deaths, and the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) was
 responsible for 174 deaths during this period. However, Mass, a human rights orga-
 nization in Assam with a credible record, claims that during the period January 1
 through July 21, a total of 202 people were killed in the state (of which 68 died at
 the hands of security forces and 57 were killed by the ULFA). Compilation of reports
 of killings from the press suggests that the numbers may be even higher. On March
 15, ULFA insurgents shot and killed an army lieutenant colonel and wounded his
 wife at a temple in Tezpur, Assam. Members of the same rup killed an army brig-
 adier and colonel on August 8 in Guwahati in front of the brigadier's teenage daugh-
 ters.
 On November 19, an independent commission of inquiry set up by Parliament in
 August 1991 to investigate the May 21, 1991 assassination of former prime minister
 Rajiv Gandhi tabled an interim report of its findings in the Lok Sabha. The report
 pointed clearly to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) as having been re-
 sponsible for the assassination, but was inconclusive on the question of whether the
 LTiE had received assistance in carrying out the murder. It criticized the then-In-
 dian government for an alleged failure to provide comprehensive security for the
 former prime minister. The commission is expected to conclude its work in February
 1998.
 b. Disappearance.-According to human rights groups, unacknowledged, incommu-
 nicado detention of suspected militants continued in Jammu and Kashmir although
 the practice again decreased compared with previous years. Between January and
 June, 197 new writs of habeas corpus were filed with the Jammu and Kashmir High
 Court and the Supreme Court, most by family members of disappeared persons in
 Jammu and Kashmir. The Government acknowledges that, as of August, it held
 about 1,600 persons in connection with the insurgency in 5 detention centers in
 Jammu and Kashmir, compared with 2,070 persons acknowledged held in 1995. Of
 these 1,298 were held under the Public Safety Act and 772 under other laws, includ-
 ing the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Act (TADA). The Government acknowl-
 edged holding 112 persons in the northeast at year's end under special security acts.
 Although the Government allowed the TADA to lapse in 1995, several hundred per-
 sons remained in detention awaiting prosecution under the law. Several thousand
 others are held in short-term confinement in transit and interrogation centers.
 Human rights groups maintain that as many as 3,000 more are held by the mili-
 tary and paramilitary forces in long-term unacknowledged detention in interroga-
 tion centers and transit camps in Jammu and Kashmir and in the Northeast nomi-
 nally intended for only short-term confinement. Jammu and Kashmir courts cur-
 rently have a backlog of more than 600 pending habeas corpus cases filed by family
 members of those who are missing, according to credible human rights groups. The
 U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture reported that more than 15,000 habeas corpus
 petitions have been filed in India since 1990, "but that in the vast majority of these
 cases the authorities had not responded to the petitions." In one prominent case in
 Jammu and Kashmir, the Government responded to the U.N. Special Rapporteur on
 Extrajudicial, Summary, or Arbitrary Executions stating that human rights activist
 Jalil Andrabi was not arrested by security forces, as alleged by human rights
 groups, but was abducted by "unidentified armed persons." Andrabi was last seen
 alive in the presence of countermilitants and members of the security forces on
 March 8, 1996 in Srinagar. Despite the Government's statement, the army in Feb-
 ruary 1996 identified to a Srinagar court a major with a temporary commission as
 the individual primarily responsible for Andrabi's death. Andrabi's body was
 dumped in the Jhelum River, allegedly by security forces. His case is also the sub-
 ject of inquiry by the NHRC, and there were no significant developments in the case
 by years end.
 The Government maintains that screening committees run by the state govern-
 ment provide information about detainees to their families. However, other sources
 indicate that families are able to confirm the detention of their relatives only by
 bribing prison guards. A program of prison visits by the ICRC, which began in Octo-
 ber 1995, is designed in part to help assure communications between detainees and
 their families. Between July 1996 and April 1997, the ICRC visited 3,249 detainees
 in Jammu and Kashmir. All acknowledged detention centers in Jammu and Kash-
 mir and Kashmiri detainees elsewhere in the country have been visited. The ICRC
 is not authorized access to interrogation centers or transit centers, nor does it have
 access to regular detention centers in the Northeast.
 In Punjab the pattern of disappearances prevalent in the early 1990's appears to
 be at an end. Hundreds of police and security officials have not been held account-
 able for serious human rights abuses committed during the counterinsurgency of
 1984-94. However, steps have been taken against a few such violators. The CBI ac-
 
 
 1642
 tively is pursuing charges against dozens of police officials implicated in the "mass
 cremations" case. Police in the Tam Taran district secretly disposed of bodies of sus-
 pected militants believed to have been abducted and extrajudicially executed cre-
 mating them without the knowledge or consent of their families. The Central Bu-
 reau of Investigation (CBI) has reported that 984 unidentified bodies were cremated
 by Punjab police in Tarn Taran. Most reportedly were killed by border security
 forces while trying to cross into India from Pakistan, were unidentified victims of
 accidents or suicide, or died in clashes between militant factions. However, 424 were
 apparently militants killed in the interior of the district, 291 of whom were subse-
 quently identified. These numbers demonstrate the extent of the bloodshed during
 those years and, given the pattern of police abuses prevalent during the period,
 credibly include many kilied in extrajudicial executions. The NHRC is seeking to ob-
 tain compensation for the families of those victims whose remains have been identi-
 fied, but the government has chalenged the NHRC's jurisdiction in the case. The
 Supreme Court has yet to rule on this question.
 In June the former Tarn Taran senior superintendent of police, Ajit Singh
 Sandhu, died in an apparent suicide. At the time of his death, Sandhu was free on
 bail after having been charged with the abduction and murder of human rights ac-
 tivist Jaswant Singh Khalra, who had been investigating the cremation of unidenti-
 fied bodies by Tarn Taran police. Sandhu's suicide prompted extended public debate
 over the accountability of  njab police for excesses during the suppression of a
 bloody insurgency. According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, as of June, 29 mem-
 bers of the Punjab police were being held pending trial on charges of human rights
 violations, 34 members had been suspended and faced possible charges, and inves-
 tigations had been ordered into the actions of at least 122 additional members of
 the force.
 There are credible reports that police throughout the country often do not file re-
 quired arrest reports. As a result, there are hundreds of unsolved disappearances
 in which relatives claim an individual was taken into police custody and never
 heard from again. Police usually deny these claims, countering that there are no
 records of arrest.
 Militants in Jammu and Kashmir and the Northeast continued to use kidnapings
 to sow terror, seek the release of detained comrades, and extort funds. According
 to the Government, terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir kidnaped 422 persons during
 the year, of whom 181 were killed by their captors, 82 were released, and 158 re-
 mained unaccounted for. The July 1995 kidnaping of American, British, German,
 and Norwegian nationals by terrorists remains unresolved. The Norwegian captive
 was beheaded in August 1995. A captured terrorist stated that the remaining hos-
 tages--one American, two Britons, and a German-were murdered by their captors
 in December 1995. There has not been a verifiable contact with the hostages for
 more than 2 years.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture, and confessions extracted by force are generally inadmis-
 sible in court. Nevertheless, torture is common throughout the country and authori-
 ties often use torture during interrogations. In other instances, they torture detain-
 ees to extort money and sometimes as summary punishment.
 On October 14, the Government signed the United Nations Convention Against
 Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and the
 decision to accede was welcomed by human rights organizations. However, the Gov-
 ernment's decision not to accept Articles 20, 21, and 22 of the Convention means
 effectively that the U.N. Human Rights Commission will not be able to investigate
 allegations of torture in India.
 In 1997 the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture reported that torture was prac-
 ticed systematically by the security forces against persons in Jammu and Kashmir
 "in order to coerce them to confess to militant activity, to reveal information about
 suspected militants, or to inflict punishment for suspected support or sympathy with
 militants." According to the Rapporteur, "on no occasion had information been made
 public regarding instances o action taken against security force personnel in
 Jammu and Kashmir for acts of torture."
 The U.N. Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Executions received responses from
 the Government to several inquiries. In the case of Purushottam Kumar and Manoj
 Kumar, who reportedly died in police custody as a result of torture, the Government
 stated that four police officers had been found guilty and that further investigations
 by the state police were under way. The Government denied wrongdoing by the po-
 lice in several other cases involving allegations of death from torture while in police
 custody telling the Rapporteur that those in question had died of cardiac arrest or
 other iliness, or by mishap during altercations with police. The Special Rapporteur
 on Torture noted that methods of torture included beating, rape, crushing the leg
 
 
 1643
 muscles with a wooden roller, burning with heated objects, and electric shocks. Be-
 cause many alleged torture victims die in custody, and others are afraid to speak
 out, there are few firsthand accounts, although the marks of torture have often been
 found on the bodies of deceased detainees. The U.N. Special Rapporteurs onTorture
 and on Extrajudicial Killings renewed their requests to visit Jammu and Kashmir
 to the Government in 1997, but they were not permitted to do so.
 The prevalence of torture by police in detention facilities throughout the countr
 is borne out by the number of cases of deaths in police custody (see Section l.a.).
 In May human rights activists reported that Srinagar's S. K. Institute of Medical
 Sciences treats six to seven cases of renal failure wee ly as a result of police torture.
 On March 2, it was announced in the West Bengal state assembly that there had
 been 84 custodial deaths in the state in the 5 previous years; others claim that the
 figure is much higher.
 According to the U.N. Special Rapporteur, torture victims or their relatives have
 reportedly had difficulty in filing complaints because police in Jammu and Kashmir
 were issued instructions not to open a case without permission from higher authori-
 ties. In addition, Section 7 of the Armed Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Pow-
 ers Act provides that unless approval is obtained from the central Government, no
 "prosecution, suit, or other legal proceeding shall be instituted. .... against any per-
 son in respect of anything done or purported to be done in exercise of the powers
 of the Act." This provision reportedly allows the security forces to act with virtual
 iral p nity.
 The rape of persons in custody is part of the broader pattern of custodial abuse.
 Limits placed on the arrest, search, and police custody of women appear effectively
 to limit the frequency of rape in custody, although it does occur on occasion. The
 NHRC received reports of only three cases of custodial rape during the 1995-96 fis-
 cal year. The 24-hour reporting requirement applies to custodial rape as well as cus-
 todial death. However, the requirement does not apply to rape by policemen outside
 police stations. NGO's claim that rape by police, including custodial rape, is more
 common than NHRC figures indicate. Although evidence islacking, a larger number
 appears credible, in light of other evidence of abusive behavior by police and the
 likelihood that many rapes go unreported due to a sense of shame.
 A pattern of rape by paramilitary personnel allegedly exists in Jammu and Kash-
 mir and the northeast (see section 1.g.), but is not included in NHRC statistics be-
 cause it involves military forces. Human rights activists allege that Indian army
 personnel raped two sisters of a suspected militant on January 8 in the village of
 Hakura, Anantnag district, Jammu and Kashmir. Human rights activists alleged
 that on February 4, security force members tortured and humiliated several girls
 and women in Waloo Noorabad Kulgam, Jammu and Kashmir.
 On March 30, a soldier from the 15th Maratha Light Infantry raped a 12-year-
 old girl in the Mokukchnag District of Nagaland; a court of inquiry found him guilty
 and recommended court martial. On March 27, a police constable was sentenced to
 death for the rape and murder of a minor girl in North Dinajpur, West Bengal in
 1995.
 Although custodial abuse is deeply rooted in police practices, increased press re-
 porting and parliamentary questions provide evidence of growing public awareness
 of the problem  The   -C has identified torture and deaths in detention as one
 of its priority concerns.
 Between April 1996 and March 1997, 888 cases of custodial death were reported
 to the NHRC, including 188 deaths in police custody. The 700 deaths in judicial cus-
 tody, occurring in a prison population of approximately 155,000, many of whom are
 held for years, include a large proportion of deaths frm natural causes, in some
 cases aggravated by poor onditions in prisons. Deaths in poice custody, which typi-
 cally occur within hours or days of initial apprehension, more clearly imply violent
 abuse. The NHRC has no authority to investigate abuses by security forces directly,
 and security forces in Jammu and Kashmir and the Northeast are not required to
 report custodial deaths to the Commission.
 As a result of NHRC investigations during the fiscal year, 22 police personnel
 were prosecuted during the fiscal year and 79 were suspended, most in both cases
 due to involvement in custodial abuse. Charges against police prosecuted for custo-
 dial abuse include murder.
 Prison conditions are poor. Prisons are seriously overcrowded, often housing over
 three times their designed capacity. The largest class of prisoners typically sleeps
 on bare floors, has inadequate sanitary facilities, and receives inadequate food and
 medical care. Prisoners with privileged status or with the personal or family means
 can supplement what is normally provided. There are three classes of prison facili-
 ties. Prisoners are not classified by the nature of their crimes, but by their standing
 in society. Class "C" prisoners are those who cannot prove they are college grad-
 
 
 1644
 
 uates or income taxpayers. Their cells are overcrowded, often have dirt floors, no
 furnishings, and poor quality food. The use of handcuffs and fetters is common.
 Class "B  prisoners-college graduates and taxpayers-are held under markedly
 better conditions. Class "A' prisoners are prominent persons, as designated by the
 Government, and are accorded private rooms, visits, and adequate food, which may
 be supplemented by their families. Class "A" prisoners are usually held in govern-
 ment guest houses.
 Overcrowding in jails is severe. According to a statement in Parliament in 1994
 by the Minister of State for Home Affairs, New Delhi's Tihar jail, considered one
 of the best-run in the country, housed 8,577 prisoners in facilities designed to hold
 2,487. According to the Minister, 7,505 detainees awaited the completion of their
 trials, while 672 others had been on trial for 3 years or longer. As a result of an
 NHRC inquiry into the causes of 46 custodial deaths reported at Tihar Prison be-
 tween April 1994 and June 1995, a new building was constructed at the prison in
 1996 to house 750 inmates. In addition about 130 new staff members were hired
 and the medical staff was augmented. Elsewhere in India, prison conditions remain
 little changed from previous years.
 Nevertheless, prison conditions are a subject of press reports and court cases and
 have received attention from human rights groups. Press accounts of prison condi-
 tions include reports of sexual abuse of prisoners, the use of prisoners by prison offi-
 cials as domestic servants, the sale of food and milk for prisoners on the black mar-
 ket, the sale of female prisoners to brothels, and the marketing and export of prison-
 made goods. Women constitute 3 percent of the prison population, the Union Min-
 istry of Home Affairs said at year's end. Although Parliament passed a Children's
 Act in 1960 to safeguard young prisoners against abuse and exploitation and a Juve-
 nile Justice Act in 1986 provides that boys under 16 and girls under 18 are not to
 be held in prison, most states have not implemented these acts. The Supreme Court
 has criticized the state governments for not providing reformatories and separate
 detention facilities for children. In March the NHRC recommended that the Govern-
 ment enact a central law regulating state prisons, in order to replace the Prison Act
 of 1894.
 With the exception of an agreement with the ICRC for visits to detention facilities
 in Jammu and Kashmir, the Government does not allow NGO's to monitor prison
 conditions.
 Over the course of the conflict in Jammu and Kashmir, security forces have de-
 stroyed more than 800 homes of suspected militants and their family members as
 a form of "collective punishment," according to credible human rights groups.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention or Exile.-The Government ifnplemented during the
 early 1980's a variety of special security laws intended to help law enforcement au-
 thorities fight separatist insurgency. There were credible reports of widespread arbi-
 trary arrest and detention under these laws.
 Although the law that had been subject to the most extensive abuse-the Terror-
 ist and Disruptive Practices (Prevention) Act (TADA)-lapsed in May 1995, 3,785
 persons previously arrested under the act continued to be held in a number of states
 at year's end, and a small number of arrests under TADA continued for crimes al-
 legedly committed before the law lapsed. Criminal cases are proceeding against
 most of those still held under TADA, with more than 3,000 charged under other
 laws in addition to TADA. In March, the Government asserted that all TADA cases
 would be reviewed. In February 1996, the Supreme Court eased bail guidelines for
 persons accused under TADA, taking into account the large backlog of cases in spe-
 cial TADA courts. In reply to a question in the Jammu and Kashmir state assembly
 in May, the Government reported that 15,826 people were detained under TADA in
 the state between 1990 and 1995. TADA courts use abridged procedures. For exam-
 ple, defense counsel is not permitted to see witnesses for the prosecution, who are
 kept behind screens while testifying in court. Also, confessions extracted under du-
 ress are permitted in evidence.
 The Constitution provides that detainees have the right to be informed of the
 grounds for arrest, to be represented by counsel, and, unless the person is held
 under a preventive detention law, to appear before a magistrate within 24 hours of
 arrest. At this initial appearance, the accused must either be remanded for further
 investigation or released. The Supreme Court has upheld these provisions. An ac-
 cused person must be informed of his right to bail at the time of arrest and may,
 unless he is held on a nonbailable offense, apply for bail at any time. The police
 must file a charge sheet within 60 to 90 days of arrest; if they fail to do so, court
 approval of a bail application becomes mandatory.
 The Constitution permits preventive detention laws in the event of threats to pub-
 lic order and national security. These laws provide for limits on the length of deten-
 tion and for judicial review. Several-laws of this type remain in effect.
 
 
 1645
 
 The National Security Act (NSA) of 1980 permits detention of persons considered
 security risks; police anywhere in the country (except Jammu and Kashmir) may de-
 tain suspects under NSA provisions. Under these provisions the authorities may de-
 tain a suspect without charge or trial as long as 1 year on loosely defined security
 grounds. The state government must confirm the detention order, which is reviewed
 by an advisory board of three high court judges within 7 weeks of arrest. NSA de-
 tainees are permitted visits by family members and lawyers and must be informed
 of the grounds for detention within 5 days (10 to 15 days in exceptional cir-
 cumstances). At year's end, approximately 500 persons continue to be detained
 under the NSA. The NSA does not define "security risk." Human rights groups al-
 lege that preventive detention can be ordered and extended under the act purely
 on the opinion of the detaining authority. Such a subjective decision cannot be over-
 turned by any court.
 The Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act (PSA) of 1978 covers corresponding
 procedures for that state. Over half of the detainees in Jammu and Kashmir are
 held under the PSA.
 The court system is overloaded. The result has been the detention of persons
 awaiting trial for periods longer than they would receive if convicted. Prisoners may
 be held months or even-years before obtaining a trial date. According to a reply to
 a parliamentary question in July 1994, more than 111,000 criminal cases were
 pending in the Allahabad High Court, the most serious case backlog in the country,
 of which nearly 29,000 cases had been pending for 5 to 8 years. A statement to Par-
 liament in, July 1996 indicated that criminal and civil cases pending before the
 country's high courts numbered nearly 2.9 million in 1995, roughly the same as in
 1994 but an increase from 2.65 million in 1993. The Government acknowledged that
 73 percent of all prisoners held at year's end were so-called "under-trials," i.e.
 unconvicted remand prisoners awaiting the start or conclusion of their trials.
 In June Rongthong Kunley Doji," a Bhutanese dissident, was placed in *udicial
 custody pending review of an extradition request from the Government of Bhutan
 on charges that included political offenses as well as financial malfeasance. Dorji
 remained in custody in New Delhi at year's end, awaiting conclusion of his extra-
 dition hearing.
 The Government does not use forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-There is an independent judiciary with strong con-
 stitutional safeguards. Under a Supreme Court ruling, the Chief Justice, in con-
 sultation with his colleagues, has a decisive voice in selecting judicial candidates.
 The President appoints the judges, and they can serve up to the age of 62 on the
 state high courts and up to the age of 65 on the Supreme Court.
 Courts of first resort exist at the subdistrict and district levels. More serious cases
 and appeals are heard in state-level high courts and by the national-level Supreme
 Court, which also rules on constitutional questions.. Subdistrict and district judicial
 maistrates are appointed by state governments. High court judges are a p pointed
 on the recommendation of the federal Law Ministry, with the advice of the Supreme
 Court, the High Court Chief Justice, and the chief minister of the state, usually
 from among district judges or lawyers practicing before the same courts. Supreme
 Court judges are similarly appointed from among high court judges. The Chief Jus-
 tice is selected on the basis of seniority.
 When legal procedures function normally, they generally assure a fair trial, but
 the process can be drawn out and inaccessible to the poor. Defendants have the
 right to choose counsel from a bar that is fully independent of the Government.
 There are effective channels for appeal at most levels of the judicial system.
 The Criminal Procedure Code provides for an open trial in most cases, but it al-
 lows exceptions in proceedings involving official secrets, trials in which statements
 prejudicial to the safety of the State might be made, or under provisions of special
 security legislation. Sentences must be announced in public.
 Muslim personal status law governs many noncriminal matters involving Mus-
 lims-including family law, inheritance, and divorce. The Government does not
 interfere in the personal laws of the minority communities, with the result that laws
 that discriminate against women are upheld.
 In Jammu and Kashmir, the judicial system barely functions due to threats by
 militants against judges, witnesses, and their family members, because of judicial
 tolerance of the Government's heavy-handed antimilitant actions, and the frequent
 refusal by security forces to obey court orders. Courts there are not willing to hear
 cases involving terrorist crimes or fail to act expeditiously on habeas corpus cases,
 if they act at all. As a result, there have been no convictions of alleged terrorists
 in Jammu and Kashmir since before 1994, even though some militants have been
 in detention for years.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 
 
 1646
 
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The po-
 lice must obtain warrants for searches and seizures. In a criminal investigation, the
 police may conduct searches without warrants to avoid undue delay, but they must
 justify the searches in writing to the nearest magistrate with jurisdiction over the
 offense. The authorities in Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, and Assam have special
 powers to search and arrest without a warrant.
 The Indian Telegraph Act authorizes the surveillance of communications, includ-
 ing monitoring telephone conversations and intercepting personal mail, in case of
 public emergency or "in the interest of the public safety or tranquillity." These pow-
 ers have been used by every state government. The Union Government also uses
 the powers of the Indian Telegraph Act to tap phones and open mail.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law In Internal Con-
 flicts.-Government forces continue to commit serious violations of humanitarian
 law in the disputed state of Jammu and Kashmir. Between 350,000 and 400,000
 army and paramilitary forces are deployed in Jammu and Kashmir. The Muslim
 majority population in the Kashmir Valley suffers from the repressive tactics of the
 security forces. Under the Jammu and Kashmir Disturbed Areas Act, and the
 Armed Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act, both passed in July 1990,
 security forces personnel have extraordinary powers, including authority to shoot
 suspected lawbreakers and those disturbing the peace, and to destroy structures
 suspected of harboring militants or arms.
 Civilian deaths caused by security forces diminished for the fourth consecutive
 year in Jammu and Kashmir. This decrease apparently is due to press scrutiny and
 public criticism of abuses in previous years, increased training of military and para-
 military forces in humanitarian law, and greater sensitivity of commanders to rule
 of law issues. The improvement has taken the form of increased discipline and care
 in avoiding collateral civilian injuries and deaths (i.e., deaths in crossfire). The
 Union Home Ministry reported that 84 such deaths had occurred in Jammu and
 Kashmir in 1996-97, compared with 171 the previous reporting period. The security
 forces have not abandoned the abduction and extrajudicial execution of suspected
 militants, nor accepted accountability for these abuses. However, the inclination of
 many commanders to distance their units from such practices has led to reduced
 participation in them and a transfer of some of such actions to countermilitants.
 In April the alleged rape by security forces of nine women in the village of
 Wawoosa, near Srinagar, led to protest demonstrations. There is no evidence that
 charges have been brought in the alleged rape by security forces of nine women in
 Wawoosa. Kashniris asserted that the incident was part of a larger pattern of rape
 committed by army personnel in the valley. In a separate incident in May, four
 members of the Rashtriya Rifles were sentenced by military authorities to 10 years
 in prison for the rape of two women in south Kashmir.
 Kashmiri militant groups also committed serious abuses. In addition to political
 killings and kidnapings of politicians and civilians (see Sections L.a. and 1.b.), ter-
 rorists engaged in extortion and carried out acts of random terror that killed hun-
 dreds of Kashmirs. Terrorist acts by Kashmiri groups have also taken place outside
 Jammu and Kashmir. Many of the terrorists are not Indian citizens, but are of Af-
 ghan, Pakistani and other nationalities.
 On March 22, seven members of the Hindu Pandit community in the Kashmir val-
 ley were abducted and killed. On March 29, at least 16 people were killed and 60
 injured when two bombs exploded outside a concert arena in Jammu. Chief Minister
 Farooq Abdullah was scheduled to attend the concert, but arrived after the blasts
 and was unhurt. On June 29, an explosion at the heavily guarded Legislative As-
 sembly members' hostel killed three people, including an assembly member who was
 a former militant. On 31 and November 1, militant separatist organizations ex-
 ploded bombs in Srinigar, Kashmir, injuring several civilians and killing 2 security
 forces personnel. On November 30, three persons were killed and 58 were injured,
 when two bombs exploded in a crowded marketplace in New Delhi.
 Kashmiris continued to be caught in the crossfire between militants on one side
 and security forces and countermilitants on the other. Unlike past years, however,
 there were no large-scale or prolonged clashes resulting in extensive loss of civilian
 life or property.
 Government security forces in the northeast have been responsible for human
 rights abuses ranging from extrajudicial killings and disappearances to torture and
 rape. There are approximately 40,000 government security forces deployed in the
 northeast. Through June, the Government stated that militants in the northeast
 had killed 163 members of the security forces and 363 civilians. Militant violence
 directed against civilians resulted in numerous deaths and drove thousands of per-
 sons from their homes (see Section 1.a). Bodo militants attempted to blow up a pas-
 
 
 1647
 senger train on August 13. They alsq planted explosive devices under a number of
 bridges in Assam during August.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and
 with some limitations they are exercised in practice. A vigorous press reflects a wide
 variety of public, social, and economic beliefs. Newspapers and magazines regularly
 pubish investigative reports and allegations of  government wrongdoing, and the
 press as a whole champions human rights and criticizes perceived government
 lapses.
 The Press Council of India is a statutory body of journalists, publishers, academ-
 ics, and politicians with a chairman appointed by the Government. Designed to be
 a self-regulating mechanism for the press, it investigates complaints of irresponsible
 journalism and sets a code of conduct for publishers. This code includes not publish-
 ing articles or details that might incite caste or communal violence. The Council
 publicly criticizes newspapers or journalists it believes have broken the code of con-
 duct, but its findings, while noted by the press community, carry no legal weight.
 Parliament adopted a freedom of information act in June.
 National television and radio, which are government monopolies, are frequently
 accused of manipulating the news to the benefit of the Government. However, inter-
 national satellite television is widely distributed in middle class neighborhoods by
 cable and is gradually eroding the Government's monopoly on television.
 Under the Official Secrets Act (OSA), the Government may restrict publication of
 sensitive stories, but the Government sometimes interprets this broadly to suppress
 criticism of its policies. Human rights activists state that government pressure
 caused one national, English-language daily to suppress some stories and transfer
 a staff reporter. The 1971 Newspapers Incitements to Offenses Act remains in effect
 in Jammu and Kashmir. Under the act, a district magistrate may prohibit the press
 from publishing material resulting in "incitement to murder" or "any act of vio-
 lence. As punishment the act stipulates that the authorities may seize newspapers
 and printing presses. Despite these restrictions, newspapers in Srinagar regularly
 publish militant press releases attacking the Government and report in detail on
 alleged human rights abuses. The authorities allowed foreign journalists to travel
 freely in Jammu and Kashmir, where they regularly spoke with militant leaders,
 and filed reports on government abuses.
 On June 27 in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir police attacked a group of journal-
 ists protesting police brutality. On March 16, unidentified gunmen murdered jour-
 nalist Saidain Shafi in Srinagar. There is no active investigation of the Saidan Shafi
 murder. In late August, Assam police arrested several members of a local human
 rights organization on allegations that they were helping the United Liberation
 Front of Assam (ULFA) insurgents. One of those arrested, Ajit Bhuyan, is also the
 editor of two Assamese language daily newspapers that had been critical of the state
 government. Local journalists allegedthat the arrests constituted a violation of free-
 dom of speech. In January 1998, the International Federation of Journalists re-
 ported that seven journalists were murdered in India in 1997, allegedly because of
 stories they had written or in order to halt investigations they were conducting.
 A government censorship board reviews films before licensing them for distribu-
 tion. The beard deletes material deemed offensive to public morals or communal
 sentiment. Producers of video news magazines must also submit their products to
 the board, which occasionally censors stories that portray the Government in an un-
 favorable light. The beard's ruling may be appealed and overturned.
 Kashmri groups threatened journalists and editors and even imposed temporary
 bans on some publications.
 Citizens enjoy complete academic freedom, and students and faculty espouse a
 wide range of views. In addition to 10 national universities and about 160 state uni-
 versities, states are empowered to accredit locally run private institutions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly arid Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly, and the Government generally respected these rights
 in practice.
 The authorities sometimes require permits and notification prior to holding pa-
 rades or demonstrations, but local governments ordinarily respect the right to pro-
 test peacefully. At times of civil tension, the authorities may ban public assemblies
 or impose a curfew under the Criminal Procedure Code.
 Srinagar and other parts of Jammu and Kashmir occasionally came under curfew,
 but were more often affected by strikes called by the militants. The Kerala High
 Court ruled in July that "bandhs," or forced public closures, as opposed to dem-
 onstrations or rallies, forcibly interfered in the affairs of others, and thus rep-
 
 
 1648
 resented a violation of the constitutional right to assemble peaceably. Critics of the
 ruling say that the court overstepped its bounds by restricting the right to protest.
 The Constitution provides for the right to form associations, and the Government
 generally respected these rights in practice.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. India is a secular state in which all
 faiths generally enjoy freedom of worship. Government policy does not favor any re-
 ligious group. There is no national law to bar proselytizing by Indian Christians.
 Foreign missionaries can generally renew their visas but since the mid-1960's the
 Government has refused to admit new resident foreign missionaries. Those who ar-
 rive now do so as tourists and stay for short periods. As of January 1993, there were
 1,923 registered foreign Christian missionaries. As in the past, state officials refused
 to issue permits for foreign Christian missionaries to enter some northeastern
 states. Tension between Hindus and Muslims continues to pose a challenge to the
 secular foundation of the State (see Section 5).
 The U.N. Special Rapporteur for all forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination
 Based on Religion or Belief published a report in February on his visit of December
 2-14, 1996 at the invitation of the Government. Having studied the situation of the
 majority Hindus and minority Muslims, Christians, and Sikh's, the Rapporteur con-
 cluded that the country's constitutional and legislative guarantees of religious free-
 dom contributed to religious tolerance in India as did a conception of secularism
 implying not the rejection of religion but equality for all religions." He warned, how-
 ever, that tolerance was susceptible to attack by religious extremists (see Section
 5).
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens enjoy freedom of movement within the country except in cer-
 tain border areas where, for security reasons, special permits are required. Under
 the Passports Act of 1967, the Government may deny a passport to any applicant
 who "may or is likely to engage outside India in activities prejudicial to the sov-
 ereignty and integrity of India. The Government uses this provision to prohibit the
 foreign travel of some government critics, especially those advocating Sikh inde-
 pendence.
 Citizens may emigrate without restriction.
 India is not a party to the 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Refu-
 gees or its 1967 Protocol. It cooperates with the office of the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in the care of certain groups of refugees (nota-
 bly Afghans, Iranians, Somalis, Burmese, and Sudanese), but not in the case of
 other groups, most notably the Sri Lankan Tamils to whose camps in Tamil Nadu
 the Government has barred access by the UNHCR and NGO's. [ndia does provide
 first asylum to refugees, most notably in recent years to Tibetan and Sri Lan
 Tanil refugees. However, this policy is inconsistently applied. For example, the in-
 sistence of some border authorities on the presentation of passport and visas by
 those claiming refugee status has occasionally resulted in individuals or groups
 being refused admittance. This has occurred in recent years in cases involving Ira-
 nians who had transited Pakistan to enter India, and some Chin and Rakhine refu-
 gees from Burma. Human rights groups allege that the Government forced 5,000 to
 6,000 Jumma refugees to return to Bangladesh, where no adequate housing was
 provided for them. Refugees are not required to make claims in third countries.
 Cramped and unhygienic conditions are reported to exist in some of the camps for
 Sri Lankan Tamils in Tamil Nadu.
 The Government recognizes certain groups, including Chakmas from Bangladesh,
 Tamils from Sri Lanka, and Tibetans, as refugees, providing them assistance in ref-
 ugee camps or in resettlement areas. According to a government statement to Par-
 liament in July 1996, there were 98,000 Tibetans, 87,729 Sri Lankan Tamils, 66,234
 Chakmas and Hajongs from Bangladesh, and 52 Burmese refugees. In the state-
 ment, the Government indicated that 18,932 Afghans, 255 Somalis, and 308 persons
 of other nationalities were living in India "under the mandate" of the UNHCR. Al-
 though the Government does not formally recognize persons in this latter category
 as refugees, it does not deport them. Instead, these people receive renewable resi-
 dence permits or their status is ignored.
 According to the UNHCR, as of August, there were about 65,000 Tamil refugees
 from Sri Lanka living in 115 camps in India, including approximately 6,000 who
 fled the upsurge in fighting in Sri Lanka during 1996 and 338 suspected of militant
 activities, who are detained in special camps. An estimated 30,000-60,000 more Sri
 Lankan Tamils are not registered as refugees and are living outside the camps. The
 Government states that there are some 57,000 Sri LankanTamil refugees in camps
 in India and a few thousand more living outside the camps. NGO's report refugee
 complaints about deteriorated housing, poor sanitation, delayed dole payments, and
 
 
 1649
 inadequate medical care. The state government, using central government re-
 sources, provides shelter and subsidized food for those in the camps. Enforcement
 of a Tamil Nadu government ban on NGO assistance to the camps has been relaxed
 and NGO's have visited the camps.
 There are Chin ethnics among nonrecognized refugees in the northeastern states,
 particularly Mizoram. Their presence is generally tolerated. However, recent ten-
 sions between security forces and Chin National Force (CNF) insurgents operating
 in Burma have allegedly resulted in detention, interrogation, and expulsion of some
 persons associated with the CNF. More than 100,000 Buddhist Chakma refugees
 live in uncertainty over their futures in Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh, and Mizoram.
 About 40,000 in Arunachal Pradesh live under the threat of deportation following
 a series of acts of student-led agitation against their presence in the state. Human
 rights activists alleged that the government forcibly repatriated 5,000 to 6,000
 Jumma refugees from the eastern state of Tripura to Bangladesh in March, despite
 evidence that they would face reprisals there. The Government maintained that
 there was not sufficient evidence to suggest a possibility of reprisal on return. Mili-
 tant organizations in Manipur are forcing all non-Manipuris above the age of 12 to
 pay a $3 "tax" in order to continue to live in the state.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercise this right freely. India has a democratic, parliamentary system
 of government with representatives elected in multiparty elections under universal
 adult suffrage. A parliament sits for 5 years unless dissolved earlier for new elec-
 tions, except under constitutionally defined emergency situations. State govern-
 ments are elected at regular intervals except in states under President's Rule, i.e.,
 rule by the central Government.
 On the advice of the Prime Minister, the President may proclaim a state of emer-
 gency in any part of the national territory in the event of war, external aggression,
 or armed rebellion. Similarly, President's Rule may be declared in the event of a
 collapse of a state's constitutional machinery. The Supreme Court in May 1995
 upheld the Government's authority to suspend fundamental rights during an emer-
 gency.
 President Narayanan dissolved the lower house of Parliament on December 4.
 Elections are scheduled for February and March 1998.
 There are no legal impediments to participation by women in the political process.
 A large proportion of women participate in voting throughout the country, and nu-
 merous women represent all major parties in the national and state legislatures.
 There are 59 women in the Parliament, including the deputy speaker of the upper
 house, and 5 women in the 45-member Cabinet. The 1993 passage of the
 "Panchayati Raj" constitutional amendments, reserved 30 percent of seats in elected
 village councils (panchayats) for women. Debate over the reservation of parliamen-
 tary and state assembly seats for women continued throughout 1997.
 The Constitution reserves seats in Parliament and state legislatures for "sched-
 uled tribes" and "scheduled castes" in proportion to their population (see Section 5).
 Indigenous people participate actively m national and local politics, but their impact
 depends on their numerical strength. In the northeastern states, indigenous people
 are a large proportion of the population and consequently exercise a dominant politi-
 cal influence in the political process. In Maharashtra and Gujarat, on the other
 hand, tribal peoples are a small minority and have been unsuccessful in blocking
 projects they oppose.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Independent human rights organizations operate throughout most of the country
 investigating abuses and publishing their findings. Human rights activists in
 Jammu and Kashmir, however, have been unable to move around the state to docu-
 ment human rights violations for fear of threats by countermilitants and security
 forces. Since 1992 several individuals closely involved in the documentation of viola-
 tions there, including lawyers and journalists, have been attacked and in some cases
 killed. International human rights groups have had difficulty in obtaining visas to
 visit India for research purposes. For example, a visa application by Amnesty Inter-
 national researchers was pending throughout the entire year. Moreover, the police
 and security forces have targeted human rights monitors for arrest and harassment.
 No definitive resolution of the case of abducted and murdered Kashmir human
 rights activist Jalil Andrabi was reached. The army and other branches of the Gov-
 ernment have issued conflicting statements as to the responsibility of security forces
 in this death (see Section 1.b). A warrant for the arrest of an army major has been
 
 
 1650
 
 issued in connection with the case. He reportedly resigned his commission shortly
 after the crime was committed and is now in custody. In Assam the investigation
 into the murder of human rights activist and journalist Parag Das has yielded no
 definitive information on the identity of his killer. Das was killed in May 1996. The
 assailant was allegedly a militant who had previously surrendered and was sup-
 ported by the Government. Human rights activists in Andhra Pradesh were at-
 tacked by unidentified assailants in April and May. The director of the South Asian
 Human Rights Documentation Center was questioned and threatened in September
 by persons claiming to be police officers but who refused to properly identify them-
 selves. The evidence suggests that this was an attempt to intimdate the director
 and obstruct the work of the South Asian Human Rights Documentation Center.
 The Government appointed a National Human Rights Commission in October
 1993 with powers to investigate and recommend policy changes, punishment, and
 compensation in cases of police abuse. In addition, the N1RC is directed to contrib-
 ute to the establishnent, growth, and functioning of nongovernmental human rights
 organizations. The Government appoints the members and finances the operations
 of the NHRC. The NHRC is seriously understaffed and prohibited by statute from
 directly investigating allegations of abuse involving army and paramilitary forces.
 Between Aprl and November, the NHRC reeived more than 30,000 complaints.
 It considered 15,086 of these complaints, of which it dismissed 7,474 and transmit-
 ted 2,991 to other governmental authorities for disposition. It held inquiries into
 4,050 complaints, concluding 571 cases. During the entire 1995-96 fiscal year, the
 Commission received about 20,000 complaints, considering 9,751 of them. The in-
 creased number of complaints made to the commission this year is thought to be
 the result of its increased visibility.
 Human rights gups alleged that persons protesting the World Bank-sponsored
 National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) project in Singrauli were harassed by
 police and NTPC officials, but these allegations could not be verified. Human rights
 groups also reported that the NTPC project displaced a number of people, causing
 them to lose their homes and livelihoods without compensation. According to Am-
 nesty International, groups protesting the construction of a power plant by the
 Dabhol Power Company in Maharashtra were harassed by police.
 The NHRC has pursued the building of a culture of human rights by fostering
 human rights education in schools and universities, by offering support and encour-
 agement to human rights NGO's, by supporting training programs for the police,
 military forces, and paramilitary forces, and by making recommendations to central
 and state governments. In November the NHRC recommended the preparation of
 a human rights training program, including stress counseling, for state police. The
 NHRC has also influenced the legislative process (particularly in advocating aboli-
 tion of the TADA and by proposing prison reform legislation). State human rights
 commissions have been established in West Bengal, Himachal Pradesh, Assam, and
 Madhya Pradesh. In addition, special courts to hear human rights cases have been
 established in Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and Andhra Pradesh.
 The NHRC was also involved in programs to eliminate child labor (see Section 6).
 A state human rights commission was established in Jammu and Kashmir by act
 of the state legislature on May 30. Its powers to independently investigate alleged
 human rights violations committed by members of the security forces are strictly
 limited. Credible human rights activists state that the Jammu and Kashmir com-
 nmission has not yet demonstrated effective, independent protection of human rights
 in the state.
 The prison visits program in Jammu and Kashmir by the ICRC, initiated in Octo-
 ber 1995, continued in 1997. ICRC representatives also continued training police
 and border security force personnel in international humanitarian law. The U.N.
 Special Rapporteurs on Torture and Extrajudicial Execution renewed their requests
 to the Government this year to visit Jammu and Kashmir, but were not permitted
 to do so.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The traditional caste system as well as differences of ethnicity, religion, and lan-
 guage deeply divide society. Despite laws designed to prevent discrimination, there
 are other aws as well as social and cultural practices that have a profound discrimi-
 natory impact. More than 60 persons were killed in caste-related violence in Bihar
 State and a score or more died as a result of incidents in Tamil Nadu.
 Women.-Domestic violence in the context of dowry disputes is a serious problem.
 In the typical dowr dispute, a groom's family members harass a woman they be-
 lieve has not provided a sufficient dowry. This harassment sometimes ends in the
 woman's death, which family members often try to portray as a suicide or kitchen
 
 
 1651
 accident. Although most "dowry deaths" involve lower and middle-class families, the
 phenomenon crosses both caste and religious lines. The Government stated at year's
 end that 3,899 dowry deaths had occurred during the year.
 Under a 1986 amendment to the Penal Code, the court must presume the hus-
 band or the wife's in-laws are responsible for every unnatural death of a woman in
 the first 7 years of marriage-provided that harassment is proven. In such cases,
 police procedures require that an officer of deputy superintendent rank or above
 conduct the investigation and that a team of two or more doctors perform the post
 mortem procedures.
 There is an elaborate system of laws to protect the rights of women, including the
 Equal Remuneration Act, the Prevention of Immoral Traffic Act, the Sati (widow
 burning) Prevention Act, and the Dowry Prohibition Act. However, the Government
 often is unable to enforce these laws, especially in rural areas where traditions are
 deeply rooted. Female bondage and forced prostitution are widespread in parts of
 society.
 National Crime Record Bureau statistics show that registered cases of violence
 against women-including molestation, rape, kidnaping, and wife murder (dowry
 deaths)-numbered 83,964 in 1993, 98,948 in 1994 and 100,846 in 1995 (the last
 year for which such statistics are available.) In Orissa State alone, 710 cases of
 dowry torture were reported by mid-year. There were continued reports during 1997
 of gang rapes as penalties for alleged adultery or as means of coercion or revenge
 in rural property disputes and feuds.
 Higher female mortality at all age levels, including female infanticide, accounts
 for a decline in the ratio of females to males to 927 per 1,000 in 1991, from 955
 per 1,000 in 1981 and 972 per 1,000 at the turn of the century.
 The personal status laws of the religious communities discriminate against
 women. Under the Indian Divorce Act of 1869, a Christian woman may demand di-
 vorce only in the case of spousal abuse and certain categories of adultery while for
 a man adultery alone is sufficient. In May the Bombay High Court recognized abuse
 alone as sufficient grounds for a Christian woman to obtain a divorce. Under Islamic
 law, a Muslim husband may divorce his wife spontaneously and unilaterally-, there
 is no such provision for women. Islamic law also allows a man to have up to four
 wives but prohibits polyandry.
 The Hindu Succession Act provides equal inheritance rights for Hindu women, but
 married daughters are seldom given a share in parental property. Islamic law recog-
 nizes a woman's right of inheritance but specifies that a daughter's share should
 be only one-half that of a son.
 Under tribal land systems, notably in Bihar, tribal women do not have the right
 to own land. Other laws relating to the ownership of assets and land accord women
 little control over land use, retention, or sale.
 There are thousands of grassroots organizations working for social justice and the
 economic advancement of women, in addition to the National Commission for
 Women. The Government usually supports these efforts, despite strong resistance
 from traditionally privileged groups.
 Children.-The United Front coalition Government pledged in 1996 to enact legis-
 lation making free and compulsory elementary education a fundamental right and
 to increase funding for primary education, but such legislation has not yet been
 passed. The Government continued efforts initiated in August 1994 to pass more
 laws banning child labor and to enhance enforcement of existing laws. The Govern-
 ment's program to eliminate child labor is aimed at progressively withdrawing chil-
 dren from the workplace in hazardous industries and placing them in schools by
 2000 through initiatives in education, rural development, woman and child develop-
 ment, health, and labor programs. Government efarts to eliminate child labor have
 touched only a small fraction of children in the work place. The United Front gov-
 ernment pledged in 1997 to eliminate child labor by 2010. A Supreme Court decision
 in December 1996 raised penalties for employers of children in hazardous industries
 and established a welfare fund for formerly employed children (see Section 6.d.).
 There are an estimated 500,000 street children nationwide. Child prostitution is
 occurring in the cities, and there is a growing pattern of traffic in child prostitutes
 from Nepal. According to one estimate 5,000 to 7,000 children, mostly between the
 ages 10 and 18, are victims of this traffic annually. In a wellpublicized case, poor
 Muslims from Murshidabad District, West Bengal, were foundto be sending their
 children (usually maimed or disabled girls) to Saud Arabia to beg, in return far
 payment of abut $1,400. Authorities arrested three traffickers and prosecuted them
 under the Immoral Traffic Act.
 The Child Marriage Restraint (Amendment) Act of 1976 prohibits child marriage,
 a traditional practice in northern India. The act raised the ane of marriage for girls
 to 18 from 15, but the Government does not enforce it effectively. According to one
 
 
 1652
 report, 50 percent of the girls in Bihar, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya
 Pradesh are married at or before age 16.
 The traditional preference for male children continues. Although a law passed in
 September 1994 prohibits the use of amniocentesis and sonogram tests for sex deter-
 mination, they are widely misused for this purpose and termination of a dispropor-
 tionate number of pregnancies with female fetuses occurs. In the 9 years since the
 southern state of Maharashtra passed a law banning the use of such tests for sex
 determination, the state government has filed charges against one doctor, he was
 acquitted. Human rights groups estimate that at least 10,000 cases of female infan-
 ticide occur yearly, primarily in poor rural areas. In addition, parents often give pri-
 ority in health care and nutrition to male infants. Women's rights groups point out
 that the burden of providing girls with an adequate dowry is one factor that makes
 daughters less desirable. Although abetting or taking dowry is theoretically illegal
 under the Dowry Prohibition Act of 1961, it is still widely practiced.
 People With Disabilities.-The Ministry of Welfare has principal responsibility for
 programs for the disabled, and it delivers comprehensive rehabilitation services to
 the rural ppulation through 16 district centers. A national rehabilitation plan com-
 mits the Government to putting a rehabilitation center in each of more than 400
 districts, but services are still concentrated in urban areas. The Government re-
 serves 3 percent of positions in official offices and state-owned enterprises for people
 with visual, hearing, or orthopedic disabilities. The Government provides special
 railway fares, education allowances, scholarships, customs exemptions, and rehabili-
 tation training to assist people with disabilities. There is no legislation or otherwise
 mandated provision of accessibility for the disabled. The National Human Rights
 Commission sought to improve conditions in mental hospitals and enhance aware-
 ness of the rights of those with mental disabilities during the year. It commissioned
 an assessment of conditions at mental hospitals throughout the country, to be con-
 ducted by the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Science. The rights
 of the mentally ill and mentally retarded are protected by the Constitution and the
 Mental Health Act of 1987. The NHRC noted, however, that despite these protec-
 tions, "conditions in many mental hospitals in the country are far from satisfactory.
 They continue to embody old concepts of mental health care and function essentially
 as custodial rather than therapeutic institutions. Overcrowded and serving as
 "dumping grounds" by desperate relatives, some of them lack even basic amenities
 and have poor medical facilities."
 Indigenous People.-The Innerline Regulations enacted by the British in 1873 still
 provide the basis for safeguarding tribal rights in most of the border states of north-
 eastern India. These regulations prohibit any person, including Indians from other
 states, from going beyond an inner boundary without a valid permit. No rubber,
 wax, ivory, or other forest products may be removed from the protected areas with-
 out prior authorization. No outsiders are allowed to own land in the tribal areas
 without approval from tribal authorities.
 Despite constitutional safeguards, the rights of indigenous groups in eastern India
 are often ignored. Indigenous people suffer discrimination and harassment, have
 been wrongly deprived of their land, and have been subject to arbitrary arrest and
 torture. There has been encroachment on tribal land in almost all the states of east-
 ern India, including by illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, and by businesses that
 have removed forest and mineral products without authorization. Moreover, persons
 from other backgrounds often usurp places reserved for members of tribes and lower
 castes in national education institutions.
 Such violations have given rise to numerous tribal movements demanding protec-
 tion of land and property rights. The Jharkhand Movement in Bihar and Orissa,
 and the Bodo Movement in Assam, reflect deep economic and social grievances
 among indigenous people. In the Jharkhand area, tribal people complain that they
 have been relegated to unskilled mining jobs, have lost their forests to industrial
 construction, and have been displaced by development projects. The Government
 has considered the creation of an independent Jharkand State, but the affected state
 governments oppose the idea.
 However, there is some local autonomy in the northeast. In Meghalaya tribal
 chiefs still wield influence in certain villages. The Nagaland government controls
 the rights to certain mineral resources, and autonomous district councils in Tripura,
 Assam, and Meghalaya control matters such as education, rural development, and
 forestry in cooperation with the state governors.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Constitution gives the President author-
 ity to specify historically disadvantaged castes and tribes, which are entitled to af-
 firmative action in employment and other benefits. These "scheduled" tribes and
 castes benefit from special development funds, government hiring quotas, and spe-
 cial training programs. According to the 1991 census, scheduled castes made up 16
 
 
 1653
 percent and scheduled tribes 8 percent of the country's 1991 population of 846 mil-
 ,on.
 The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act of 1989
 specifies new offenses against disadvantaged people and provides stiffer penalties
 for offenders. However, this act has had only a modest effect in curbing abuse. Gov-
 ernment statistics indicate that 20,312 crimes against scheduled castes and 3,193
 crimes against scheduled tribes were recorded during the year.
 The practice of untouchability was in theory outlawed by the Constitution and the
 1955 Civil Rights Act, but it remains an important aspect of life. Intercaste violence
 claims hundreds of lives each year; it was particularly pronounced in Bihar and
 Tamil Nadu states.
 During the year, inter-caste violence rose sharply in the northern state of Bihar,
 where both upper-caste private- armies and lower-caste armed groups committed
 massacres with impunity on a monthly basis. The inability of Bihar's authorities to
 cope with caste violence was the subject of emergency state- center consultations fol-
 lowing the December 1 massacre by the Ranvir Sna in Lakshmanpur-Bathe village.
 On March 23, 10 members of a lower-caste community in Hawaspur were killed by
 alleged members of an upper-caste private a-my; on April 20, 6 upper-caste villagers
 in Raghopur were killed by members of a Naxalite group, who reportedly stated that
 their assault was intended to avenge the March 23 incident. On December 1, Ranvir
 Sna (a private army of landlords and upper-caste Hindus) killed at least 63-and
 perhaps as many as 75-low-caste persons in Lakshampur Bathe village, in Bihar,
 apparently in retaliation for the deaths of six landlords who were killed 2 months
 earlier by Naxalites in the neighboring village of Bathani Tola. A government com-
 mission is charged with giving special attention to the problems of the scheduled
 castes and tribes and submits an annual report. In Tripura in January, 36 people
 were killed and 200 homes were burned -when tribal militants attacked Bengali set-
 tlers in Khowai district. In four similar incidents between February 12 and 15, trib-
 al extremists killed 37 people, including 8 children, and destroyed 66 houses in
 Khowai district and Jharul-Bachal village.
 Religious Minorities.-Controversy between Hindus and Muslims continues with
 regard to three sites where mosques were built centuries ago on sites where temples
 are believed to have previously stood. The potential for renewed Hindu-Muslim vio-
 lence remains considerable.
 The Religious Institutions (Prevention of Misuse) Act makes it an offense to use
 any religious site for political purposes or to use temples for harboring persons ac-
 cused or convicted of crimes. While specifically designed to deal with Sikh places
 of worship in the Punjab, the law applies to all religious sites.
 Fear of political violence drove most Hindus in the Kashmir Valley (Pandits) to
 seek refuge in camps in Jammu or with relatives in New Delhi or elsewhere. The
 Pandit community criticizes bleak conditions in the camps and fears that a nego-
 tiated solution giving greater autonomy to the Muslim majority might threaten its
 own survival in Jammu and Kashmir as a culturally and historically distinctive
 group. On March 22, seven members of this community were abducted from their
 homes in the Kashmir valley and killed (see Section 1.a). In his report on his 1996
 visit, the U.N. Special Rapporteur for all forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination
 Based on Religion or Belief cited the "traumatic situations" in Jammu and Kashmir
 and Punjab, as well as intercommunal rioting in Mumbai and incidents of religious
 extremism, the Rapporteur warned that the country's tradition of religious tolerance
 is susceptible to attack by religious extremists (see Section 2.c.). In Bihar, there was
 evidence of a pattern of violence against the Christian minority. In the last week
 of October, A. T. Thomas, a Jesuit priest, was beheaded by unknown persons in
 Hazaribagh village, Bihar. On September 2, another Jesuit priest, Christudas, was
 stripped and paraded naked in Dumka village, Bihar. In looking into these inci-
 dents, the National Minorities Commission found police guilty of "gross dereliction
 of duty and bias" in handling these cases.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of associa-
 tion. Workers may establish and join unions of their own choosing without prior au-
 thorization. There are five major recognized national trade union centrals, each of
 which is associated with, but not necessarily controlled by, a political party. Some
 15 to 20 percent of the approximately 28 million persons employed in the so-called
 "organized sector," that is, "all public sector and non-agricultural establishments
 employing more than 10 people," according to government definition, belong to
 unions. The vast majority of the country's approximately 360 million workers are
 employed in the "informal," i.e., not the "organized," sector.
 
 
 1654
 Trade unions often exercise the right to strike, but public sector unions are re-
 quired to give at least 16 days' notice prior to striking. Some states have laws re-
 quiring workers in certain nonpublic sector industries to give prior strike notice.
 The Essential Services Maintenance Act allows the Government to ban strikes
 and requires conciliation or arbitration in specified essential industries. Legal mech-
 anisms exist for challenging the assertion t at a given dispute falls within the scope
 of this act. The Industrial Disputes Act prohibits retribution by employers against
 employees involved in legal strike actions. This prohibition is observed in practice.
 When abuses, such as intimidation or suppression of legitimate trade union activi-
 ties, are occasionally perpetrated against nationally organized or other large-scale
 unions or unionized workers, civil authorities generally respond by prosecuting and
 punishing those responsible. Unaffiliated unions of low caste or tribal workers are
 not always able to secure for themselves the protections and rights provided by law.
 However, six men were convicted in June on charges related to the 1991 murder
 of tribal union leader Shankar Guha Niyogi. The gnman was sentenced to death,
 while industrialist Chandrakant Shah and our others received life sentences.
 Unions are free to affiliate with international trade union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right to bargain collec-
 tively has existed for decades. The Trade Union Act prohibits discrimination against
 union members and organizers, and employers may be penalized if they discrimi-
 nate against employees engaged in union activities.
 Collective bargaining is the normal means of setting wages and settling disputes
 in unionized plants in the organized industrial sector. Trade unions vigorously de-
 fend worker interests in this process. Although a system of specialized labor courts
 adjudicates labor disputes, there are long delays and a backlog of unresolved cases.
 When the parties are unable to agree on equitable wages, the Government may set
 up boards of union, management, and government representatives to determine
 them.
 In practice legal protections of worker rights are effective only for the 28 million
 workers in the organized industrial sector, out of a total work force of more than
 376 million. Outside the modern industrial sector, laws are difficult to enforce.
 Union membership is rare in this informal sector and collective bargaining does not
 exist.
 There are seven export processing zones (EPZ's). Entry into the EPZ's is ordi-
 narily limited to the employees. Such entry restrictions apply to union organizers.
 While workers in the EPs have the right to organize and bargain collectively,
 union activity is rare. In addition unions, content with their role in public sector
 enterprises, have not vigorously pursued efforts to organize private-sector employees
 anywhere in the years since EPZ's were established. Women constitute the bulk of
 the work force in the EPZs.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by both the Constitution and specific statute. Bonded labor, as a form of
 compulsory labor, is also prohibited by statute (the Bonded Labor System (Abolition)
 Act of 1976). Enforcement of this statute, which is the responsibility of state govern-
 ments, has not been adequate due to lack of adequate resources available to the gov-
 ernment machinery and, to some extent, societal acceptance. Estimates for the num-
 ber of bonded laborers range to as high as 5 million, an unknown number of these
 are children. Enforcement of the statutory prohibitions on bonded labor varies from
 state to state, but has generally been inadequate.
 A Supreme Court decision defined forced labor as work at less than the minimum
 wage, which is usually set by the state governments. Under this definition, which
 differs from that of the International Labor Organization (ILO), forced labor is wide-
 spread, especially in rural areas.
 Bonded labor, the result of a private contractual relationship whereby a worker
 incurs or inherits debts to a contractor and then must work off the debt plus inter-
 est, is illegal but widespread. The Government estimates that between enactment
 of the Bonded Labor (Regulation and Abolition) Act in 1979 and March 31, 1993,
 approximately 251,424 bonded workers had been released from their obligations.
 Other sources maintain that those released are only one-twentieth of the total num-
 ber of bonded laborers. State governments are responsible for enforcing the act. In
 February the Supreme Court required state governments to file detailed affidavits
 on the status of bonded labor. Offenders may be sentenced to up to 3 years in prison
 but prosecutions are rare. The Bonded Labor System (Abolition) Act of 1976 pro-
 hibits all bonded labor, by adults and children, but the Government does not enforce
 this prohibition effectively.
 The situation of some domestics and some children in the work place amounts to
 bonded labor. Children sent from their homes to work because their parents cannot
 afford to feed them, or in order to pay off a debt incurred by a parent or relative,
 
 
 1655
 have little choice in the matter. There are no universally accepted figures for the
 number of bonded child laborers. However, in the carpet industry alone, human
 rights organizations estimate that there may be as many as 300,000 children work-
 ing, many of them under conditions that amount to bonded labor.
 There were press reports that prison officials used prisoners as domestic servants,
 and that they sold female prisoners to brothels (see Section 1.c.).
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Article 24
 of the Constitution and the Child Labor (Prohibition and Regulation) Act of 1986
 are the principal protections from exploitation of children in the work place. Provi-
 sions for the protection of children in the work place are also made in the Beedi
 and Cigar Workers (Condition of Employment) Act of 1966, the Factones Act of
 1948, the Mines Act of 1952, the Motor Transport Workers Act of 1961, the Planta-
 tions Labor Act of 1951, and the Minimum Wages Act of 1948. The Government pro-
 hibits forced and bonded labor by children, but does not enforce this prohibition ef-
 fectively (see Section 6.c.).
 The enforcement of child labor laws is the responsibility of the state governments.
 Enforcement is inadequate, especially in the informal sector where most children
 who work are employed. The continuing prevalence of child labor may be attributed
 to social acceptance of the practice and the failure of the state governments to make
 primary school education compulsory.
 Work by children is completely barred in "hazardous" industries," which include
 passenger, goods, and mail transport by railway; carpet weaving; cinder picking,
 cleaning of ashpits; cement manufacturing; building and construction; cloth print-
 ing-, dyeing and weaving; manufacturing of matches, explosives, fireworks; catering
 within railway premises or port limits; beedi (cigarette) making; mica cutting and
 splitting; abattoirs; wool cleaning;, printing; cashew and cashew nut descaling and
 processing; and soldering processes in electronics industries.
 Industries which utilize child labor include hand-knotted carpets, gemstone
 polishing, brass and base metal articles, glass and glassware, footwear, textiles, silk,
 and fireworks.
 In occupations and processes in which child labor is permitted, work by children
 is permissible only for six hours between 8:00 am and 7:00 pm with one day's week-
 ly rest.
 Primary school education is not compulsory, free, and universal.
 Of a primary school-age population (between the ages of 5 and 14) of approxi-
 mately 205 million, about 120 million children attend school. No significant sectors
 or groups are actively excluded, but the economic reality is that children of more
 well-to-do families are more likely to attend school than those of poor families. Ac-
 cording to a UNDP study conducted in 1993 the drop-out rate from primary school
 was 34 percent.
 Estimates of the number of child laborers range widely. The Government esti-
 mates that there were 17.5 million child workers in 1985. The ILO estimates the
 number at 44 million, while NGO's claim that the figure is 55 million. Interpolation
 of census figures by the National Labor Institute indicates that of a total of 203 mil-
 lion children between the ages of 5 and 14, 116 million are in school, 12.6 million
 are in full time employment, and the status of 74 million is unknown. Most, if not
 all, of the 87 million children not in school do housework, work on family farms,
 work alongside their parents as paid agricultural labor, work as domestic servants,
 or are otherwise employed.
 The United Front Government has continued its predecessors' comprehensive plan
 to eliminate child labor from hazardous industries by the year 2000, and from all
 industries by 2010. This program, for which approximately $260 million has been
 budgeted, includes enhanced enforcement of child labor laws, income supplements
 for families, subsidized school lunches in areas where child labor is concentrated,
 and a public awareness campaign. Recognizing a need to ensure that primary edu-
 cation is made universal and compulsory by state governments, the Government has
 committed itself to making primary education a fundamental constitutional right,
 not merely a directive principle. About 59 percent of school-age children go to school.
 It has also pledged to raise educational expenditures to 6 percent of the budget and
 to spend at least 50 percent of this amount on primary education. The actual pr-
 centage of the union budget spent on education is approximately 2.0 percent. The
 state governments also spend on education, but no comprehensive figure of com-
 bined union-state expenditure is available. A 1993 study commissioned by the
 UNDP estimated that India as a whole (states and union government) devoted
 about 3.7 percent of GNP to education. The NHRC, continuing its own child labor
 agenda, organized NGO programs to provide special schooling, rehabilitation, and
 family income supplements for children in the glass industry in Firozabad. The
 NHRC also intervened in individual cases. A December 10, 1996 Supreme Court de-
 
 
 1656
 cision imposed a penalty of about $570 (20,000 rupees) on persons employing'chil-
 dren in hazardous industries and stipulated that parents or guardians of children
 receive an income supplement payment from a fund created with this money, on
 condition that the children removed from employment attend school. A survey of
 child labor throughout the country ordered by the Supreme Court in this judgment
 was -completed during the year and documented the existence of some 150,000 wage-
 earning child laborers. However, this number understates the true dimension of the
 problem.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The directive principles of the Constitution de-
 clare that "the State shall endeavor to secure. . . to all workers. . . a living wage,
 conditions of work ensuring a decent standard of life and full enjoyment of leisure
 and social and cultural opportunities." Laws set minimum wages, hours of work,
 and safety and .health standards. Laws governing minimum wages and hours of
 work are generally observed in industries subject to the Factories Act but are large-
 ly unenforced elsewhere and do not ensure acceptable conditions of work for the
 nine-tenths of the work force not subject to the Factories Act. Enforcement of safety
 and health standards is lax.
 Minimum wages vary according to the state and sector of industry. Such wages
 are considered adequate only for a minimal standard of living. Most workers em-
 ployed in units subject to the Factories Act receive -much more than the minimum
 wage, including mandated bonuses and other benefits. The state governments set
 a separate minimum wage for agricultural workers but do not enforce it well.
 The Factories Act establishes an 8-hour workday, a 48-hour workweek, and var-
 ious standards for working conditions. These standards are generally enforced and
 accepted in the modern industrial sector, but tend not to be observed in older and
 less economically robust industries. State governments are responsible for enforce-
 ment of the Factories Act. However, the large number of industries covered by a
 small cadre of factory inspectors and their. limited training and susceptibility to
 bribery result in lax enforcement.
 Although occupational safety and health measures vary widely, in general neither
 state nor centralgovernment resources for inspection and enforcement of standards
 are adequate. Safety conditions tend to be better in the EPZ's. The law does not pro-
 vide workers with the right to remove themselves from work situations that endan-
 ger health and safety without jeopardizing their continued employment.
