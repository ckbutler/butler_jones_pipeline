 GREECE
 Greece is a constitutional republic and multiparty parliamentary democracy with
 an independent judiciary in which citizens choose their representatives in free and
 fair elections. The Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) holds a majority of par-
 liamentary seats, and its leader, Constantine Simitis, has been Prime Minister since
 1996. The New Democracy Party is the main opposition party.
 The national police and security services are responsi  or internal security. Ci-
 vilian authorities maintain effective control of all security forces, and police and se-
 curity services are subject to a broad variety of restraints. Some members of the po-
 lice and security forces committed human rights abuses.
 Greece has a market economy with a large public sector that accounts for roughly
 40 percent of gross domestic product. Residents enjoy a relatively advanced stand-
 ard of living. European Union subsidies, grants, andloans, the latter two directed
 mainly toward major infrastructure projects, reinforce government economic devel-
 opment efforts.
 The Government respected the human rights of most citizens, but problems re-
 main in some areas. Security force personnel sometimes abused suspects during ar-
 rests and interrogations and abused illegal aliens. The Government continued to
 take corrective action to relieve severe overcrowding and harsh living conditions in
 some prisons. It continued to use Article 19 of the Citizenship Code to revoke the
 citizenship of Greek citizens who are not ethnically Greek, and Article 20 of the
 same code was used to revoke the citizenship of some Greek citizens abroad who
 asserted a 'Macedonian" ethnicity. On occasion the Government placed inter-
 national and domestic human rights monitors, non-Orthodox religious groups, and
 minority groups under surveillance.
 Some restrictions on freedom of religion persisted; the Government investigated
 and arrested members of non-Orthodox religions for proselytism. Discrimination
 against minorities continued to be a problem. The Government formally recognizes
 only the Muslim minority specified in the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. It refuses to
 acknowledge formally the existence of any other ethnic groups, principally
 Slavophones, under the term "minority." As a result, some individuals who define
 themselves as members of a minority find it difficult to express their identity freely
 and to maintain their culture.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other E.Wrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings.
 
 
 1103
 In February a policeman was charged with homicide for killing an Albanian mi-
 grant in Kastoria who was a passenger in a car that failed to stop when police
 flagged it down. In April a policeman was convicted of manslaughter and exceeding
 the limits of self- defense for shooting and killing a man who did not stop for a rou-
 tine identity check. This marked the first time a policeman has been convicted for
 such an offense in Greece. There were several reports of shootings on the Greek-
 Albanian border during the period of armed unrest in the latter country. An indeter-
 minate number of deaths resulted; the incidents were investigated by local officials.
 In October a policeman shot and killed an Albanian illegal immigrant who alleg-
 edly resisted arrest in Thessaloniki. The policeman claimed that the shooting was
 accidental.
 In 1996 a Romani man was shot and killed by a police officer while lying face
 down on the pavement at a police roadblock in Livadia. The officer was charged
 with involuntary manslaughter. The case was pending at year's end.
 Shipyard owner Constantine Peratikos was shot to death by masked assailants in
 May. The "November 17" terrorist organization claimed responsibility for the killing.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, .or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution specifically forbids torture, and a 1984 law makes the use of tor-
 ture an offense punishable by a sentence of 3 years' to life imprisonment. This law
 has never been invoked. However, security force personnel sometimes abused sus-
 pects during arrests and interrogations and abused illegal aliens.
 Six Albanian immigrants reported that police entered their house and beat them
 in January. A traffic policeman was suspended from duty in January for attacking
 a driver in central Athens. An Albanian illegal immigrant was reportedly shot and
 wounded by police in February; an internal police investigation cleared the police-
 man and the prosecutor declined to press charges. In March three policemen in the
 town of Amfikleia stood trial on charges of beating, torturing, and robbing a group
 of Indian and Pakistani immigrants. Other credible reports of severe beatings of de-
 tainees exist.
 An Evia man filed assault charges against policemen in November 1996 for alleg-
 edly attacking him after he visited a police station to pick up a legal document.
 In the 1996 case of a man beaten by five policemen in Ira lion, four of the officers
 were suspended from duty for 15 days. Charges filed by the individual were still
 pending. The prosecutor dropped a case relating to a man who died in a Vyron po-
 lice detention center in 1996 after concurring with the internal investigation, which
 concluded that the man had died of a heart attack. Charges are still pending from
 a 1996 incident in Thessaloniki in which a man charged with robbery was allegedly
 beaten by police officers.
 Conditions in some prisons remained poor due to substantial overcrowding and
 outdated facilities. The largest prison housed 1,127 inmates, more than double its
 official capacity, through the first 9 months of the year. As of September 1, the Min-
 istry of Justice reported that the total prison population was 5,477 (of whom ap-
 proximately 2,150 were foreigners), while total capacity of the prison system was
 4,332.
 No credible reports emerged of abuses in prisons. In October 80 to 100 illegal im-
 migrants held in the Drapetsona police detention facility staged a hunger strike to
 protest their detention. The Ministry of Justice expanded the prison construction
 program announced in 1996 to include a total of seven new facilities. Construction
 on several of the facilities began during the year.
 No Albanian prisoners were repatriated under the 1995 bilateral agreement be-
 tween Greece and Albania due to the civil unrest that prevailed in Albania for much
 of the year.
 The Government is inconsistent in granting permission for prison visits by non-
 governmental organizations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution requires judicial war-
 rants for all arrests, exept during the actual commission of a crime, and the law
 prohibits arbitrary arrest orders. Police must, by law, bring a person arrested on
 the basis of a warrant or while committing a crime before an examining magistrate
 within 24 hours. The magistrate must issue a detention warrant or order the release
 of the detainee within 3 days, unless special circumstances require a 2-day exten-
 sion of this time limit.
 Defendants brought to court before the end of the day following the commission
 of a charged offense may be tried immediately, under a "speedy procedure." Al-
 though legal safegards, including representation by counsel, apply in speedy proce-
 dure cases, the shortperiod of time may inhibit the defendants ability to present
 an adequate defense. Defendants may ask for a delay to provide time to prepare
 
 
 1104
 their defense, but the court is not obliged to grant it. The speedy procedure was
 used in less than 10 percent of misdemeanor cases. It does not apply to felonies.
 The effective maximum duration of pretrial detention is 18 months for felonies
 and 9 months for misdemeanors. Defense lawyers complain that pretrial detention
 is overly long and overused by judges. A panel of judges may grant release pending
 trial, with or without bail. Pretrial detainees made up 31 percent of those incarcer-
 ated, contributing to overcrowding problems, according to government sources. A
 person convicted of a misdemeanor and sentenced to 2 years or less may, at the
 court's discretion, pay a fine in lieu of being imprisoned.
 Exile is unconstitutional, and no cases have been reported since the restoration
 of democracy in 1974. However, Greek citizens not of ethnic Greek origin who travel
 outside the country may be deprived of their citizenship and refused readmittance
 to the country under Article 19 of the Citizenship Code. Article 20 of the Code per-
 mits the Government to strip citizenship from those who "commit acts contrary to
 the interests of Greece for the benefit of a foreign state." Article 19 was applied in
 50 cases as of the 9 months ending in September, the Government would not pro-
 vide statistics on the number of Article 20 cases it pursued in 1997 (see Section
 2.d.).]
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for the independence
 of the judiciary; recurring public charges suggest that judges sometimes allow politi-
 cal criteria, including the desire to obtain promotion, to influence their judgments.
 The judicial system includes three levels of courts, appointed judges, an examm-
 ingmagstrate system, and trial by judicial panels.
 e onstitution provides for public trials, and trial court sessions are open to
 the public, unless the court decides that privacy is required to protect victims and
 witnesses, or the cases involve national security matters. According to defense attor-
 neys, the latter provision has not been invoked since the restoration of democracy
 in 1974. The defendant enjoys a presumption of innocence, the standard of proof of
 guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the right to present evidence and call witnesses,
 the right of access to the prosecution's evidence, the right to cross-examine wit-
 nesses, and the right to counsel. Lawyers are provided to defendants who are not
 able to afford legal counsel only in felony cases. Both the prosecution and the de-
 fense have the right of appeal.
 Non-Greek speaking defendants have the right to a court-appointed interpreter;
 however, the low fees paid for such work often result in poor translation. Foreign
 defendants who depend on these interpreters frequently complain that they do not
 understand their trials.
 The legal system does not discriminate against women or minorities, with some
 exceptions: Article 19 of the Citizenship Code (see Section 2.d.) applies only to Greek
 citizens who are not ethnically Greek; the Ministry of Education and Religious Af-
 fairs may base its decision on "house of prayer" permit applications by non-Orthodox
 groups on the opinion of the local Orthodox bishop (see Section 2.c.); non-ethnic
 reek citizens are legally prohibited from settling in a large "supervised zone" near
 the frontier (although this prohibition is not enforced in practice); and a 1939 law
 (also not enforced in practice) prohibits the functioning of privat schools in build-
 ings owned by non-Orthodox religious foundations.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits invasion of privacy and searches without warrants, and the
 law permits the monitoring of personal communications only under strict judicial
 controls. However, the number of persons and groups subjected to government sur-
 veillance in recent years raises questions about the efficacy of these safeguards.
 The security services continued to monitor human rights activists, non-Orthodox
 religious groups, minority group representatives, and foreign diplomats who met
 with such individuals. On several occasions, information about such private meet-
 ings was published by the press. Human rights activists also reported the continu-
 ation of suspicious openings and diversions of mail. As far as is known, the Govern-
 ment took no steps to stop such practices or to prosecute those involved.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the Government generally respected these rights in practice, but
 with exceptions. Legal restrictions on free speech remain in force and were used in
 some cases by the Government.
 Articles of the Penal Code that can be used to restrict free speech and the press
 include Article 141, which forbids exposing the friendly relations of the Greek state
 with foreign states to danger of disturbance; Article 191, which prohibits spreading
 false information and rumors liable to create concern and fear among citizens and
 
 
 1105
 cause disturbances in the country's international relations and inciting citizens to
 rivalry and division, leading to disturbance of the peace; and Article 192, which pro-
 hibits inciting citizens to acts of violence or to disturbing the peace through dishar-
 mony among them. No one was imprisoned as a result of such charges during the
 year. Those convicted in the past were allowed to convert their convictions into a
 fine of approximately $14 per day.
 In December Article 191 charges were filed against a Vlach man by New Democ-
 racy M.P. Evgenios Haitidis after an incident in 1995 in which the man was seen
 distributing a brochure of the European Union's Bureau for Lesser Used Languages
 that listed several dialects spoken in Greece.
 The public prosecutor in Florina has invoked these laws on several occasions in
 recent years in attempts to limit the Rainbow Party's use of Slavic names for Greek
 towns. In October the trial of four officers of the Rainbow Party was postponed until
 1998. The charges under Article 192 arose from a 1995 riot over a bilingual sign
 hung outside party headquarters in Florina. The case of a Rainbow Party official
 charged in 1996 under Article 191 for attempting to bring wall calendars into the
 country that identified Greek cities by their Slavic names is scheduled to be heard
 in 1998 as well.
 On matters other than the question of ethnic minorities, Greece generally enjoys
 a tradition of outspoken public discourse and a vigorous free press. Satirical and o
 position newspapers routinely attack the highest state authorities. Members of eth-
 nic, religious, and linguistic minorities freely publish periodicals and other publica-
 tions, often in their native language. The Constitution allows for seizure (though not
 prior restraint), by order of the public prosecutor, of publications that insult the
 President, offend religious beliefs, contain obscene articles, advocate violent over-
 throw of the political system, or disclose military and defense information. Seizures
 have been rare, however, none occurred in 1997.
 In June two journalists were charged with "espionage" for printing a classified
 Government document believed to have been leaked by government officials. The ex-
 amining magistrate imposed $7,000 (2 million drachmas) bail for each of the jour-
 nalists and a travel ban based on "demonstrable proof of guilt." The case is ongoing.
 In July two journalists were each sentenced to 33 months in p rison for "malicious
 defamation" of Minister of Justice Evangelos Yiannopoulos. The criminal charges
 were filed by the public prosecutor based on a complaint from Yiannopoulos regard-
 ing a series of articles published in July and September 1996 that questioned his
 participation in the resistance during the Greek civil war.
 In 1996 Muslim journalist Abdullialim Dede was charged under Article 191 and
 libel laws for an article he wrote about extremist groups in Thrace. In February he
 was acquitted of violating Article 191 but sentenced to 10 months in prison for libel.
 In Jul an appeals court reduced the sentence to 6 months with a 3-year suspen-
 sion. Dede appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, which had not ruled by
 yeais end.
 The Constitution provides that the state exercise "immediate control" over radio
 and television. The state monopoly on radio and television ended in 1989 and a
 plethora of private stations quickly emerged. A 1995 law places ownership and tech-
 nical frequency limits on the electronic media. Until 1997 radio and television sta-
 tions operated either without licenses or with provisional licenses, usually issued by
 local authorities. Licensing of radio stations began in late 1996, but the process of
 licensing television stations only began in September. State-run stations tended to
 emphasize the Government's views but also reported objectively on other parties'
 programs and positions. Private radio and television stations operated independ-
 ently of any Government control over their reporting. Turkish-language television
 programs are widely available via satellite in Thrace.
 The National Radio and Television Council (NRTC), a governmental organization,
 fined the Antenna Television Station $350,000 (100 million drachnmas) and ordered
 it to suspend normal programming for 10 minutes daily for 5 days for "violating the
 code of ethics" and "not protecting juveniles." (The charges stemmed from an episode
 of an Antenna "reality show" that allegedly prompted a man charged with incest
 to commit suicide before the show was broadcast.) The Minister of Press and Mass
 Media approved the Council's decision in September. Antenna appealed the case to
 the Council of State, claiming that the NRTC acted in an extrajudicial manner and
 exceeded the limits of its statutory authority, which authorizes it to revoke or sus-
 pend licenses but is silent on other penalties.
 The Government prosecuted radio Icik, a Turkish-language station in Komotini,
 for operating without a license in 1994 and 1995. At the trial in February, the sta-
 tion argued that operation of a station without a license was so common that pros-
 ecution of radio Icik was unfair. The judge postponed a decision in the case for 14
 months, pending reform by Parliament of laws on radio licensing.
 
 
 1106
 In March an appeals court judge dismissed charges brought against actor Vassilis
 Diamantopolous  and professor George Roussis in 1996 for praising a criminal act"
 in conjunction, with their defense of rioting students on a television talk show. They
 were acquitted in 1996, but thepublic prosecutor appealed the decision.
 Academic freedom is respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly, and the Government respects this right in practice. Police per-
 mits were routinely issued for public demonstrations, and there were no reports that
 the permit requirement was abused.
 The Constitution provides for the right of association, which was respected except
 in cases involving ethnic minorities. In 1996 the European Court of Human Rights
 declared a case regarding the Government's refusal to register the "Macedonian Cul-
 tural Center" in Florina admissible. The European Court is scheduled to hear the
 case in 1998.
 Government authorities legally recognize the existence of the Muslim minority,
 but not other minorities (see Section 5). This is contrary to the 1990 Copenhagen
 document of the then-Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to which
 the Government is a signatory, which asserts that "to belong to a national minority
 is a matter of a person's individual choice."
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution establishes the Eastern Orthodox
 Church of Christ, to which 95 to 97 percent of the population at least nominally ad-
 here, as the prevailing religion. The Orthodox Church wields significant political
 and economic influence. Although the Constitution provides for freedom of religion,
 non-Orthodox groups face legal limits on religious practice. The Constitution also
 prohibits proselytism. Two laws from the 1930's require that to hold services,
 "known" religious groups must obtain a "house of prayer" permit from the Ministry
 of Education and Religion, which by law may base its decision on the opinion of the
 local Orthodox bishop. No formal mechanism exists to seek recognition as a known
 religion.
 In March an appeals court confirmed the 1996 conviction of Hara Kalomiri for op-
 erating a Bhuddist place of worship without a house of rayer permit.
 Following a 1996 European Court of Human Rights decision (Manousakis et al vs.
 Greece) in which the Court ruled that aspects of the house of prayer authorization
 procedure were contrary to Article 9 of the European Convention on the Protection
 of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, Prime Minister Simitis ordered the
 Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs to draft new legislation to adapt Greek
 laws to international human rights norms. Although the legislation has not been fi-
 nalized, Ministry officials say that they no longer obtain the opinion of the local Or-
 thodox bishop when considering "house of prayer" permit applications. According to
 ministry officials, all pending applications have been issued.
 Muslims who live in the Athens area, including immigrants from the Middle East
 and Greek citizens of Turkish origin originally from Thrace, complain that the Gov-
 ernment has hindered their efforts to establish a mosque and a cemetery in the Ath-
 ens area.
 Several religious denominations reported difficulties in dealing with the authori-
 ties on a variety of administrative matters. Privileges and legal prerogatives grant-
 ed to the Greek Orthodox Church are not routinely extended to other recognized re-
 ligions. The non-Greek Orthodox must make separate and lengthy applications to
 government authorities on such matters as arranging appointments to meet with
 Ministry of Education and Religion officials and gaining permission to move places
 of worship to larger facilities.
 A tax bill passed by Parliament in February created three new taxes on churches
 and other nonprofit organizations; "public legal entities" were exempted from the
 property tax requirement. The exemption of the Greek Orthodox Church, a public
 legal entity due to its official status, from the property tax led many observers to
 conclude that the legislation was discriminatory. Leaders of some non-Orthodox reli-
 gious groups claimed that all the taxes were discriminatory, even those that the Or-
 thodox Church had to pay, since the Government subsidized the Orthodox Church
 while other groups were self-su pporting.
 Religious instruction in public primary and secondary schools is mandatory for
 Greek Orthodox students. Non-Orthodox students are exempt from this require-
 ment.
 Police frequently detained Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, and Scientologists after
 receiving complaints that the individuals were engaged in proselytism. In most
 cases, the individuals were held for several hours at a police station and then re-
 leased with no charges filed. Many reported that they were not allowed to call their
 lawyers and that they were verbally abused by police officers for their religious be-
 liefs. Mormon church officials allege that police failed in June to intervene appro-
 
 
 1107
 
 priatelyin two separate cases when missionaries were assaulted on the street in
 central Athens (see Section 5).
 In December 1996, an Athens court revoked the operating permit of KEFE (now
 known as EKDS), the organization representing Scientologists in Greece, on a tech-
 nicality. The group, which the Government does not recognize as a religion, has
 since obtained a new operating permit. The court's decision contained extensive crit-
 icism of Scientology's beliefs and practices; the Scientologists appealed the decision
 in order to have that language invalidated. Since October 1996 the Government has
 summoned 15 members of the boards of KEFE and EKDS to face charges of
 "unrovoked factual insult."
 The Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs launched an investigation into
 the activities of two teachers in Crete who are members of the Church of Christians,
 a nondenominational Protestant church. The men are under investigation for alleg-
 edlyproselytizing their students and for "membership in a para-rehgious organiza-
 tion. In a letter to one of the men, a ministry official stated that the charges were
 based in part on a January episode of a sensationalist television program about the
 Church of Christians. The investigation was still underway at year's end.
 In June Parliament passed a law providing an alternative form of mandatory na-
 tional service for conscientious objectors. The law, which is to take effect in January
 1998, provides that conscientious objectors may work in state hospitals or municipal
 services for 36 months. Conscientious objector gups generally characterized the
 legislation as a "positive first step" but criticized the 36-month alternative service
 term, which is double the regular 18-month period of military service.
 Although Jehovah's Witnesses are recognized as a "known" religion, the military
 has consistently refused to exempt their clergy from mandatory military service.
 This practice was found to be in violation of Articles 5 and 6 of the European Con-
 vention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms by the European Court of
 Human Rights in two ecisions reached in May, Tsirlis and Kouloumpas vs. Greece
 and Georgiadis vs. Greece. While the Government apparently has not yet changed
 its policy as a result of the Court's decisions, no such cases arose during the year.
 Mosques operate freely in Western Thrace and in the islands of Rhodes and Kos,
 where most Greek citizens of the Muslim faith reside. In Xanthiprovince 17 Mus-
 lims arrested in 1996 for ignoring a stop-work order against adding a minaret to
 their mosque were sentenced in January to 4 months in jail. In June an appeals
 court reduced the sentence to 2 months with a 3-year suspension. Renovation of the
 mosque stopped and the congregation was not allowed access to the site. The Gov-
 ernment encouraged the builders to apply for an amended building permit including
 the minaret; the builders refused, claiming to have a valid permit that was not rec-
 ognized due to discrimination. In Octoberlocal officials allowed construction on the
 mosque to resume.
 Under a 1990 presidential decree, the Government appointed two muftis (Islamic
 judges and religious -leaders) and one assistant mufti in Greece, all resident in
 Thrace, based on the recommendations of a committee of local Muslim scholars, reli-
 gious authorities, and community leaders. The Government argued that it must ap-
 point muftis because, in addition to their religious duties, they perform judicial
 functions in many civil and domestic matters under Muslim religious law, for which
 the State pays them.
 The Muslim minority remains divided on the mufti selection issue. Some Muslims
 accept the authority of the two officially appointed muftis; others have chosen two
 different muftis to serve their communities. In November and December, the Gov-
 ernment convicted Mehmet Amin Aga, one of the unofficial muftis, of usurping the
 authority of the official mufti; Aga was convicted six times in 2 years of the same
 offense. The respective sentences were suspended pending appeal.
 A 1980 law placed administration of the "wakfs" (Musin charitable organiza-
 tions) in the hands of the appointed muftis and their representatives. In response
 to objections from some Muslims that this arrangement weakens the financial au-
 tonomy of the wakfs and violates the terms of the Treaty of Lausanne, a 1996 presi-
 dential decree put the wakfs under the administration of a committee for 3 years
 as an interim measure pending resolution of outstanding problems.
 Some non-Greek Orthodox religious leaders assert that their followers face dis-
 crimination in reaching the senior ranks of government service. In the military, gen-
 erally only members of the Greek Orthodox faith become officers, leading some
 members of other faiths to declare themselves Orthodox. Only two Muslim officers
 have advanced to the rank of reserve officer.
 The Government took no further action to implement or repeal a 1991 law man-
 dating that citizens declare their religion on new EU-standardized identity cards
 basec-on European Union (EU) standards, which could be used for internal EU trav-
 el. Current identity cards contain a space for religion which may be left blank.
 
 
 1108
 On December 16, the European Court of Human Rights held unanimously that
 Greek courts had violated Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights
 by refusing to acknowledge that the Canea Catholic church in Crete had legal per-
 sonality and therefore the standing to act in legal proceedings. The Court awarded
 the church $40,000 in court costs and damages. Human rights observers viewed the
 decision as a criticism of government policies toward non-Orthodox religions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation..The Constitution calls for freedom of movement within and outside the
 country and the right to return. However, Article 19 of the Citizenship Code distin-
 guishes between citizens who are ethnic Greeks and those who are not. Most Article
 19 cases involve Muslims from Western Thrace, since only the "Muslim minority"
 is recognized as having non-Greek ethnicity. Citizens who are not ethnic Greeks
 may be deprived of their citizenship if it is determined that they left Greece with
 no apparent intent to return. Determination of intent is made without input from
 the affected individual; in practice, this law is applied to members of the Muslim
 community considered to be "undesirable" by the security services. However, immi-
 grants who are ethnic Greeks are normally recognized as citizens and accorded full
 rights, despite years or even generations of absence.
 The Interior Ministry initiates proceedings under Article 19 on the basis of re-
 ports by local authorities or by Greek embassies or consulates abroad. Affected per-
 sons are not notified of Article 19 hearings and are not permitted to attend. Those
 who lose citizenship as a result of such hearings sometimes learn of this loss only
 when they seek to reenter Greece. According to the Ministry of the Interior, 50 per-
 sons lost Greek citizenship under Article 19 as of September (compared with 84 at
 the same time in 1996). Of this number, the Government claims that 36 voluntarily
 relinquished their citizenship (compared with 35 in 1996). Recent Government sta-
 tistics indicate that over 7,000 individuals were stripped of their citizenship between
 1981 and 1996. Between 1981 and 1991, Article 19 was applied an average of 570
 times per year;, from 1992 to 1996, it was applied an average of 164 times per year.
 Persons who lose their citizenship under Article 19 have the right of "administra-
 tive appeal" to the Interior Ministry; they can also appeal to the Council of State
 and to the Council of Europe. Leaders of the Muslim community complained that
 the time and expense involved tended to discourage such appeals. In addition some
 persons who lose their citizenship under Article 19 do not discover that fact until
 appeals deadlines have passed. Human rights observers report that an unspecified
 number of individuals, possibly as many as 2,000, who have been stripped of their
 citizenship under Article 19 actually live in Greece. As the Government has not is-
 sued the affected individuals any alternative form of identity document, they find
 it difficult or impossible to travel abroad and to obtain government services.
 Another section of the Citizenship Code, Article 20, permits the Government to
 strip citizenship from those who "commit acts contrary to the interests of Greece for
 the benefit of a foreign state." While the law as written applies equally to all Greeks
 regardless of ethnic background, to date it has been enforced only against citizens
 who identified themselves as members of the "Macedonian" minority. The Govern-
 ment would not reveal the number of Article 20 cases it pursued in 1997. Dual citi-
 zens who are stripped of Greek citizenship under Article 20 are frequently pre-
 vented from entering the country using the passport of their second nationality.
 Greece maintains restricted military zones along its borders. Until 1995 authori-
 ties controlled entry into the zone along the northern border with Bulgaria even for
 local residents, causing the mostly Pomak inhabitants of the region to complain that
 their freedom of movement was restricted. The Government removed the sole re-
 maining checkpoint into the village of Exinos in 1995 and no longer enforces the
 entry restrictions for citizens. Regulations concerning the zone remain in force for
 foreigners, however, and in 1997 several were refused official permission to enter
 the zone.
 Ethnic Greek immigrants, including those who came from the former Soviet
 Union since 1986, normally qualify promptly for citizenship and special assistance
 from the Government. The returnees were settled initially in Western Thrace, where
 government programs encouraging them to remain have met with limited success.
 most move to Athens, Thessaloniki, or other cities, where job prospects are better.
 The Government offers asylum under the terms of the 1951 Geneva Convention.
 It cooperates with the local office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Par-
 liament passed new legislation in 1996 amending-the sections of the Aliens Act that
 relate to refugees an[ asylum. The legislation is scheduled to be implemented in
 1998, after necessary presidential decrees are completed. The new legislation abol-
 ished the requirement that asylum seekers submit their applications immediately
 after entering the country.
 
 
 1109
 Individuals recognized as refugees under the terms of the Geneva Convention are
 eligible for residence and work permits necessary to resettle permanently. In the
 first 8 months of 1997, 2,369 individuals submitted applications for refugee status,
 an almost three-fold increase over the corresponding period in 1996. Eighty-five in-
 dividuals were recognized as refugees during the first 8 months of the ear, of those
 refused refugee status, 38 were granted temporary residence on humanitarian
 grounds until return to their countries of origin becomes possible.
 Credible reports indicated that the Government at times deported asylum seekers
 back to their country of origin before they could submit formal applications for asy-
 lum.
 The Government does not recogize the concept of first asylum. Thousands of in-
 dividuals from Turkey, Iraq, andnra enter Greece illegally each year; only a small
 percentage eventually apply for official refugee status. Some of those who do not
 atpply remain illegally, often living in government camps where conditions vary from
 adequate to very poor. Others proceed on to Western Europe, often applying for asy-
 lum there. The Government does not usually seek out such individuals for deporta-
 tion; as Greece and Turkey do not have a readmission agreement, the Government
 finds it practically impossible to deport individuals who enter Greece from Turkey.
 In June Greece and Albania exchanged instruments of ratification for the seasonal
 employment agreement signed in 1996 in an effort to regularize the status of the
 approximately 250,000 Albanians working illegally in Greece.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Greece is a multiparty democracy in which the Constitution provides for full polit-
 ical rights for all citizens and for the peaceful change of governments and of the
 Constitution. The Government headed by Prime Minister Constantine Simitis of the
 Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) won in free and fair elections in Septem-
 ber 1996. Parliament elects the President for a 5-year term. Voting is man ato
 for those over age 18, but there are many conditions that allow one not to vote, and
 penalties are not applied in practice. Members of the unicameral 300-seat Par-
 liament are elected to maximum 4-year terms by secret ballot. Opposition parties
 function freely and have broad access to the media.
 Although there are no legal restrictions on the participation of women or minori-
 ties in government or politics, representation of both at the higher levels of political
 life remains low. Women held 2 ministerial positions in the Government and only
 1 of 29 subministerial positions. Of the 300 members of Parliament, 17 were women.
 Women are underrepresented in the leadership of the two largest parties. The head
 of the Communist Party is a woman.
 While the Government generally respects citizens' political rights, there are some-
 times charges that it limits the right of some individuals to speak publicly and asso-
 ciate freely on the basis of their self-proclaimed ethnic identity, thus impinging on
 the political rights of such persons. In the 1996 parliamentary elections, however,
 three Muslim deputies were elected in Thrace, one each from PASOK, New Democ-
 racy, and the Coalition of the Left. Romani representatives report that local authori-
 ties sometimes deprive Roma of the right to vote by refusing to register them.
 In 1996 the Government transferred responsibility for oversight of all rights guar-
 anteed to the Muslim minority under the Treaty of ausanne (including education,
 zoning, administration of the wakfs, and trade) from elected local governors to the
 government-appointed  periferiarch  of Eastern  Macedonia  and   Thrace. The
 periferiarh is a regional administrative official appointed by the Government. Mi-
 nority members charged that the transfer reduced their ability to use the democratic
 process to influence decisions that affect them. They also charged that the transfer
 opened the possibility of unequal application of local laws, because it created a situ-
 ation in which Muslims and non-Muslims must go to different government offices
 to apply for documents such as building permits. The Government stated that it
 made the change because Greece's treaty obligations could be administered more ef-
 fectively by the central authorities.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government allows domestic human rights organizations to operate, but co-
 operation with them varies. In principle it does not prohibit foreign diplomats from
 meeting with officials and other citizens, including critics of official policy. However,
 the security services on occasion monitor contacts of human rights groups, including
 listening i  n conversations held between those groups and human rights  ives-
 tigators and diplomats. The security services have also questioned monitors' inter-
 locutors in the aftermath of meetings, reports of which have subsequently appeared
 
 
 1110
 in the press. Official government documents regarding the activities of human
 rights monitors have afse been cited in the press. Monitors view this activity as a
 form of intimidation that deters others from meeting with investigators.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equality before the law and the full protection of
 individual life, honor, and freedom irrespective of nationality, race, language, or reli-
 gious or political belief. Government respect for these rights in practice is uneven.
 Women.-The incidence of violence against women that is reported to the authori-
 ties is low, but Athens' Equality Secretariat, which operates the only shelter for bat-
 tered women, believes the actual incidence is "high." According to the Ministry of
 Public Order, 183 cases of rape were reported in 1996 (latest statistics available).
 The General Secretariat for Equality of the Sexes (GSES), an independent govern-
 ment agency, asserts that police tend to discourage women from pursuing domestic
 violence charges and instead undertake reconciliation efforts, although they are nei-
 ther qualified for nor charged with this task. The GSES also claims that the courts
 are lenient when dealing with domestic violence cases.
 A government shelter and a residential facility for battered women and their chil-
 dren provide relevant services in Athens, including legal and psychological advice.
 Battered women can also go to state hospitals and regional health centers, although
 these facilities are often not adequately staffed to handle such cases properly.
 According to the police, trafficking in women for prostitution, mostly from the
 former Soviet Union, Albania, Bulgaria, and Romania, has increased sharply in re-
 cent years. The MPO reports that of the 185 foreigners arrested for prostitution
 without a license in the first 9 months of 1997, 50 were from Albania and 78 were
 from the former Soviet Union. Police estimate that foreigners constitute 2,000 of the
 5,000 prostitutes in Greece.
 Women enjoy broad constitutional and legal protections, including equal pay for
 equal work. However, the GSES and the unions maintain that women receive lower
 salaries overall than men because they are hired for lower-level jobs. The National
 Statistical Service's most recent data (the fourth quarter of 1996) show that wom-
 en's salaries in manufacturing were 69 percent of those of men in comparable posi-
 tions; in retail sales, women's salaries were 85 percent of those of men in com-
 parable positions. These same groups claim that women face a "glass ceiling" when
 they are considered for promotions in both the public and private sectors. Although
 there are still relatively few women in senior positions, in recent years women have
 entered traditionally male-dominated occupations such as the legal and medical pro-
 fessions in larger numbers.
 Children.-The Government is committed to providing adequate basic health and
 education services for children. Education is compulsory through the ninth grade
 and free through university. Penal law prohibits the mistreatment of children and
 sets penalties for violators, while welfare legislation enacted in 1992 established
 preventive and treatment programs for abused children and for children deprived
 of a family environment; it also sought to ensure the availability of alternative fam-
 ily care or institutional placement.
 Several government organizations have responsibility for children's issues. The
 National Welfare Organization, which has a nationwide network of offices, is active
 in the field of child protection. The General Secretariat for Youth, a part of the Min-
 istry of Education and Religious Affairs, is conducting a campaign to encourage so-
 cial and political participation by the young and to promote the rights of children
 and youth.
 According to the Institute of Child Health (ICH), a research center under the Min-
 istry of Health and Welfare, physical punishment is widely regarded as a socially
 acceptable method of disciplining children. In a recent ICH study, 65% of mothers
 and 55% of fathers told surveyors that they punished their children physically. The
 use of such measures has decreased over the years as parents have learned about
 alternatives forms of punishment. There is no societal pattern of abuse of children.
 No national data exist on the incidence rate of child abuse, as local authorities
 are not obligated to report such cases. In a 10-year clinical study of 200 cases, the
 ICH reports that 59.5% involved physical abuse, 20% involved neglect, and 21% in-
 volved children who were not abused at the time but had a history of abuse. (The
 study did not cover victims of sexual abuse.) An ICH prevalence study of child sex-
 ual abuse among 740 university students revealed an incidence rate of 7% among
 boys and 17% among girls prior to age 18. Societal abuse of children in the form
 of pornography and child labor is rare. Child prostitution is a growing phenomenon,
 particularly in some parts of central Athens.
 
 
 1111
 Child health specialists say that some social groups, such as Roma and illegal im-
 migrants, are underserved. Children's rights advocacy groups claim that protection
 of high-risk children in state residential care centers is inadequate and of low qual-
 ity. They cite lack of coordination between welfare services and the courts, inad-
 equate funding of the welfare system, and poor staffing of residential care centers
 as systemic weaknesses in child abuse prevention and treatment efforts. Child
 health specialists note that the number of children in residential care facilities is
 decreasing, while the number in foster cE re is rising.
 In recent years, the number of street children who panhandle or peddle at city
 intersections on behalf of adult family members or for criminal gangs has increased.
 Many such street children in the Athens area are Albanian. Police occasionally
 round up these children and take them to state or charitable institutions that care
 for wayward children. Parents can reclaim their children but risk deportation if they
 are illegal immigrants.
 Pegople With isabilities.-Legislation mandates the hiring of disabled persons in
 public and private enterprises employing more than 50 persons. However, the law
 is reportedly poorly enforced, particularly in the private sector. The law states that
 disabled persons should number 3 percent of staff in private enterprises. In the civil
 service, 5 percent of administrative staff and 80 percent of telephone operator posi-
 tions are reserved for disabled persons. Persons with disabilities have been ap-
 pointed to importantpositions in the civil service.
 The Construction Code mandates physical access for disabled persons to private
 and public buildings, but this law too is poorly enforced. Ramps and special curbs
 for the disabled have been constructed on some Athens streets and at some public
 buildings, and sound signals have been installed at some city street crossings. Since
 1993 the Government has been replacing old city buses with new ones with stairs
 specially designed for the disabled. The new Athens subway lines under construction
 reportedly were designed to provide full access for the disabled.
 Religious Minorities.-In August the Council of State ruled that individuals who
 "explicitly state that they adhere to a dogma or religion the beliefs of which would
 prevent the fulfillment of their duties" can legally be excluded fron the national fire
 brigade. Human rights observers criticized the decision as a dangerous precedent al-
 lowing religious discrimination in public sector hiring.
 Jehovah's Witness leaders report that their members experienced difficulty ob-
 taining permission to bury their dead in public cemeteries.
 In June Mormon missionaries were assaulted by passersby in two incidents on the
 street in central Athens; police allegedly failed to intervene. Mormon church officials
 criticized the police response (see Section 2.c.).
 In March a Jewish cemetery in Trikala was severely vandalized. Jewish commu-
 nity leaders report that the Ministry of Public Order at first declined to investigate
 the incident. An investigation was eventually launched that has produced no results
 to date. Leaders of the Jewish community have lobbied the Government for several
 years to delete anti-Semitic references from public school textbooks. The Ministry
 of Education and Religion agreed to delete all such references as new editions were
 published, and established a committee to identify such references. Only one of the
 six anti-Semitic references identified by the committee was deleted from the new
 textbook editions published in 1996.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-There are communities that identify them-
 selves as Turks, Pomaks, Vlachs, Roma, Arvanites (ethnic Albanians), and "Macedo-
 nians" or "Slavomacedonians." Most are fully integrated into society. The Govern-
 ment formally recognizes only the "Muslim minority" specified in the 1923 Treaty
 of Lausanne, applying the term to several different ethnic communities. Most of the
 Muslim minority (officially estimated at 120,000 persons) is ethnically Turkish or
 Turcophone and lives in Western Thrace. The Muslim minority also includes
 Pomaks and Roma. Many Greek Muslims, including Pomaks, identify themselves as
 Turks and say that the Muslim minority as a whole has a Turkish cultural con-
 sciousness. While use of the term "tourkos" ("Turk") is prohibited in titles of organi-
 zations, individuals may legally call themselves "tourkos." To most Greeks, the word
 "tourkos" connotes Turkish identity or loyalties, and many object to its use by Greek
 citizens of Turkish origin. Use of a similar adjective, "tourkoyennis" (of Turkish de-
 scent, affiliation, or ethnicity) is, however, allowed. In June a dozen Muslim teach-
 ers were each sentenced to 8 months in prison for using the term "Turkish teachers
 of Western Thrace" in signing a union document. Their sentences were suspended
 pending appeal.
 he Treaty of Lausanne provides that the Muslim minority has the right to Turk-
 ish-language education, with a reciprocal entitlement for the Greek minority in Is-
 tanbul (now reduced to about 3,000). Western Thrace has both Koranic and secular
 Turkish-language schools. Government disputes with Turkey over teachers and text-
 
 
 1112
 books caused these secular schools serious problems in obtaining faculty and teach-
 ing materials in sufficient number and quality. Under a 1952 educational protocol,
 Greece and Turkey may annually exchange 35 teachers on a reciprocal basis. The
 teachers serve in Istanbul and Western Thrace, respectively, but in recent years the
 Greek side limited the exchanges to 16 teachers per country due to the dwindling
 needs of the small and a*g   Greek population in Turkey. In Greece over 9,000
 Muslim chldren attended         ang age primary schools. Approximately 650 at-
 tended Turkish-language secondary schools, and approximately 1,000 attended
 Greek-language secondary schools. Many Muslims reportedly went to high school in
 Turkey due to the limited number of places in the Turkish-language secondary
 schools, which are assigned by lottery.
 In 1995 the Government enacted several measures designed to improve the edu-
 cational situation of Muslims in Thrace. Incentives were created to encourage Mus-
 lim and Christian educators to reside and teach in isolated villages. The law also
 permits the Minister of Education to give special consideration to Muslims for ad-
 mission to universities and technical institutes. The law required universities and
 technical institutes to create a certain number of places for Muslim students each
 year, in 1997, 334 spaces were available. The admission exams were taken by 120
 Muslim students, and 114 were accepted into universities and technical schools. Mi-
 nority sources indicate that the success rate of students accepted in 1996 was low.
 The rate of employment of Muslims in the public sector and in state-owned indus-
 tries and corporations is much lower than the Muslim percentage of the population.
 In Xanthi and Komotini, while Muslims hold seats on the prefectural and town
 councils, there are no Muslims among the regular employees of the prefecture. Mus-
 lims in Thrace claim that they are hired only for lower level, part-time work. The
 Government says that lack of fluency in written and spoken Greek and the need
 for university degrees for high-level positions limit the number of Muslims eligible
 for government jobs. In 1997-, for the first time, a Muslim-owned company received
 one of the government subsidies offered to corporations establishing or expanding
 business oprations in Thrace.
 Public o ices in Thrace do their business in Greek; the courts provide interpreters
 as needed. The office of the nomarch (governor) in Rodopi province, where many eth-
 nic Turks live, has Turkish-language interpreters available. In November, however,
 a prosecutor in Rodopi ordered the Komotini registrar to stop accepting documents
 sealed by the government-appointed muftis unless the language of the documents
 is Greek. He also ordered the registrar to reject as unsealed any documents bearing
 the Arabic-lettered seals used by the muftis for the last 70 years.
 Claims of discriminatory denial of Muslim applications for business licenses, trac-
 tor ownership, or property construction have diminished greatly in recent years. De-
 velopment of basic public services (electricity, telephones, paved roads) in Muslim
 neighborhoods and villages, however, continues in many cases to lag far behind that
 of non-Muslim areas.
 Other than in one multicultural education 'pilot school,' the Government does not
 provide instruction in Greek as a second language to Turcophone children in the
 Athens area. Muslim parents report that their children are unable to succeed in
 school as a result of this policy. The Government maintains that Muslims outside
 of Thrace are not covered by the Treaty of Lausanne and therefore do not enjoy
 those rights guaranteed by the treaty.
 In February a group of youths threw rocks at a mosque in Rodopi province during
 prayers, causing minor damage. Four people were injured in the ensuing scuffle.
 The incident did not appear to be related to the organized anti-mosque violence of
 previous years. Authorities who investigated the incident attributed it to intoxicated
 juvenile delinquents. However, Muslims continued to face governmental and societal
 discrimination.
 Members of the Muslim minority on the Dodecanese islands of Rhodes and Kos
 are much more integrated into local society.
 Northern Greece is home to an indeterminate number (estimates range widely,
 from under 10,000 to 50,000 or more) of citizens who are descended from
 Slavophones. Some still speak a Slavic dialect, particularly in Floina province. A
 small number of them identify themselves as belonging to a distinct ethnic group,
 which they call "Macedonian, and assert their right to minority status. (these self-
 described ethnic "Macedonians" are hereafter referred to as "Macedonians. ") This
 assertion generates strong objections among the 2.2 million ethnically and linguis-
 tically Greek inhabitants of the northern Greek region of Macedonia, who also use
 the term to identify themselves. The Government reuses to recognize the Slavic dia-
 lect as "Macedonian" and denies that it is a language distinct from Bulgarian. Gov-
 ernment officials in Florina have used laws against "inciting rivalry and division"
 to block the use of Slavic place-names and other terms in public (see Section 2.a.)
 
 
 1113
 
 Greek sensitivity on this issue stems from concern that members of the "Macedo-
 nian" minority may have separatist aspirations. Greece's dispute with the former
 Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia over that country's name heightened this sensitiv-
 ity.
 Government harassment and intimidation of some of these people, which has in-
 cluded denngther right to association (see Section 2.b.), monitoring activists'
 meetings withhumn rights investigators (see Section 2.d.), and accusing activists
 publicly of being agents of a foreign Government, continues at a reduced level. Fear
 of loss of employment or other sanctions leads some Greeks who consider themselves
 "Macedonian not to declare it openly. Activists also complain of limited access to
 the press, although there is no evidence that the Government pressures the media
 not to cover the issue.
 Roma frequently face discrimination in employment and in housing, particularly
 when attempting to rent accommodations. They experience police abuse more fre-
 quently than some other groups, particularly when police raid entire Roma camps
 based on a warrant to arrest one individual.
 The General Secretariat for Adult Education (GSAE), a government agency, esti-
 mated the Romani population to be 150,000 to 200,000 in 1997. Nonofficial sources
 estimate the total at 250,000 to 300,000. Most of the Roma in Western Thrace are
 Muslim; elsewhere, the majority are Greek Orthodox. Almost half are permanently
 settled, mainly in the Athens area. The other half are mobile, working mainly as
 agricultural laborers, peddlers, and musicians throughout the country. The GSAE
 reports that the number of Roma who move around the country is gradually de-
 creasing as families settle into slums in the suburbs of major cities. Government
 policy is to encourage the integration of Roma. Poverty, illiteracy, and social preju-
 dice continue to plague large parts of the Romani population; these problems are
 most severe among the Roma who are mobile or who live in slums. The GSAE con-
 ducts education and training programs for the Romani population. The illiteracy
 rate among Roma is estimated at 80 percent. The Ministry of Education established
 a system of identity cards designed to permit students to change schools easily as
 their parents move and is developing a system of satellite schools for Romani settle-
 ments.
 The integration of Roma into public social security systems is quite low. It is esti-
 mated that 90 percent of Roma are not insured by the public social security systems,
 as they are unable or unwilling to make the required contributions. Like all Greek
 citizens, the Roma are entitled to free emergency health care. Their access to health
 care is at times hindered by the fact that their encampments are located far from
 public health facilities.
 In April the mayor of Ano Liossia ordered the eviction of 100 Romani families liv-
 ing on private land next to the landfill that serves the greater Athens area. Accord-
 ing to human rights observers and Roma, the residents were given only a few hours
 notice to remove their possessions before bulldozers leveled their shacks. Roma
 claim that there had been a Romani encampment on the site for 15 years and criti-
 cized the short notice and apparently arbitrary nature of the eviction.
 Projects announced in 1996 to improve Romani living conditions have not yet been
 implemented. The Prime Minister has designated a member of his staff to coordi-
 nate the efforts of all government ministries having a role in the integration of
 Roma.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and subsequent legislation provide
 for the right of association. All workers, with the exception of the military, have the
 right to form or join unions. Police have the right to form unions but not to strike.
 Approximately 30 percent of workers (nearly 1 million persons) were organized in
 unions. Unions receive most of their funding from a Ministry of Labor organization,
 the Workers' Hearth, which distributes mandatory contributions from employees
 and employers. Workers, employers, and the state are represented in equal numbers
 on the board of directors of the Workers' Hearth. Only the five most powerful public
 sector unions have dues-withholding provisions in their contracts, in addition to re-
 ceiving Workers' Hearth subsidies.
 Over 4,000 unions are grouped into regional and sectoral federations and two um-
 brella confederations, one for civil servants and one, the General Confederation of
 Greek Workers (GSEE), for private sector employees. Unions are highly politicized,
 and there are party-affiliated factions within the labor confederations, but day-to-
 day operations are not controlled by political parties or the Government. There are
 no restrictions on who may serve as a union official.
 Legal restrictions on strikes include a mandatory period of notice, which is 4 days
 for public utilities and 24 hours for the private sector. Legislation mandates a skele-
 
 
 1114
 
 ton staff during strikes affecting public services, such as electricity, transportation,
 communications, and banking. Public utility companies, state-owned banks, the
 postal service, Olympic Airways, and the railroads are also required to maintain a
 skeleton staff during strikes.
 The courts have the power to declare strikes illegal, although such decisions are
 seldom enforced. Unions complain, however, that this judicial power serves as a de-
 terrent to some of their membership from participating in strikes. In 1997 the
 courts declared a majority of strikes illegal for reasons such as failure of the union
 to give adequate advance notice of the strike, or the addition of demands by the
 union during the course of the strike. No striking workers were prosecuted, how-
 ever.
 Unions are free to join international associations and maintain a variety of inter-
 national affiliations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Legislation provides for the
 right to organize and bargain collectively in the private sector and in public corpora-
 tions. These rights are respected in practice. There are no restrictions on collective
 bargaining for private sector employees. The union of civil servants negotiates with
 the Office of the Minister to the Prime Minister.
 In response to union complaints that most labor disputes ended in compulsory ar-
 bitration, legislative remedies were enacted in 1989 providing for mediation proce-
 dures, with compulsory arbitration as a last resort. The legislation establishing a
 national mediation, reconciliation, and arbitration organization went into effect in
 1992 and applies to the private sector and public corporations (the military and civil
 service excluded).
 Antiunion discrimination is prohibited. The labor inspectorate or a court inves-
 tigates complaints of discrimination against union members or organizers. Court
 rulings have mandated the reinstatement of improperly fired union organizers.
 Three free trade zones operate according to European Union regulations. The
 labor laws apply equally in these zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits all
 forced or compulsory labor, including that performed by children, and the Ministry
 of Justice enforces this prohibition. However, the Government may declare the "civil
 mobilization" of workers in the event of danger to national security, life, property,
 or the social and economic life of the country. The International labor Organization
 (ILO) Committee of Experts has criticized this power as violating the standards of
 ILO Convention 29 on forced labor.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Con-
 stitution contains a blanket prohibition of compulsory labor. Although no specific
 legislation explicitly prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, such practices
 are not known to occur. The minimum age for employment in the industrial sector
 is 15, with higher limits for certain activities. The minimum age is 12 in family
 businesses, theaters, and the cinema. These age limits are enforced by occasional
 Labor Inspectorate spot checks and are generally respected. However, families en-
 gaged in agriculture, food service, and merchandising often have younger family
 members assisting them, at least part time.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Collective bargaining between the GSEE and
 the Employers' Association determines a nationwide minimum wage. The Ministry
 of Labor routinely ratifies this minimum wage, which has the force of law and ap-
 plies to all workers. The minimum wage of $22 (Dr 6,000) daily and $495 (Dr
 133,962) monthly, effective July 1, is sufficient for a decent standard of living for
 a worker and family. The maximum legal workweek is 40 hours in the private sec-
 tor and 3712 hours in the public sector. The law provides for at least one 24-hour
 rest period per week, mandates paid vacation of 1 month per year, and sets limits
 on overtime.
 Legislation provides for minimum standards of occupational health and safety. Al-
 though the GSEE characterized health and safety legislation as satisfactory, it
 charged that enforcement, the responsibility of the Labor Inspectorate, was inad-
 equate. The ILO urged the Government to put the Labor Inspectorate under central
 authority in order to comply with ILO Convention 81. Workers do not have the legal
 right to remove themselves from situations they believe endanger their health. They
 do have the right, however, to lodge a confidential complaint with the Labor
 Inspectorate. Inspectors have the right to close down machinery or a process for a
 period of up to 5 days if they see safety or health hazards that they believe rep-
 resent an imminent danger to the workers.
