 CAMBODIA
 Cambodia completed its first full year under democratic rule after 20 years of un-
 democratic regimes and civil war. The transition to democracy followed the signing
 of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords by Cambodia's rival factions and a peace process
 overseen by the U.N. Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC). This process
 culminated in the May 1993 multiparty election sponsored by the United Nations.
 The U.N. certified the election as free and fair, although polling in areas controlled
 by the Khmer Rouge was not possible. The royalist party FUNCINPEC entered into
 a coalition with the other parties that participated in the election, including the
 Cambodian People's Party (CPP), which had ruled the country since 1979 following
 the ouster of the Khmer Rouge (KR) regime by the Vietnamese. In September 1993
 a new Constitution was promulgated, establishing a constitutional monarchy with
 King Sihanouk as Head of State. The leader of FUNCINPEC, Prince Norodom
 Ranariddh, and CPP leader Hun Sen became First and Second Prime Ministers re-
 spectively.
 The Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF) are composed of former members of
 the armies of the factions that implemented the Paris accords. The RCAF continued
 to face a mostly low-level armed insurgency by the Khmer Rouge, who signed the
 Paris Accords but refused to implement them by demobilizing, opening their illegal
 zones, or partici pting in the elections. Although the KR have only a small number
 of troops, the effectiveness of the RCAF in combating the KR was marred by corrup-
 tion, lack of materiel, over staffing at senior levels, poor leadership, and the Govern-
 ment's inability to pay troops a living wage. The RCAF drafted and began imple-
 mentation of a reform plan in September. The Government announced plans to inte-
 grate the police forces, which are composed mostly of CPP staff, by appointing per-
 sonnel from other parties. The Interior Ministry began to carry out this plan in the
 latter part of the year.
 Although the economy depends largely on subsistence rice farming, Cambodia has
 a market economy. It was a radical Communist agrarian state under the Khmer
 Rouge, and had a centrally planned economy for most of the time of Vietnamese-
 backed rule, known as the State of Cambodia (SOC) period. Cambodia is primarily
 agrarian and very poor, with a per capita gross domestic product of approximately
 $200.
 The human rights climate was better than in past years, with a relatively open
 political atmosphere, a vigorous press, and an active human rights community.
 Cambodia continued, however to suffer from many problems, including the ongoing
 threat of the KR insurgency. in July there was a failed coup attempt. There contin-
 ued to be sporadic reports of political intimidation and of murders that appeared
 to be politically motivated. Emerging democratic institutions, particularly the judici-
 ary, were weak. The ethnic Vietnamese minority faced widespread discrimination,
 
 
 549
 sporadic attacks leading to numerous casualties, and uncertain legal status. There
 were credible reports that individual members of government security forces com-
 mitted serious human rights abuses, including instances of extrajudicial killing. In
 many cases the Government lacked the resources or the political will to act aggres-
 sively against individuals who were responsible for such abuses. Women and people
 with disabilities, in principle protected under the Constitution, in fact faced dis-
 crimination.
 In areas they control, the Khmer Rouge denied citizens most basic human rights.
 There were confirmed reports that the KR summarily executed large numbers of ci-
 vilians, including Cambodians, Thais, Western tourists, and Vietnamese fishermen.
 The dead and wounded also included women and children.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kllling.-There was no evidence of orches-
 trated violence by the Government. However, there were credible reports that indi-
 vidual members of government security forces, including members of the RCAF,
 committed extrajudicial killings. In December, an RCAF Colonel was arrested in
 connection with the killing o a journalist. (See detail below.) There were several
 other murders committed by as yet unidentified assailants that appeared to be po-
 litically motivated. The authorities made few arrests in connection with these
 crimes, due to a combination of ineffectiveness of law enforcement and in some cases
 an intentional lack of prosecutorial vigor.
 There were numerous allegations of civilians killed by RCAF troops in various
 p arts of Cambodia, particularly in areas in the Northwest where fighting with the
 Khmer Rouge was heaviest. One KR soldier was reportedly beheaded after interro-
 gation (see Section 1.g.). In the provice of Kratie, a civilian court convicted three
 provincial soldiers of voluntary manslaughter after they killed three villagers in
 April. Two of the soldiers were sentenced to 13 years; one was sentenced to ten
 years.
 In November a Thai worker on a USAID construction project was killed when sol-
 diers fired upon the convoy in which he was traveling. The police questioned several
 persons in connection with the case, but it is unclear whether any arrests had been
 made by year's end.
 On April 19, Ang Kouy, the third-ranking FUNCINPEC party official in Kampot
 province, and his nephew, were killed at close-rnge by unknown assailants. Accord-
 ing to well-informed observers Ang had been threatened by district officials and be-
 lieved his life was in danger. 1o suspects were arrested in the case. Human rights
 organizations asserted that there was strong evidence that local officials killed Ang
 Kouy.
 On September 7 Nuon Chan, editor of the Voice of Khmer Youth newspaper, was
 shot to death in Phnom Penh. His newspaper had been highly critical of government
 authorities of all parties and his killing may have been politically motivated. In Sep-
 tember the police arrested two suspects in connection with the murder. The inves-
 tigating judge issued a statement that there was no evidence against the two per-
 sons and that a confession from one of them had been coerced. However, the case
 was returned to the investigating judge for further investigation. No trial had taken
 place at year's end.
 According to human rights groups, a guard at Kampot provincial prison shot and
 killed two prisoners who had surrendered after an escape attempt in May. The
 guard was not prosecuted. Human rights groups alleged there were several other
 instances which resulted in the deaths of prisoners in which prison officials used
 excessive force.
 In December, journalist Chan Dara was fatally shot in the city of Kompong Chain.
 RCAF Colonel Sath Souen, who was with Chan Dara at the time, was arrested for
 the killing. There was widespread speculation that Dara was killed in retaliation
 for publishing allegations about corruption involving Kompong Chain's rubber in-
 dustry. Sath Souen had not been tried by year's end.
 Human rights groups presented credible evidence that the military killed at least
 35 persons during the second half of 1993 at an illegal detention facility known as
 Cheu Kmau in a remote part of Battambang province. Human rights observers be-
 lieve one more detainee was killed at Cheu Kmau in January 1994.
 Attacks on ethnic Vietnamese continued throughout the year, resulting in numer-
 ous deaths and injuries. In April unknown assailants using grenades and AK-47s
 attacked a Vietnamese village in Kandal province leaving 14 civilians dead and over
 20 wounded.
 
 
 The Khmer Rouge continued to execute summarily civilians in areas under its
 control. (See Section Ig.) In July KR forces killed nine people in a train ambush.
 In October Khmer Rouge radio announced that the KR had made a policy decision
 to engage in the systematic execution of Government officials in the countryside.
 Since then several officials have been killed by the KR, and others have been taken
 hostage or had their houses burned. The KR have kidnaped and killed other villag-
 ers as well. The Khmer Rouge have also broadcast threats to kidnap foreigners, par-
 ticularly Americans French, and Australians, and have implied that foreigners cap-
 tured would be killed. In November the Government found the remains of three
 Westerners taken hostage and subsequently executed by the Khmer Rouge during
 the July train attack. Also in November, Khmer Rouge guerrillas were responsible
 for the massacre of 51 Cambodian villagers and, in a separate attack for which the
 KR is widely considered responsible, at least 21 Thai loggers, in border areas inside
 Cambodia.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 However, people frequently disappeared temporarily including some wh6 were ab-
 ducted by the KR for short periods. There was no reliable mechanism for determin-
 ing when or whether these people reappeared. Several such cases remained un-
 solved, like that of the three Vietnamese abducted with the Westerners in the July
 train attack.
 The disappearances of 17 political party activists before the May 1993 election
 which UNTAC attributed to authorities of the former State of Cambodia, remained
 unsolved. Human rights groups suspect these missing activists were killed by mem-
 bers of the SOC security forces. There were no new disappearance cases of this na-
 ture in 1994, although people, including individuals abducted by the Khmer Rouge,
 were often temporarily unaccounted for in Cambodia.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Government does not systematically use torture, but there were credible reports
 that security officials physically abused criminal detainees, particularly during in-
 terrogations. There were credible allegations that in 1993 and possibly in early 1994
 members of the security forces tortured prisoners in the secret detention center,
 Cheu Kmau (see Section l.d.). According to press reports, Battambang provincial of-
 ficials acknowledged in September that some prisoners were tortured in the facility.
 Discipline is poor within the RCAF and the Cambodian police; members of the se-
 curity forces commit many crimes, including extortion, beatings, and car theft. At
 least one extortion attempt by soldiers is known to have resulted in a killing (see
 Section L.a.).
 Access to prisons by human rights groups improved, and the Government allowed
 human rights groups to give human rights training to prison guards. Many govern-
 ment officials appeared determined to improve prison conditions within the limits
 of available financial resources. However, conditions in many prisons remained un-
 satisfactory. The Government allows independent monitoiing of prisons. The U.S.-
 based nongovernmental organization (NGO) Physicians for Human Rights, which
 sent a team to Cambodia to investigate prison conditions, issued a report on June
 1 calling for the closure of the judicial police prison in Phnom Penh, citing over-
 crowding, food and water shortages, and a high level of violence against prisoners.
 The Cambodian NGO Licadho provided a similar characterization of conditions in
 that prison and, to a lesser extent, in other facilities. Human rights observers say
 that prisoners were often kept in their cells 24 hours a day in violation of inter-
 national standards, and that the practices of using shackles and holding prisoners
 in small dark cells resumed after being virtually eliminated during the UNTAC pe-
 riod. A U.N. human rights official stated that prison officials sometimes raped and
 abused women prisoners. In response to these criticisms, the Government, with the
 assistance of the Australian Government and human rights NGO's, began to take
 steps to improve conditions in the judicial police prison.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-A Penal Code drafted by UNTAC and ap-
 proved by the interim Supreme National Council remains in effect, as does a Crimi-
 nal Procedure Law dating from the State of Cambodia period. The Criminal Proce-
 dure Law in theory provides adequate protection for criminal suspects, but in prac-
 tice the Government frequently ignored these protections. The inefficiency of the ju-
 dicial system resulted inlong pretrial detention periods.
 Although the Government did not generally use detention without charge as a
 means of political control, there were a few cases in which persons, including a
 newspaper editor and a human rights NGO worker, were detained for political rea-
 sons (see Section i.e.).
 Human Rights groups criticized the Government for detaining for a long period
 without charge nine Thai nationals arrested in June for suspected involvement in
 the failed coup attempt. In October the Government tried the Thais, who were all
 
 
 551
 ven three-year suspended sentences. At year's end the nine had returned to Thai-
 Human rights groups presented convincing evidence that 19 prisoners were held
 illegally by the secunty forces in the secret detention facility in Cheu Kmau (see
 Section L.a.). Although in 1993 UNTAC observers identified the site as an illegal
 detention facility, government observers initially denied reports of abuses at Cheu
 Kmau. At year's end the Government had not conducted a credible investidgatio.
 However, according to press reports, Co-Interior Minister Sar Kheng and a Deputy
 Governor of Battambang acknowledged in September that Cheu Kmau was used as
 a detention center until mid-1994. Human rghts groups believe the security forces
 spddetaining prisoners at Cheu Kmau by year's end. Some groups believe that
 officials continued to detain prisoners in other illegal facilities, but there
 is no evidence to support this assertion.
 Exile is rohibited in Cambodia's Constitution and is not practiced.
 No lega system is known to exist in Khmer Rouge zones. KR forces often seize
 hsaeinorder to intimidate villagers into cooperating with their insurgency (see
 Section 1.g.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Although mandated in the Constitution, in prac-
 tice the Government does not ensure due process and an independent judiciary.
 There is a severe shortage of lawers, particularly in the provinces. The judicial sys-
 tern implemoented durng the SOC regime geneyray remains in place, and the coun-
 try's judges, most of whom were ap pointed during the SOC period, are not equipped
 to operate an independent udia system. There are frequent and credible charges
 of corruption by judges. The Constitution calls for the establishment of a body to
 choose judges. In late December, the National Assembly passed legislation establish-
 inga body to choose judges. The body had not been established by year's end.
 Pri ners are usually allowed visits by their family and their attorneys, if they
 have them. However, the Government does not provde attorneys to the indigent,
 although human rights groups sometimes provide defenders.
 Foreign and local NGO's are conducting major, long term projects to train defend-
 ers and otherwise strengthen the judiciary. The military justice system faces similar
 problems.
 Although the practice of holding political prisoners, common under the SOC, has
 all but disappeared, there were a few cases in which persons were detained for polit-
 ical reasons.Newspaper editor Nguon Non was detained in July on national security
 charges and released in August pending trial; there is widespread speculation that
 he was arrested because the Government disapproved of his coverage of the July
 coup attempt (see Section 2.a.). A human rights worker for the NGO Adhoc in Prey
 Veng province was detained from November 1993 to February 1994 under an
 antiterrorisro law; his alleged act of "terror was that he created instability and
 chaos by encouraging villagers to reclaim their property. Human rights groups be-
 lieve his detention was an act of retaliation on the part of local authorities who sus-
 p   ed him of being the source of a news article describing the corrupt handling of
 and diputes by officials. Human rights observers also beieve that several pris-
 oners held in various areas on suspicion of being Khmer Rouge members were de-
 taided for political reasons.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Accord-
 ing to human rights observers, the plice routinely make arrests and conduct
 searches without warrants. However, the number of forced entries into homes and
 offices decreased, after a high incidence during the 1993 political camp sign. Reports
 of surveillance continued, but decreased as the security apparatus of the SOC con-
 tinued to be dismantled. According to newspaper reports, the Government often
 monitored private citizens' telephone calls and asked telephone companies for
 records of conversations. There were no reported incidence of forced political party
 membership. Persons in Khmer Rouge zones are subject to rigid social controls and
 accorded no right to privacy.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flict.-Fighting between government forces and the Khmer Rouble insurgency esca-
 lated in early 1994. A rise in the number of incidents of excessive force and viola-
 tions of humoanitarian law on both sides accompanied this fighting. As inprevious
 years, many civilians were killed or wounded by indiscriminate she __g an  by land
 mines laid by both sides. Villagers were subjected to burning and looting during
 Khmer Rouse" raids and to harassment by RAF officials.
 Human rights NGO's reported that a Kher Rouge soldier was beheaded in May
 after undergoing intergtion by the RCAF. According to these reports, the soldier's
 head was later displayed on a wall outside the RCAF headurtrs in Battambang.
 There were several other credible reports of executions of Khmer Rouge prisoners
 by the RCAF.
 
 
 552
 
 The Khmer Rouge continued to abduct and summarily execute both Cambodians
 and foreigners in areas under its control. (See Section ia.) In mid-November the
 Khmer Rouge massacred 51 villager in Ba .tta   angpr ovnce. The Khmer Rouge
 often attacked civilians. A KR amoush on a train in Juy left 9 dead. After the train
 attack hostages were taken, including three Westerners who were subsequently
 killed and whose remains were identified in November. (See Section la.) At yeas
 end the fate of three Vietnamese taken captive after the train attack remained un-
 known. Khmer Rouge soldiers raped the wives of 10 RCAF soldiers in an attack on
 a village in Banteay Meanchey province.
 Several hundred people were abducted by the Khmer Rouge or remained missing
 after being abducted in earlier years. Most hostages are released after several
 weeks, but in some cases the captives are held for longer periods. For example,
 Khmer Rouge soldiers abducted 26 villagers in Kompong Speu province on August
 19. After a 5-day walk they arrived at a Khmer Rouge camp where about 35 other
 hostages were already being held. They were held for approximately 7 weeks. Some
 escaped, and the rest were released aftr many of them became ill.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Cambodian Constitution provides for free-
 dom of expression, press, publication, and association. However, the Constitution
 implicitly limits free speech by requiring that the speech not adversely affect public
 security and be carried out in accordance with law. The Constitution also declares
 that the King is "inviolable." The National Assembly has yet to implement legisla-
 tion to clarify how these articles affect press freedom. In practice, the Government
 placed some restrictions on press freedom. Self-censorship, reflecting the Govern-
 ment's inability to ensure the safety ofjournalists, remained a problem.
 Cambodia's independent news organizations, which were first allowed to operate
 during the UAC period, remained active. At year's end, there were 33 news-
 papers and magazines in operation. The Khmer Journalists' Association, established
 at the end of 1993, drew up a code of ethics and served as an informal liaison be-
 tween the press and the Govenent. However, throughout the year government
 pressure and violence from still undetermined sources created a climate of fear
 among the members of the Cambodian press and a widespread suspicion that jour-
 nalists who criticized officials were being targeted for violence, possibly by members
 of the Government or security forces.
 In March two men on motorcycles threw a hand grenade into the office of the
 newspaper Intervention; police made no arrests in connection with this incident. In
 June the editor of Intervention, Tou Chhom Mongkol, was found unconscious with
 a fractured skull on a Phnom Penh street and later died. A police report stated that
 the cause of death was a collision with a bicycle taxi. In September another news-
 paper editor, Nuon Chan, whose predecessor as editor of the newspaper Voiceof
 Khmer Youth had resigned after receiving threats on his life, was shot to death in
 what may have been a politically motivated killing (see Section l.a.). In December
 of journalist Chan Dara was fatally shot in Kompong Chain (see also Section l.a.)
 Nguon Non editor of the Morning News, was arrested in July under a provision
 of the SOC Press Law which prohibits newspapers from publishing articles det-
 rimental to the national security. His newspaper had published articles that implied
 involvement of high-ranking officials in the failed July coup attempt. After several
 postponements of his trial, he was released from prison in early August. By year's
 end he had not been tried.
 Human rights groups criticized the broad language of the SOC-era Press Law.
 There are currently no laws on libel. There were several instances in which the
 press printed stories that included harsh personal criticisms of Government officials,
 prompting Government threats to restrict press freedom. Although the final form of
 the draft press law under consideration in the National Assembly was not known
 at year's end, Members of Parliament may be responsive to King Sihanouk's request
 that the draft law's criminal penalties for libel be replaced by civil penalties.
 The Government placed pressure on the press on several occasions. In May 2police
 surrounded the newspaper Sakol and seized copies of the newspaper and printing
 materials. The newspaper had printed material critical of King Sihanouk. The au-
 thorities closed down the newspaper briefly, then allowed it to reopen. High-level
 government officials often hinted publicly that they would shut down newspapers
 that continued to print irresponsible stories. Although many newspapers continued
 to publish critical stories in spite of these threats, some practiced self-censorship in
 order to avoid government reprisals.
 The Khmer Rouge does not allow freedom of speech or press in zones they control.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom of peaceful assembly
 and freedom of association are provided for in the Constitution and were generally
 
 
 553
 unrestricted in 1994. There were fewer political rallies than in 1993, an election
 year. There were no reports of disruption of the few demonstrations that did take
 place, most of which concerned land distribution. However, human rights groups be-
 lieved that in some provinces the Government maintained a climate of political in-
 timidation that discouraged residents from engaging in political activities.
 Cambodia's large NGO community was generally allowed to operate freely, par-
 ticularly in Phnom Penh. However, the lac of legislation clarifying the rights and
 obligations of NGO'e led NGO's to worry that they would unintentionally run afoul
 of the authorities. The Interior Ministry registers NGO's and requires them to sub-
 mit lists of their stafl and to obtain permission to conduct training. There were re-
 ports that some provincial officials enforced these requirements in a manner which
 inhibited the NGO's ability to operate freel.
 In Khmer Rouge controlled areas freedom of assembly and association do not
 exist. In early 1994 two participants in a peace march in an area along the Thai-
 Cambodian border were killed by Khmer Rouge gunfire.
 c. Freedom of Reiiion.-Buddhism is the state religion, but the Constitution pro-
 vides for freedom of religion and forbids discrimination based on religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not restrict travel outside Cambodia or within
 parts of Cambodia it controls. However, the presence of land mines and bandits
 makes travel in some areas perilous. The Khmer Rouge, who refused to comply with
 the Paris Accords by opening the areas they control, continued to restrict access to,
 from, and within these zones.
 Tens of thousands of ethnic Vietnamese fled Cambodia in early 1993 due to racial
 violence directed at Vietnamese. Many returned overland after the elections. How-
 ever, the Cambodian authorities stopped and forbade reentry to several thousand
 boats on the Mekong river. Immigration legislation passed in August made no ref-
 erence to nationality and therefore failed to resolve the status of these people, many
 of whom were born in Cambodia.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights. The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides for the rit of citizens to change their government,
 and most citizens exercised this right m the 1993 elections. in those areas of the
 country controlled by the Khmer Rouge, citizens cannot exercise this right.
 Cambodia experienced its first complete year under democratic rule in decades.
 The Government was formed after a U.N.-sponsored election in May 1993 in which
 each province elected Constituent Assembly members through proportional rep-
 resentation. Some 20 parties took part; four won seats. The United Nations certified
 the election as free and fair. After the drafting of a Constitution the Constituent
 Assembly became the National Assembly. All four parties that took part in the elec-
 tion entered a coalition government, which remained in power throughout the year.
 In July CPP members Sin Sen, Sin Song, and Prince Norodom Chakrapong at-
 tempted a coup d'etat, which was quickly defeated, in large part because of the loy-
 alty of RCAF forces to the Government. In October following a 2-day trial, a military
 court found guilty and sentenced those involved in the coup attempt. The three who
 led the effort received prison sentences ranging from 18 to 20 years. At year's end
 Sin Song remained outside Cambodia, and Prince Chakrapong was in exile in
 France. Other CPP members involved received lesser sentences.
 In July the National Assembly outlawed the Khmer Rouge after their refusal to
 negotiate in good faith with the Government.
 Traditional cultural practices inhibit the role of women in government. There are
 seven women among the 120 members of the National Assembly.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental
 Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights Cambodia's large inter-
 national and indigenous human rights community, which first began operating
 under UNTAC, remained active and engaged in diverse activities. The National As-
 sembly established a commission to serve as a liaison with the human rights com-
 munity.
 Although generally allowed to operate freely, there were isolated incidents in
 which the Government restricted NGO activities, especially in the provinces. There
 were also credible reports of intimidation of NGO's by the Government.
 An employee of the NGO Adhoc was imprisoned for what appeared to be political
 motives (see Section I.e.). Also, during a human rights class in Kompong Chinang
 province, several NGO workers were taken away by RCAF soldiers wielding AK-
 47's. The NGO activists were held at the police station for 3 days, then released but
 
 
 prohibited from conducting the human rights class. There were credible reports that
 human rights workers were verbally threatened by provincial authorities.
 On at least one occasion officials in Battambang prevented an NGO from conduct-
 ing human rights training, provincial NGO's later stated they no longer felt re-
 stricted. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) interpreted as an accusation of gov-
 ernment involvement a statement released by the NGO Khmer Institute for Democ-
 racy (KID) on the killing of newspaper editor Nuon Chan. In response, the MFA
 stated that KID was operating illegally and threatened to close the organization.
 However, since KID was registered properly and did not, as an indigenous group,
 fall under MFA jurisdiction, no action was taken against the organization. The Gov-
 ernment informed another indigenous NGO that it, too, was operating illegally, but
 took no action to close the organization.
 The Khmer Rouge does not permit any investigation of human rights violations
 within their zones.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Although the Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, color, sex, lan-
 guage, religious belief, or political views, the Government does not always protect
 these rights in practice. The Government's failure to implement these provisions ef-
 fectively means that women and children, the most vulnerable elements of Cam-
 bdian society, are often victims of discrimination.
 Women.-The Constitution contains strong language providing for equal rights for
 women, equal pay for equal work, and equal status in marriage. In practice, women
 have equal property rights with men, have the same status in bringing divorce pro-
 ceedings, and have equal access to education and some jobs. However, cultural tra-
 ditions continued to affect adversely women's ability to reach senior positions in gov-
 ernment, business, and other areas. There were a large number of women's NGO's
 and the leaders of two of the most prominent human rights NGO's are women.
 International and Cambodian NGO workers confirm that violence against women,
 including rape and domestic violence, is common, although there have been no sys-
 tematic studies to determine the extent of the problem. Authorities normally decline
 to become involved in domestic disputes.
 Children.-Children are often victims of land mines. There is also evidence of in-
 creasing numbers of child prostitutes among street children in Phnom Penh. The
 Constitution explicitly provides for children's rights, and ensuring the welfare of
 children is a specific goal of the Government's political program. However, the Gov-
 ernment must rely on international aid to fund most social welfare programs tar-
 geted at children and, therefore, resources devoted to the goal are modest.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-People of Vietnamese and Chinese back-
 ground have long comprised the largest ethnic minorities in Cambodia. Ethnic Chi-
 nese are well accepted. However, fear and animosity toward the Vietnamese, who
 are seen as a threat to the Khmer nation and culture, continues. In the absence of
 a nationality law, the legal and constitutional rights of ethnic Vietnamese are un-
 clear. Constitutional protections are extended only to 'Khmer people.7 The Vietnam-
 ese Government and some NGO's expressed concern that an immigration bill passed
 in August could be used to conduct large-scale deportations of ethnic Vietnamese.
 The Government, however, made assurances that this would not happen, and there
 were no such deportations in 1994. The legal status of ethnic Vietnamese, many of
 whom were born in Cambodia, was not resolved in the immigration legislation.
 The Khmer Rouge continued a calculated campaign of racial violence and inflam-
 matory propaganda directed against ethnic Vietnamese civilians, although relatively
 few killings of ethnic Vietnamese could be attributed definitively to the Khmer
 Rouge (see Section L.a.). There was violence against ethnic Vietnamese from other
 sources. In April 13 Vietnamese residents of Kandal province were killed and 27
 were wounded in an attack on their village. Seven suspects were arrested but later
 released for lack of evidence.
 Several thousand ethnic Vietnamese who fled to the Vietnam-Cambodia border
 following massacres in early 1993 were prohibited by the Government from return-
 ing to their homes. They remained on the border at the year's end (see Section 1.d.).
 People With Disabilities.-The Government does not mandate accessibility to
 buildings or government services for people with disabilities. According to inter-
 national human rights groups, one in 236 Cambodians is missing at least one limb.
 This figure reflects the continuing impact of landmines on the population. Programs
 admini tered by various NGO's have brought about dramatic improvements in the
 treatment and rehabilitation of amputees, but they continue to face discrimination,
 particularly in obtaining skilled employment.
 
 
 555
 
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The current Labor Law was passed by the SOC in
 1992. Throughout the year the Government worked with the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) and the Asian-American Free Labor Institute (AAFLI) to draft
 a new labor code, but at years end the new legislation had not been passed. Work-
 ers have the right to form unions of their own choosing without previous authoriza-
 tion, and unions are not reqired to join a single trade union structure.
 There were few, if any, idependent trade unions active. The madority of salaried
 workers are employed by the State, although there is a growing service sector. A
 large proportion of the urmban population is engaged in low-level commerce or self-
 employed artisanship.
 The SOC Labor Law permits unions to join federations but does not address
 whether they may be ailiated with international bodies.
 The 1993 Constitution provides for the right to strike, but the Government has
 not passed implementing legislation. There were several strikes throughout the
 year.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Labor Law provides for
 collective bargaining, although any agreement reached between workers and em-
 ployees is subject to government approval. In practice collective bargain  g does not
 9e place. The Government sets wages for civil servants. Wage ra   n   oes not
 tors are set largely by the market. The Labor Law prohibits antiunion discrimina-
 tion by employers, but there is no mechanism for enforcement of this provision.
 No exprt processing zones existed in 1994.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Law prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor and contains penal sanctions for offenders. However, the Gov-
 ernment does not adequately enforce these provisions. There are no reports that do-
 mestic or foreign workers are being forced to remain in situations amounting to co-
 erced labor, although there were some reports of women being forced to work as
 prostitutes. The Khmer Rouge compel people under their control to serve as porters
 For miitary and other supplies and to clear land for farming.
 d. Minimum Age for Emnployment of Children.-The Labor Law states that the
 minimum age for employment is 16, except for those workers in family enterprises.
 Although penalties exist for violation of these provisions, the Government has not
 established an apparatus to enforce them. Cambodians under the age of 16 years
 routinely engage in a variety of Jobs, including street trading, construction, and
 small-scale manufacturing. According to a NGO study, at least 86 children, most
 aged 11 to 14 worked in the Phnom Penh dump collecting recyclable materials
 under extremefy unhealthful, dangerous, and unsanitary conditions.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Wor..-The Labor Law does not provide for a nation-
 wide minimum wage, but requires a wage that assures a decent living standard.
 This standard wage varies according to region. The Government, however, does not
 enforce this requirement. Currentlyjmarket-determined wage rates at lower levels
 are not sufficient to provide a decent living for a worker and family.
 The Labor Law provides for a standard legal workweek of 48 hours and a 24-hour
 rest period and requires overtime pay. The Government does not enforce these
 standards and workers commonly work more than 48 hours per week. The Law
 states that the workplace should have health and safety standards necessary to en-
 sure the workers' well-being. However, the Government has not yet set specific
 standards. Penalties are specified in the law, but there are no provisions to protect
 workers who complain about unsafe or unhealthful conditions. Conditions in fac-
 tories and small-scale industries are generally poor and often do not meet inter-
 national standards.
