 KENYA
 After strenuously rejecting calls for political reform
 throughout 1991 and harassing and intimidating groups and
 individuals advocating multiparty democracy, Kenyan President
 Daniel T. Arap Moi, in a surprise move in December, recommended
 that Kenya again adopt a multiparty system. Although Kenya has
 had an elected civilian government since independence in 1963,
 the Kenya African National Union (KANU) has been de facto the
 sole political party almost since independence; since 1982 it
 has held that status de jure. Passage of the enabling
 legislation on December 10 opened the way for multiparty
 elections, which must be held by mid-1993 at the latest, for
 the elected National Assembly (unicameral Parliament) of 188
 members, plus 12 members appointed by the President and 2 ex
 officio members. Parties were expected to begin registration
 immediately in anticipation of the possibility of early
 elections. As of mid-December, legislation was also under
 consideration that would increase the number of possible
 elected seats in the National Assembly from its present limit
 of 188 to a maximum of 210. In its one-party configuration,
 the National Assembly has virtually no independent power in
 national political affairs, but its sessions provide a forum
 for members to raise local or regional issues.
 Kenya has a large and growing internal security apparatus that
 includes the police Criminal Investigation Department (CID),
 the paramilitary General Service Unit (GSU), and the
 Directorate of Security and Intelligence (DSI or Special
 Branch). The CID and Special Branch investigate criminal
 activity and also monitor persons the State considers
 subversive. The internal security apparatus has been used to
 intimidate and harass politicians, opponents of the Government,
 and dissidents, sometimes resorting to torture and other
 mistreatment (see Section l.c.).
 Kenya's economy, despite the dominance of public and
 state-owned enterprises, includes a well-developed private
 sector for trade and light manufacturing as well as an
 agricultural sector that provides food for local consumption
 and substantial exports of coffee, tea, and other commodities.
 Tourism is the top foreign exchange earner but grew at a slower
 pace in 1991 due to the Gulf War. Although economic growth
 continued in 1991, a persistently high population growth rate
 contributed to serious and growing unemployment.
 While there were signs of improvement in human rights in late
 1991, human rights were circumscribed for most of the year, and
 significant restrictions remained at year's end. For the first
 10 months of 1991 KANU resisted reform. President Moi
 repeatedly asserted that Kenya was not ready for multiparty
 democracy, and movement towards political change was blocked in
 various ways. The Government refused applications for licenses
 to hold opposition political meetings, and church groups and
 the Law Society canceled prayer meetings on political topics
 following government intimidation. The Government denied
 registration to a newly formed political party, and KANU
 expelled, under the guise of "deregistration" from the party,
 several members who joined an informal group advocating change
 (the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy--FORD). In 1991
 the Attorney General lifted restrictions on the Nairobi Law
 Monthly, originally banned for its coverage of the multiparty
 debate, and the Government released from custody the three
 prominent detainees held under the controversial Preservation
 of Public Security Act (PPSA), Kenneth Matiba, Charles Rubia,
 and Raila Odinga. A number of sedition trials were also
 
 
 175
 KENYA
 concluded in 1991; many questions were raised about the
 fairness of these trials, and there were credible charges of
 police brutality and torture.
 Former Member of Parliament (M.P.) George Anyona and three
 codefendants were convicted on circumstantial evidence which
 depended heavily on inferences from ambiguous documents found
 in the possession of the accused. Former M.P. Koigi Wa
 Wamwere, arrested in October 1990 on charges of treason,
 continued to be held in prison at year's end, awaiting trial.
 In what appeared to be a politically motivated decision,
 officers of the Kenyan Law Society were convicted of contempt
 of court resulting from an order forbidding them from making
 statements critical of the Government.
 At year's end, the Government had failed to investigate several
 cases of physical attacks on well-known government opponents
 and their families. Serious questions remained about the
 Government's handling of the investigation into the 1990 murder
 of Foreign Minister Robert Ouko. The fall of the Somali and
 Ethiopian Governments in the first 6 months of 1991 triggered
 an influx of refugees. The Government was reluctant to grant
 full refugee status to asylum seekers. Many refugees suffered
 police harassment and sporadic refoulements, culminating in a
 refoulement by the Kenyan Navy which resulted in the loss of 37
 Somali lives.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killings
 Following the murder of Foreign Minister Robert Ouko in 1990,
 which many-believe was politically motivated, the Government
 called in a team from Britain's New Scotland Yard to assist 4n
 the investigation. A judicial inquiry began in October 1990
 and heard testimony for over a year. President Moi, however,
 abruptly terminated the inquiry on November 26 and asked the
 police to resume investigating the case. On December 9, a
 former district commissioner was charged with murder in'the
 case. Two other suspects, former Energy and Industry Minister
 Nicholas Eiwott and former Permanent Secretary for Internal
 Security and Provincial Administration Hezekiah Oyugi, were
 arrested November 26 but released without charge 2 weeks later
 due to lack of evidence. The judicial inquiry had heard
 substantial testimony regarding corruption on the part of
 Biwott and Oyugi, with the implication that corruption had
 played a part in motivating Dr. Ouko's murder. On the last day
 of the inquiry, its commissioners published a statement saying
 that their telephones had been bugged by the police and that
 they had heard rumors of a plot to assassinate one of their
 number to end the inquiry. There has been no investigation of
 these charges.
 On June 30, during a riot over student allowances, one Moi
 University student, Shadrack Opiyo, was shot dead by the
 police. No'investigation followed the incident.
 Reports by survivors indicate that on May 25 the Kenyan-Navy
 towed two boats of Somali asylum seekers out to sea in order to
 repatriate them against their will. Cut adrift in rough water,
 the unseaworthy boats capsized, and 37 refugees drowned. The *
 Navy showed extreme negligence over the possible loss of life.
 
 
 176
 KENYA
 The Ministry of Home Affairs, responsible for refugee matters,
 issued a statement exonerating the Navy, saying that naval
 vessels had not towed the refugees to sea but had come to
 assist an overloaded refugee boat. While towing the refugees
 to safety, the line broke, and the boat capsized. Although the
 United States Government and the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) requested an official
 investigation, at year's end no such inquiry had begun.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearance.
 c. Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman, and Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is proscribed under the Constitution, but there
 continued to be persistent credible reports of severe police
 brutality and abuse of prisoners in 1991. For example, when
 Reverend Lawford Ndege Imunde was released in March and his
 sentence commuted to time served, he alleged that during his
 imprisonment he had been beaten, denied appropriate medical
 treatment, and held in a prison for the criminally insane.
 In the sedition trial of George Anyona and his associates,
 defendant Edward Akong'o Oyugi claimed that for 10 days during
 his interrogation, he was beaten, kept naked in a flooded cell,
 and not given enough food. There has been no investigation of
 these allegations, which are the subject of pending litigation.
 During the same trial, George Anyona described his
 interrogation at Nyayo House in Nairobi, claiming that several
 floors of the building contained torture chambers and asking
 the magistrate to investigate the charge. The state prosecutor
 said that those areas of Nyayo House came under the Restricted
 Areas Act, and no further investigation occurred. E. Barrack
 Mbajah, brother of murdered Foreign Minister, Robert Ouko,
 claimed in an affidavit prepared in the United States that: "I
 was arrested, confined for 5 days and nights, and severely
 beaten by Kenya (sic) security after I refused to cooperate
 with them in covering up the assassination." A defendant in
 the Koigi Wa Wamwere treason trial, Rumba Kinuthia, says he was
 tortured and kept chained in a water-logged cell. Detailed
 accounts of beatings and painful, extended torture reported in
 past years have never been investigated. The Government seems
 to make no attempt to identify or prosecute those responsible.
 Prison conditions in Kenya are harsh due to overcrowding and
 insufficient funding for prison operations. Corruption and
 sexual abuse occur. Food and medical facilities are in short
 supply. Malnutrition particularly affects nursing and pregnant
 mothers, whose small children stay in prison with them. In
 March the Government made available information about the
 conditions under which the three Preservation of Public Safety
 Act detainees were held (see Section l.d.), specifically the
 frequency of family visits and access to legal and medical
 advice. It showed that medical and family access to these
 detainees was very limited. In the case of Raila Odinga, .all
 requests for visits by legal counsel had been refused.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution provides that most persons arrested or
 detained (other than those detained-under the PPSA) shall be
 
 
 177
 KENYA
 brought before a court "as soon as is reasonably practicable."
 If such person is not brought within 24 hours after his arrest
 or from the conmencement of his detention, the burden of
 explanation is-on the authorities.'
 The Constitution was amended in 1988 to allow the police to
 hold people suspected" of capital offenses for 14 days before
 being brought before a court. Capital offenses include such
 crimes as murder and treason. In practice, suspects of all
 types are often held incommunicado for 2 to 3 weeks before
 being brought to court. Family members often bring law suits
 to compel authorities to produce "missing" prisoners.
 Bail is frequently granted in nonpolitical cases. In late
 1991, tfe courts more frequently granted bail in "political"
 cases than had been the case earlier in the year. :When Gitobu
 Imanyara was arrested on sedition charges, which were
 subsequently dropped by the Attorney General, he was denied
 bail, even though he suffered from severe health problems.
 When he was hospitalized in recognition of the threat to his
 health, he was chained to his hospital bed. Luke Obok, an
 associate of Luo politician Oginga Odinga, was charged with
 possessing seditious documents and was repeatedly denied bail.
 Kenya's PPSA allows the State to detain a person indefinitely
 without charges or trial upon a determination "that it is
 necessary for the preservation of public security."
 "Preservation of public security" includes "prevention and
 suppression of rebellion, mutiny, violence, intimidation,
 disorder and crime, unlawful attempts and conspiracies to
 overthrow the government or the constitution," and several
 other grounds. A formal detention order must be signed and
 published in the Kenya Gazette. There is no judicial review of
 the legality of detention. A board appointed by the President,
 meeting in camera, reviews detention cases.every 6 months, but
 its recommendations are not binding.
 The Government has used the PPSA repeatedly in recent years to
 silence opposition. The issue of the three detainees held
 under the Act was a major human rights'issue of the first half
 of 1991. Charles Rubia was released on April 12, Kenneth
 Matiba on June 8, and Raila Odinga on June 21, all on health
 grounds. As PPSA detainees, they were never formally charged.
 Rubia and Matiba subsequently sought medical treatment abroad;
 Raila Odinga was denied a passport to travel for treatment.
 Lawyers, churchmen, and politicians have called for the
 abolition of the PPSA, but the law remains in force.
 Former MP Koigi Wa Wamwere, arrested in 1990 on charges of
 treason, remained in prison throughout 1991 awaiting trial.
 According to Kenyan authorities, Wamwere was arrested in
 possession of a secret cache of'arms, which he intended to use
 to overthrow the Kenyan Government. He claims to have been
 kidnaped from Uganda and brought by the Kenyans to Nairobi,
 where he says the arms were planted on him. On December 16,
 Koigi's lawyers protested to the High Court that all 7
 defendants in the case suffered from harsh prison conditions,.
 including solitary confinement 23 hours a day, a substandard
 diet, lack of family visits, and cells without blankets or
 mattresses.
 On September 24, the police arrested Ahmed Salim Bamahriz, a
 founding member of the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy,
 in Nairobi after President Moi publicly called for harsh
 measures against troublemakers. The police said his arrest was
 
 
 178
 KENYA
 unrelated to his political views and pertained instead to an
 unspecified criminal matter related to his business dealings.
 Bamahriz was taken to Mombasa, questioned, and released.
 In many other cases, Kenyans were visited and questioned by the
 police or held in police custody for periods ranging from a few
 hours to several days without being charged or officially
 detained under any specific authority. The purpose seemed to
 be the intimidation of critics of the Government. Several
 priests and ministers, such as the head of the Kenya National
 Evangelism Fellowship Church, have been questioned in this
 fashion.
 From May 8 to 10, the police interrogated the 82-year-old
 father of the Reverend Timothy Njoya. Njoya, a minister of the
 Presbyterian Church of East Africa and well known government
 critic, later issued a statement saying the interrogation was
 meant to pressure his father to disown him.
 On August 7, the police picked up three farmers from Nakuru
 district, holding and questioning them for a week for allegedly
 belonging to ax antigovernment political party and recruiting
 other members. They denied all these charges, and one claimed
 that he was tortured by the police.
 Traditionally, the Government has used neither exile nor the
 threat of exile as a means of intimidation or punishment. At
 the end of October, Raila Odinga fled Kenya after government
 harassment for his political beliefs and received asylum in
 Norway. In 1991 the Government appealed to politically
 motivated emigres abroad to return to join in Kenyan nation
 building. Early in 1991, some of the exiles asked for
 government guarantees that they would not be rearrested on
 arrival. Later that year, some of them indicated they wished
 to return as a result of the restoration of multiparty
 democracy to Kenya. According to press accounts, in a December
 18 speech President Moi said that exiles who left Kenya without
 passports should not expect to receive them now.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Kenya's legal system, as defined in the Judicature Act of 1967,
 is based on the Constitution, laws passed by Parliament, and
 common law or court precedent. Customary law is used as a
 guide in civil matters affecting people of the same ethnic
 group so long as it does not conflict with statutory law.
 Kenya does not have the jury system. The court system consists
 of the Court of Appeals, the High Court, and two levels of
 magistrates' courts where most criminal and civil cases
 originate. In 1989 Justice Dugdale decided the courts have no
 power to enforce the Kenyan Bill of Rights. Applications for
 habeas corpus have never been successful in the High Court.
 Civilians are tried in civilian courts, and verdicts may be
 appealed to the Kenyan High Court and ultimately to the Court
 of Appeals. Kenyans do not have a right to legal counsel at
 state expense except in certain capital cases. Most persons
 tried for capital offenses are'provided counsel free of charge
 if they cannot afford it. Military personnel are tried by
 military courts, and verdicts may be appealed. Attorneys for
 military personnel are appointed on a case by case basis by the
 Chief Justice.
 The President has extensive powers over the judiciary. He
 appoints the Chief Justice and the Attorney General and
 appoints High Court judges with the advice of the Judicial
 
 
 KENYA
 Service Commission. His power was significantly increased
 through constitutional amendments adopted in 1986 and 1988,
 which gave him discretionary authority to dismiss judges, the
 Attorney General, and certain other officials. In late 1990,
 this power of dismissal was restricted when Parliameat adopted
 a constitutional amendment specifying that the President may
 only dismiss those officials upon the recommendation of a
 special, presidentially appointed tribunal. Some hailed this
 as a restoration of the security of judicial tenure, but many
 lawyers criticized it as inadequate to restore judicial
 independence. The amendments have not yet been tested because
 there has been no government effort to date to rdrnove from
 office an officer affected.
 A number of trials stemming from Kenya's sedition laws were
 concluded in 1991. The Reverend Lawford Ndege Imunde,
 convicted of seditious publication on the strength of a private.
 diary entry, had his sentence commuted to time served, although
 the conviction was not overturned.
 Press reporting of the sedition trial ofGeorge Anyona and his
 three codefendants underlined the problematic character of the
 verdict, which was based on circumstantial evidence. Anyona
 and his three codefendants met in a bar on July 11, 1990, just
 after Nairobi was shaken by iioting on July 7. The men were
 arrested, charged with plotting the overthrow of the
 Government, and held without bail for a year.
 When the trial was concluded in July 1991, all four men were
 convicted and given 7-year sentences. The prosecution
 maintained that the defendants met in a private room to discuss
 the overthrow of the Government, but no witnesses came forward
 to substantiate this claim. The Government's case depended on
 documents, found in the possession of the accused, which were
 held to be seditious. One was a piece of paper with the words
 "Charles" and "Ken;" the prosecution said the words referred to
 Charles Matiba and Kenneth Rubia, two of the detainees released
 in 1991. The other most incriminating piece of evidence was
 the so-called shadow cabinet list, a list, of government
 positions paired with the names of government critics. The
 prosecution held that the list demonstrated plans to overthrow
 the Government and replace ministerial positions from the ranks
 of the antigovernment activists; the defense said the document
 was a crude forgery planted on Anyona by the police. Under
 Kenyan law, any publication calculated to excite "hatred or
 disaffection" toward the Government is deemed seditious. Some
 of the publications found in the possession of the accused and
 alleged to be seditious have never been banned in Kenya.
 Anyona and his codefendants appealed their convictions. The
 case is to be heard in February 1992.
 Defendants have occasionally been denied the right to employ
 legal counsel of their choice. Kenya theoretically permits all
 commonwealth lawyers to practice and also employs British
 judges, including the Chief Justice. Yet in 1991 two
 defendants, Mirugi Kariuki and Paul Muite, were denied the
 right to employ British barristers in their defense.
 In some cases, legislation precludes a fair trial. A relic of
 the colonial period, the Chief's Authority Act gives low-level
 administration officials, called chiefs, wide-ranging powers,
 including the power to arrest and hold persons and to restrict
 a person's movement without tril. The Kenya Law Reform
 Commission has recommended that the law be abolished.
 
 
 180
 KENYA
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Generally, judicially issued search warrants are required and
 obtained, but searches without warrants are allowed under the
 Constitution in certain instances "to promote the public
 benefit," including in security cases. Security officials also
 conduct searches without warrants to apprehend suspected
 criminals or to seize property suspected to be stolen. Homes
 of suspected dissidents have been searched without warrants,
 and evidence so obtained has been admissible to support
 convictions.
 Security forces reportedly employ a variety of surveillance
 techniques, including electronic surveillance and a, network of
 informers. Political activists have been subject to police
 surveillance as have some of their visitors. Paul Muite,
 Gitobu Imanyara, and ex-detainee Raila Odinga all experienced
 physical attacks which appear to have had a political
 motivation. In the most serious of these incidents, Raila
 Odinga, while driving family members in his car, was hit by a
 stone and subsequently required hospitalization. Former Vice
 President Oginga Odinga alleges that an unsuccessful break-in
 of his house in May was an attempt to plant arms in his house
 prior to his arrest. At the time of Gitobu Imanyara's arrest
 in March, on the grounds of seditious publication (Section
 2.a.), both his home and the offices of the Nairobi Law Monthly
 were searched without a warrant.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and press and
 outlaws discrimination against any Kenyan on grounds of
 political opinion. However, there are numerous restrictions
 and inhibitions on the exercise of free speech, although they
 are not consistently effective. The legality of the Nairobi
 Law Monthly has been upheld; and some public figures,
 churchmen, and former Members of Parliament, have spoken
 vigorously against the Government. A number of prosecutions
 for sedition were withdrawn in 1991, but enough were carried
 through to create a climate in which free debate is discouraged
 and sometimes penalized. Kenyans have been charged with such
 offenses as wearing a badge with a V symbol, which was
 interpreted as "creating a disturbance" by seeming to advocate
 multiparty politics. In another case, a woman was charged with
 creating a disturbance for saying that there is "no justice"
 under the present Government. Some small businesses in Kenya
 have been fined by the police for the offense of operating
 without displaying a picture of the President, even though no
 law requires such display.
 Free speech and association in Kenya is also inhibited by an
 atmosphere of repression created when KANU and government
 officials make public statements threatening violence or
 repression against dissidents. At a public rally, Minister of
 Energy Biwott threatened that if Paul Muite were jailed he
 "might not come out alive." President Moi himself publicly
 called on KANU members to "act as agitators," and on another
 occasion to deal firmly with troublemakers. In September, as
 tensions role in anticipation of the planned October 5
 demonstration, Energy Minister Biwott and 19 Rift Valley M.P.s
 threatened in a rally to "crush" the Forum for the Restoration
 of Democracy (FORD) and told the populace to "arm themselves"
 
 
 181
 KENYA
 against FORD. At a similar rally, Minister of State Barudi
 Nabwera urged KANU youthwingers to "do the needful, a clear
 threat, if they encountered FORD organizers.
 One television station and all radio stations are owned and
 controlled by the Government. A second television station is
 owned by KANU and adheres to self-imposed guidelines. The
 KANU-owned outlet carries Cable News Network programs,
 generally without restriction, although at times stories about
 Kenya have been deleted. Privately owned newspapers and
 journals are published in Kenya, and there is no systematic
 censorship of the press. However, in early 1991 some
 publications were seized, and until late 1991 the press
 practiced self-censorship and confined its commentary within
 usually understood but legally undefined limits. Further,
 press members were subject to intimidation by persons
 associated with the Government. Despite these limitations,
 Kenyan press reporting on local issues remains spirited, and,
 after the constitutional changes in late 1991, there was a
 significant increase in press commentary critical of the
 Government ana, most notably, the President.
 Newspapers, magazines, and books from abroad are readily
 available. In late 1991, Kenya ceased to exclude individual
 editions of foreign papers which contained articles critical of
 Kenya. More than 100 foreign journalists representing Western
 news organizations operate from Nairobi.
 Free speech won a notable victory in Kenya when the Attorney
 General dropped all sedition charges against Gitobu Imanyara
 and subsequently lifted the'ban on the Nairobi Law Monthly.
 Imanyara was first charged with sedition in 1990 because of the
 Nairobi Law Monthly's coverage of the multiparty-debate. ,
 Imanyara was taken into custody for the second time on sedition
 charges in March, whenthe Nairobi Law Monthly published an
 editorial claiming that the Government distributed jobs in
 state-owned companies on the basis of ethnicity. Imanyara's
 printer was heavily, fined for publishing the magazine without
 posting a legally required bond. On May 28, following strong
 domestic and international criticism, the Government released
 Imanyara and dropped all sedition charges against him. On July
 4, the ban on the Nairobi Law Monthly was officially lifted,
 thus upholding an October 1990 judgment suspending the ban.
 �Several other magazines, however, are' still proscribed.
 Several plays, including a Kiswahili translation of "Animal
 Farm" and a Dario Fo play about a rent strike, have been
 censored.
 Possession, distribution, or publication of banned writing is
 subject to a punishment of up to 7 years' imprisonment.
 Several persons were charged and convicted of this offense in
 1991. In December, after the announcement of the change to
 multipartyism, the press continued to report cases of citizens
 charged with the possession of seditious literature. None. of
 these cases-has yet come to court since the constitutional
 change was recommended.
 Another case dramatizing the limits of free speech in Kenya was
 the injunction issued by the High Court against Paul Muite,
 chairman of the Law Society of Kenya (LSK) and other members of
 the Law Society council. Muite, in his acceptance speech as
 chairman, had urged the registration of the National Democratic
 Party (see Section 2.b.).
 
 
 182
 KENYA
 Progovernment members of the LSK sought the injunction against
 Muite to prevent him from speaking on political topics in his
 capacity as LSK chairman. In May Muite, along with other LSK
 council members, published a statement criticizing the record
 of legal judgments by British expatriate judges, including
 Justice Dugdale. Alleging that Muite had violated the
 injunction forbidding him to pronounce on political topics,
 four lawyers brought an action for contempt of court against
 Muite. To do so, they were required to ask the duty judge for
 leave for the action to go forward; the judge who granted leave
 was Dugdale. The Attorney General has stated that the
 Government has no involvement in this case and that it is
 private suit brought by one group of lawyers against another.
 On October 23, the Court of Appeal found Muite and his
 colleagues guilty of contempt of court for disobeying an
 injunction prohibiting them from making political statements.
 They were ordered to pay a fine of approximately $350.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly, while provided for in the Constitution, is
 seriously limited by the Public Order and Police Act, which
 gives authorities power to control public gatherings, defined
 as meetings of three or more persons. It is illegal to convene
 an unlicensed meeting. The ban does not extend to persons
 meeting on church property for religious purposes. On April
 28, the Reverend Timothy Njoya of the Presbyterian Church of
 East Africa, known for his advocacy of multiparty politics,
 held an open air prayer meeting without a license. Before the
 meeting began, police in riot gear confronted the gathering of
 300 people. Security personnel beat up several journalists and
 took their cameras, and government figures criticized Njoya for
 leading his parishioners to confrontation. On July 28, the
 Church of the Province of Kenya (CPK) and the Law Society of
 Kenya proposed to call believers to a session of prayers for
 peace and justice. According to a schedule published
 beforehand, the prayers were to cover many of the issues on the
 dissident agenda. The Government refused a request for a
 license to hold a procession before the prayers, and the
 meeting was called off after the authorities exerted
 considerable pressure on the churchmen.
 The FORD attempted to hold an unlicensed political meeting on
 November 16. A number of FORD members and presumed
 sympathizers were picked up before the day of the meeting;
 others were arrested on their way to the meeting. In spite of
 some stone throwing clashes with the police, the crowd was
 essentially peaceful. At least 87 people were arrested for
 participating in the banned gathering or urging others to do
 so. Charges against most of the FORD members and prominent
 sympathizers were swiftly dropped, but the outcome of the
 charges against many ordinary citizens arrested in connection
 with the rally is still unclear. After the announcement of the
 change to multiparty democracy, Nairobi saw a number of
 spontaneous small street demonstrations which dispersed on
 their own accord without police intervention, but on December 9
 the police broke up a peaceful pro-FORD demonstration and
 arrested 17 people. However, on January 18, 1992, the
 Government authorized a FORD rally in downtown Nairobi. Over
 100,000 persons attended the event, which unfolded peacefully.
 Freedom of association is governed by the Societies Act, which
 states that every association must be registered or exempted
 from registration by the Registrar of Societies. In February
 Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, Kenya's first Vice President, attempted
 
 
 KENYA
 to register a new political party, the National Democratic
 Party (NDP). The request was refused under section 2(A) of the
 Constitution, which makes Kenya a one-party state. The NDP
 argued without success that it was not a political party in the
 proscribed sense, since it did not plan to field electoral
 candidates, but would confine itself to propagating its views
 on political topics, especially regarding the elimination of
 section 2(A) of the Constitution. Later in the year, Oginga
 Odinga joined with others to propose a new grouping, the Forum
 for the Restoration of Democracy. FORD members urged Kenyans
 to form themselves into 9-member groups, since only.
 associations of 10 or more members legally require registration.
 President Moi denounced the FORD as "the NDP in disguise" and
 termed it "illegal' and nonexistent. One FORD organizer, Ahmed
 Salim Bamahriz, is an elected member of the Mombasa municipal
 council. When Babmariz announced his association with the
 FORD, attempts were made to suspend him from KANU and to strip
 him of his councillorship. In September Bamahriz and other
 FORD members were "deregistered" from KANU by the KANU special
 delegates' conference. There is, however, no provision at all
 for deregistration in the KANU constitution. KANU, having
 agreed under pressure in 1990 to stop expelling members as a
 disciplinary measure, seems to be looking for other names under
 which to achieve the same effect: suppressing dissent in its
 ranks. It is not yet clear whether expulsions will become more
 or less common now that Kenyans are legally free to form and
 join parties other than KANU.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Kenya has no state religion. Freedom of worship.is
 acknowledged in the Constitution and generally allowed, but
 churches new to Kenya must obtain government approval to be
 registered. Some church figures have voiced concern about a
 new bill to regulate nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) in
 Kenya, which might impose some government controls over church
 projects. NGO's will henceforth have to reregister every 5
 years, and those deemed not to act in the' public interest may
 suffer deregistration
 Throughout 1991 activist churchmen were denounced by Parliament
 and the press, and the organizers of the abortive July 28
 prayer meeting, sponsored jointly by the Law Society of Kenya,
 the Church of the Province of Kenya, and the National Council
 of Christian Churches, were subjected to government pressure
 (see Section 2.b.).
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Kenyans may travel freely within the country. In September
 several Rift Valley politicians attending a political rally
 purported to "ban" members of the FORD from entering the
 Valley. They threatened reprisals against members of the
 Kikuyu ethnic group and multiparty supporters settled in the
 region. Implementation of these proposals is unlikely. Kenyan
 law gives all Kenyans the right to settle and conduct business,
 which includes obtaining land titles, in any area of the
 country.
 Kenya does not generally prohibit emigration of its citizens
 but on occasion does prevent travel abroad by critics of the
 Government. The Government does not regard issuance of
 passports to citizens as a right and reserves the authority to
 
 
 184
 KENYA
 issue or deny passports at its discretion. In 1991 the
 Government seized or declined to issue passports to over 20
 Kenyans. In two cases, the Government seized the passports of
 persons returning from abroad who had made political speeches
 during their trips.
 In July labor leader Dennis Akumu and former parliamentarian
 Martin Shikuku were removed from an aircraft they had boarded
 to travel to London. Their passports were not taken, but their
 right to travel was denied without any administrative or
 judicial proceeding.
 In 1991 large numbers of Somali and Ethiopian refugees fled to
 Kenya after their governments collapsed. Kenya has accepted
 most asylum seekers, though sometimes entry is delayed,
 resulting in hardship and denial of assistance, and many
 suffered police harassment. Thirty-seven Somali asylum seekers
 drowned when the Kenya Navy towed their boats to the open sea.
 (see Section l.a.).
 None of these refugees has been granted legal status other than
 that of asylum seeker. About 50,000 refugees reside in camps,
 and at least double that number live outside the camps, in
 cities as well as rural areas. Refugees outside of the camps
 are extremely vulnerable to arrest. Refugees who purchase fake
 identity papers and visas put themselves even further at risk.
 Conditions in the camps have caused several riots, one of which
 led to a number of hospitalizations. The Government promised
 to investigate the incident but has yet to do so.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens in 1991 had neither the right nor the ability to
 change the one party system of government through the electoral
 process. However, the year-end recommendations for
 constitutional change would permit multiparty elections by
 mid-1993 at the latest, which, if conducted freely and fairly,
 would give Kenyans this right. At year's end, it was not clear
 whether independent, as well as party-based candidates, would
 be permitted to contest the elections. Although the President
 said that each electoral district will be contested by a single
 KANU candidate, since the KANU nomination process was abolished
 in June, the selection mechanism within KANU remained unclear.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no local organizations solely devoted to
 investigating human rights abuses, but the Law Society of
 Kenya, some church groups, some periodicals, a few
 organizations, and individual attorneys function as de facto
 human rights monitors. However, through most of 1991 they
 faced serious obstacles, including harsh government criticism,
 restrictions on free speech and assembly, and, in some cases,
 torture and harassment by the police (see Section l.a.). The
 Government reacts negatively to criticism of its human rights
 record, at home and abroad, and through its accusations of
 association with "foreign masters" discourages Kenyans from
 providing outside human rights groups with information.

 KENYA
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Kenya's Constitution and laws prohibit discrimination on the
 basis of race, sex, religion, language, or social status.
 However, the situation of Kenyans of Somali ethnic origin is a
 major concern. Ethnic Somalis are the only ethnic group in
 Kenya for which the Government requires an additional form of
 identification, stating that they are Kenyan citizens.
 In 1990 the Government required that ethnic Somalis have their
 claim to Kenyan citizenship verified through a "screening"
 process involving verification by a panel of Somali elders.
 This screening effort continued through the first 3 months of
 1990 and then was phased out, although its practical effects
 remained. The screening has been widely criticized as
 discriminatory, unconstitutional, and without basis in law.
 Ethnic Somalis must still produce upon demand their Kenyan
 identification card and a second identification verifying
 "screening." Both cards are also required to apply for a
 passport, and airlines have been required to submit passports
 held by Kenyan Somalis for verification before-issuing tickets
 to such persons.
 Members of all ethnic groups may run for office, and ethnic
 representation at the minister and assistant minister level is
 broad. The Asian community, numbering about 65,000, accounts
 for a disproportionate share of the nation's economic wealth
 and output, but very few Asians participate in electoral
 politics; The Kikuyu remain the largest and richest ethnic
 group in Kenya. But anti-Kikuyu language from ministers and
 other officials entered the public domain in 1991 without
 official rebuke, particularly in connection with Kikuyu land
 purchases in areas traditionally inhabited by other tribes..
 While there is no legal discrimination against women,
 traditional culture and-attitudes have long prescribed limited
 roles for women. Women's roles are particularly restricted in,
 rural areas where they account for 75 percent of the total
 agricultural work force. Rural families are more reluctant to
 invest in educating girls than in educating boys, especially at
 the higher levels. The number of girls and boys in school are
 roughly equal at the primary and secondary levels, but men
 outnumber women by almost two to one in higher education.
 Though women are increasingly active in the modern economy, the
 number of women in professional roles is still limited. The
 number of female unemployed is double that of men. Women
 sometimes receive lower rates of pay than men performing the
 same job, and disparities in fringe benefits occur, e.g., some
 businesses give housing allowances to men but not to married
 women. Women are legally able to own property and businesses.
 Polygamy is not legal for people married under the Christian
 Marriage Act, but it is permitted for those who marry under
 African customary law. Kenya's law of succession, which-
 governs inheritance rights, provides for equal treatment of
 male and female children.
 The Government strongly condemns extreme violence towards
 women, specifically murder, female circumcision, rape, and
 incest. In many cases, rapists, particularly of minors, are
 given sentences of up to 14 years in prison. However, the
 ambivalence of Kenyans to the abuse of women was graphically
 demonstrated by the public response to a case of multiple rape
 
 
 186
 KENYA
 and manslaughter at St. Kizito boarding school. In July, on a
 Saturday night when few teachers or staff were at the school, a
 group of 50 adolescent boys attending St. Kizito broke into the
 crowded dormitory housing their female contemporaries. In the
 panic that ensued, 19 girls suffocated, and 71 were raped.
 Despite public expressions of horror at the event, many Kenyans
 acknowledge that rapes are frequent in Kenyan schools. This
 seems borne out by a published comment by the principal of the
 school, who said: "The boys meant no harm, they just wanted to
 rape."
 Domestic violence occurs in Kenya, but little information is
 available on the extent of the problem. In practice, most
 cases of domestic violence are settled outside of the courts.
 The maximum legal penalty for wife beating is 5 years in
 prison. Women may also sue for civil damages. Female
 circumcision is illegal but still practiced by some Kenyan
 ethnic groups on girls under the age of 16. The Government
 officially discourages the practice but leaves it to women's
 groups to actively oppose female circumcision through health
 education programs. Murder or manslaughter charges are brought
 when circumcisions result in death. There are press reports of
 both male and female community-forced circumcisions, but
 charges are never brought in such cases.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Save for the central Government's civil servants, all workers
 are free to join unions of their own choosing. The law
 provides that as few as seven workers may establish a union,
 provided the objectives of the union do not contravene Kenyan
 law and another union is not already representative of the
 employees in question. The Government may deregister a union,
 but the Registrar of Trade Unions must give the union 60 days
 to challenge the deregistration notice; an appeal of the
 Registrar's final decision may be brought before the High
 Court. The Kenya Civil Servants Union was deregistered more
 than 10 years ago by President Moi.
 There are at least 33 unions in Kenya representing
 approximately 350,0000 to 3a5,000 workers, or 3 percent of the
 country's work force. Except for the 150,000-165,000 teachers
 believed to be members of the Kenya National Union of Teachers
 and four other smaller unions, which have been registered by
 the Government, all other unions are affiliated with one
 central body, the Central Organization of Trade Unions (COTU).
 The Government created COTU in 1965 as the successor to both
 the Kenya Federation of Labor and the Kenya African Workers
 Congress. This amalgamation was effected allegedly to
 eliminate instability and rivalries within the nation's trade
 union movement.
 COTU is independent of the Government and KANU in name only.
 The 1965 decree establishing COTU gives the President the power
 to remove from office the central body's senior leaders. Rule
 5 of the COTU constitution accords nonvoting membership on the
 executive board (COTU's managing body) to a representative of
 the Labor Ministry as well as of KANU. Moreover, COTU and its
 Secretary General Joseph Mugalla arefirmly allied with the
 President and KANU against those who advocate greater
 democratization. In June, seeking to keep pliant unionists in
 office, the President offered to underwrite the costs of union
 elections which he had announced some 5 months earlier. At
 
 
 187
 KENYA
 year's end, Mugalla was reelected Secretzzy General, but his
 opponents declared their intention to form a rival
 Confederation. The Court of Appeals enjoined the Registrar
 from certifying the election pending a hearing on a suit
 brought by the opponents.
 The Trade Disputes Act permits workers to strike provided that
 21 days have elapsed following the submission to the Minister
 of Labor of a written report detailing the nature of the
 dispute. During this 21-day period, the Minister may either
 mediate the dispute himself, nominate a person to investigate
 and propose a solution, or refer the matter to the Industrial
 Court, a body of five judges appointed-by the President, for
 binding arbitration. Once a dispute is referred to either
 meditation, fact finding, or arbitration, any subsequent strike
 is illegal.
 The military, police, prison guards, and members of the
 National Youth Service are precluded by law from striking.
 Under the Trade Disputes Act, other civil servants, like. their
 private sector counterparts, may strike .following the 21-day
 notice period (28 days if it is an essential service, e.g.,
 water, health, education, air traffic control). However, the
 Labor Minister may at any time preempt a strike involving civil
 servants by referring the dispute to the. Industrial Court for
 resolution. Save for the wildcat strikes involving the bank
 employees in November and Mombasa's dockworkers in December,
 there were no significant strikes in 1991.
 Internationally, COTU is now affiliated to both the
 continentwide Organization of African Trade Union Unity and the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. Its
 affiliates are free to establish links to international trade
 secretariats of their choosing.- A veteran trade-union leader,
 associated with the political opposition, however, was
 prevented from leaving the country in June (see Section 2.d.).
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 While not having the force of law, the 1962 Industrial
 Relations Charter, executed by the Government, COTU, and the
 Federation of Kenya Employers,.gives workers the right-to
 engage in legitimate trade union organizational activities.
 Both the Trade Disputes Act and the Charter authorize
 collective bargaining between unions and employers. Wages and
 conditions of employment are established in the context of
 negotiations between unions and management. The Government has
 promulgated wage policy guidelines limiting wage increases to
 75 percent of the annual rate of inflation. Collective
 bargaining agreements must be registered with the Industrial
 Court for the purpose of guaranteeing adherence to these
 guidelines. In 1990 there were 1,875 agreements registered
 with the court. Some 1 million workers (union and nonunion)
 were covered by these accords.
 The Trade Disputes Act makes it illegal for employers to
 intimidate workers: Employees wrongfully dismissed for union
 activities are generally awarded damages in the form of lost
 wages by the Industrial Court; reinstatement is not a common
 remedy. This is due in large measure to the fact that most
 aggrieved workers have found alternative employment in the
 lengthy period prior to the hearing of their cases.
 While legislation authorizing the creation of export processiqg
 zones was passed in November 1990, such entities have been slow
 
 
 188
 KENYA
 to get off the ground. The first such zone, developed by a
 subsidiary of Firestone East Africa, has only succeeded in
 attracting a few investors. The Government has yet to decide
 definitively whether the provisions of the Trade Disputes Act,
 the Trade Unions Act, or the Regulation of Wages and Conditions
 of Employment Act will be extended to the zone (see also
 Section 6.e.).
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution proscribes slavery, servitude, and forced
 labor. Under the Chiefs' Authority Act, a local authority can
 require people to perform community services in an emergency,
 but there were no known instances of this practice in 1991.
 People so employed must be paid the prevailing wage for such
 employment. The International Labor Organization (ILO)
 Committee of Experts (COE) has found these and other provisions
 of Kenyan law to contravene ILO Conventions 29 and 105
 concerning forced labor. The COE's 1991 report noted the
 Government's intention to repeal or amend the offending
 provisions of the law in order to bring them into compliance
 with the Conventions. The Government, however, has not given a
 definite timetable for the introduction of remedial legislation.
 d, Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Employment Act of 1976 proscribes the employment in any
 industrial undertaking of children under the age of 16. This
 enactment applies neither to the agricultural sector, where the
 overwhelming majority of the labor force is employed, nor to
 children serving as apprentices under the terms of the
 Industrial Training Act. Ministry of Labor officers are
 authorized to enforce the minimum age statute. Given the high
 levels of adult unemployment and underemployment, the
 employment of children in the formal wage sector in violation
 of the Employment Act is not a significant problem.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The legal minimum wage for workers in the wage sector varies by
 location, age, and skills. On May 10, the minimum wage was
 raised an average of 16 percent. At the bottom rung of the
 adult minimum wage scale is the rural general laborer; the
 highest minimum was paid in Nairobi and Mombasa to drivers of
 heavy commercial vehicles. Violations of the minimum wage
 guidelines are not a recurring problem in the modern wage
 sector. Despite nominal wage increases, inflation over 20
 percent and the precipitous decline in the shilling's value
 substantially eroded workers' living standards during 1991.
 Most workers continued to lead the most marginal of existences.
 The Regulation of Wages and Conditions of Employment Act limits
 the normal workweek to 52 hours. Nighttime employees, however,
 may be employed for 60 hours a week. As is the case with
 respect to minimum age limitations, the Act specifically
 excludes agricultural workers from its purview. An employee in
 the nonagricultural sector is entitled to 1 rest day in a
 week. There are also provisions for annual leave and sick
 leave. Concerning limits on overtime, Kenyan law provides that
 the total hours worked (i.e., regular time plus overtime) in
 any 2-week period by night workers may not exceed 144 hours;
 the limit is 120 hours for other workeis.. The Ministry of
 Labor is tasked with enforcing tHese regulations, but reported
 violations are few.
 
 
 189
 KENYA
 The Factories Act of 1951 sets forth detailed health and safety
 standards; the Act was amended in 1990 to encompass the
 agriculture, service, and government sectors. The 65 health
 and safety inspectors attached to the Ministry of Labor's
 Directorate of Occupational Health and Safety Services have the
 authority to inspect factories and work sites if they have
 reason to believe that a violation of'the Act has occurred, or
 upon receipt of a complaint from a worker. As a result of the
 1990 amendments, the Directorate's inspectors may now issue
 notices enjoining employers from practices or activities which
 involve a risk of serious personal injuries. Previously, only
 magistrates were vested with this authority.
 Such notices may be appealed to the Factories Appeals Court, a
 body of four members, one of whom must be a High Coqrt judge.
 In practice, inspectors, who conduct 2,000 to 3,000 inspections
 annually, generally respond only to worker complaints.
 "Whistle blowers" are not protected by the Factories Act. On
 May 31, the Government exempted enterprises in the export
 processing zones from the occupational health and safety
 requirements of the Factories Act.
