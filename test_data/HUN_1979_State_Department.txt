 HUNGARY
 Except for a brief period in 1956, one-party rule has
 been a fact in Hungary for more than three decades.
 The Communist Party has maintained a monopoly of
 political power. Although a number of citizens' rights
 are prescribed by the Constitution, as in other Communist
 countries, such rights are qualified by the interests of
 "socialist society."
 Prior to the 1956 revolution, the Hungarian Government
 followed rigid Stalinist policies. Beginning in the early
 1960's, Hungary has gradually eased internal controls, per-
 mitting a degree of modest economic wellbeing and cultural
 diversity. This easing of controls represents an attempt
 to accommodate popular opposition to rigid restrictions.
 Political expression is still tightly controlled and effect-
 ive participation in the political process is not possible
 without approval of the Communist Party. However, the
 Party has sought public support through the explicitly-
 stated "alliance" policy under the tenet, "who is not
 against us is with us," and through mass organizationSsuch
 as the Patriotic People's Front.
 According to Amnesty International, there are a few pol-
 itical prisoners in Hungary. Emigration is possible within
 limits. Visitor-travel abroad, including to Western
 countries, is-possible within wider limits. Religion can be
 practiced to a considerable extent. Secret police and pro-
 secutorial discretion, powers, and methods are curtailed to
 an extent. In this last connection, Party and Government
 officials claim to have eradicated many of the abuses of
 "socialist legality" which characterized the pre-1956 period.
 Since 1945 , Soviet troops have been "temporarily" stationed
 in Hungary. An estimated 70,000 Soviet troops are currently
 in the country. They are garrisoned outside the major
 cities and maintain a low profile.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person,
 Including Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The Constitution guarantees the right of citizens to preser-
 vation of life, integrity of the body, good health, and
 personal liberty and inviolability of the person. There are
 no known recent instances of torture or violation of the
 above provisions.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment
 or Punishment
 There have been no known executions in Hungary in recent
 years (although some reportedly occurred during--and a much
 larger number after--the suppression of the 1956 revolution).
 Cruelty and other forms of mistreatment are believed to have
 gradually ceased after the end of the so-called consoli-
 dation phase in 1960. Citizens may sue the police for
 brutality, and in at lease one case, a person has done so.

 There are three levels of punitive incarceration in Hungary:
 "workhouse," with somewhat liberal visiting, outside work,
 and outside leave possibilities; "jail," which is less lib-
 eral; and "prison," maximum-security penitentiary. Prison
 conditions vary in relation to the category level, but all
 levels are believed to provide adequate diet and health
 care. Hardened criminals are confined separately from
 those convicted of petty crimes. Prisoners have a right
 to an attorney of their choice. With varying degrees of
 frequency depending on levels of imprisonment, prisoners
 have visitation rights by family members, other relatives,
 and friends. There does not appear to be deliberate and
 willful or other systematic mistreatment of prisoners.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Citizens are generally free from arbitrary arrest. Upon
 arrest, a detainee must be informed in writing of what she
 or he is suspected, and can be held at a police station a
 maximum of 72 hours before charges must be filed. There
 is no right of bail or provisional pretrial liberty, but
 authorities have some discretion to grant pretrial liberty.
 They do so only rarely. In cases of suspicion for major
 crimes, a person can be held in jail 30 days before trial,
 renewable twice for a maximum of three months.
 No persons remain in prison because of activities related
 to the 1956 revolt. During the past year, according to
 Amnesty International, three Hungarians (sentenced inter
 alia for attempting to form a Helsinki monitoring group in
 Hungary) were released after serving sentences ranging from
 5 to 18 months. Another Hungarian, Dr. Maria Dombovari-
 Lorincz, reportedly has been recently released after having
 been keptin involuntary confinement in a psychiatric hos-
 pital since her trial in 1976.
 On July 1, 1979 Hungary adopted a new penal code which some-
 what narrows the range of acts defined as crimes and pro-
 vides for modest reduction of penalties for some types of
 offenses. The new penal code, however, retains an article
 on "incitement" permitting officials to prosecute a wide
 range of utterances or statements per se. Official
 Hungarian statistics show that 230 cases of incitement
 arose in 1977 and 214 in 1978. 'Apparently not all these
 cases involved political matters. Frequently such cases
 result in short or suspended sentences.
 Another penal code provision on "espionage" provides for
 punishing "a person who obtains, collects, or gives out data
 which can be used against the Hungarian People's Republic
 with the purpose to forward them to a foreign government or
 organizations..." Neither the nature of the datA transmitted
 nor the nature of the recipient organization is closely de-
 fined.
 In a November 1979 interview the Hungarian Interior Minister
 indicated that there has been a slight increase in the crime
 rate during the past five years. The Minister attributed the
 increase in crime to accelerated urbanization and social mo-
 bility, a dynamic increase in tourism, societal tension due
 to financial circumstances, and alcohol consumption.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution (Article 49) stipulates that all court pro-
 ceedings are open except for cases specifically exempted by
 
 
 610
 law (those involving morals or state secrets), and that "all
 courts are independent" (Article 50 (2)) and "subject to
 laws." All courts deal with criminal, "political," and
 security cases.
 In general, judicial procedures are based on Napoleonic
 code principles, i.e., they are investigatory rather than
 adversary in nature. There is no trial by jury. Defend-
 ants are entitled to counsel. While courts normally seek
 to apply the law in a methodical fashion, political pressure
 can be presumed to be applied by the Communist Party in cases
 of special interest.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The Constitution guarantees citizens' personal freedom and
 inviolability, as well as the secrecy of correspondence and
 privacy of the home. Such guarantees are couched "in the
 interests of socialism" and may in practice be breached in
 the name of that interest, but Hungarian practice appears to
 afford a degree of due process. For example, search war-
 rants are necessary, and house searches require a court
 order and must be carried out in the presence of two wit-
 nesses. A written inventory must be prepared of items
 removed from the premises. Available information corrobo-
 rates adherence to these procedures.
 2.   Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Hungary has undergone rapid industrialization since the
 end of the Second World War, transforming a basically
 agricultural society with some feudal overtones into a
 moderately-developed industrial socialist state. Agricul-
 ture currently employs about 20% of the vrkforce. The city of
 Budapest has 20% of Hungary's total population; 34% live in smaller
 cities or tans, and the remaining 46% live in villages or rural
 settlements. Hungaryis a communist country; except for a
 private sector of small stores and artisan shops and
 small private agricultural plots, ownership of all means
 of economic activity is vested either in the state or in
 cooperatives. Although the right to own private "personal"
 property is protected, there are strict limits on the
 amount of real property which can be privately owned.
 The government has been relatively forthcoming in informing
 the public about economic problems in sober and nonideological
 terms. Current economic discourse is factual in tone and is
 keyed to the need for Hungary to make its way in a competitive
 world. In this connection, Hungary undertook in mid-1979 to
 build upon reform mechanisms dating from 1968 to make its
 economy more efficient and more competitive with world trad-
 ing partners, including Western ones. In the near term the
 new measures confront Hungarians with higher consumer prices
 and with the prospect of a static, or slightly diminished,
 standard of living. Living standards are also affected by
 energy conservation measures.
 The Hungarian Government assigns high priority to housing
 construction, and in recent years the number of new dwellings
 completed has hovered around 90,000 per year. Waiting lists
 and anxiety over ability to obtain housing and over inter-
 
 
 611
 generational crowding in existing housing are common in
 Hungary, and a serious housing shortage remains a major
 source of public frustration.
 The average Hungarian monthly wage is about 3,522 forints
 ($173). Information on the average division of earnings
 is not extensive. One mid-1979 set of statistics indicat-
 ed that 76% of wage earners received between 2,000 ($99)
 and 5,000 ($246) forints per month, 6% received less than
 2,000 forints, and 18% received more than 5,000 forints
 (including .6% receiving more than 10,000 forints/mo.).
 Actual income disparities are undoubtedly higher, as, for
 example, between pensioners, who were not included in the
 above survey, and individuals who supplement their official
 salaries with income from moonlighting and significant tip-
 income. Persons in senior governmental and party positions
 also have access to special stores and privileges not avail-
 able to the general public.
 There is an extensive system of medical benefits so that
 virtually everyone has access to medical care at little cost.
 At the same time the quality of medical services is greatly
 dependent on the patient's ability to offer substantial
 money or material gifts to receive quality service. Senior
 party, governmental, and military persons presumably have
 access to special medical facilities.
 Education is free in general, with only nominal fees or
 costs at the university level.
 Alcoholism is a major health and social problem. Hungary
 also suffers from an elevated suicide rate.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press) Religion and Assembly
 Articles 63, 64 and 65 of the Constitution guarantee freedom
 of conscience, religious practice, free speech, free press
 and assembly, and the right to form associations. The latter
 four rights are qualified by the need to conform to the
 "interests of socialism and the people." In practice, if a
 Hungarian citizen accepts the cbmmunist form of government
 bnd does not publicly oppose Hungary's alliance with the
 Soviet Union, he or she is free to pursue a range of expression
 and activity. If these limits are not respected, it is
 possible to be subjected to varying measures of admonition,
 harassment, and punishment. The Constitution does not protect
 the citizen who exceeds the generally-understood boundaries
 of expression, and pervasive self-censorship in media and
 cultural circles serves to remind him where the boundaries are.
 Despite the absence of formal censorshipauthorities have banned
 circulation of particular books or articles.
 
 
 There is no organized dissent in Hungary in the sense of
 identifiable groups or continuing movements. The Govern-
 ment seeks tacit support from the populace in general,
 professes confidence that its measures have that support,
 and appears to be willing to weather, without explicit
 reply or rejoinder, some incidents of dissent which
 occasionally emerge. In 1977, a group of 34 Hungarian
 intellectuals sent letters of support to Czechoslovak
 intellectuals in connection with their promulgation of
 the famous manifesto, Charter 77. Hungary did not carry
 out repressive or retaliatory actions against the
 Hungarian signers -- who did not criticize Hungary or
 communism per se -- although some of them left Hungary for
 extensive stays abroad, presumably under pressure. In
 October 1979, 254 intellectuals siqned petitions protestinq
 Czechoslovak dissident trials and expressing support for
 Charter 77. The Hungarian Government has not publicly
 reacted to these petitions. In late December and early
 January there were reports of harassment of some of
 the signatories, including dismissal from their jobs.
 Persons have been sentenced for brief periods for "incitement"
 and for such activities as trying to form an unauthorized
 Helsinki monitoring group.
 Hungarian press, radio, and television are government
 managed. They are governmentally owned and observe both
 current Party'guidelines and the maxim that the role of a
 "journalist" is to further the cause of communism. Cen-
 sorship does not exist in a formal sense but rather is
 exercised by writers and editors themselves in terms of
 certain basic premises of domestic and foreign policy. Some
 carefully-nuanced differing views occasionally appear in the
 press and literature, but they are usually well within the
 general constraints. Infrequently, Western viewpoints can
 be heard on Hungarian radio and television. These may be
 the views of a Western spokesman broadcast together with
 those of other participants in a panel discussion, or
 .straight reporting of a Western official.'s comments on a-
 topical international issue such as SALT.
 Hungary does not jam Western radios (including RFE), and
 Austrian and Yugoslav radio and television broadcasts
 reach much of the country. Hungary permits a degree of
 access to Western literature and films, including some
 American movies and television programs. Some Western
 periodicals continue to be available in very limited quanti-
 ties in Hungary, usually only at locales frequented by
 foreigners.
 The practice of religion in Hungary is neither encouraged
 nor rigorously impeded by the state which -- albeit stead-
 fastly committed to atheism -- has come to profess the
 acceptability of both believers and nonbelievers working
 together in the interest of "socialist society." However,
 a Hungarian's religious beliefs can limit advancement in
 Party, government, and other organizations.
 
 
 613
 Sizeable religious groups in Hungary include Roman Catholics
 (5.25 million), Calvinists (2 million), Evangelical Lutherans
 (0.5 million), and Jews (80,000). There are some 19 religious
 denominations in Hungary recognized by law plus several
 minor sects, such as Jehovah's Witnesses. The total number
 of persons manifesting some religious belief is estimated
 at 8.5 million. There are Jewish schools and a rabbinical
 seminary.
 b.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 Citizens must possess an I.D. booklet and carry it with them
 for travel, and register with local police when moving from
 one locality to another. Permanent transfer from rural
 areas to Budapest is permitted, but, because of overcrowding
 of the capital, is not encouraged and can be difficult be-
 cause of the scarcity of housing.
 Hungarian emigration law is ostensibly restrictive in that
 it stipulates that a person can normally apply to emigrate
 only if over 55 years of age and joining a parent, spouse,
 or child abroad. However, the law provides for exceptions
 to the normal rules in individual cases, and approximately
 90% of Hungarians who apply to emigrate receive permission.
 Persons who are refused may appeal and reapply; reappli-
 cations are considered on a case-by-case basis and are
 sometimes successful, particularly if special humanitarian
 considerations emerge. There are no systematic official
 sanctions, such as loss of employment, imposed on persons
 who seek to emigrate, and emigrants may take a modest
 amount of personal property with them.
 Hungary follows a cautiously liberal practice in regard
 to permitting visits to the West. Some 355,000 Hungarians
 currently visit the West annually; 3-4 million make visits
 to other Eastern European countries.
 Substantial numbers of Hungarians can visit the West at
 regulated intervals, if they wish. It is possible to pay
 for trips to Western Europe and beyond, including North
 America, in Hungarian currency. Private travelers can re-
 ceive a modest amount of hard-currency exchange once every
 three years to defray hard-currency expenses; biennial or,
 in the case of older persons, annual trips are possible if
 relatives or friends abroad pay the costs.
 Exit permission for both visitors and emigrants can be and
 occasionally is denied, under the law, to persons "whose
 travel or sojourn abroad violates or jeopardizes the interests
 of the Hungarian People's Republic or other public interest."
 The "right" of travel remains a gift of the state rather than
 a prerogative of the individual.
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The Constitution emphasizes that the Hungarian Socialist
 Workers (Communist) Party represents the "working class"
 and the "interests of the whole of the society." The
 Communist Party retains 9 monopoly of political power in
 Hungary and utilizes Party-sanctioned organizations such as
 the Patriotic People's Front, trade unions, and the Young
 Communist Organization to elicit broad public support.
 Effective political participation is not possible outside the
 Party or the Party-sanctioned organizations.
 
 
 614
 The Party to an extent invites the opinions and recom-
 mendations of nonparty organizations, for example,
 cooperatives' associations, on policy proposals in which
 they have an interest. It appears that deliberation within
 the Party about proposed policies and actions can be somewhat
 open, but decisions once made and handed down by the leader-
 ship are to be loyally followed.
 The Constitution guarantees equal rights for men and women.
 Women appear to participate freely in all major sectors of
 social activity, especially in medicine and in education.
 Although more than one-third of the members of the National
 Assembly are women, relatively few women are at the top
 levels of the Party and the Government.
 Hungarian trade unions do not have the right to strike and,
 like other mass organizations, are subject to Party control
 and direction. However, the Party does, to an extent,
 appear to welcome their suggestions on policy proposals
 and, at enterprise levels, trade unions appear to play some
 role in employer-employee relations including matters such
 as bonuses, profit shares, work safety and conditions, and
 enterprise-controlled housing.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental Investigation
 of Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 The Hungarian Government regards outside charges and investi-
 gations of alleged human rights violations as interference
 in its internal affairs. Hungary has nevertheless shown
 a willingness to engage in mutually beneficial discussions
 with other countries on all aspects of the Helsinki Final
 Act, including its human rights provisions. In certain
 elements of its bilateral dialogue with some other
 countries, Hungary has been willing to discuss quietly some
 individual problem cases, particularly ones dealing with
 emigration.
