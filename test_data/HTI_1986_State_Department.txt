 HAITI
 After months of mounting unrest, President-for-Life Jean-Claude
 Duvalier fled Haiti on February 7, 1986. This ended the
 hereditary dictatorship begun by his father, Francois Duvalier,
 in 1957. The National Governing Council (CNG) replaced
 Duvalier and is presently composed of three members:
 Lieutenant General Henri Namphy, President, Colonel Williams
 Regala, and Jacques Francois. On assuming office, the CNG
 suspended Duvalier's 1983 constitution and currently rules by
 decree. It has largely retained the inherited government
 structure while replacing most senior officials. The CNG at
 its inception stated that its primary goal wag to oversee a
 transition to a freely elected government. To this end, it
 announced on June 7 a comprehensive program for building
 democratic institutions, to culminate in the inauguration of an
 elected president and legislature on February 7, 1988.
 The CNG committed itself to the protection of human rights and
 the end of the systemic repression of the Duvalier regime. In
 one of its first acts, it freed all political prisoners. It
 also dissolved the Volunteers for National Security (VSN) or
 "Tontons Macoute," Duvalier's.secret police. All defense and
 police functions are now performed by the Haitian armed forces,
 an integrated organization composed of army, navy, air force,
 and police elements.
 The CNG has instituted basic freedoms of expression and
 association. The press now functions without restraint.
 Dozens of political parties have emerged, and Haitian
 politicians are attempting to build electoral support. The CNG
 has issued two decrees governing the press and political
 parties, respectively. Both decrees have been criticized as
 unduly restrictive, but in practice, press and political
 activity have flourished without hindrance by the Government.
 Extreme poverty, a weak economy, and a deteriorating
 environment remain Haiti's most urgent problems. Haiti is the
 poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. Few social services
 are available to the average Haitian; a CNG goal is to improve
 living standards  Economic reforms have reduced prices of
 certain staples such as gasoline and cooking oil.
 Virtually all Haitians welcomed Duvalier's ouster and the new
 opportunities it provided. However, the CNG has moved only
 gradually to make changes many Haitians and other observers
 expected. Haitians have manifested their impatience in several
 periods of unrest since Duvalier's departure. Often stimulated
 by agitators, they have marched and demonstrated during these
 periods. There have been about a dozen deaths at government
 hands, generally during confrontations with police and military
 forces; approximately three soldiers and police also have
 died. While the Government has implemented positive human
 rights measures, incidents contrary to CNG policy demonstrate
 that further progress remains to be made, especially in the
 professionalization of the security forces.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Since February 7, there is no evidence that the Government has
 singled out individuals and killed them for political motives.
 
 
 534
 HAITI
 However, there have been several instances where people have
 been killed during confrontations with government forces;
 government personnel acting in a private capacity also have
 exceeded, their authority and killed people.  The Government
 has investigated'several such cases and has prosecuted in at
 least one of these.
 The most serious incident occurred April 26 at Fort Dimanche, a
 military base and, under the Duvaliers, a political prison.
 Early that day, a commemorative mass took place to honor
 victims of a 1963 massacre by the regime of Francois Duvalier.
 Thousands of mourners then marched peaceably to Fort Dimanche
 where a confrontation developed between the few police officers
 present and a separate group of agitators. The police opened
 fire after rocks and other debris were allegedly thrown. Three
 persons were killed; four others died when an electrical line
 fell. The Government announced that it would investigate the
 tragedy. However, no report has been issued nor has
 anyone--police or agitator--been arrested. Another incident
 occurred February 26, when security forces shot and killed one
 person at the home of a former Duvalier regime official in
 Port-au-Prince during a curfew imposed because of unrest. The
 victim and about a dozen others were in the house when security
 forces arrived and, apparently with no explanation, began
 beating some of those present. On March 19, in a violent
 encounter in Port-au-Prince, gunfire from soldiers resulted in
 one to five deaths (the number is unknown). The Government
 issued a report on this incident late in 1986; this report did
 not find the Government at fault. On June 6, government
 security forces shot and killed a man in Port-au-Prince during
 a confrontation between protestors and government forces.
 Army Adjutant Robesse Metellus was charged with killing a
 public transport driver in October. He was subsequently tried,
 convicted, and sentenced to prison.
 Government security personnel have also been the victims of
 violence. One police sergeant was shot and wounded May 30 by
 demonstrators in Port-au-Prince. On June 4, an unknown
 assailant shot and killed a police sergeant. Neither case has
 been solved. A police station in the Cite Soleil slum was
 attacked September 19 and two police officers were killed. On
 October 1 and 2, the Armed Forces announced that three men had
 been arrested in connection with the attack and two others were
 being sought.
 The Government has prosecuted several Duvalier regime security
 officials accused of murder and other crimes, and has charged,
 or said it would prosecute, about 20 others. On April 4, a
 court-martial sentenced a warrant officer to I year in prison
 at hard labor for having ordered the fatal beating of a
 Gonaives schoolmaster in 1985. An 18-day court-martial
 convicted Lt. Col. Samuel Jeremie of homicide May 30 and
 sentenced him to 15 years' imprisonment. Jeremie was found
 guilty of a 1984 murder and of mass killings in Leogane in
 January 1986. After a 15-hour trial in July, a 12-member jury
 convicted former secret police chief Luc Desyr of the murder of
 a man and his wife in 1935. Desyr was sentenced to death. He
 remains in custody.
 On July 22, a court convicted Edouard Paul of the disappearance
 and death of Pierre Denis in 1969. Paul, the former director
 of the Government's literacy office and of the Duvalier
 political movement CONAJEC, was sentenced to 3 years'
 
 
 535
 HAITI
 imprisonment and fined US$180,000. The trial lasted 15
 uninterrupted hours.
 On September 11, two former secret police officials were
 convicted in absentia and sentenced to death as accomplices in
 two murders. The court also awarded the victims' estates
 US$400,000 damages. The Government has an extradition request
 before a Brazilian court for former police chief Albert Pierre
 so he can stand trial for multiple crimes.
 b. Disappearance
 In a widely publicized case, Charlot Jacquelin, a Catholic
 church literacy worker disappeared September 19. Witnesses
 said several civilians and one man in military fatigues took
 Jacquelin from his home to a police station, where they were
 met by eight men in blue police uniforms who took Jacquelin
 away. He has not been seen since. Jacquelin's disappearance
 sparked controversy and some unrest. Both civil and military
 officials denied any knowledge of Jacquelin's whereabouts.
 The Government released 28 political prisoners on February 7.
 The whereabouts of several political prisoners from the
 Duvalier era, however, remain unknown. The Government
 maintains that all political prisoners found in prison were
 freed on February 7, and that any persons still missing must be
 presumed to have died in custody. Family members and
 associates of the missing continue to seek definitive reports
 from the authorities in each case. No such reports were issued
 in 1986.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Several persons complained they were physically abused by
 police when arrested at demonstrations. However, there is no
 credible evidence of torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment under the CNG. Prison conditions in
 Haiti are poor.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The CNG ended the arbitrary arrest and detention of political
 opponents. Under Haitian law, a person may be arrested or
 detained if apprehended during the commission of a crime or
 pursuant to a judicial warrant based on evidence justifying the
 arrest. In all cases not involving the actual commission of a
 crime or issuance of a warrant, the person arrested must be
 brought before a judge within 48 hours to determine if a legal
 basis exists for the arrest. If the judge so determines, the
 person may be detained for further legal process. Otherwise,
 he is released.
 In addition to the laws governing arrests, Haitian law requires
 that a suspect be formally charged at least 2 weeks before
 trial. The law permits the accused to meet with an attorney
 immediately before trial, although defendants are often able to
 meet informally with counsel shortly after arrest. There is no
 public defender or bail system in Haiti; judges may, however,
 grant "provisional liberty" to a prisoner. A case may be
 brought before a jury or, in the case of military personnel, a
 court-martial. Defendants may appeal judgments within 3 days
 of conviction.
 
 
 536
 HAITI
 The entire Haitian legal system is recovering from abuse and
 neglect during the Duvalier era, when it had little
 independence. In cases of arrest of political activists since
 February, the system appears to have operated generally in
 accordance with legal requirements. In October army units
 arrested three anti-CNG activists, apparently for disturbing
 the peace; all were released 3 days later on court orders. On
 October 6, military forces in Les Cayes arrested a prominent
 anti-Duvalierist on charges of being a public nuisance. He was
 later released, and no legal action against him is pending.
 Cap-Haitien police arrested a Catholic literacy worker in
 October. They notified Church officials promptly.
 Except for those associated with Jean-Claude Duvalier who fled
 Haiti on or after February 7, there are no Haitian political
 exiles. Those exiled under the Duvalier regime have been
 invited by the CNG to return to Haiti; many have.
 Forced or compulsory labor, other than prison labor, is not
 employed in Haiti
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials in the Jeremie, Desyr, and Paul cases were public and
 received full media coverage. Juries and courts-martial were
 properly constituted. The defendants were represented by
 attorneys, who themselves faced public criticism for taking the
 cases. In each trial, the accused confronted witnesses and was
 allowed to cross-examine them, through counsel, and to make
 statements on his own behalf.
 The difficulties of conducting fair trials for Duvalier
 officials charged with murder and other crimes were
 demonstrated in April in the case of Adherbal Lherisson.
 Prosecutors could not begin his trial in Cap-Haitien because
 witnesses were unwilling to testify, and there was a problem of
 obtaining evidence in a case 2 decades old. Rioters then
 burned down the prosecutor's house and ran the defense lawyer
 out of town. The trial is still scheduled, perhaps with a
 change of venue.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 There is no interference with individual privacy or the
 sanctity of the family, home, or correspondence.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The CNG has promoted free speech and press freedom. Public
 debate is robust. Criticism of the Government and its
 officials is prominent in all media, including the state-owned
 daily newspaper Haiti Liberee, Radio Nationale, and Television
 Nationale d'Haiti.
 No journalists have made credible allegations of official
 censorship or intimidation. Twice, journalists at the
 state-owned media have implied or complained of CNG
 interference with editorial content. In neither case were the
 allegations substantiated.
 There are several privately owned daily and weekly newspapers
 and radio stations and one television station. All have
 
 
 537
 HAITI
 criticized the CNG with no apparent interference from the
 Government. Church-owned radio stations are prominent in
 Haiti. The Catholic and Protestant churches operate Radio
 Soleil and Radio Lumiere, respectively. Both served as
 important sources of news and commentary during the last months
 of the Duvalier regime. Both continue to provide news, and
 their commentaries often are critical of the CNG. There is no
 indication that the Government has interfered with their
 operations.
 Foreign publications are freely sold and distributed in Haiti.
 Several weeklies produced by Haitians in the United States and
 other once-prohibited foreign publications have become freely
 available in Haiti since the CNG assumed power. At least one
 U.S.-based publication has opened a local office.
 On July 31 the CNG issued a comprehensive press decree which
 has been the target of intermittent public criticism. It does
 not appear, however, to have inhibited the press in any way.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The CNG permits freedom of assembly and association. Many
 political parties, human rights groups, and other associations
 have formed and become active. People have assembled publicly
 with little government interference since Duvalier's departure
 and have expressed many opinions, some highly critical of the
 CNG. The Government has, however, reacted with force when
 marches and demonstrations were believed to threaten public
 order or safety.
 The Ministry of the Interior and National Defense issued
 regulations in May requiring groups planning marches to obtain
 permits from local police at least 72 hours in advance. Groups
 were required to designate marshals and coordinate marchers'
 security with the police. These regulations had little
 practical effect until early October, when police began
 enforcing them and put a stop to several unauthorized
 protests. Although the Government has generally allowed groups
 to demonstrate, it took forceful action in cases where marches
 threatened public order, increasingly so toward the end of
 1986. In several instances there were deaths and injuries on
 both sides. According to the Government, excessive police and
 army use of force generally results from inexperience,
 overreaction, provocation, or lack of service discipline. The
 Government states that excessive use of force does not reflect
 its policy.
 Dozens of political groups and parties have emerged since
 February 7. A few existed in Haiti under Duvalier but operated
 cautiously. Others were formed abroad by exiles and now
 function in Haiti. New parties range from paper organizations
 to a few which claim large and well-organized memberships.
 On July 30, the CNG issued a political parties law guaranteeing
 the right of citizens to form political parties, and containing
 provisions governing the organization, registration, and
 functioning of parties. Reaction to the law has been diverse.
 Some politicians said they would comply with the law; others
 attacked one or another provision, or rejected it. In spite of
 this, the law does not appear to have inhibited political
 activity and in fact has served as an additional point for
 public debate.
 
 
 538
 HAITI
 Many human rights, political, and other civic organizations
 have been active in Haiti since February 7. As with the
 political parties, they range from the ephemeral to relatively
 well-organized and sophisticated associations. Some groups
 have sponsored public conferences and seminars concerning human
 rights and democracy. The League of Former Political Prisoners
 organized two conferences in August and September on
 constitutionalism and human rights. In October, the
 International Institute of Haiti for Research and Development
 organized a seminar on the electoral process that featured
 election experts from several countries. These conferences and
 seminars have been conducted with no government interference.
 Trade unionism is in its infancy in Haiti, even though the
 Duvalier labor code guaranteed the right of workers to organize
 unions and seek international affiliation. Today the leading
 union federation in terms of membership in affiliated unions is
 the Federation of Union Workers (FOS). By October 1986, 16
 legally-registered and 6 unregistered unions were associated
 with FOS, which claimed an aggregate membership of 2,800. FOS
 is apolitical, concerned with traditional labor-management
 issues. It has worked with the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). Two other trade union organizations
 operated in Haiti in 1986. One is the Autonomous Central of
 Haitian Workers (CATH/CLAT), affiliated with the World
 Confederation of Labor. Its membership is estimated at several
 hundred. The other organization is an offshoot of CATH/CLAT.
 Employer organizations joined to promote their interests with
 labor and government in the Alliance of the Private Sector for
 Development. Besides retaining the pre-existing labor code,
 the CNG issued two decrees bearing directly on labor issues.
 One created a mixed commission to establish wages when there is
 a labor-management conflict over pay scales. The second
 defines the circumstances under which a strike or lockout is
 legal.
 Although the labor code and these decrees provide a framework
 for relations between labor, management, and government,
 organized labor's success in negotiations with management has
 been limited. In the period immediately after Duvalier's
 departure, there were many wildcat strikes. These strikes
 diminished as workers realized their expectations were
 sometimes unrealistic; retaliation by employers increased, and
 some ceased operations in Haiti. Some labor-management
 disputes were resolved or averted through intervention by labor
 union officials. Although strikes and walkouts decreased,
 disputes continued periodically. Several workers were fired
 illegally for legal union activity. In response, FOS in
 October appealed for help to ICFTU and the Inter-American
 Commission on Human and Trade Union Rights. Other labor
 organizations complained to labor and human rights groups
 outside Haiti. One typical case involved a worker who attended
 a labor training course in Washington sponsored by the American
 Institute for Free Labor Development, and was fired for that
 reason.
 The Haitian Government's real commitment to fostering trade
 unionism remains to be demonstrated. Although legal mechanisms
 guarantee unions and workers various rights and privileges,
 employers wield much influence because unemployment remains
 high (estimated in the 50 percent range), resources are few,
 and investment is crucial to economic development. The
 Government has failed generally to enforce labor laws, often to
 the detriment of management as well as workers. For example,
 workers at one U.S.-owned plant went on strike following the
 
 
 539
 HAITI
 firing of a union leader. The government took no legal action
 against the workers or the company.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Roman Catholicism is the official religion of Haiti and is
 embraced to varying degrees by about 75 percent of the
 population. Voodoo, a religion combining Christian and African
 animist elements, is also practiced by a majority of Haitians.
 All other religions are freely practiced by their adherents.
 The Government does not interfere with proselytizing,
 missionary activities, sects that affiliate with overseas
 coreligionists, or religious instruction and publishing.
 After Duvalier's departure, elements of the rural population
 attacked many voodoo priests, reportedly because of their
 "pagan" beliefs and supposed VSN or Duvalier ties. Many were
 reported murdered. The Government was not involved in this
 activity and in several cases offered protection to those
 threatened.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government does not normally restrict domestic travel of
 citizens or foreigners. A sparse network of military
 checkpoints operates irregularly across Haiti, and foreigners
 and interurban transports are sometimes required to register
 before entering some towns. Police enforce this requirement
 much less rigorously than during the Duvalier era. There are
 no restrictions on persons changing their residences or places
 of employment.
 Haitians are legally required to obtain passports and exit
 visas of limited validity before leaving the country. Reentry
 visas, obtained from Haitian consulates abroad, are
 theoretically required of those who have been out of Haiti for
 a long period; the requirement is not normally enforced.
 Travel documents are neither issued nor denied on the basis of
 political considerations. Expatriates are free to return to
 Haiti, and many regularly do so. The Government encourages
 skilled Haitian emigrants to return. Many have done so.
 Immigration officials at Port-au-Prince maintain and use a list
 of persons to be prevented from leaving or entering the country
 for criminal, security or other reasons.
 Large numbers of Haitians continue to attempt to leave Haiti
 for economic reasons. Their primary destination is the United
 States. Pursuant to a 1981 U.S.-Haitian agreement on the
 interdiction of undocumented migrants, about 3,000 illegal
 migrants were repatriated to Haiti by the U.S. Coast Guard in
 1986.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The CNG's stated purpose is to provide a transition to a
 democratic government. On June 7 it announced a calendar for
 political reform that will culminate in 1988. Intermediate
 steps include election of rural councils, an advisory
 "consultative council," and a constituent assembly to draft and
 present a new constitution for approval in a referendum;
 enactment of press and political parties laws; and municipal,
 local, legislative, and presidential elections, the last two in
 November 1987. The CNG completed all steps on schedule, with
 
 
 540
 HAITI
 no evident fraud or deception. Elections for rural councils
 took place in September. The Consultative Council assumed
 office on September 29 after elections earlier in the month.
 On October 19, a national election for members of the
 Constituent Assembly took place. The Assembly consists of 41
 elected members, 1 from each voting district, and 20 members
 appointed by the CNG. Prior to the election, the CNG appointed
 9 constitutional experts to write a draft constitution as a
 point of departure for the assembly. They began work in
 mid-October.
 These elections did not arouse a great deal of public interest
 or participation. Observers attributed this to Haitians'
 inexperience with free elections, mass illiteracy, uncertainty
 about procedures, distrust of the CNG, and a lack of civic
 responsibility and participation by political parties and
 pressure groups. The Government did not provide clear
 instructions well enough in advance to give voters a good idea
 of the significance of and procedures involved in each
 election. Rudimentary voting procedures were employed. For
 the constituent assembly election, voting assistants helped
 illiterate voters indicate their choices, and marked their
 hands with indelible ink to prevent multiple voting. Observers
 estimate that only 5 to 10 percent of eligible voters actually
 cast ballots. Nevertheless, the Government, operating with
 little experience, few technical resources, and a cramped
 timetable, met its electoral commitments. That it did so in
 the face of multiple handicaps impressed many observers.
 Politicians did little to encourage voter participation.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In December President Namphy met with the United Nations Human
 Rights Commission's Special Rapporteur on Haiti to discuss
 human rights developments. In addition, members of the CNG and
 other government officials met with representatives of Americas
 Watch and the Center for Electoral Promotion and Assistance,
 which is affiliated with the Inter-American Institute of Human
 Rights. The CNG has agreed to meet with the Organization of
 American States' Inter-American Human Rights Commission (IAHRC)
 in January 1987 to explore ways the IAHRC can support Haiti's
 democratic transition.
 The Government has not interfered with Haitian human rights
 groups that have formed international connections. For
 example, the League of Former Political Prisoners sponsored a
 seminar in August with the participation of Amnesty
 International and the Academy of Human Rights of Mexico.
 In October cabinet ministers participated in a workshop for the
 Formation of Promoters of Human Rights. This conference was
 sponsored by the Latin American Association for Human Rights
 and the National Haitian Commission for Cooperation with
 UNESCO, and featured participants from several countries.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The role of women in Haitian society is limited by tradition.
 Since 1982, there has been no legal discrimination between the
 sexes: women enjoy full rights in education, property, voting,
 and such social prerogatives as divorce. Particularly among
 
 
 541
 HAITI
 peasants, however, women are still confined to the traditional
 occupations of marketing, sewing, and housekeeping.
 Middle-class women comprise a large proportion of the work
 force and dominate secretarial, teaching, and nursing
 positions. In recent years, there has been progress in
 senior-level employment of women in the private sector.
 Greater opportunities are generally available to women in the
 government bureaucracy. There have been a few women occupying
 second level positions in the ministries in the last several
 years, even under the Duvalier regime. Women are well
 represented at the mid- and upper-level managerial ranks. A
 woman served as the mayor of Port-au-Prince in 1986, and the
 CNG has appointed women to several advisory bodies. Women may
 serve in the armed forces, however, only as nurses.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The labor code mandated a daily minimum wage that in 1986 was
 US$3.00 per day in Port-au-Prince and US$2.60 per day in the
 rest of Haiti. The minimum age for even limited employment was
 12. Fierce adult competition for factory jobs ensures that
 child labor is not a factor in the industrial sector. Many
 children, however, especially young teenagers, work long hours
 in cottage industries for less than the minimum wage.
