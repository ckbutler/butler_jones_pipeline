 MACAU
 Macau, a 13-square-mile enclave on the south China coast, is recognized by both
 China and Portugal as Chinese territory under Portuguese administration. The "Or-
 ganic Statute" of 1976, which serves as the constitution, grants it considerable ad-
 ministrative, financial, and legislative autonomy. Both the Governor and the Legis-
 lative Assembly excercise legislative power. The Governor, appointed by the Por-
 tuguese President, holds extensive powers under the Organic Statute.
 Under the 1987 Sino-Portuguese joint declaration, Macau will become a Special
 Administration Region of China on December 20, 1999, and operate under the prin-
 ciple of "one country, two systems," to remain unchanged for 50 years. The future
 constitution, the "Basic Law," was promulgated by China's National People's Con-
 gress on March 31, 1993.
 Portuguese metropolitan law serves as the basis for the legal system, which fea-
 tures a judiciary and public trials. The police force maintains public order and is
 under civilian control.
 The market-based economy is fueled by textile and garment exports, along with
 tourism and gambling. A depressed real estate market and stagnant exports have
 limited economic growth in recent years, a trend that continued in 1997. Despite
 the economic downturn, most citizens still enjoy a high standard of living.
 Although the people of Macau enjoy a wide range of rights and freedoms as resi-
 dents of a Portuguese-administered territory, they have limited ability to change
 their government. Voters directly elect only one-third of the legislators, and the ter-

 ritory's future path has been set by the Governments of Portugal and China. Legis-
 lation, effective in November 1995 provided greater equality in the work force for
 women. Although China, through the Basic Law, agreed to continue the application
 of international covenants on civil and political rights and on economic, social, and
 cultural rights after 1999, human rights activists remain concerned that China
 made no ob~ligation to submit regular reports in these areas. There are credible re-
 3nthat media self-censorship continues on issues considered to be sensitive to
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Such abuses are prohibited by law, and the authorities respect this in practice. Pris-
 on conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Government permits
 visits by human rights monitors. Human rights groups have expressed concern that
 there has been no agreement within the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group on the
 application to Macau of the Covenant against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman
 or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, although beth Portugal and China have
 ratified the covenant.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Legal prohibitions against arbitrary ar-
 rest exist, and the authorities respect them in practice. The examining judge, who
 conducts a pretrial inquiry in criminal cases, has a wide range of powers to collect
 evidence, order or dismiss indictments, validate and maintain the detention of sus-
 pects, and determine whether to release detained persons. Police must present per-
 sons remanded in custody to an examining judge within 48 hours of detention. The
 accused's counsel may examine the evidence. If the judge is not convinced that the
 evidence is adequate, he may dismiss the detainee.
 Forced exile is not practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Changes to the judicial system in 1993 designed
 to render the system autonomous from the Portuguese system-required to bring
 the system into conformity with the structure for the judicial system specified in the
 Basic Law-raised some concerns among human rights observers and journalists.
 Prior to the reorganization, the judiciary had only subordinate (first instance) courts
 located in the territory. In the first stage of the reforms, new courts, most notably
 a Superior Court of Justice, were established to allow appeals to be heard locally.
 The Superior Court consists of six magistrates divided into two panels, one of
 which hears only administrative, fiscal, and customs duties cases; the other oversees
 all other cases. An additional judge serves as President of the Court. Cases before
 the Superior Court are heard initially by the relevant panel of three judges. In in-
 stances in which a judgment has been rendered by such a panel and subsequently
 appealed, the case is then heard by all six judges, with the President voting only
 in case of a tie. This structure results in a situation in which three of the individ-
 uals hearing an appeal have already rendered an opinion in the initial judgment.
 Critics charge that this calls into question the objectivity of the subsequent ruling.
 Until full autonomy of the courts is achieved, however, some special appeal cases
 may still be either presented directly to courts in Portugal or sent to them through
 a local court.
 Journalists and human rights activists have also voiced concerns that, as a result
 of the 1993 reforms, judges and public prosecutors are now appointed by the Gov-
 ernor based on proposals made by two administrative beards of the judiciary. The
 Supreme Council of Justice, recommends judges for appointment to the Macau Su-
 perior Court as well as the local attorney general, and the Judiciary Council of
 Macau, which recommends judges for the common courts and delegates to the public
 prosecutor's office. In particular, critics charge that the strong ties members of the
 latter group have to the executive branch and to China raise questions about the
 independence of the judiciary, particularly as judges and public prosecutors rely on
 the Judiciary Council to win renewal of their 3-year assignments. The 3-year ap-
 pointment of judges differs from the practice in Portugal, where appointments are
 generally for life.
 The law provides for a fair trial, and this is generally observed. The Constitution
 provides for the right of access to law and the courts, and the authorities respect
 this right in practice. The Criminal Procedure Code expressly provides for, among
 other things, the accused's right to be present during proceedings, to be heard by
 a judge, and to choose an attorney or request that one be provided
 
 
 1234
 
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Laws
 provide for the inviolability of the home and of communication, the right of owner-
 ship of private property and enterprises, and the freedom to marry and raise a fam-
 ily. The Government respects these rights in practice.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The law provides for these rights, and the Gov-
 ernment respects them in practice. However, some journalists and human rights ac-
 tivists believe that the practice of media self-censorship is increasing as reversion
 approaches. Critics charge that the leading newspapers are pro-China publications
 that do not give equal attention to liberal and prodemocracy voices. Local journalists
 continue to oppose a government proposal to establish a press council to monitor the
 press and advise the Government of press issues.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The law provides for these
 rights, and the Government respects them in practice. Under local law, individuals
 and groups intending to hold peaceful meetings or demonstrations in public places
 are required to notify the President of the relevant municipal council in writing at
 least 3 days but no more than 2 weeks in advance of the event; no prior authoriza-
 tion is necessary for the event to take place, however.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Portuguese law as extended to Macau provides for free-
 dom of religion, and the Government respects this right in practice. Human rights
 groups have expressed concern, however, that the Legislative Assembly thus far has
 failedto establish these rights in local law.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The law provides for these rights, and the Government respects them
 mpractice.
 The Government has assisted in the resettlement of Vietnamese boat people. Only
 seven Vietnamese refugees remain in Macau. All other boat people have emigrated
 to host countries.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have a limited ability to change their government. The 23-member Legis-
 lative Assembly is composed of 8 members elected in direct elections; 8 indirectly
 elected by local community interests; and 7 appointed by the Governor. The Consult-
 ative Council, an advisory group to the Governor composed of elected and appointed
 members, also provides some measure of popular representation. By tradition the
 Government also consults informally on a regular basis with local business and cul-
 tural leaders. Although the Legislative Assembly can enact laws on all matters ex-
 cept those reserved for bodies in Portugal or the Governor, in reality the Governor
 imtiates the vast majority of legislation, either directly through "decree-laws" or in
 the form of bills that require that he receive the permission of the Legislative As-
 sembly prior to issuing legislation. In 1996 The Governor issued 71 percent of all
 legislation and the Legislative Assembly generated 29 percent; a similar breakdown
 is likely for the 1997 legislative year. While the Legislative Assembly has the legal
 power to refuse to ratify laws issued by the Governor, in practice this is seldom
 done.
 Although women traditionally have played a minor role in local political life, they
 increasingly hold senior positions throughout the administration. The Legislative
 Assembly currently has three female members including the President of the As-
 sembly, the second most senior position. According to Government statistics, women
 now hold 38 percent of senior government positions.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights groups operate without government restriction, investigating and
 publishing findings on human rights cases.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 While the Constitution does not explicitly proscribe discrimination based on race,
 sex, religion, disability, language, or social status, it does incorporate the principle
 of nondiscrimination. Separate laws provide for many of these rights. Access to edu-
 cation, for example, is stipulated for all residents regardless of race, religious belief,
 or political or ideological convictions under the law that establishes the general
 framework for the educational system.
 Women.-Violence against women is not common. For cases that are reported, the
 authorities enforce criminal statutes prohibiting domestic violence and prosecute
 
 
 1235
 violators. Police and doctors report abuses to the Social Welfare Department, which
 investigates them. If hospital treatment is required, a medical social worker coun-
 sels the victim and informs her about social welfare services. Until their complaints
 are resolved, battered women may be provided public housing, but no facilities are
 reserved expressly for them. The United Nations Human Rights Committee, in re-
 sponding to the Government's submission on the application of the International
 Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in April, expressed some concern over traf-
 ficking in women for the purposes of prostitution in Macau. The Government re-
 sponded that it had taken measures to end such exploitation of women by organized
 crime.
 Women are becoming more active and visible in business and government, and
 some enjoy considerable influence and responsibility in these areas. The Govern-
 ment estimates that women account for 43 percent of the work force. Equal oppor-
 tunity legislation enacted in 1995, applicable to all public and private organizations,
 mandates that women receive equal pay for equal work, states that discrimination
 based on sex or physical ability is not permitted, and establishes penalties for em-
 ployers who violate these guidelines.
 Children.-The Government has not promulgated any statutes specifically to pro-
 tect the rights of children, relying on the general framework of civil and political
 rights legislation to protect all citizens. However, the Government seeks to protect
 the health and well-being of children, who represent a growing share of the popu-
 lation. The Social Welfare Institute is charged with implementing programs de-
 signed to provide services for children. A government-sponsored panel, set up to
 study the~prvision of social services to Chinese families, recommended in 1995 that
 greater effortbe expended to address the need for additional educational and other
 services for children. School attendance is not compulsory; however, social services
 officials report that the vast majority of residents' minor children attend school.
 Basic education is provided in government-ron schools and subsidized private
 schools, and covers the preprimaiy year, primary education, and general secondary
 school education. The Education Department provides assistance to families of those
 children who cannot pay school fees. The children of illegal immigrants are excluded
 from the educational system (see Section 6.d.).
 Child abuse and exploitation are not widespread problems.
 People With Disabilities.-The extent to which physically disabled persons experi-
 ence discrimination in employment, education, and the provision of state services is
 not fully known. In the past, the Government provided little funding for special pro-
 grams aimed at helping the physically and mentally disabled gain better access to
 employment, education, and public facilities, and has not mandated accessibility for
 the disabled, legislativel or otherwise. The Government's lack of attention to this
 problem was hi hli htedin an April report of the U.N. Human Rights Committee
 in response to the Gvernment's submission on the application of the International
 Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in Macau. According to the Government,
 these shortcomings are being addressed through newly implemented programs. The
 Social Welfare Department provides funds to private organizations to help disabled
 persons. Since 1992 it has instituted four day care centers for children and adults
 with mental disabilities, providing buildings and technical support while the private
 groups administer the facilities. A residential halfway house for mentally ill patients
 after release from institutionalization has also been established.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Although the governmental and legal sys-
 tems place a premium on knowledge of the Portuguese language, which is spoken
 by less than 4 percent of the population, the Chinese language received official sta-
 tus in 1993, and the use of Chinese in the civil service is growing. According to Gov-
 ernment statistics, by the end of 1996, 64 percent of senior government positions
 were filled by individuals born in Macau or in the People's Republib of China. Con-
 siderable public pressure remains on the Government to speed up the process of
 making the civil service more representative of the population.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Portuguese Constitution recognizes the right
 and freedom of all workers to form and join trade unions and of private sector
 unions to strike, and these rights are extended to Macau. The Government neither
 impedes the formation of trade unions nor discriminates against union members.
 Human rights groups are concerned that no similar rights and protections have
 been incorporated into local law.
 People's Republic of China interests heavily influence local trade union activities,
 including the selection of union leadership, and stress the importance of stability
 and minimum disruption of the work force. Nearly all of the private sector union
 members belong to a pro-China labor confederation. Many local observers claim that
 
 
 1236
 
 this organization is more interested in furthering the Chinese political agenda than
 in addressing trade union issues such as wages, benefits, and working conditions.
 A few private sector unions and two of the four public sector unions are outside Chi-
 nese control. Although the Portuguese Constitution provides workers with the right
 to strike, labor leaders complain that there is no effective protection from retribu-
 tion should they exercise this right. The Government, for its part, argues that provi-
 sions in the labor law requiring an employer to have "justified cause to dismiss an
 employee protects striking employees from retaliation.
 Unions may freely form federations and affiliate with international bodies. Three
 civil services unions--representing Portuguese, Macanese, and Chinese employees-
 are affiliated with the major non-Communist Portuguese union confederation.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Chinese unions tend to re-
 semble local traditional neighborhood associations, promoting social and cultural ac-
 tivities rather than issues relating to the workplace. Local customs, moreover, nor-
 mally favor employment without the benefit of written labor contracts except in the
 case of labor from China and the Philippines. Chinese unions traditionally have not
 attempted to engage in collective bargaining. Portuguese laws protecting collective
 bargain    appl, and the Government does not impede or discourage such activity.
 Although the law prohibits antiunion discrininaton, and it does not appear to be
 widespread, representatives from some civil service unions have raised concerns
 during the year over government practices that they feel disadvantage them.
 There are no export processing zones; Macau is a free port.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.--Compulsory labor is prohibited by
 law, and no cases were reported during the year. Children are covered under the
 existing legislation prohibiting forced or bonded labor, although they are not speci-
 fied in the legislation.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-Forced
 and bonded labor is prohibited by law; although child labor is not specified in the
 law, it is covered by the law's provisions and there were no reports of such practices
 (see Section 6.c.). The law prohibits minors under the age of 16 from working, al-
 though there is a provision stating that minors between the ages of 14 and 16 can
 be authorized to work on an "exceptional basis." The Labor Department enforces
 this law through periodic and targeted inspections, and refers offending employers
 to the judicial authorities for prosecution. The incidence of child labor has declined
 radically since effective enforcement began in 1985, and there are only a few cases
 reported eachyear. While local laws do not establish specific regulations governing
 the number of hours children can work, International Labor Organization conven-
 tions are applied.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-While local labor laws establish the general
 principle of fair wages-including the definition and calculation of wages-and man-
 date compliance with wage agreements, no legislated minimum wage exists. In the
 absence of any statutory minimum wage or publicly administered social security
 programs, some large companies have provided private welfare and security pack-
 ages. Labor activists charge that the absence of a government-backed social security
 fund leaves many workers vulnerable.
 Labor legislation provides for a 48-hour workweek, an 8-hour workday, overtime,
 annual leave, medical and maternity care, and employee compensation insurance.
 Although the law provides a 24-hour rest period for every 7 days of work, worker
 representatives report that workers frequently agree to work overtime to com-
 pensate for low wages. The Department of Labor provides assistance and legal ad-
 vice to workers on request, but government enforcement of labor laws is lax because
 of limited resources.
 A significant amount of the total work force (approximately 16 percent) is com-
 posed of laborers from China and other countries who fill both blue- and white-collar
 positions. These workers often work for less than half the wages paid to a Macau
 citizen performing the same job, live in controlled dormitories, work 10 to 12 hours
 a day, and owe large sums of money to the labor-importing company for the pur-
 chase of their job. The U.N. Human Rights Committee, in responding to the Govern-
 ment's submission on the application of the International Covenant on Civil and Po-
 litical Rights, noted the lack of protective measures for working conditions and the
 absence of social security programs for nonresident workers as an area of concern.
 Labor interests claim that the high percentage of imported labor erodes the bargain-
 ing power of local residents to improve working conditions and increase wages.
 The Department of Labor enforces occupational safety and health. Failure to cor-
 rect infractions can lead to government prosecution. Although the law includes a re-
 quirement that employers provide a safe working environment, no explicit provi-
 sions exist to protect employees' right to continued employment if they refuse to
 work under dangerous conditions.
