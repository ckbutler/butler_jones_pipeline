 ECUADOR
 Ecuador is a constitutional republic. The President and
 members of the unicameral Congress are chosen in free
 elections. The Supreme Court, which is selected by Congress,
 presides over an independent judiciary. Elections in 1979
 ended 7 years of military rule, and since then 2 democratically
 elected administrations have governed Ecuador. Seventeen
 registered political parties and a free and partisan press
 participate in a lively and contentious democratic political
 process.
 In June, regular midterm elections were held to select new
 provincial representatives to Congress as well as many
 provincial and municipal council officials. A coalition of
 opposition parties dominates the 1986-1988 Congress, which
 took office in August.
 The President controls the police through the Ministry of
 Government. In 1986 local human rights organizations and
 opposition members of Congress alleged several cases of police
 brutality. Government officials acknowledged isolated
 incidents but donied any systematic abuses.
 The terrorist group Alfaro Vive Carajo (AVC), which has links
 to the Colombian M-19 guerrillas, initiated several bloody
 confrontations with police which resulted in deaths on both
 sides. In May the Montoneras Patria Libre, an offshoot of the
 AVC, kidnaped a government official. After negotiations the
 kidnapers surrendered, and the official was freed.
 The labor movement is broad-based and active within Ecuador's
 essentially free enterprise economic system. The Government's
 announcement of financial reform measures in August in the
 face of sharply reduced export revenues prompted a coalition
 of labor unions to organize a 24-hour general strike in
 September that was only partially successful. Economic
 progress in the last 15 years, based on petroleum exports, has
 been concentrated in the industrial and commercial sectors.
 Extensive rural poverty persists, especially among highland
 Indians.
 Despite terrorist violence, extremely poor prison conditions,
 and an inefficient and corruptible judicial system, Ecuador
 maintained generally good human rights standards.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no substantiated charges of politically motivated
 killings by government forces.
 Armed clashes between police and the AVC resulted in deaths on
 both sides, including several key leaders of the AVC and the
 head of the police antiterrorist unit. In August the AVC
 murdered three policemen in order to free a hospitalized
 terrorist, who was later recaptured. After several police
 actions against the AVC, Ecuadorean human rights groups claimed
 that excessive police violence had resulted in deaths of
 terrorists. The Government denied these charges and published
 its versions of the confrontations.

 ECUADOR
 In February the death of a student in clashes with police led
 to the arrest of a policeman. A similar case occurred in June.
 At the end of 1986, both policemen were still in prison
 awaiting trial.
 Human rights groups maintain that police too frequently apply
 the "ley de fuga" (the law of escaping prisoners), which
 allows them to fire upon fleeing prisoners. Escapees are
 generally not armed, and the groups argue that they would
 normally be willing to surrender if challenged.
 Human rights activists periodically charged that provincial
 governments remain indifferent to the deaths of rural
 inhabitants killed in disputes over land tenure. In some
 cases local government officials were accused of complicity.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no substantiated cases of disappearances in 1986
 attributable to the Government.
 In May the Montoneras Patria*Libre kidnaped a government-
 appointed member of the Constitutional Guarantees Tribunal.
 Police quickly discovered and surrounded the kidnapers'
 hideout. After negotiations they surrendered, and the
 official was released unharmed.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Torture is prohibited by law. Police are reported occasionally
 to beat suspects or to treat them harshly, usually during
 initial interrogations. This is not officially condoned by
 the Government. Human rights activists and congressional
 opponents claim abuses arise from lax supervision of the
 police, and hold the Government responsible.
 Ecuadorean prisons are overcrowded and unhealthy. Guards use
 solitary confinement and beatings for disciplinary purposes,
 even though this is contrary to prison regulations. Prisoners
 often bribe guards to avoid punishment and to improve their
 living conditions.
 Detainees under civil control who have been charged with
 terrorism or subversion have generally received good treatment
 and are allowed frequent family visits. However, the few
 detainees under military control are usually held incommunicado
 and there have been reports they are mistreated.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Preventive detention is illegal. The criminal code forbids
 isolated confinement for more than 24 hours and detention
 without charge for more than 48 hours. Since the outbreak of
 terrorist activity in 1985, AVC suspects have frequently been
 held beyond these limits.
 Mayors and municipal council presidents are constitutionally
 empowered to order the release of detainees and do so
 liberally, irrespective of the severity of the charges.
 The armed forces held an air force general in pre-trial
 detention during 1986 on charges of instigating a rebellion in
 March which resulted in the death of several soldiers. Both
 the Defense Minister and the service chiefs rejected a
 
 
 483
 ECUADOR
 congressional resolution of amnesty in the case, as wel'l as a
 writ of habeus corpus authorized by the acting mayor of Quito:
 they asserted that the military court of justice is not obliged
 to recognize either. The opposition-dominated Congress issued
 a resolution accusing the President of unconstitutional action
 in supporting the military's position in the dispute. The
 Supreme Court has agreed to hear a suit by the general against
 the head of the military court.
 There is no forced or compulsory labor. Forced exile is not
 practiced.
 Local human rights activists accuse the Government of
 continuing widespread illegal detentions of suspected
 terrorists and their family members.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There were no political prisoners in Ecuador in 1986.
 The Congress elects the Supreme Court and has the power to
 impeach judges, to fix the budget of the judicial branch, and
 to ratify the Supreme Court's judicial review decisions. From
 time to time the Court investigates allegations of judicial
 inefficiencies or improprieties and may remove judges.
 Judicial corruption is widespread in part because judges are
 inexperienced and poorly paid.
 Defendants have the right to counsel as soon as arrested, to
 call witnesses on their behalf, to cross-examine all witnesses,
 to refrain from testifying against themselves, and to appeal
 sentences to intermediate or higher courts. Although a public
 defender system is mandated in the Constitution, this provision
 has not been implemented.
 The judicial system is inefficient. Detainees may wait 2 years
 or longer for trial, placing additional burdens on the
 overcrowded prison system. Time spent awaiting trial is
 counted toward completion of the final sentence, but some
 long-term detainees have been found innocent. Those unable to
 afford legal counsel face the longest periods of pretrial
 detention.
 As in most civil law systems, there is no trial by jury.
 Judges play a central role in investigations as well as in
 deciding guilt or innocence. The Attorney General, the
 Solicitor General, and provincial prosecutors carry out
 investigations and prosecutions. These officials also defend
 state interests in criminal and civil cases, receive
 complaints against judges, conduct fiscal inspections of lower
 courts, and provide legal opinions in all court cases.
 The autonomous Constitutional Guarantees Tribunal, made up of
 representatives of the Presidency, the Congress, the judiciary,
 municipalities, business and labor, is empowered by the
 Constitution to investigate charges of constitutional or human
 rights violations. The Tribunal has little real power to
 enforce its rulings concerning laws passed by Congress or
 decrees issued by the President. It has focused public
 attention on human rights issues by calling hearings, listening
 to complaints by human rights activists, and requiring
 government officials, including the Minister of Government, to
 answer questions.

 ECUADOR
 Military courts may try only those cases involving infractions
 of military regulations or acts against military installations.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government generally respects the sanctity of the home and
 privacy of correspondence. Police must have a warrant to enter
 a dwelling except in the case of hot pursuit. This requirement
 is generally observed in practice, but in their response to the
 terrorist threat, government security forces have apparently
 been involved in a number of illegal and surreptitious entries.
 In August, newspapers published alleged transcripts of
 international telephone conversations between various political
 opposition figures, including members of Congress, and a
 Guayaquil politician who had fled to Panama rather than face
 charges of embezzlement and of defaming the armed forces.
 Government opponents accused the administration of illegally
 taping these conversations and releasing the transcripts for
 political purposes. The second charge against the politician
 was dropped by a civil judge after a congressional resolution
 of amnesty. The same politician has accused the Government of
 being responsible for his brief imprisonment by Panamanian
 authorities on drug charges.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and expression.
 This right is vigorously exercised in the Ecuadorean media,
 which are essentially privately owned and free from direct
 government control. Twelve daily newspapers, dozens of
 weeklies, many magazines, 10 television stations, and more
 than 450 radio stations operate in Ecuador and present a
 diversity of political opinion.
 The Government has been accused by opposition politicians and
 local human rights activists of using a variety of indirect
 pressures to soften media criticism of its policies. The
 Inter-American Press Association has supported some journalists
 who complained of official harassment after they criticized
 the Government. Despite an adverse court ruling, the
 Government continued to find a technical basis for preventing
 the opening of a new television station owned by political
 adversaries who had obtained a license in the final days of
 the previous administration.
 Ecuadorean law, like that of other Latin American countries,
 prohibits defaming the President. In April 3 opposition
 congressional candidates were jailed for 4 days for writing a
 letter to local newspapers calling the President a liar.
 There is no political censorship of foreign or domestic books,
 films, or works of art. There is no government interference
 with academic inquiry.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution guarantees the right to free assembly and
 association and this is observed in practice. Public rallies
 require prior approval from local governments, but this is
 generally granted. The one notable exception has been the
 consistent refusal of the Government to grant permission for
 
 
 485
 ECUADOR
 rallies or marches during national strikes. Both in January
 and September, marchers were stopped by police during 24-hour
 national strikes. Violence and detentions were minimal. The
 Government has argued that the labor code does not permit
 national strikes because they are not related to a collective
 bargaining action.
 Labor organizations represent about 15 percent of the country's
 economically active population. The labor movement, organized
 into four major confederations and many independent unions,
 reflects widely different political orientations and has links
 to international labor organizations.
 All private sector employees and government blue collar workers
 enjoy the right to organize unions, bargain collectively, and
 strike. Government white collar workers may not strike and
 their labor organizations are not officially recognized by the
 Government as having bargaining rights.
 The 50-year-old labor code provides for a considerable
 government role in the resolution of labor-management disputes,
 especially through Conciliation Tribunals of the Ministry of
 Labor. Trade union leaders are elected by their membership.
 Membership dues of recognized unions are collected by the
 Government and given directly to the union leadership. The
 Constitution provides for formal labor participation in
 government through representation on the executive boards of
 several national institutions. Labor leadership meets
 regularly with the Minister of Labor and other senior
 government officials to discuss current problems.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, Ecuador has no state
 religion. Citizens and residents are free to practice the
 religion of their choice. Clergymen, by local law, may not
 become high-level elected or appointed government officials.
 Foreign missionaries of many faiths have operated freely in
 Ecuador for many years. Radio HCJB, the "Voice of the Andes,"
 has functioned for more than 50 years as an evangelical
 fundamentalist Christian shortwave radio service supported
 largely by contributions from the United States. It broadcasts
 domestically both on AM and FM.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 All Ecuadoreans may travel freely at home or abroad.
 Individuals from other Latin American countries have readily
 found asylum in Ecuador. No cases of involuntary repatriation
 or persons fleeing political persecution were reported in 1986.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Ecuador is a multiparty democracy with 17 registered parties
 representing the full political spectrum. Thirteen of these,
 including two avowedly Marxist parties, are represented in the
 unicameral Congress. Ecuadoreans 18 years of age and older
 have the right to vote. Voting is mandatory for literates and
 voluntary for illiterates. Political participation and
 suffrage are open to all citizens without discrimination on
 
 
 486
 ECUADOR
 the basis of sex, ethnic group, or socioeconomic status. All
 citizens have the right to form and join political parties.
 Only certified political parties may present candidates for
 election. For certification an aspiring party must present a
 petition bearing a minimum number of voter signatures. In
 June voters rejected a government-sponsored proposal to change
 the Constitution so that independents might run for office.
 Since the return to democracy in 1979, Ecuadorean politics
 have been characterized by strident partisanship and shifting
 alliances. Strong political rivalries among individuals and
 ideological and regional differences account for much of the
 rough and tumble nature of the political process.
 The inauguration of the current President in August 1984
 marked the first peaceful transfer of power from one
 democratically elected administration to another in 24 years.
 Despite pressure from Congressional allies for postponement,
 the President proceeded with midterm elections mandated by law
 in June. An opposition coalition won and took control of the
 new Congress in August.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigations of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government has a constructive approach to international
 human rights issues. An Ecuadorean serves on the Human Rights
 Committee of the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political
 Rights and on the UN Committee on the Elimination of All Forms
 of Racial Discrimination. Domestic human rights bodies are
 free to investigate human rights practices within the country.
 Congress formed a Commission on Human Rights in November.
 Representatives of the International Labor Organization's
 regional office in Lima travel regularly to Ecuador in order
 to consult with government officials on labor policies and
 programs. The Latin American Human Rights Association is
 headquartered in Quito, as is the local office of Amnesty
 International. Active local human rights organizations
 include the Ecumenical Commission on Human Rights, with ties
 to the Catholic Church, and the National Human Rights
 Commission. During 1986 individual human rights activists
 occasionally met with Ministry of Government officials to
 discuss human rights concerns. The Foreign Ministry has an
 office responsible for providing detailed replies to queries
 from outside Ecuador concerning human rights matters.
 Amnesty International in its 1986 Report on Ecuador expressed
 concern with what it charged were unacknowledged detention
 of political prisoners in secret detention centers,
 disappearances, torture, and death in custody as a comsequence
 of torture or ill-treatment. The Ecuadorean Minister of
 Government, appearing in November before the congressional
 Human Rights Commission, said Amnesty International had been
 "deceived and misled" and that its accusations of systematic
 disrespect for human rights on the part of the Ecuadorean
 Government were irresponsible. The Minister denied that the
 Government uses torture or that clandestine interrogation
 centers exist in Ecuador. He also said that while the
 Government will improve prison conditions and will reform the
 penal code and judicial system, it will also continue to
 respond to terrorist actions with force.

 ECUADOR
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution prohibits any discrimination based on race,
 color, sex, language, religion, political or other affiliation,
 social origin, or economic position.
 The urban poor are predominantly mixed race or black. The
 Indian population is primarily rural and poor. There is no
 overt or legally sanctioned discrimination practiced against
 these groups.
 The Constitution establishes complete political equality for
 men and women. However, due to the female's traditional role
 in Ecuador there are few highly-placed women in the political
 structure. Three of the 71 congressional deputies elected in
 1984 were women. Only one was elected in the 1986 midterm
 election. Several women occupy prominent positions in the
 present Government, but none is at the ministerial level.
 Women still suffer some discrimination under civil law,
 despite considerable progress in recent years. In divorce
 matters and in the right of inheritance, the male continues to
 enjoy preferential status as head of the household.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The labor code prescribes a standard work week of 40 hours
 with paid annual vacations. Ecuador enforces a minimum wage
 law. Employment of minors under the age of 18 requires
 parental permission. This regulation is generally observed in
 larger enterprises; however, a large percentage of rural
 children are part of the active work force.
 The labor code mandates safe and healthy working conditions
 and holds employers responsible for maintaining such
 conditions. The autonomous Social Security Institute monitors
 complaints concerning working conditions and has legal power
 to enforce compliance.
