 NAMIBIA
 Namibia achieved its independence under United Nations
 supervision on March 21, 1990, following 74 years of South
 African rule. The new nation is a functioning multiparty,
 multiracial democracy, whose Constitution contains an
 entrenched bill of rights, providing for freedom of speech,
 press, assembly, asscciation, and religion. The Government is
 headed by Sam Nujoma, leader of the South West Africa People's
 Organization (SWAPO), which won Namibia's first free election
 in November 1989. The Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA),
 SWAPO's major opposition, and five small parties are also
 represented in the National Assembly.
 The main security force is the Namibian Defense Force (NDF),
 comprised of former troops of the People's Liberation Army of
 Namibia (PLAN--SWAPO's military wing) and of the South West
 African Territorial Force (SWATF)--forces that battled each
 other in the years prior to independence. The NDF and- a small
 national police force, responsible for maintaining internal
 security, receive professional training from the United Kingdom
 and other countries, including the United States. Key officers
 received human rights-related instruction from the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Nonetheless,
 security force members were responsible for a number of human
 rights abuses during the year.
 The Namibian economy has two major components--a modern market
 sector that produces most of its wealth and a traditional
 subsistence agricultural sector (mainly in the north) that
 supports most of its labor force. The mainstays of the market
 sector are mining, ranching, and fishing, still mostly
 controlled by white Namibian businessmen. Throughout 1991 the
 Government stressed the leading role of the private sector and
 encouraged new investment by indigenous and foreign
 entrepreneurs on the basis of a new investment code adopted in
 December 1990.
 Namibia continued to enjoy a wide range of civil and political
 liberties in 1991 with much public discussion of citizens'
 rights and obligations. Controversy continued, however, about
 accounting for missing detainees formerly held by SWAPO in
 Angola and Zambia and by South African authorities in Namibia
 and, to a lesser extent, about refugee issues. In June the
 Government requested ICRC assistance in investigating the
 identities and circumstances under which Namibians died or
 disappeared during the liberation struggle. The problems of
 racial discrimination and disparities, especially in education,
 health, and working conditions, and of discrimination and
 violence against women continued in 1991. There were
 continuing credible reports of NDF personnel torturing or
 abusing civilians despite strong condemnation by officials.
 Approximately 30 persons were convicted and dismissed from
 service for offenses against civilians, including such matters
 as theft, assault, and rape.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from.
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of political or other extrajudicial
 killings during 1991. Several charges of politically motivated
 killings remained unresolved from previous years, including
 
 
 269
 NAMIBIA
 that of Anton Lubowski, a senior SWAPO official who was shot
 outside his home in Windhoek by an unknown gunman in September
 1989.
 In October the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal of a white
 man, Hendrik van Wyk, who was convicted for the unprovoked
 assault and murder of a black man, Johannes Haufiku, and
 sentenced to 12 years in prison. The Chief Justice said that
 the Court would impose heavy sentences of imprisonment as a
 deterrent in cases of violence motivated by racism. A black
 former member of PLAN, convicted of murdering a white farmer
 and gravely wounding his wife, received life imprisonment.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances occurring during 1991.
 Most, if not all, earlier disappearance cases involved either
 persons detained by SWAPO in Angola or those arrested and
 unaccounted for by the former South African authorities prior
 to independence. The number of SWAPO detainees still not
 accounted for has been estimated to range from the 256 listed
 in 1989 by the Special Ad Hoc Committee of the U.N. Transition
 Assistance Group to the 1,400 noted by~the Namibian National
 Society for Human Rights (NSHR) and the Parents' Committee.
 The disparity in numbers will continue until a full
 investigation by the Government and the ICRC is completed.
 The whereabouts of people detained by the former South African
 (SA) administiation in Namibia also remained unclear.
 According to a 1990 NSHR report, the whereabouts and fate of 59
 people remain unknown.
 In June the Government formally requested ICRC assistance'in
 determining the identities and whereabouts of iamibians who
 died or disappeared during this period. In October SWAPO
 appointed a liaison officer to facilitate the transmission of
 tracing requests between the ICRC and the Government. In
 October the Government also asked the U.N. High Commissioner
 for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Governments of South Africa,
 Zambia, Botswana, and the People's Republic of Angola to
 appoint similar liaison officers. As the year ended, none of
 the four neighboring Governments had done so.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Namibian Constitution states that "no persons shall be
 subject to torture or to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment
 or punishment." Although they are greatly reduced from the
 preindependence period, there were a number of reports of
 torture or other inhuman treatment by police and military
 forces during 1991. Following the theft in August of uranium
 oxide from the Rossing mine, the National Union of Namibian
 Workers (NUNW) charged that three of its members suspected of
 the theft were beaten and tortured during interrogation. All
 three repoitedly had wet plastic bags pulled over their heads,
 and two, with arms'and legs bound, were hung from a broomstick
 resting between two office desks. They pressed charges, which
 were under investigation as the year ended.
 According to the NUNW, three policemen were expelled from the
 police force earlier in the year for "torturing" prisoners, but
 no specifics were available. There were also several shootings
 and other forms of harassment against civilians by members of
 the NDF. The Government publicly urged citizens to come
 
 
 270
 NAMIBIA
 forward with allegations of abuse by police or military forces
 so that disciplinary measures could be taken. Of several dozen
 NDF members tried by military courts for offenses against
 civilians, some 30 were found guilty and dismissed from the
 armed forces. It is not clear how many of these cases involved
 torture or other human rights violations. The NSHR reported
 that Paulus "Katemo" Johannes was subjected to severe torture
 while in police detention in Ruacana. He was accused of being
 a spy for UNITA and was held for 5 months without trial. His
 torturers reportedly tightened wire around his head in order to
 exert maximum physical as well as psychological pain. The NSHR
 referred his case to the High Court, which ordered his release
 in early May. An investigation by the Prosecutor General into
 the circumstances of his detention was continuing as the year
 ended.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution forbids arbitrary arrest or detention.
 According to the Constitution, persons who are arrested must be
 informed of the reason for their arrest "promptly, in a
 language they understand," and they must be brought before a
 magistrate within 48 hours of their detention. A trial must
 take place within "a reasonable time," or the accused must be
 released. The accused are entitled to defense by a legal
 counsel of their choice; the State will provide a lawyer for
 the indigent. These rights and protections have generally been
 afforded in practice since independence. However, in April the
 NSHR charged the police and the NDF with unconstitutional
 arrests and detentions without trial. The Government has made
 no response to these charges. There is a reported backlog of
 cases awaiting trial due to a lack of magistrates; a number of
 judgments rendered by inadequately trained magistrates have
 been overturned upon review by the Prosecutor General. Other
 delays have resulted from the paucity of legal counsel--less
 than 100 lawyers are currently engaged in private practice in
 the country; no more than 10 of these are black.
 There were no reports of Namibians being exiled in 1991.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Namibia has an independent judiciary, and under the
 Constitution all citizens have the right to a fair trial.
 Namibia has retained the Roman-Dutch court system it inherited
 from South Africa as well as tribal courts. In the formal
 system, there are three levels: magistrate's courts, the High
 Court, and the Supreme Court. The latter also serves as the
 court of appeals and as a constitutional review court. The
 Supreme Court is also charged with hearing cases of persons who
 claim to have been tortured by former South African authorities.
 The tenure of sitting judges was unaffected by the 1990 change
 in government. Traditional courts have dealt with minor
 criminal offenses, such as petty theft and infractions of local
 customs. A presidential commission was to make recommendations
 on the prospective jurisdiction of tribal courts, which have
 functioned at the village level among members of the same
 ethnic group. The Constitution guarantees that persons
 claiming violation of their fundamental rights may seek redress
 in court and request free legal advice from the Ombudsman.
 In the postindependence period, the right to a fair trial has
 been afforded in practice. However, there have been charges of
 racial bias in court decisions.
 
 
 NAMIBIA
 In September three persons were given sentences, which ranged
 from a $180 fine to 4 years' imprisonment, for their supporting
 roles in an aborted coup attempt in mid-1990. SWAPO party
 leaders and other organizations led public demonstrations to
 protest the perceived leniency of the sentences and demanded
 that the Government impose harsher penalties. However, the
 SWAPO-led Government refused to do so, noting the
 constitutional separation of powers and the independence of the
 judiciary.and that it respected the courts' determinations.
 Redress for alleged crimes by the SADF pridr to independence
 hinged on the outcome of a landmark case brought before the
 Namibian courts in September 1990, for which a judgment was
 rendered in October 1991. In this case, Israel Mwandingi
 sought damages from the Namibian Government and the Ministry of
 Defense after being shot in the back by the SADF, SWATF, or SWA
 police in a 1987 shooting in Ongwediva, northern Namibia. The
 court upheld his contention that Namibian authorities-as
 successors to the South African Government and its Ministry of
 Defense-were liable for damages. No amount for such damages
 had been determined as of year's end, however.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 The legal requirement that arresting officers must have a
 warrant and the constitutionally safeguarded right'to privacy
 were respected in practice in 1991.
 No evidence exists that unlawful electronic surveillance or
 interference .with correspondence are conducted against Namibian
 citizens.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.
 The Constitution provides for these fundamental freedoms,
 including academic freedom in-institutions of higher learning,
 and it states these righ s-may not be'suspended in time.of war
 or during a state of emergency. In practice, these freedoms
 have been respected'since independence.
 All radio and television services are operated by the
 government-owned Nainibian Broadcasting Corporation (NBC); a
 broadly representative government-appointed board sets policy
 for the NBC. Although'the NBC routinely gives prominent
 coverage to the activities of government officials, it also
 provided significant coverage to opposition spokespersons and
 issues.
 Print journalism in Namibia is free and vigorous. At present
 there are three daily, one semiweekly, and four weekly
 newspapers of general interest. One (a weekly) is published by
 the Government, and several others are affiliated to political
 parties. There was no apparent self-censorship by journalists,
 aside from the constraints of libel laws (which impose stricter
 limits with regard to public figures than does U.S. law) and a
 general circumspection with regard to the person of the
 President. Within the local media council, however, one
 newspaper can charge another with erroneous reporting, which
 has resulted in editorial retractions. There are no
 restrictions on academic freedom.
 
 
 272
 NAMIBIA
 b. Freedom of Assembly and Association
 The new Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and
 association. During 1991 various organizations, including
 political parties and religious groups, held large meetings and
 public gatherings without interference. These included
 demonstrations against the perceived lenient sentences meted
 out to three persons for participating in a 1990 coup plot and
 protests to several municipal governments over poor housing and
 sanitary conditions in the still largely segregated townships.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion, and Namibians have enjoyed freedom
 of religion since well before independence. There are no
 restrictions on the activities of particular religious groups
 or on foreign clergy members and, in contrast to the
 preindependence period, no restrictions on internal or foreign
 travel of church leaders.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution guarantees the rights to move freely
 throughout Namibia, to reside and settle in any part of
 Namibia, and to leave and return to Namibia, and these rights
 are respected in practice. During and after the transition to
 independence, a total of 42,736 Namibian exiles (returnees)
 returned to the country as part of the UNHCR repatriatio?
 program, which ended in June 199G. Many returnees have since
 encountered difficulties in reintegrating into life in Namibia,
 and the majority in 1991 faced continued unemployment.
 The Government had not developed a consistent policy on
 refugees or asylum seekers by the end of 1991 and was still
 reviewing the possibility of acceding to the Protocol Relating
 to the Status of Refugees. Sporadic incidents occurred in
 which persons seeking refugee status were deported or jailed
 upon their arrival in the country. Police at a northern border
 post detained one Kenyan and two Zairean nationals seeking
 refugee status for several months before informing U.N.
 officials. Despite growing public criticism, the Government
 continued to review on a case-by-case basis the requests of 128
 persons classified as refugees by the UNHCR. Of this group,
 two were held in Windhoek central prison; the remainder were
 given unofficial temporary residence with the proviso that they
 make plans to leave the country as soon as possible.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens exercised their right to change their Government in
 nonracial, multiparty elections held in 1989 and characterized
 as free and fair by the United Nations' special
 representative. The Constitution establishes a bicameral
 parliament, the National Assembly, and calls for free general
 elections by secret ballot every 5 years and regional elections
 every 2 years. As 1991 ended, only the lower house was
 functioning. The Government promised regional elections for
 the crucial second parliamentary chamber, the National Council,
 in 1992.
 Seven political parties are currently represented in the
 Namibian National Assembly. The SWAPO-led Government has 45 of
 the.78 seats in the Assembly, and the DTA, the major opposition
 
 
 273
 NAMIBIA
 /
 party, holds 21 seats. Five small parties are also
 represented. The DTA, together with the other non-SWAPO
 parties in Parliament, can block constitutional changes, which
 require a two-thirds majority of all members.
 Section'4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 During 1991 local organizations such as the National Society
 for Human Rights (NSHR), the Parents' Committee, and the Legal
 Assistance Centre (LAC), operated freely, criticizing the
 Government's bandling of the preindependonce SWAPO detainee
 issue, the treatment of refugees, the repatriation of exiled
 children of SWAPO members, the conduct of the presidential
 security guard, and other matters. Unlike the Parents'
 Cosrkittee ;nd the LAC,.which existed before independence, the
 UNR is"i   w private *-amibi'-"nbuman'rights organization,"
 established in early 1990. Like the Parents' Committee, its
 principal focus is on the SWAPO .detainee issue and accounting
 for persons who disappeared while in custody under the previous
 government. The LAC is highly regarded for its assistance,
 especially to indigent defendants. It also follows the
 detainee issue, but its current primary focus is on legal
 education, for which it coordinated with the Ministry-of
 Education to develop a constitutional curriculum for schools
 and lectures on human rights issues for police cadets and
 defense force trainees.
 International human rights organizations are free to visit and
 to discuss human rights issues with governmental and,
 nongovernmental representatives. In February the Government
 hosted a Swedish-funded week-long conference on human rights
 for public officials. In June the .Government formally asked
 the ICRC to help investigate the identities and circumstances
 under which Namibians died or disappeared during the
 independence'struggle (see Section l.b.). In October the
 Government announced its intention to establish a Human Rights
 Information and Documentation Center in early 1992 and
 submitted funding proposals to UNHRC and other donors.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, creed,
 sex, or religion and specifically prohibits "the practice and
 ideology of Apartheid." In December the National Assembly
 enacted a bill to outlaw racial discrimination and to punish
 its perpetrators with severe fines or prison sentences. Racial
 discrimination continued in 1991 to be a very sensitive
 political issue. As a result of many years of South African
 administration, racial and ethnic discrimination were
 institutionalized in Namibian society to the same extent as in
 South Africa itself. This was particularly true with respect
 to serious inequalities in education, health, housing, and
 employment,'which nonwhites complain are not being adequately
 addressed by government action. In a highly publicized
 incident, a white hotel manager in the Northern town of Outjo
 was accused of refusing service to two black Namibians (one was
 a Deputy Minister and Member of Parliament). In proceedings
 beginning in October, the courts sought to determine whether
 the manager's actions were in fact racially motivated and thus
 in contradiction of Article 10 of the Constitution. (For a
 discussion of white/black disparities, see Section 6.a.)
 
 
 274
 NA14IBIA
 Women's rights are guaranteed by the Constitution, but in
 practice discrimination against women, especially stemming from
 pervasive cultural and traditional practices of all races,
 persists. There are also inequalities in the law and in
 employment and educational opportunities. For instance, under
 existing community property laws, married women of all groups
 are defined as legal minors and may not legally acquire or
 purchase property or enter into a legal contract without the
 signature and consent of the husband. At present, any property
 brought into a marriage by a woman is transferred to the
 ownership of her husband, who has the authority to decide its
 disposition without her consent. A woman is considered a ward
 of her father until she marries; then she becomes a ward of her
 husband. The law also does not currently compel men to provide
 economic support for their children in case of divorce, with
 the result that there are many indigent mothers. Women are not
 barred from pursuing higher education but tend to be directed
 to certain educational fields and areas of employment, such as
 clerical and secretarial work, teaching, and domestic service.
 Several women's groups are working to change these inequalities
 to ensure that constitutional guarantees for women are put into
 practice. In one positive development during 1991, traditional
 leaders stopped taking communal land rights away from widows.
 Violence against women is reportedly widespread, particularly
 wife beating and rape. The courts have traditionally treated
 cases of wife beating as assaults, but because of traditional
 attitudes regarding the subordination of women, most such cases
 do not reach the courts. In addition, many cases of wife
 beating are not reported to the authorities. Others, which are
 brought to the attention of the police, are reportedly
 dismissed as frivolous, and the alleged perpetrator is not
 charged. Women's groups and other women's rights advocates
 contended that rape and wife beating were not taken seriously
 by police, claiming that police prefer not to interfere in
 domestic disputes and that prosecutions of rape and convictions
 for it are the exception. In October, however, the Namibian
 High Court condemned the application of the "cautionary rule"
 in cases involving sexual assault as contrary to the
 Constitution and held that the same standards of evidence
 should be applied for rape cases as for other crimes. Women's
 groups and the LAC applauded this decision.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Namibia's Constitution provides for freedom of association,
 including freedom to form and join trade unions, a right that
 will be extended to public servants, farm workers, and domestic
 employees under a new Labor Code tabled in Parliament at the
 end of the year. It is to be debated and enacted early in
 1992. Approximately half of Namibia's 200,000-person wage
 sector work force is organized to some degree. Less than 20
 percent of the total economically active population is
 unionized. Very few of the country's 36,000 rural laborers are
 organized. Unions are independent of government and may form
 federations and confederations, of which there are several.
 The principal trade union federation is the National Union of
 Namibian Workers (NUNW), a SWAPO-aligned federation of 7
 industrial unions which claims a membership of over 70,000.
 Most workers in the mining industry, the country's key export
 sector, are members of the NUNW-affiliated Mineworkers Union of
 Namibia (MUN). Some union leaders are also SWAPO officials and
 
 
 275
 NAMIBIA
 have served in the National Assembly. In December several
 prominent union leaders were elected to SWAPO's Central
 Committee. The NUNW, however, now expects labor leaders to
 resign if appointed to high government office. The current
 NUNW leadership does not hesitate to promote its concept of
 workers' interests even when their positions are not in line
 with government policies. The Confederation of Namibian
 Christian Social Trade Unions (NCSTU) and other unions claim to
 be nonpartisan and in practice confine their activities to
 labor-management relations. The Ministry of Labor and Manpower
 Development encourages broad cooperation within the labor
 movement, while supporting trade union pluralism and
 maintaining a strict policy of noninterferpnce-with internal
 union matters. Trade unions have no difficulty registering,
 and there are no government restrictions on who may serve as a
 union official.
 Namibian workers, except for those providing essential
 services, enjoy the right to strike once conciliation
 procedures have been exhausted. The proposed Labor Code will
 extend the right to strike to public servants, farm workers,
 and domestics. Under the Code, strike action could only be
 used in disputes involving worker interests, such as pay
 raises. Disputes over worker rights, including dismissals,
 would have to be referred to the Labor Courts or for
 arbitration.' Legally striking workers would gain protection
 from dismissal under the proposed Labor Code.
 There has yet to be a legal strike in Namibia. Nevertheless,
 during the first year of independence there were at least 30
 reported wbrk stoppages over pay, dismissal, and pension
 issues, with most actions lasting for no more than a few days.
 In no case had the strikers exhausted existing procedures-for
 settling disputes. A series of wildcat strikes in Windhoek
 during September-November 1990 led to the tear gassing of a
 bakery sit-in and the mass firings of transport and security
 workers. During 1991 labor unrest abated, with short work
 stoppages reported among nurses and construction workers, among
 others.
 The International'Labor Organization (ILO) has been
 instrumental in assisting Namibia with the drafting of the
 proposed new labor Code. Trade unions are free to exchange
 visits with foreign trade unions and'to affiliate with
 international trade union organizations, and they exercise this
 freedomwithout interference.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 In 1985 the Supreme Court of what was then South West
 Africa/Namibia recognized the right of collective bargaining
 without intervention by other government agencies. The
 proposed tabor Code lays down minimal standards, in accordance
 with international labor practices, and guarantees employees
 the right to bargain individually or collectively. At present,
 collective'bargaining is not widely practiced outside the
 mining and construction industries; wages are usually set by
 employers. Even in the mining'sector, union officials complain
 that the lack of access to financial information on companies
 hampers effective negotiation.
 When a dispute cannot be resolved directly, the first recourse
 for workers is to request that the Cabinet create a
 conciliation board under the Wage and Industrial Conciliation
 Ordinance of 1952, with a mediator and representatives of both
 
 
 276
 NAMIBIA
 sides. The proposed Labor Code retains the conciliation board
 mechanism under the supervision of the Labor Commissioner.
 Conciliation boards have mostly been used in wage disputes and
 to a lesser extent to negotiate working conditions, overtime
 hours, and reinstatement of dismissed employees. Under the
 proposed Labor Code, if union recognition cannot be obtained by
 consensus, it can be sought through recourse to a labor court.
 Current law does _-flctively prohibit antiunion
 discrimination by employers against union members and
 organizers. Employers do not have to recognize a union and may
 dismiss members and organizers if they wish. However, the new
 Labor Code would empower the labor courts to remedy unfair
 labor practices. The new Labor Code explicitly forbids unfair
 dismissals, which may also be brought on appeal to the labor
 court. No formal complaints of discrimination were filed in
 1991, although union officials regularly hear such complaints.
 At present, there are no export or offshore processing zones or
 facilities in Namibia. One is planned, and the Prime Minister
 has stated that the workers in such zones will be protected by
 the Labor Code.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is prohibited by law, but during the June 1991
 Land Reform Conference, there were reports that farm workers
 sometimes receive little or no compensation for labor and are
 strictly controlled by farm owners, There were also reports at
 the conference that some farm workers are still subject to
 physical punishment by their employers, although there were no
 formal complaints filed with the Ministry of Labor in 1991. Of
 all Namibian workers, farm labor is the least organized for
 collective action.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment is 15 years. Age regulations
 are generally enforced in the wage sector pursuant to the
 Employment Act of 1986. However, children below the age of 15
 often work on family and commercial farms and in the informal
 sector. Boys in the rural areas traditionally start herding
 livestock at age 7, and street vending by children is becoming
 a more common sight in urban areas. The proposed Labor Code
 empowers the Ministry of Labor inspectors to enforce
 prohibitions on child labor, including minimum ages of 16 for
 underground work and 18 for night work. The labor courts are
 now able to hear criminal charges against violators.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There is no statutory minimum wage law in Namibia. The
 proposed Labor Code does not establish a minimum wage, but it
 provides for the creation of a wages commission by the Minister
 of Labor to determine appropriate living wages. Unskilled
 workers in the relatively high paying mining sector earn about
 twice the amount urban unskilled laborers earn. Domestic
 workers earn much less. Since basic living costs in Windhoek's
 traditionally nonwhite townships are high, most nonwhite
 workers have difficulty maintaining a decent standard of
 living. Union leaders hope to make extensive use of the wage
 commission procedure to redress past inequalities and achieve
 the goal of a "living wage" for all Namibians. However, an
 unemployment rate of more than 25 percent and chronic
 
 
 277
 NAMIBIA
 double-digit inflation tend to turn wage negotiations into
 efforts to maintain real wage levels.
 White Namibians earn significantly more on average than their
 black compatriots. In large part this is due to their
 ownership of most of the country's productive resources and
 past preferential access to education that enables them to take
 advantage of.the skilled labor shortage. .Moreover, even when
 access was.guaranteed, educational facilities-for black
 Namibians were vastly inferior to those which whites enjoyed.
 Allegations continue to surface that nonwhite skilled employees
 often earn less than their white c6unterparts doing the same
 job or whites performing unskilled-tasks. Perhaps because they
 are under greater public scrutiny, state-owned enterprises are
 often accused in the press of engaging in discriminatory hiring
 and pay practices. However, there have been no reported court
 cases involving racial discrimination in the workplace.
 The standard legal workweek-was 46 hours, which would be
 reduced to 45 hours by the proposed Labor Code. If. the
 employee freely agrees, up to 10 hours of overtime per week is
 currently allowed at time-and-a-third pay. Overtime would be
 increased to time-and-a-half and double for Sundays/holidays
 under the proposed Code. Legally, more than 10 hours per week
 of overtime have to be approved by the Government. The new law
 will also mandate annual leave (21 days), sick leave (36 days),
 and a yet-to-be determined amount of maternity leave. Most
 employees are entitled to 21 calendar days of leave per year.
 In practice, these provisions are not rigorously observed or
 enforced.
 Government-mandated occupational health and safety standards
 are set by law, and the Labor Code empowers the.Ministry of
 Labor to strengthen applicable regulations and enforcement
 through inspections and criminal penalties. The Labor Code
 also requires employers to ensure the health, safety, and
 welfare of their employees and provides for the right to remove
 oneself from dangerous work situations. At year's end, the
 Government was conducting anational survey in an effort to
 upgrade health and safety standards. Improvement of safety
 conditions is a key trade union concern, particularly in the
 mining sector where safety campaigns by the mining companies
 have reduced the combined reportable injury and fatality rates.
