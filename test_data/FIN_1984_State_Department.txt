 FINLAND
 Finland is a constitutional republic, a democratic state built
 upon tne principle of the rule of law. Sovereign power in
 Finland rests with the people as represented by their
 delegates assembled in Parliament. Legislative power is
 exercised by Parliament. Supreme executive power is vested in
 the President. A Cabinet, consisting of a Prime Minister and
 sixteen Ministers and responsible to Parliament, works with
 the President in governing the country. Judicial power is
 exercised by an independent judiciary consisting of the
 Supreme Court and Supreme Administrative Court. The Finnish
 people freely choose by direct election a 200-member
 unicameral Parliament every 4 years. They also choose
 electors every 6 years who in turn elect the President. At
 present,' there are nine political parties represented in the
 Parliament, four of which form a center-left coalition
 government.
 During 1984, there were no reported violations in Finland of
 fundamental human rights. The security apparatus is
 controlled by elected officials and supervised by the courts.
 National minorities and women enjoy the same economic and
 political rights as the Finnish majority and men
 respectively. Individuals are free in Finland to pursue their
 religious beliefs.
 Finland has a mixed economy with state-owned, privately owned,
 and publicly owned companies. Citizens are free to pursue
 their legitimate private interests, hold private property, and
 engage in economic activity without government interference.
 Aliens in most cases may own real property only with the
 Government's permission and are prohibited from engaging in
 political activity.
 RESPECT FOR HUMANRIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Killing for political motives by the Government or opposition
 political organizations does not occur.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported cases of disappearances, abduction, or
 clandestine detention by official or opposition forces in 1984.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment is guaranteed by law and respected in
 practice. By law, prisoners must be treated justly with
 respect for their human dignity and without distinction made
 on the basis of race, color, sex, language, nationality,
 religious or political conviction, social position, wealth, or
 any other grounds.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment or exile is
 guaranteed by law and respected in practice. A suspect may be

 FINLAND
 detained by the police for questioning for 3 days, but for
 special reasons not specified in the law this period may be
 extended for 14 additional days. A suspect may, in the latter
 case, be kept in custody only on order of an authority with
 the right to remand a person for trial. That authority must
 immediately notify the court of the extension. During the
 investigative period, the accused may be denied access to a
 lawyer. Following formal arrest, the accused is permitted
 ree access to the lawyer of his choice. The state will pay
 legal fees for the indigent. A court hearing must take place.
 within 8 days of notification of the arrest if in a city or
 within 30 days if in rural areas. The circumstances of the
 arrest are subject to judicial review when the accused is
 brought to trial. Should the arrest be shown to have been
 incorrect, or should the accused be found innocent, he may
 apply to tne same court for civil damages for loss of
 freedom. At present there is no pretrial judicial examination
 of an arrest, although a proposal to change pretrial
 procedures, including the institution of pretrial judicial
 examination, is being considered inParliament.
 The institutions of habeas corpus and bail do not exist as
 such in Finland. Those accused of serious crimes must by law
 remain in custody. Those accused of minor offenses may be
 released on personal recognizance at the court's discretion.
 Preventive detention is authorized only during a declared
 state of war for narrowly defined offenses such as treason,
 mutiny, and trafficking in weapons. Supervisory personnel
 from the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Interior as
 well as the parliamentary Ombudsman and the Chancellor of
 Justice have authority to enter prisons and order the release
 of prisoners held without charges. Exile has not been used as
 a punishment in Finland.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair trial is guaranteed by law and respected
 in practice. Finnish citizens and aliens legally present in
 Finland have the right to effective counsel. Charges must be
 clearly stated. Civilians may not be tried by military courts
 except in time of war. There are no separate *security'
 courts, although local courts may decide to conduct a trial
 behind closed doors in juvenile, matrimonial, and guardianship
 cases, or when the publicity would offend morality or endanger
 the national security of the state. In "national security'
 cases, the judge may withhold any or all information
 pertaining to charges against individuals, verdicts, and
 sentencing. Sanctions may be imposed if such information is
 made public. Provisional tribunals are constitutionally
 prohibited.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The right to privacy and the sanctity of the home, including
 prohibition of eavesdropping and mail tampering, are
 guaranteed by law and respected in practice. The security
 police is subject by law to judicial scrutiny.

 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Law and practice thereunder, an effective judiciary, an
 independent press, and a functioning democratic political
 system combine to ensure freedom of speech and press. There
 have been no instances of abuse or legal decisions restricting
 freedom of the press.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association is guaranteed by
 the Constitution. However, if the purpose of the association
 is to influence political issues, only Finnish citizens may
 belong.
 Trade unions are constitutionally guaranteed the right to
 organize, assemble peacefully, and strike. They enjoy a
 protected status and play an important role in political and
 economic life. A 1-million-member, blue-collar confederation,
 the central organization of Finnish Trade Unions (SAK),
 dominates the trade union movement. The allegiance of its
 members is organizationally divided between two political
 parties. Three other confederations dominate the white-collar
 and professional employees. All trade unions are
 democratically organized and managed and are independent of
 both government and political parties. Most trade unions
 maintain relations with their Nordic counterparts. The four
 trade union confederations also maintain contact with the
 Soviet All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions. SAK and one
 white-collar confederation are members of the International
 Confederation of Free Trade Unions. SAK, through two of its
 affiliates, also has ties to the Communist-dominated World
 Federation of Trade Unions. Finnish trade unions participate
 in the International Labor Organization.
 The Finnish Government encourages voluntary organizations and
 subsidizes many private groups formed to achieve a public
 purpose. They are permitted to maintain relations with other
 international groups in both Communist and Western countries.
 However, if the membership of an organization is more than
 one-third foreign, it requires the Government's permission to
 operate.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Finland has two state religions: Evangelical Lutheran and
 Orthodox. Voluntary taxes are collected by the Government
 from church members to support these churches. Other
 Christian, Muslim, and Jewish populations enjoy unrestricted
 freedom of worship. About 93 percent of the population of
 Finland belongs to the Lutheran church.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Finns are free to travel within the Nordic countries of
 Finland, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, and Sweden without
 passports and need not apply for exit visas for travel to
 other countries. A large number of Finns emigrated to Sweden
 in the pact two decades to seek employment, but many have
 since repatriated themselves. No restrictions have been
 placed on emigration or repatriation.

 During 1984, questions were raised about the criteria which
 the Finnish Government applies in deciding whether or not to
 grant political asylum. The Finnish Government maintains that
 "in accordance with the Geneva Agreement, Finland gives asylum
 to individuals arriving (in Finland) who have the
 characteristics of refugees determined by the Agreement.'
 However, Amnesty International alleged that in six instances
 in recent years Soviet citizens seeking asylum in the West
 were involuntarily repatriated. Finland does not grant asylum
 to people wishing to escape economic hardship.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Finland is a multiparty parliamentary democracy in which all
 citizens over the age of 18 freely elect their representatives
 from among multiple candidates representing a wide spectrum of
 political ideologies. In 1906, Finnish women became the first
 in Europe to win women's suffrage. At present there are 62
 women in the unicameral 200-member Parliament and 3 women in
 the Cabinet. Finland's proportional representation system
 ensures that all political parties or factions with no more
 than 5 percent of the vote can obtain a representative in
 Parliament. Any member of Parliament may introduce
 legislation, although most bills are proposed by the Cabinet.
 Until most recently, votes of no confidence in the Finnish
 Parliament limited the average life of a government to about 8
 months.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Finland participates actively in international human rights
 organizations and is currently a member of the United Nations
 Human Rights Commission. Finland has not been a subject of an
 international investigation of alleged human rights
 violations. Within Finland, several organizations monitor
 human rights performance, including the Finnish Red Cross, the
 government-sponsored Equality Council, the Women's Rights
 Union, and Amnesty International. Amnesty International did
 not discuss Finland in its 1984 report. Freedom House in its
 1983-84 report rates Finland 'free,' but adds that the Finnish
 media are circumspect in criticizing the Soviet Union.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Finland is a prosperous industrial market economy where
 private property is protected by law within a mixed economy of
 private owned, cooperative public, and state-owned
 enterprises.
 Finland with a population of 4.87 million has a comprehensive
 social welfare system available to all citizens without regard
 to race, religion, or sex. Life expectancy at birth is 73.3
 years with an infant mortality rate of 6 per 1,000 in the
 first 12 months of life. In 1981, primary school enrollment
 was over 94.4 percent of the population in the relevant age
 group. Finland enjoys a virtual 100 percent literacy rate. In
 1984, World Bank data-for gross national product per capita
 placed Finland among the world's 20 richest countries with a
 per capita income of $10,876. The level of unemployment
 dropped in 1984 to an estimated 5.7 percent, and the rate of
 inflation fell to 6.7 percent (August 1983 to August 1984).

 Finland is an ethnically homogeneous society with less than 1
 percent of the population either foreign-born or belonging to
 one of the national minorities: Gypsies, Sami (Lapps), Jews,
 and Turks. A large (6 percent) Swedish-speaking minority is
 fully integrated in the society.
 According to the official national program for promoting
 equality, 'The Government of Finland regards the prevailing
 inequality between men and women in society as a serious
 shortcoming.' To redress existing inequities, the Government
 established a Council for Equality which coordinates and
 sponsors legislation to meet the needs of women as workers,
 mothers, widows, and retirees. According to spokesmen from
 Unioni, the leading women's rights group in Finland, the
 Equality Council has sponsored two bills designed to improve
 the status of women in Finland. The first, a comprehensive
 equal rights bill, was to ensure equal treatment for women in
 the workplace; and the second, a family name bill, was to
 permit women to retain legally their maiden names after
 marriage. These bills have not yet been introduced in
 Parliament.
 Government statistics indicate that women's salaries as a
 percentage of those of their male counterparts remained in
 1984 at 77 percent in industry and 85 percent in government.
 Finnish female labor participation rate in 1984 was 70.2
 percent while the male rate was 71.9 percent.
