 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 Since the overthrow of the oppressive Macias dictatorship in
 1979, Equatorial Guinea has had a military Government which has
 under taken steps toward increased civilian participation in the
 Government. During the past year, a draft Constitution was sub-
 mitted to the electorate and approved overwhelmingly. At the
 same time, President Teodoro Obiang Nguema, nephew of former
 President Macias, was reconfirmed as President for a seven-year
 term. In October 1982, under the new Constitution, the Supreme
 Military Council was dissolved and a reorganized civilian Govern-
 ment was named.
 The current President was instrumental in 1979 in overthrowing
 the brutal Macias regime. The nation has subsequently been faced
 with enormous tasks of economic, social, and administrative re-
 construction.
 Equatorial Guineans today are not subject to the terror and
 oppression that they knew under the Macias regime. After the
 overthrow of Macias, the new Government stated its commitment
 to human rights, the principles of international law, and the
 charters of the United Nations and the Organization of African
 Unity. In addition, the Government announced its compliance with
 principles of physical integrity and the inviolability of all
 Guinean citizens, as well as opposition to slavery, torture,
 degrading treatment, and political imprisonment.
 In practice, abuses of the person have greatly declined since
 Macias' overthrow, but political and civil rights arL still
 severely curtailed, although efforts to improve civil control
 have begun.
 The adoption of the new Constitution, which guarantees the right
 "to freely express thoughts, ideas, and opinions", as well as the
 right to run for political office, has yet to affect the politi-
 cal process. Its provision for freedom of association has been
 defined by the President as embracing the formation of political
 parties. However, the election for the country's first parlia-
 ment since 1968 has not yet taken place.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 The Government has committed itself to maintaining the "physical
 integrity of persons" and "the inviolability of all Guinean citi-
 zens." As far as is known, there were no political killings by
 the Government, or by government-inspired or opposition groups
 in 1982. In June 1981 at least 24 military personnel and civi-
 lians were tried for plotting against the Government, and one
 was executed. The reasons were primarily political.
 b. Disappearance
 No information has been received that secret arrests and deten-
 tions continue in Equatorial Guinea, as practiced by the Macias
 regime. There have been isolated reports of arrests without a
 warrant.
 c. Torture
 There is no reliable information that torture, consistently used
 by the former regime, is still practiced, although there are
 
 
 93
 threats of physical reprisals made at times by low-level officials.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Exile groups have charged that inmates at the prison in Malabo
 are mistreated, but these reports have not been substantiated.
 Living conditions and sanitary facilities there are adequate.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Although there are occasional reports of arbitrary arrests,
 including preventive detention, usually at the instance of low-
 or mid-level officials, there are no indications that the Govern-
 ment condones or systematically indulges in these practices.
 While habeas corpus does not exist in practice, some officials
 have been punished for engaging in arbitrary arrests, and the
 Government has indicated that it is striving to correct abuses at
 all levels.
 The above is not true of detentions to provide compulsory labor.
 About every three months the Equatorial Guinea military rounds
 up "vagrants" and buses them to cocoa plantations to work the
 crop. The round-ups are government-sanctioned, and may be
 motivated by a desire to limit vagrancy and encourage gainful
 employment. However, some gainfully employed individuals who
 are impressed have said that it took up to a week to be freed.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There have been no reports of trial denied to accused persons.
 The current court system in Equatorial Guinea appears to be a
 combination of traditional, civil, and military justice, in which
 the modern civil component dominates. It is unclear how this
 court system will operate under the new Constitution, because al-
 though the Constitution establishes a court system, it does not
 describe in detail its structure or the rules governing it.
 Amnesty International indicates trials probably have not been
 fair.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The 1982 Constitution provides that a house may be entered with-
 out the permission of the inhabitant only after a warrant has
 been issued, but it is not clear whether this provision will be
 honored in practice.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees the right "to freely communicate or
 receive truthful information by whatever means of diffusion".
 However, freedom of speech and of the press do not exist in prac-
 tice. The Government owns and operates the radio and television
 stations in Equatorial Guinea and clearly prefers to maintain its
 monopoly in this regard.
 The officially-controlled media do not offer criticism of the
 Government. In 1981 certain Spanish publications were banned
 for negative reporting, but the ban was lifted in a few weeks,
 and the climate for foreign published material now appears good.
 Dissent is rarely heard from the general public, but this may be
 due as much to reticence remaining from the Macias days as to
 fear of punishment from the present Government. Direct public
 criticism of Government policy or personalities is not permitted.
 
 
 94
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution makes no mention of unions, but does prohibit
 strikes injurious to the public interest. It is doubtful that
 strikes have been attempted, and there have been no attempts to
 organize labor unions in recent years. Given the country's
 miniscule industrial and disorganized agricultural sectors, lit-
 tle scope for labor union activity exists. A possible exception
 would be the civil service, which is small and only recently
 reconstituted.
 The Government does not permit political organizations outside
 of its control to function. Non-political groups, such as pro-
 fessional associations and sports groups, are permitted.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution guarantees freedom of worship, but qualifies
 this right with a duty to contain religious practice within
 limitations prescribed by unspecified laws for the good of
 national security, public order and morals. Catholicism domi-
 nates, but other churches and foreign missions also operate
 in Equatorial Guinea. With the exception of one instance in
 which the Government threatened expulsion of a foreigner said to
 be fomenting a schism in the Reformed Church of Equatorial
 Guinea, the Government has not interfered in the internal affairs
 of the churches.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no known restrictions on Equatorial Guineans with
 regard to travel within the country. Travel abroad is limited
 by the shortage of foreign exchange. There have been reports
 of delays in the granting of exit visas, but these do not seem
 to be politically motivated. In 1979 the Government invited
 exiles to return without fear of retaliation for having abandoned
 Equatorial Guinea. Some anti-regime exiles continue to reside in
 Spain, but Guineans in large numbers no longer seek refuge
 outside of the country. There are no foreign refugees known to
 have sought asylum in Equatorial Guinea.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Although the Government in October 1982 announced the dissolu-
 tion of the Supreme Military Council and a reorganized government
 a majority of whose members are civilians, not military officers,
 the Government remains authoritarian in character, with politi-
 cal power centered in the Presidency. Elections for a House of
 Representatives envisaged in the 1982 Constitution have not
 been scheduled, and no separate political parties have been
 permitted to organize, although the President has made public
 commitments to the idea of the establishment of political parties.
 Both the country's ethnic groups are represented, in the Govern-
 ment but there is de facto discrimination in favor of the Fang
 group, which has historically ruled Equatorial Guinea. The
 President, in consultation with his close advisors, chose the new
 Cabinet members.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 From 1979 to the present the Government has cooperated with the
 United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNHRC) with respect to
 
 
 95
 the restoration of civil and political liberties. Two UNHCR
 representatives reviewed and provided the Government with advice
 with respect to the new Constitution.  Amnesty International
 remains concerned about detention without charge and the unfair
 conduct of political trials. The Government has repeatedly
 ignored Amnesty's requests for information on political trials.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 During the eleven-year period following independence in 1968,
 Equatorial Guinea's once prosperous colonial economy was pro-
 gressively weakened by mismanagement to the point of collapse.
 Some have estimated that approximately one-sixth of the popula-
 tion was killed by the Macias regime (including much of the
 economic elite). Although progress at reconstruction has been
 made since the revolution, Equatorial Guinea's economy is still
 weak, and most of the population is very poor. The size of the
 population was estimated in 1981 at 354,000 with a growth rate of
 2.3 percent. GNP per capita was $330 dollars in 1979. Life
 expectancy at birth is 47.1 years, and the infant mortality rate
 is about 143 per 1000.
 There are no sources of water in Equatorial Guinea that can be
 considered safe for drinking without treatment or boiling.
 No statistics are available on primary school enrollment or on
 the adult literacy rate. Education was interrupted for six years
 during the Macias regime, and many teachers were killed or went
 into exile. Primary education has only recently been reorganized.
 Classes are now run by about 700 unevenly educated teachers who
 teach classes that include pupils from age 6 to 18 in the same
 grade. This system probably reaches most of the school age
 population. UNESCO is assisting the Government with on-the-job
 teacher training and reestablishment of the primary school
 system.
 Although no statistics are available on the percentages of the
 population living below the absolute poverty level, the number
 living at the subsistence level is certainly very high. The food
 supply is small and food is expensive, making adequate nutrition
 a problem. Most people have enough to eat, but many suffer from
 protein deficiencies.
 The right to own property alone as well as in association with
 others is guaranteed in the Constitution, but this guaranty is
 subject to limitations also mentioned but unspecified in the
 Constitution. There has been one report of refusal or delay in
 the return of private property confiscated by the Government
 during the Macias regime and now held by the current Government.
 Nevertheless, the Government strongly proclaims its recognition
 of property rights and its commitment to developing a free market
 economy.
 Although stated government objectives include the fair treatment
 of all races and tribes, there is traditional tension between the
 Fang ethnic group, of which the great majority of government
 officials are members, and the other tribes within the territory.
 There have been reports of discrimination and tribally-based
 mistreatment. The tension is especially evident on the island on
 which Malabo is located, since this was traditional Bubi tribe
 territory before the Fang moved there from the continent at the
 beginning of this century. As part of its stated goal of inte-
 grating the different peoples into national life, the Government
 has included some members of the Bubi and other tribes in high-
 level government positions.
 
 
 96
 The 1982 Constitution guarantees all women, whether single or
 married, equality before the law, and also guarantees equality
 of opportunity. There is a ministry for the promotion of women's
 rights. Several women occupy important government posts, although
 not in proportion to their number within the population.
