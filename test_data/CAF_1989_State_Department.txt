 CENTRAL, AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 The Central African Republic (C.A.R.) is a one-party state in
 which General Andre Dieudonne Kolingba has exercised virtually
 full political control since his accession to power in a
 bloodless coup on September i, 1981. In 1986 President
 Koling6;'a stablished the only legal political party, the
 Central'African Domocratic Assembly (RDC), and introduced a
 new Constitution, which was subsequently approved in a
 national referendqm. In that same vote he was elected without
 oppositioh f6 a 6-year term as President. The new
 Constitutioh established a directly elected parliament
 (National Assembly) and an advisory body known as the Economic
 and Regional Council. Both have met regularly since 1987.
 The Ministry of Defense controls a military police force
 (Gendarmerie Natioiiile), in addition to the armed forces,
 which nudiber about"3,dU0." These forces share internal
 security:rbsponsibilities with the civilian police force
 (P6lice Nationale) tnder the Ministry of Interior, which is
 responsible for policing major roads and keeping records of
 the movement of vehicles. The Presidency has its own security
 force, which has collateral responsibility with the border
 policb for airport'security.
 The-C.A.R. is a poor, landlocked, and sparsely populated
 country, most of whose inhabitants derive their livelihood
 from subsistence agriculture. The essentially agrarian
 economy has suffered in the past from ineffective government
 fiscal and ddvelopmental policies and adverse global trends.
 Since'1981'the Government has tried to implement economic
 structural reforms'in cooperation with international donors.
 However, with continiing unfavorable world economic trends,
 progr6ss has remaified elusive.
 Human rights remained restricted in 1989. The Government did
 release several political prisoners, including a journalist,
 and moved to put into effect a law authorizing the resumption
 of trade union activity. However, the Government took further
 action to rebiess the religious activities of the Jehovah's
 Witnesses and two other religious groups. In September, tinder
 unexplained'circumstances, the Government brought back from
 Benin 12 former dissidents, arrested them on arrival, and held
 them without charge throiighbut the remainder of 1989.
 Principal hdman rights problems cbntinu6d to be mistreatment
 of prisoners and detainees,'arbitrary detentions, intrusive
 surveillance of political opponents, and restrictions on
 freedom of speech and press, association, the right of
 citizens to change their government, women's and minority
 rights, and worker rights.
 RESPECT'FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. 'Political'and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There have been no reports of killings or executions for
 political motivesby government forces, although at least one
 death from mistreatment while in official custody occurred
 (see Section l.c.).
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of politically motivated disappearance.
 
 
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Penal Code prohibits torture and provides for sanctions
 against those found guilty of physical abuse. Nonetheless,
 there are reports of police beatings of criminals or suspects.
 Family members, legal counsel, doctors, and clergy generally
 have access to prisoners, including prominent political
 detainees. The latter frequently receive special privileges,
 including permission to leave the prison periodically.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under Central African law, political detainees may be held
 without charge for as long as 2 months but must then be
 formally charged or released. In regular cases, those
 arrested must be brought within 96 hours before a magistrate,
 who decides whether formal charges will be filed. In
 practice, this limit is often exceeded owing to inefficiencies
 in judicial procedures. No system of bail exists. When
 political detainees are charged, local judicial procedures
 (which are modeled on the French system) allow for open-ended
 preventive detention while the public prosecutor prepares the
 state's case against the accused.
 The exact number of political detainees and political
 opponents in exile is not available. During high-security
 events, the Government controls the activities of about 10
 opponents, particularly supporters of former Emperor Bokassa,
 by holding them under house or village arrest until the event
 is over. Four students arrested in September 1988 for alleged
 but unspecified political reasons were released soon
 thereafter without any known charges having been brought
 against them.
 It is the Government's announced policy to encourage
 dissidents to return to the C.A.R.; several former opponents
 of the regime have returned and been appointed to high
 positions in the Governient. In late August, a government
 opponent, Gen. Francois Bozize, and 11 followers returned from
 Benin. It is not clear whether they were forcibly expelled
 from Benin, but all were taken into custody upon arrival in
 thd C.A.R. and were in detention awaiting trial at the end of
 4989.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judiciary consists of regular and military courts, with
 the Supreme Court at the apex. III-,most cases involving common
 criminals, the Government permits legal procedures modeled
 after French Law to be fairly and openly applied, although
 execution of the law is hampered by inadequate training of
 officials and persistent traditional beliefs regarding
 witchcraft and sorcery that sometimes take precedence over
 strict rules of evidence. The accused have a right to legal
 counsel at all stages in the formal procedures and have the
 right of appeal.
 In 1988 a High Court of Justice was created to try political
 prisoners, replacing the Special Tribunal of civilian
 magistrates and military advisers-which had adjudicated
 political cases from 1981 to 1987. It functions in much the
 
 
 63
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 same manner as the ordinary courts, except there is no right
 of appeal, although the possibility of presidential clemency
 exists. No cases have yet come before this Court, although a
 president of the court was.named in October.
 The number of political prisoners is unknown. Political
 opponent Ruth Rolland was released from prison in September by
 7a Presidential Decree of General Clemency. Rolland had been
 tried, convicted, and imprisoned-for distributing tracts
 critical of the Government. She was rearrested on December 16
 on unspecified charges.
 .f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or.
 Correspondence
 Governfient. interference with privacy is common only in
 political and security cases. The law formally prohibits the
 invasion of-the-home without a warrant,-and this prohibition
 -is not generally abused in civil and criminal cases. If a
 political crime is considered to be involved, police are
 allowed to search private property without written
 authorization. The consensus among Central Africans is that
 their Government can and does keep a .close watch on any
 citizen who opposes or appears to oppose it, but government
 surveillance is rare in practice.
 To combat increasing local crime, including robbery and
 assault, citizens' action groups, called vigilance committees,
 were created by the RDC,-- These committees, consisting of 20
 volunteers per-neighborhood, patrol the streets and. have the
 right to stop and.hold suepected criminals-briefly-before
 handing them over to the-police. A code of-cozduct guides
 committee members, forbidding -hem, for-example, from invading
 private property or acting in the capacity of a police
 officer. In September the RDC decided to establish vigilance
 committees throughout the country.
 Civil servants are not required to be party members, but there
 are strong social pressures to join, particularly in the case
 of those holding higher level positions.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties Including:..
 a. Freedom of Speech. and Press
 The right of private-citizens to speak publicly about
 political developments orx.to criticize the Government is-
 circumscribed, although most people -feel free to comment
 privately on political affairs. The National Assembly
 provides a limited forum for public discussion of government
 policies.
 Newspapers, radio, and television are all government owned and
 controlled. Domestic news favors upbeat stories and
 noncontroversial events. Reporting on international news is
 selective and tends to avoid events that may be embarrassing
 to friendly foreign governments.
 Thomas Kwazo, a journalist serving a 3-year sentence for
 filing an "unauthorized" story, was released following the
 September Clemency Decree for various prisoners.

 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Despite constitutional guarantees of the right to assembly,
 only assemblies of a nonpolitical nature can take place
 without government approval. Groups that register with the
 Ministry of Interior can hold meetings. Government forces
 quickly disband unlawful assemblies and, in some instances,
 arrest the participants.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 A variety of religious groupings are active in the country
 (approximately 35 percent traditional African, 50 percent
 Christian, 15 percent Muslim). Religious organizations and
 missionary groups are generally provided religious freedom by
 Central African custom. However, any group whose behavior is
 considered political in nature is quickly stifled. In 1986
 the Jehovah's Witnesses were banned by the Minister of the
 Interior for alleged advocacy of civil disobedience. This
 restriction was only partially enforced, and Witnesses
 continued to congregate quietly for religious services in
 private homes. In April 1989, about l0a participants at such
 a meeting in Bangui were rounded up and detained by police
 under direct supervision of the Minister of the Interior.
 Most were released within 2 days; the others a few days
 later. The last four foreign Witnesses remaining in the
 country were expelled shortly afterward. Other religious
 groups also have been affected. In February the Minister of
 the Interior suspended the activities of the Fraternal Union
 of Baptist Churches on unspecified grounds. It resumed its
 activities in July. In September he suspended indefinitely
 the activities of the Union of Evangelical Pentecostal
 Churches for "irresponsible conduct." It remained suspended
 at the end of 1989.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 People are generally free to move about within the country.
 There are police checkpoints along major roads which sometimes
 present an obstacle to travelers unwilling or unable to pay
 bribes expected by some officials.
 The right of voluntary travel and repatriation is recognized.
 Financial and educational constraints, rather than government
 controls, act to restrict most foreign travel and emigration.
 There were no known cases of revocation of citizenship.
 A reduction of political tensions in Chad since 1985 prompted
 many Chadian refugees in the C.A.R. to return to their
 homeland voluntarily. Their number in the C.A.R. declined in
 1989 to less than 3,000, from a high of 45,000 in 1984-85.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens do not have the ability to change their government
 through democratic means. The power and prerogatives of the
 President and the sole party are not subject to change from
 below. There has been progress in expanding participation in
 the political process. The President makes all important
 national policy decisions, althouuh he allows his Crh;--
 
 
 65
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 considerable leeway in day-to-day activities of government
 administration. The President is also head of the party, the
 RDC. Approval--of the RDC is required in order to run for
 political office, including the National Assembly.
 The Constitution-grants the National Assembly, elected by
 secret ballot in free elections, the authority to debate and
 vote on bills proposed by the executive and to initiate
 legislation of its own. Deputies are promised immunity from
 prosecution or other government interference for opinions
 voiced or votes cast during the exercise of their duties in
 the National Assembly. Assembly sessions in 1989 were marked
 by occasional frank criticisms of government policy, and for
 the first time the Assembly considered budgetary matters.
 Virthally all-aieasures proposed by the Government eventually
 were adopted by nearly unanimous votes after significant
 amendments by the Assembly. In March the Deputies elected a
 new Assembly President.
 ,Electi6ns for municipal councilors were held in May 1988. In
 the seven largest towns, the Ministry of the Interior chose
 one member of the elected municipal council to serve as
 mayor. In all other municipalities the mayors were, at least
 in theory, elected by the municipal councils; but in several
 cases the councils were overruled by the Ministry of the
 Interior.
 Section 4' GovernmentaloAttitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no local organizations to monitor human rights
 issues. However, the Government does permit representatives
 of Amnesty International and the International Committee of
 the Red Cross to visit Bangui periodically. The Government
 also permitted an October visit of an International Labor
 Organization (ILO) mission to investigate allegations of
 worker rights abuses (Section 6.a.). Union representatives
 indicated the visit went well. The Government plans to host
 in January 1990 a conference on human rights sponsored by the
 International Committee on African Human Rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution mandates that all persons are equal before
 the law without regard to wealti, race, or religion. In
 practice, some minorities tend to receive unequal treatment,
 e.g., the forest-dwelling Bamingua, commonly known as pygmies,
 are subject to discrimination and exploitatiqn which the
 Government has'done little to correct.
 There are more than 80 ethnic groups in the Central African
 Republic, with about 70 percent of the population being
 Ngbaka, Baya, or Banda. While President Kolingba has made
 statements about the desirability of an ethnic balance in his
 Cabinet, preference for high government and military- positions
 has been given to members of his Yakoma ethnic group
 (approximately 10 percent of the population). Each ethnic
 group has its own language, but the Sangho language is spoken
 throughout the country.
 Although the Constitution affirms the equality of all
 citizens, women have traditionally been accorded fewer
 opportunities than men. Certain jobs remain closed to women,
 
 
 66
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 such as service in the gendarmerie. There are no precise data
 on the percentage of women in the paid labor force. Many are
 involved in traditional labor--gathering food and firewood and
 keeping house--while others are in commerce as market
 vendors. Educated women working outside the home typically
 find clerical jobs, but some are gradually moving into
 professional positions.
 Polygamy is legally sanctioned, although increasingly fewer
 women accept the practice. A prospective husband must
 indicate at the time of the marriage contract whether he
 intends to take further wives. Divorce is legal in the C.A.R.
 and may be initiated by either partner.
 Violence against women, including wife beating, occurs, but it
 is difficult to gauge the extent of the problem, as it is
 seldom officially reported. The Ministry of Justice does not
 generally hear many cases from people complaining of spouse
 abuse, although the issue does come up during divorce trials
 or in civil suits for damages. Most often, women will
 tolerate abuse in order to retain a measure of financial
 security for themselves and their children.
 Female genital mutilation (circumcision) has been forbidden by
 law since the 1960's, but it is practiced by some ethnic
 groups. Enforcement of the prohibition is rare as it is
 basically considered a private, family matter. It is
 practiced in rural areas and, to a lesser degree, in the
 Muslim quarters of Bangui. Many urban dwellers consider it an
 outdated custom.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 A 7-year suspension of most trade union activity ended on May
 19, 1988, when a law concerning trade union freedom and the
 protection of union rights was adopted. The new law provides
 employees and employers the right to establish and join
 organizations of their own choosing, to draw up their own
 constitution and rules, to elect their own representatives,
 and to formulate their program of action. Implementation of
 the law was delayed nearly a year while the Government drafted
 detailed regulations and guidelines.
 On May 1, 1989, the law entered into full force, and the
 Minister of Labor gave workers throughout the country official
 permission to begin organizing. The Government determined
 that all trade union activity should begin from the ground up
 with elections organized by profession and place of work.
 Only after all major trade unions are in place will workers be
 permitted to convene a congress to set up a National
 Federation. Once the law had entered into force, teachers,
 civil servants, and employees at most of the large factories
 and businesses in the capital, Bangui, met in groups organized
 by profession and place of work in order to elect
 representatives and draft statutes for their union locals. By
 the end of November, 50 unions had held elections, 37 of them
 had submitted their statutes to the Ministry of the Interior,
 and 28 of them had been officially recognized. The other 9
 are still in process. The Procurator and the Ministry of
 Labor retain the right to review the statutes for compliance
 with labor legislation. Encouraged by their official
 recognition, local unions have stepped up their activities and
 plan to send a committee outside of Bangui to organize unions
 
 
 67
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 on a regional level. Two seats for labor representatives are
 reserved on the Economic and Regional Council.
 The new law permits strikes when all efforts at conciliation
 have failed. It also allows unions to become affiliated with
 international labor organizations; even during the 1981-88 ban
 on union activity some lbbor leaders continued to attend
 international labor congresses.
 Despite fhis progress, there are unresolved problems with the
 1988 lasi as written, e.g.., i<strictive membership requirements
 and the uncertain role 'of federations. In June the ILO
 Committe:of xpertson Applications of Conventions'and
 Recommendations -ook note 6f 'recent changes outlined by the
 Gove'ifimen'As reprsentative, but determindd that C.A.R.
 compliance with ILO conventions could only-be assessed by a
 direct dontacts'mission. A visit by such a mission took place
 in October. The mission's report had not been made public by
 the bh-d of 1989.
 In April the U.S. Government announced the suspension of
 kcertain trade privileges accorded the C.A.R., based largely on
 the C.A.R.,.Government's failure to respect freedom of
 association since 1981.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The 1988 union law, which applies throughout the country,
 accords trade unions full legal status, including the right to
 own property and to sue in court. Employers are forbidden
 from discriminating against workers on the basis of union
 membership or union activity, and infractions can result in
 the assessment of legal damages. It is too early to tell
 whether, or how effectively, these provisions will be
 -enforced. Mechanisms for collective bargaining spelled out in
 the 1961 Labor Code fell into-disuse during the ban on union
 activity and had not yet been revived in late 1989. The 1988
 law does not specifically address whether trade unions may
 engage in collective bargaining. There are no export
 processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The ILO Committee of Experts has for some years noted
 "considerable divergencies" between legislation and practice
 in the C.A.R. with respect to Conventions No. 29 and 105 on
 forced labor. The Government has maintained that the C.A.R.
 laws in question, which all date back to the 1960's, are
 obsolete and are no longer observed. In its.1989 report, the
 Committee noted that the Government had indicated its ,
 readiness to accept, but has thus far not requested, ILO
 assistance in drafting legislation to repeal the offending
 laws.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Employment of children under 14 years of age is forbidden by
 law. The relevant legislation is only loosely enforced. Jobs
 are in such demand that children in the labor force are
 generally limited to helping the family in traditional
 subsistence farming or retailing.
 
 
 68
 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum wages are established by the Government, and a social
 security system exists for private industry. The minimum wage
 for a manual laborer, for example, is about $40 per month and
 about $140 per month for a stenotypist. These salaries assure
 a family the basic necessities but are barely adequate to
 maintain a decent standard of living as measured against the
 norms of industrialized countries. The Government has not
 raised the minimum wage since 1980, partly in response to
 pressure from international financial institutions. Much
 labor is performed outside the wage and social security
 system, especially in the large subsistence agricultural
 sector by self-employed farmers. The law sets maximum working
 hours for government employees and most people in the private
 sector at 40 hours per weak. Domestic employees may work up
 to 55 hours per week. There are also general laws on health
 and safety standards in the workplace, but they are neither
 precisely defined nor actively enforced.
 
 
 President Hissein Habre, whose support is based in the armed
 forces,'heoGd an authoritarian government which care to power
 in.1902-after )rotrate4 civil war. Since then, President
 Hebre has govorned through a Council of Minksters and a
 National Consultative Council, both appointed by him. On
 Decembor 10, il Chad's-first eloction since 1969, a'new
 Consttution was adopted-by referendum, and Hissein Habre was
 elect d to a 7- yaar term as President. Legislative elections
 for the National Assembly,. as mandated by the new
 Constitution, are expected to be held during the first part of
 1990. The fmsltiethni  National Uni6n for Independence and
 Revolution (UIR), created in 1984 to bioadon*Habre's        .
 political censtitqency, remains the only officially recognized
 politic4l party. Many former opponents continued to be
 brought into the 'ivl service and army, including some at the
 ministerial level, while several hundreds of iiheir followers
 were released from prison. President Habre's long-time rival,
 ex.president Goikouni Oueddei, remained in self-imposed exile
 in 1989.
 The Government employs a large internal security apparatus.,
 In'addition to the army and police, it includes the National
 Security Service (DDS),' the Special Rapid Intervention Brigade
 (BSIR), the Rural Paramilitary Police (Gendarmerie), and a
 Presidential Security Service. Chad has been concerned about
 sporadic terrorism, mostly emanating from Libya, and chronic
 instability among ethnkq groups, notably the Hadjerai and
 Zaghawa in 1988 and 1989.
 .Chad remains desperately poor, and its economy has been
 severely dislbcited by-extended war with Libya and by
 declining world prices for its principal export, cotton. Its
 estimated 4.5-i illion population has one of the loiest per
 capita annual incomes in the world, $178 in 1988. The
 Government relies heavily on foreign donors, particularly
 France, to fiqance government'operations and to fund
 .develbpmbnt projects. The economy improved in 1989 as the
 Government adopted a stringept World.Bank plan, important
 donors increased their aid, and abundant rains insured that
 subsistence farmers and herders produced enough to feed
 themselvds-.
 Human rights in Chad remained circumscribed in 1989. Major
 -hbman rights concerns were: possible extrajudicial killings;
 tortuie and harsh treatment of prisoners; indefinite and
 incommunicado detentions; denial of.fair trial; restrictions
 on freedom of speech and press, assembly and association, and
 the right of citizens to change their government
 democratically. However, significant steps were taken in 1989
 t'oliprove'the situation. Between December 1988 and December
 1989, the dovernment "released 625 dissidents or former Chadian
 -rebels from prison. Chad's new Constitution promises basic
 political rights and liberties to all Chadians and secret
 elections through universal suffrage. In August the Habre
 Government further e6sed tensions with Libya with the signing
 of a bilateral Framework Accord committing the two countries
 to seek a political solution to their longstanding territorial
 dispute, and to release all prisoners of war (POW's). Chad
 continued to hold.Libyan POW's at year's end, as well as an
 unknown number of persons arrested in the wake of a military
 revolt in April.
 
 
 70
 RESPECT FOR HUIIAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no confirmed instances of government-instigated
 political or extrajudicial killings in 1989. In April a group
 of senior military leaders, all of whom were members of one
 branch of the Zaghawa ethnic group, led an armed revolt
 against the Habre regime. The Government successfully put
 down the revolt and arrested an unknown number of persons,
 most of them Zaghawa. Their status at the end of 1989 was
 unknown. There is concern that Army Commander Hassan Djamous,
 who was implicated in the April 1989 military revolt, may have
 been summarily executed.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no confirmed disappearances in Chad during 1989.
 However, the fate of hundreds of Chadian soldiers who fought
 under Goukouni and were captured in July 1983 has not been
 clarified by the Government. Amnesty International (AI)
 estimates the number of these "disappeared" prisoners as
 between 500 and 1,000.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There were no confirmed reports of torture of prisoners during
 1989. Due to government secrecy and the practice of holding
 most political/security detainees (and many others) in
 indefinite, incommunicado detention, it is difficult to obtain
 information on torture and many other alleged abuses of
 prisoners. For example, the Government has never clarified
 the fate of Saleh Gaba, a journalist, who, according to many
 reports, was tortured with electric shocks and beaten
 severely, and who reportedly died in prison in June 198a. AI
 requested the Government to conduct an urgent investigation
 into the circumstanCes of Gaba's death, but no response had
 been received by the end of 1989.
 There were allegations that government troops continued to use
 extreme measures and intimidation to maintain order in parts
 of Guera prefecture, where a 1987 insurrection among members
 of the Hadjerai ethnic group was met with strenuous
 repression, including summary executions. There were also
 reports in 1989 that the military had used similar measures
 against members of the Zaghawa ethnic group following an armed
 revolt in April by senior Zaghawa military commanders.
 Prison conditions in Chad are harsh, and abuses in handling
 prisoners, usually in the form of beatings, are understood to
 be common. Conditions are reportedly severe in the special
 detention centers maintained by the DDS and other security
 organizations. The lack of food and medical treatment is
 reported to be especially glaring, and prisoners in past years
 are alleged to have died from the combination of malnutrition
 and physical abuse.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under Chadian law, the authorities are required to show
 probable cause in making arrests and to adhere to established
