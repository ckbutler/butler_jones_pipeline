 HUNGARY
 Hungary is a parliamentary democracy with a freely elected legislative assembly.
 Prime Minister Gyula Horn the leader of the Hungarian Socialist Party, heads a
 coalition Government formed after the 1994 national elections. The Government re-
 spects the constitutional provisions for an independent judiciary.
 The internal and external security services report directly to a minister without
 portfolio, and the police report to the Interior Minister. There continued to be credi-
 ble rports of police abuses, although their frequency has declined compared with
 previous years.
 The Government has demonstrated through its macroeconomic policies and exten-
 sive privatization its commitment to the transition to a market economy. The pri-
 vate sector generates about 75 percent of gross domestic product. Services, trade,
 and government employ about 63 percent of the labor force, and industry nearly 30
 percent. Major exports include manufactured goods (41 percent) and machinery and
 transport equipment (39 percent). An estimated 25 percent of theppulation live in
 poverty, with elderly pensioners, dependent housewives and children, and Roma
 most affected.
 The Government generally respects human rights and civil liberties of its citizens;
 however, in practice the authorities do not always ensure due process in all cases.
 Prosecutors and judges may impose what amounts to unlimited pretrial detention,
 although the Government expanded legal provisions for the right to fair trial. Police
 on occasion enter private residences to check foreigners' identification without war-
 rants. Although senior levels of the Interior Ministry and the National Police ad-
 dressed problems in specific cases, police continued to use excessive force against
 suspects. Police harassed and abused both Roma and foreign nationals.
 The print media are completely privatized and enjoy a high degree of independ-
 ence. The electronic media remain a mixture of state-run and private enterprises:
 the two largest stations are state owned, but in October three commercial stations
 began broadcasting. Opposition politicians and some journalists criticized what they
 termed the Government's "media monopoly," the constraints it purportedly imposes
 on press freedom by economic pressure, and its discrimination against conservative
 media. However, there is no evidence of government interference with editorial con-
 tent. Societal discrimination against Roma remains a serious problem. Anti-Semitic
 and racist attacks continued to decline. Spousal abuse of women, sexual harass-
 ment, and discrimination in the job market remain serious problems. Steps were im-
 plemented to improve the rights of women and persons with disabilities.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 After a suspect reportedly was beaten to death in Paszto in 1995, one of the police
 officers involved was dismissed, three were suspended, and the police commander
 resigned. After 12 months of investigation, formal charges were brought in October
 1996. In February the police officers were acquitted on the grounds that there was
 insufficient evidence that the beating directly resulted in the suspect's death.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 No known incidents of torture occurred. Police abuses continued, including harass-
 ment, use of excessive force, and beatings of suspects. Police also continued to har-
 ass and physically abuse Roma and foreign nationals. A total of 164 police officers
 were accused of physical abuse in 1995 (latest available data), a three-fold increase
 over 1994.
 The police and Interior Ministry are working to change the police's authoritarian
 image, and human rights organizations report that police are generally more cooper-
 ative with outside monitoring of police behavior. These efforts are hampered, how-
 ever, by low salaries and a lack of physical resources. A 1997 study by the ombuds-
 man's office, which investigates constitutional violations in the public sector, con-
 demned police corruption but noted that it is unsurprising that it exists, given the
 police's low pay and poor working conditions. Police frequently harass residents,
 charging questionable fines for erroneous traffic violations to earn petty cash. Police
 showed indifference towards foreigners who have been victims of street crime.
 Although prisons are overcrowded, conditions meet minimum international stand-
 ards. Following a report by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture
 and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment published in January, the
 Government closed detention facilities deemed unfit and modernized others. A re-
 
 
 1116
 port for the first half of 1996 by a local human rights organization identified 28
 cases of physical abuse of detainees in prisons (latest available data).
 The Government permits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Poice must inform suspects upon arrest
 of the charges against them and may hold them for a maximum of 72 hours before
 filing charges. The law requires that all suspects be allowed access to counsel prior
 to questioning and throughout all subsequent proceedings. The authorities must
 provide counsel for juveniles, the indigent, and the mentally disabled. There are
 credible reports that police do not always allow access to counsel, particularly for
 minor crimes. There is no bail system; however, depending upon the nature of the
 crime, courts may release detainees upon their own recognizance.
 The Police Act permits police to ho d suspects in public security detention (PSD)
 in cases where the suspect has no identity papers; where blood or urine tests must
 be performed to determine blood alcohol content; or if the suspect continues to com-
 mit a misdemeanor offense in spite of prior warning. Suspects may be held in PSD
 for up to 24 hours. Such detainees are not always informed of the charges against
 them, because such periods of "short" detention are not defined as "criminal deten-
 tion" and so are not considered to be covered by the Criminal Code.
 Pretrial detention, based on a warrant issued by a judge, is initially limited to
 1 year while criminal investigations are in progress; it may be extended indefinitely
 on the prosecutor's motion (provided the judge concurs). The lack of a bail system
 gives tremendous leeway to the judge. In 1996 the average length of pretrial deten-
 tion was 3 to 6 months, although nearly 10 percent of detainees were held for peri-
 ods ranging from 8 to 12 months. In addition, foreigners are usually held until their
 trial since they are considered likely to flee the country. Roma allege that they are
 kept in pretrial detention longer and more frequently than non-Roma (see Section
 i.e.). The law provides for compensation when a detainee is released for lack of evi-
 dence, but the procedure is exercised rarely since detainees must undertake a com-
 plicated legal rocedure to pursue their claims.
 The enalCodedoesnot provide for exile, and it is not employed.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides or an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice. The judiciary provides
 citizens with a fair, although sometimes slow, process. Counsel is appointed for indi-
 gent clients, but public defenders are poorly aid and do not give indigent defend-
 ants priority; lawyers often meet such  ientsr the first time at trial.
 Under the Constitution, the courts are responsible for the administration of jus-
 tice, with the Supreme Court exercising control over the operations and judicature
 of all the courts. There are three levels of courts. Original jurisdiction in most mat-
 ters rests with the local courts. Appeals of their rulings may be made to the county
 courts or to the Budapest municipal court, which have original jurisdiction in other
 matters. The highest level of appeal is the Supreme Court, whose decisions on non-
 constitutional issues are binding. In the case of military trials, appeals also may be
 addressed to the Supreme Court.
 The Constitutional Court is charged with reviewing the constitutionality of laws
 and statutes brought before it. Citizens may appeal directly to the Constitutional
 Court if they believe that their constitutional rights have been violated. Parliament
 elects the Court's members to 9-year terms, which may be renewed. In September
 the Parliament began debate on whether to increase the number of seats on the
 Constitutional Court, as well as providing life tenure for its members (the current
 retirement age is 70), thereby addressing concerns that vacancies on the bench
 could delay the Court's work. No judge or member of the Supreme or Constitutional
 Court may belong to a political party or engage in political activity. Although the
 Government has alleged that judges' political attitudes have affected decisions,
 these charges are undercut by unanimous decisions in controversial cases, with
 judges appointed by the Government siding with those appointed by the opposition.
 The law provides for the right to a fair trial, and the authorities respected this
 right in practice. In selected cases judges may agree to a closed trial to protect the
 accused or the crime victim, such as in some rape cases. There is no jury system;
 hence judges are the final arbiters.
 Military trials follow civil law and may be closed if national security or moral
 grounds so justify. In all cases, sentencing must take place publicly. Defendants are
 entitled to counsel during all phases of criminal proceedings and are presumed inno-
 cent until proven guilty. Judicial proceedings are generally investigative rather than
 adversarial in nature.
 Many human rights and Romani organizations claim that Roma receive less than
 equal treatment in the judicial process. Specifically, they allege that Roma are kept
 in pretrial detention more often and for longer periods of time than non-Roma. This
 allegation is credible in light of general discrimination against Roma; however, there
 
 
 1117
 is no statistical evidence because identifying the ethnicity of offenders is not allowed
 in police records.
 There were no reports of plitical prisoners.
 f. Arbitra Inter ference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 provides that the prosecutor's office may issue search warrants. Police must carry
 out house searches in the presence of two witnesses and must prepare a written in-
 ventory of items removed from the premises. Wiretapping, which may be done for
 national security reasons and for legitimate criminal investigations, requires a
 court's permission. These provisions appear to be observed in practice. However, po-
 lice at times enter private residences without warrants to check foreigners' identi-
 fication.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and the Government respects this right in practice. All the major
 print media-national and regional newspapers, magazines, and tabloids-are in
 private hands, some as part of foreign media companies. The print media enjoy con-
 siderable freedom; however, journalists and opposition politicians are concerned that
 the expression of different views in the press may be circumscribed by the small
 number of owners who control most of the print media.
 Parliament passed a media law in 1995 creating institutions designed to foster
 a free and independent electronic media. The law provided for the creation of na-
 tionwide commercial television and radio, and insulated the remaining public serv-
 ice media from government control. In June the Government awarded licenses for
 the new privatized television channels that began broadcasting in October; licenses
 for commercial radio were awarded in November, and the stations are expected to
 beg   broadcasting in early 1998.
 The regulatory body created by the 1995 law, the National Television and Radio
 Board (ORTT), was accused during its first year and a half of operation of political
 bias in awarding television licenses. Others have criticized ORTT for its attempts
 to acquire a share of the National Broadcasting Company, thereby becoming an
 owner in the industry it regulates. Two lawsuits have been filed against the Board,
 in both cases raising the question of whether the Board is truly insulated from poli-
 tics and conflicts of interest as intended by the law.
 Academic freedom is generally respected.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-There are essentially no re-
 strictions on peaceful public gatherings. In general the Government does not require
 permits for assembly except when a public gathering is to take place near sensitive
 installations, such as military facilities, embassies, or key government buildings. Po-
 lice may sometimes alter or revoke permits, but there is no evidence that they abuse
 Any 10 or more persons may form an association, provided that it does not com-
 mit criminal offenses or disturb the rights of others. Assocations with charters and
 elected officers must register with the courts.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and
 members of all faiths are allowed to practice their religion freely. There are 77 offi-
 cially recognized churches. There is no officially preferred religion, but only 41 offi-
 cially approved religions receive state subsidies. A 1996 law permits citizens to do-
 nate 1 percent of their income tax to the church or nonprofit agency of their choice.
 Figures released in September show that of $10 million (1.9 billion forints) donated,
 $100,000 (20 million forints) was sent to churches (the remainder was donated pri-
 manily to schools and animal welfare groups). In June the Government signe a
 treaty with the Vatican to return church property confiscated by the Communist re-
 gime; the treaty also guaranteed a minimum state subsidy to the Catholic Church
 of $9 million (1.7 billion forints). Religious orders and schools have regained some
 property confiscated by the Communist regime.
 In March Parliament passed enabling legislation setting up a $20 million (4 bil-
 lion Ft) Jewish Heritage Foundation fund as provided for in the 1996 Jewish res-
 titution decree. The fund provides restitution to over 16,000 Holocaust survivors.
 Payments, in the form of life pensions, began in October. The Government also
 agreed to restore to the Jewish community nine real estate properties and assorted
 artwork confiscated by the Communist authorities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on the movement of citizens within or outside
 the country, including on the rights of emigration and repatriation. However, local
 authorities have in some cases tried to expel Roma from towns or to induce Roma
 to live in what amount to ghettos. The Government may delay but not deny emigra-
 tion for those who have significant court-assessed debts or who possess state secrets.
 
 
 1118
 It requires that foreigners from countries that do not have a visa waiver agreement
 with Hungary obtain exit visas each time they leave the country, although blanket
 permission is sometimes available.
 Refugees numbering 4,469 from the former Yugoslavia are registered in Hungary.
 Most are in private housing, with only 500 housed in 3 refugee camps. The Govern-
 ment estimates there are as many as 60,000 immigrants (the vast majority from Ro-
 mania) living in the country in unregistered status, although the local office of the
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) believes that this figure
 is too high.
 Hungary is a signatory to the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the
 Status of Refugees and to its 1967 Protocol. In December Parliament amended the
 refugee law to eliminate a restriction granting refugee status only to Europeans.
 The Government cooperates with the office of the UNHCR and other humanitarian
 organizations in assisting refugees. Hungary provided first asylum to refugees from
 the former Yugoslavia during the fighting in that neighboring country. Prospective
 refugees who seek only to transit to Western Europe are encouraged to return to
 their countries of departure.
 Illegal aliens, mostly non-European, were housed at border guard facilities
 throughout Hungary. During the period from January to July, 5,149 illegal aliens
 were processed pending either deportation or qualification for resettlement in a
 third country according to Interior Ministry data. The determination is made by the
 local office of UNHCR. While police seek the timely deportation of detainees who
 do not qualify for refugee status, a shortage of funds and the detainees' lack of prop-
 er documentation, such as passports, often result in lengthy stays. The Helsinki
 Committee reported that a group of 15 Syrian Kurds were detained for 6 weeks in
 an airport hangar after being denied refugee status. They were transferred to a ref-
 ugee camp after human rights groups threatened to take the case to the European
 Court of Human Rights. The group as since left the camp and is believed to have
 left the country. There were no reports of the forced return of persons to a country
 where they feared persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens age 18 and over have the right to change their government through na-
 tional elections held at least every 4 years. Members of Parliament are elected
 through a complex voting procedure for individuals and party lists. In the 1994 na-
 tional elections, Prime Minister Gyula Horn's Hungarian Socialist (formerly Com-
 munist) Party won an absolute majority and formed a coalition Government with
 the Liberal Alliance of Free Democrats. Four parties, ranging from moderate to con-
 servative, as well as several independent members, constitute an active opposition
 in Parliament.
 There are no legal impediments to women's participation in government or the po-
 litical process; 43 of 383 parliamentary deputies are women. There are few women
 in leadership positions in the Government or the political parties. Several minorities
 are represented in Parliament, including one Rom, one ethnic German, one ethnic
 Slovak, one ethnic Croat, and one ethnic Romanian.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Numerous human rights organizations operate without government restriction or
 interference. Many nongovernmental organizations (NGO's) report that the Govern-
 ment is generally responsive to their requests for information. However, individual
 police units and prosecutors are reportedly uncooperative at times, particularly in
 cases involving Roma or police abuses. Some NGO's also reported attempted intimi-
 dation and harassment by the police. There is also an active 20-member parliamen-
 tary Committee for Human, Minority, and Religious Rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for individual rights, equality, and protection against
 discrimination, but in practice discrimination still exists, particularly against Roma.
 Women.-Spousal abuse is believed to be common, but the vast majority of such
 abuse is not reported, and victims who step forward often receive little help from
 authorities. While there are laws against rape, it is often unreported for cultural
 reasons. Police attitudes towards victims of sexual abuse are often reportedly un-
 sympathetic, particularly if the victim was acquainted with her aggressor. New laws
 entered into force in September that recognize rape within marriage as a crime and
 increase penalties for sex crimes. According to the government statistics office, there
 were 406 reported rapes in 1995 and 2,862 reported cases of assaults on women;
 
 
 1119
 for the first 6 months of 1996, 189 rapes and 1,303 assaults were reported (latest
 available data).
 Legally, women have the same rights as men, including identical inheritance and
 property rights. While there is no overt discrimination against women, the number
 of women in middle or upper managerial positions in business and government is
 low. Women are heavily represented in the judiciary and in the medical and teach-
 ing professions.
 The law does not prohibit sexual harassment in the work place. A 1995 report
 prepared under the auspices of the U.N. to evaluate compliance with the Convention
 on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women termed sexual harassment in
 the workplace as virtually eomen's groups report that there is little
 suppt   or efforts to crimnaize sexual harassment and that harassment is toler-
 ated by women who fear unemployment more than harassment. The Government
 moved to address women s concerns by establishing an Office of Women's Issues in
 the Ministry of Labor.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's rights. Education is man-
 datory through 16 years of age, and employment is illegal blow the age of 16. There
 is no societalpattern of child abuse, although NGO's report that neglect and abuse
 are common in state care facilities. According to the government statistics office,
 there were 753 reported cases of violence against chilren in 1995, 100 of which
 took place within the family. For the first 6 months of 1996, 331 crimes against chil-
 dren were reported, of which 54 were within the home (latest available data).
 People With Disabilities.-Although the Government does not mandate accessibil-
 ity to buildings or government services for people with disabilities, a September de-
 cree requires all companies that employ over 20 persons to reserve 5 percent of their
 jobs for the physically or mentally disabled, with fines of up to 75 percent of the
 average salary paid by the company for noncompliance. Services for the disabled are
 limited, and most buildings are not wheelchair accessible.
 Religious Minorities.-There were a few anti-Semitic incidents of damage to ceme-
 tery property. In May the local government paid for repairs to a Jewish cemetery
 vandalized in Balassagyarmat. In May a group of youths shouted anti-Semitic slo-
 gans and beat a Jewish youth, who suffered a broken nose and chin.
 In the first conviction under a 1996 law making it a crime to incite hatred against
 a community, a court in July sentenced neo-Nazi politician Albert Szabo to 1 year
 in prison for delivering an anti-Semitic speech in 1996. The court suspended the
 sentence and placed Szabo on parole for 3years.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The 1993 Law on Ethnic and Minority
 Rights establishes the concept of collective rights of minorities and states that mi-
 norities need special rights in order to preserve their ethnic identities. It explicitly
 permits organized forms of limited self-government in areas where ethnic groups
 constitute a majority and states that the establishment of self-governing bodies
 must be made possible in localities where an ethnic group constitutes less than a
 majority of the population. The law permits associations, movements, and political
 parties based upon an ethnic or national character and mandates the unrestricted
 use of ethnic languages. Only those ethnic groups that have lived within the coun-
 try's presen         or at least 100 years and whose members are citizens may
 obJtain recognized status under this law.
 On this basis, the law specifically grants minority status to 13 ethnic or national
 groups. Other groups may petition the Chairman of Parliament for inclusion if they
 include at least 1,000 citizens and have their own language and culture.
 In 1994 the first elections were held for minority local self-government entities,
 which resulted in the formation of over 600 minority local bodies. The number grew
 in 1995 to 817 organizations, of which 477 are Rma groups. With funding from the
 central budget ($7.5 million [1.5 billion forints] in 1997) and logistical support from
 local governments, these bodies have as their primary responsibility influencing and
 overseeing local matters affecting the minorities. In 1995 these groups elected na-
 tional minority self-government bodies, whose effectiveness has varied widely. The
 non-Romani minorities appear to be the most satisfied, while Romani leaders ex-
 press frustration with the self-governments' lack of clear authority, responsibility,
 or resources. These entities' greatest value is that they provide a platform for mi-
 norities to address local and national government organizations; their greatest
 weakness is that the Government is compelled to listen, but not to act.
 In 1995 Parliament appointed an Ombudsman--currently an ethnic German-
 specifically charged with defending minority rights.
 Roma constitute at least 4 percent of the population; Germans, the second largest
 minority group, constitute about 2 percent. Smaller communities of Slovaks, Croats,
 Romanians, Poles, Greeks, Serbs, Slovenes, Armenians, Ruthenians, and Bul-
 garians, all are recognized as minorities.
 
 
 1120
 Education is available to varying degrees in almost all minority languages. There
 are minority-language print media, and the state-run radio broadcasts 2-hour daily
 programs in the mother tongue of major nationalities, i.e., Romani, Slovak, Roma-
 nian, German Croatian, any Serbian. State-ran television carries a 30-minute pro-
 gram for the larger minority groups, complemented by 5-minute weekly news bul-
 letins. And the newly-privatized television stations also carry weekly programs for
 ethnic minorities.
 Conditions of life within the Romani community are significantly worse than
 among the general population. Roma suffer from discrimination and racist attacks
 and are considerably less educated, with lower than average incomes and life ex-
 pectancy. The Romani unemployment rate is estimated to be 60 to 85 percent, over
 six times the national average of 10.3 percent. With unemployment benefits ex-
 hausted and social services stretched thin, Roma often confront desparate situa-
 tions.
 Roma continue to suffer widespread discrimination in education, housing, and ac-
 cess to public institutions, including restaurants and pubs. Discrimination in edu-
 cation was highlighted when the town of Tiszavasvari held separate graduation cele-
 brations in June for Roma and non-Roma high school students. Local authorities
 segregated Roma students in a separate school from non-Roma for 12 years because,
 local officials allege, they carry lice and have proportionately more learning disabil-
 ities. Local officials deny any discrimination; the Government criticized the local au-
 thorities, but took no steps to correct the situation. Roma schools are more crowded
 and in markedly poorer condition than those attended by non-Roma. The Helsinki
 Committee found that there are 132 similarly segregated schools throughout the
 country.
 In what is considered a landmark case, in July a court ordered a bar owner in
 the city of Pecs to pay a $750 fine and take out newspaper advertisement apologiz-
 ing for refusing to serve a Rom.
 Local officials have in some cases taken advantage of rules prohibiting over-
 crowded, unsafe or unsanitary housing, or punishing nonpayment of utility bills to
 evict Roma families from residences without providing alternative housing as the
 law requires. In July in Satoraljaujhely, the local government ordered the expulsion
 of two Roma families for disturbing the peace. Central government officials con-
 demned the decree but did not move to overturn it (see Section 1.d.).
 The Government sponsors programs both to preserve Romani languages and cul-
 tural heritage and to assist social and economic assimilation. There is a Coordina-
 tion Council for Romani Affairs attached to the Prime Minister's Office. In July the
 Government published an action plan designed to improve living conditions in
 Romani communities, with specific focus on public health, education, and work
 training. However, the plan provides no additional funds; rather, it redistributes al-
 ready inadequate resources. Widespread popular prejudice against Roma nonethe-
 less continues. Police commonly abuse them (see Section 1.c).
 The Helsinki Committee recorded 2 cases of skinhead assaults (one against a
 group of Roma, the other against an Asian student.) According to press reports, a
 danese man was attacked in Budapest by four skinheads in December. The
 attackers were arrested and the case is under investigation. Foreigners of color re-
 ported harassment byplice and at border control checkpoints. The Martin Luther
 King Organzation (MLKO), which documents assaults on nonwhites, recorded six
 such incidents in the first half of 1996, a higher rate of assaults than the total
 (seven) for 1995 (latest available data). MLKO sources believe many cases go unre-
 ported.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1992 Labor Code recognizes the right of unions
 to organize and bargain collectively and permits trade union pluralism. Workers
 have the right to associate freely, choose representatives, publish journals, and
 openly promote members' interests and views. With the exception of military per-
 sonnel and the police, they also have the right to strike. Under a separate 1992 law,
 public servants may negotiate working conditions, but the final decision on increas-
 ing salaries rests with Parliament.
 The largest labor union organization is the National Confederation of Hungarian
 Trade Unions, the successor to the former monolithic Communist union, with over
 800,000 members. The Democratic League of Independent Unions and the Federa-
 tion of Workers' Councils have approximately 250,000 and 150,000 members respec-
 tively.
 There are no restrictions on trade union contacts with international organizations,
 and unions have developed a wide range of ties with European and international
 trade union bodies.
 
 
 1121
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectivly.-The Labor Code permits col-
 lective bargaining at the enterprise and industry level, although the practice is not
 widespread and is actively discouraged in the growing private sector. Labor organi-
 zations appear willing to cooperate with one another, and this is particularly evi-
 dent in their relationship in forums such as the National Interest Reconciliation
 Council (ET), which provides a forum for tripartite consultation among representa-
 tives from management, employees, and the Government. The ET discusses issues
 such as wage increases and the setting of the minimum wage, which is centrally
 negotiated within the ET in order to control inflation. Individual trade unions and
 management may negotiate higher levels at the plant level. The Ministry of Labor
 is responsible for drafting labor-related legislation, while special labor courts enforce
 laborlaws. The decisions of these courts may be appealed to the civil court system.
 Employers are prohibited from discriminating against unions and their organizers.
 The Ministry of Labor enforces this provision.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, including that performed by children, and the Ministry of Labor en-
 forces this prohibition.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The law
 prohibits forced and bonded labor by children. The Labor Code forbids labor by chil-
 dren under the age of 14, and regulates labor conditions for minors (14 to 16 years
 of age), including prohibitions on night shifts and hard physical labor and guaran-
 teed overtime payments. The National Labor Center enforces these regulations in
 practice, and there does not appear to be any significant abuse of this statute. Edu-
 cation is compulsory through age 16. Roma are far more likely than non-Roma to
 stop attending school before age 16.
 e. Acceptable Conditions ofWork.-The ET establishes the legal minimum wage,
 which is subsequently implemented by Ministry of Labor decree. The minimum
 wage, $95 (14,500 Ft) per month, is insufficient to provide an adequate standard of
 living for a worker and family. Many workers supplement their primary employ-
 ment with second jobs.
 The Labor Code specifies various conditions of employment, including termination
 procedures, severance pay, maternity leave, trade union consultation rights in some
 management decisions, annual and sick leave entitlement, and labor conflict resolu-
 tion procedures. Under the Code, the official workday is set at 8 hours; it may vary,
 however, depending upon the nature of the industry. A 24-hour rest period is re-
 quired during any 7-day period.
 Labor courts and the Ministry of Labor enforce occupational safety standards set
 by the Government, but specific safety conditions are not generally consonant with
 internationally accepted standards. The enforcement of occupational safety stand-
 ards is not always effective in part due to the limited resources the Ministry of
 Labor is able to commit to enforcement. In theory, workers have the right to remove
 themselves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to continued employ-
 ment.
