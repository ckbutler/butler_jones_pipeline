 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES
 The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a federation of seven emirates established in
 1971. Each emirate retains extensive control over mineral wealth (including oil) and
 some aspects of defense and internal security. There are no popular elections, either
 local or federal. Most emirates are governed through traditional tribal mechanisms,
 relying heavily on the open majlis or meeting wherein citizens may express their
 concerns directly to their leaders. In accordance with the 1971 Constitution, the
 seven emirate rulers comprise a Federal Supreme Council, the UAE's highest legis-
 lative and executive body. The Supreme Council selects a President and Vice Presi-
 
 
 1103
 dent from its membership; the President in turn appoints the Prime Minister and
 his Cabinet. The Supreme Council meets officially only occasionally although the
 leaders meet frequently in more traditional settings. In practice, the legislative and
 executive work is delegated to the Council of Ministers, which manages the federa-
 tion on a day-to-day basis.
 Each emirate maintains its own police force, but only the Federal Government
 and the emirate of Dubai have independent internal security organizations.
 The largely free market economy, based on oil and gas production and light manu-
 facturing, has made the UAE's per capita income one of the world's highest. The
 Government owns the majority share of the oil enterprise in the largest emirate of
 Abu Dhabi with the other shares held by various private oil company equity part-
 ners. The kAE's four emirates with small or nonexistent petroleum resources are
 dependent on federal government subsidies for such essential services as health,
 electricity, water, and education. The UAE economy is heavily dependent on foreign
 labor, which makes up 80 percent of the population. These workers, primarily from
 Asian and other Arab countries; perform most manual and technical labor.
 There was no significant change in the human rights situation in 1992. The prin-
 cipal problems were incommunicado detention and restrictions on the freedoms of
 speech, press, assembly, association, and worker rights, and denial of the right of
 citizens to change their government. Although women continue to make progress in
 education and in the work force, certain types of discrimination persist. Although
 the trend toward somewhat freer expression of opinion in the media continued in
 1992, the press continued to avoid direct criticism of the Government and exercised
 self-censorship on topics sensitive to the Government. President Zayed signed into
 law a new Criminal Procedures Code which codifies basic rights for the accused in
 the federal courts of all seven emirates. It includes, for the first time, the right of
 the accused to have defense counsel at trial in cases of a capital offenses or if the
 sentence is life imprisonment.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGH
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killings.-There were no reports of political
 or other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-No political disappearances were re  rted.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Teatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits torture or degrading treatment, and there were no re-
 ports of such abuse in 1992. Shari'a courts are known to sentence Muslims to flog-
 ging for crimes related to alcohol abuse and adultery. In July a foreign national was
 convicted of stealing and was sentenced to have his left hand amputated. The sen-
 tence is under appeal.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arrest, search,
 detention, or imprisonment except in accordance with the law, and the laws of each
 emirate prohibit arrest or search without probable cause. However, there were cred-
 ible reports of persons, particularly Iraqis and Palestinians, who were arbitrarily de-
 tained in 1992. They were sometimesheld in incommunicado detention for 1 to 2
 months before being released.
 Some long-term residents of Palestinian, Iraqi, Yemeni, Jordanian, and Sudanese
 origin have-ad their residence permits and employment visas revoked, or have not
 been able to have them renewed, and are beingheld in jail because they are unable
 or unwilling to return to their countries of origin.
 A new Criminal Procedures Code, applicable in the federal courts of all the emir.
 ates, went into effect in 1992. Under this new Code, the police must report any ar-
 rest to the Attorney General within 48 hours and he must determine within the
 next 24 hours whether to charge, release, or, with sufficient police justification,
 allow limited, further detention pending an investigation. Once charged, detainees
 are brought to trial reasonably expeditiously, although the code includes no specific
 right to a speedy trial. There is no formal system of bail, but detainees sometimes
 are release upon the deposit of money or an important document such as a pass-
 port. The Government has not denied its use of incommunicado detention. There
 were also several instances of prolonged detention without charge but with access
 to legal counsel.
 Exile of citizens is prohibited by the Constitution and is not practiced. Noncitizens
 convicted of crimes are subject to deportation.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The UAE has a dual system of Shari'a (clerical)
 and civil courts, each of which deals with both criminal and civil cases. The Shari'a
 courts are administered by each emirate, but the civil courts are usually part of the
 federal system and are answerable to the Federal Supreme Court in Abu Dhabi.
 
 
 1104
 However, the court systems in the Emirates of Dubai and Ras al-Khaimah are inde-
 pendent of the federal system. Each court system has a multilevel appeals process,
 and verdicts in all capital cases are appealable to the President of the UAE. The
 nature of the case determines which court system hears a particular case. Due proc-
 ess rights are uniform under both Shari'a and civil court procedure, and the new
 Criminal Procedures Code applies to both court systems. There is a presumption of
 innocence until guilt is proven.
 Legal counsel is readily available and permitted to represent a defendant in both
 court systems. The court may appoint legal counsel if counsel agrees to provide serv-
 ices free; there is no office of public defender. The losing party may be required to
 pay the winner's legal fees. The judge is responsible for looking after the interests
 of a person not represented by counsel. Under the new Criminal Procedures Code
 the accused has a right to defense counsel at trial in cases that involve a capitai
 crime or possible life imprisonment. If the defendant is indigent, the Government
 will provide counsel.
 There are no jury trials. All cases, except national security cases and those
 deemed by the judge likely to harm public morality, are open to the public. Most
 judges are foreign nationals, primarily from other Arab countries. A sentence of exe-
 cution requires a unanimous decision by a three-judge panel and the approval of the
 President of the UAE. There has been little evidence in recent years of rulers inter-
 fering in the judicial process.
 There is no separate national security court system. The military has its own
 court system based on Western military judicial practice. Military tribunals try only
 military personnel.
 There are no known political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits entry into homes without the owner's permission, except in
 accordance with the law. Although the police may enter homes without a warrant
 and without demonstrating probable cause, an officer's actions in searching prem-
 ises are subject to review, and he is subject to discipline if he acts irresponsibly.
 Anyone other than a police officer must have a court order to enter a private home.
 Local custom and practice place a high value on privacy, and entry into private
 homes without the owner's permission is rare. There is no surveillance of private
 correspondence. Except for occasional instances involving national security, no cases
 of arbitrary interference with privacy have been reported in recent years.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although UAE citizens are constitutionally as-
 sured freedom of speech, in practice there is censorship, and most inhabitants, espe-
 cially foreign nationals, are circumspect in public discussions of sensitive political
 topics or in criticizing the Government.
 Many of the local English- and Arabic-language newspapers are privately owned,
 but all receive government subsidies. Self-censorship by the press, following govern-
 ment guidelines, makes formal censorship rare, and there were no instances in
 1992. J ournalists in the UAE must also conform to the code of self-censorship in
 articles concerning the UAE destined for publication abroad.
 The UAE press continues to be cautious in reporting on government policy, the
 ruling families, national security, religious matters, and relationships with neigh-
 boring states. During 1992 a trend, noted during the Gulf war, continued toward
 more open expression of opinion on subjects sensitive to the Government. Articles
 were published on some political issues, such as current international events, and
 some domestic issues, such as local drug abuse.
 All television and radio stations are government owned and conform to govern-
 ment reporting guidelines. However, television stations in Abu Dhabi and Dubai
 continue to broadcast the programs of the Cable News Network (CNN), with no ap-
 parent censorship.
 The censorship department of the Ministry of Information and Culture reviews all
 imported newspapers, periodicals, books, films, and videos, and bans items consid-
 ered pornographic, violent, derogatory to Islam, favorable to Israel, unduly critical
 of friendly countries, or critical of the Government or the ruling family. Authorities
 confiscate material written in the Hebrew language. The small publishing industry
 is subject to government censorship in accordance with the above criteria.
 The Government dropped previous prohibitions on the private ownership of sat-
 ellite dishes, and an increasing number of residents now receive uncensored enter-
 tainment programming.
 In 1991 the Sharjah Government responded to the staging of an Indian satirical
 play, "Ants That F east on Corpses," critical of religion by filing charges of blas-
 phemy and sacrilege against Islam and Christianity in a civil court against the for-
 
 
 1105
 eign group that sponsore-d1he play and requiring that all future plays staged by
 this sponsor be screened by the Ministr of Iformation and Culture. The court con.
 victed and sentenced 10 Indian nationals and the playwrt (who was tried in
 absentia) to 6 years in prison, the minimum senten  provi ed for under the law.
 The conviction is under appeal.
 The unwritten but widely accepted ban on criticism of the Government also re-
 stricts academic freedom. However, the recent trend toward more overt criticism of
 the Government by academics continued to be evident in 1992. This criticism ap-
 pears in articles written by academics and published in the UAE press, as well as
 in viewpoints expressed by professors in their classrooms.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-These freedoms are restricted.
 Political organizations are prohibited. Organized public gatherings require a govern-
 ment permit. Each emirate determines its own practice on public gatherings, with
 some emirates taking a more liberal approach to seminars and conferences on sen-
 sitive subjects. Citizens normally confine their political discussion and debate to the
 numerous "assemblies" (majlises), held in private homes, which are a local tradition.
 There are no restrictions on the formation of private associations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Islam is the official religion. UAE citizens are predomi-
 nately Sunni Muslims, but Shi'a Muslims are also free to worship and maintain
 mosques throughout the UAE. By tradition and social custom, non-Muslims are free
 to practice their religion but may not publicly proselytize or distribute religious lit-
 erature. Christian churches and Hindu and Sikh temples built on land donated by
 the ruling families exist in the major cities. Foreign clergymen are allowed to min-
 ister to expatriate congregations. Christian teaching is permitted in private schools
 for Christian children. Religious groups are allowed to engage in private charitable
 activities.
 (See Section 2.a. on the arrest and conviction of Indian expatriates on blasphemy
 charges.)
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on freedom of movement or relocation within
 the country except for security areas such as defense and oil installations. Unre-
 stricted foreign travel and emigration are permitted to citizens, except those in-
 volved in financial disputes under adjudication. Exit visas are not required, al-
 though children may not leave the country without their father's permission. All
 citizens have the right to return.
 In the past, the UAE accepted large numbers of Palestinians and other displaced
 persons. This practice was reversed in the wake of the Gulf war. In 1992 the em-
 ployment contracts of some Palestinians, Iraqis, Jordanians, Yemenis, and Sudanese
 were terminated, and would-be refugees of other nationalities also continued to be
 affected by more restrictive immigration and employment policies. Only persons in
 specific occupations, primarily professional, may change employers without leaving
 the country for 6months.
 There are no formal procedures for accepting refugees, and persons who seek refu-
 gee status are routinely jailed or detained while awaiting resettlement in a third
 country. Although one may acquire a UAE passport through marriage or presi-
 dential fiat, there is no formalized procedure for naturalization. Noncitizens are ex-
 pected to leave the country at retirement age.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The UAE has no formal democratically elected institutions, and citizens do not
 have the right to change their government or even to form political parties. Al-
 though there are consultative councils at the federal and national levels, most exec-
 utive and legislative power is in the hands of the seven emirate rulers their ex-
 tended families, and those persons and families to whom they are allied by histori-
 cal ties, marriage, or common interest. These emirate political leaders constitute the
 dominant political force at the national level.
 Members of the Federal National Council are appointed by the rulers of each
 emirate in a ratio depending on the size and wealth of the emirate. Certain types
 of legislation must go before this Council to be approved; however, in reality, the
 Council has only advisory power.
 Decisionmaking at the federal level is through consensus of the seven emirates
 and their leading families. This need for consensus tends to slow decisionmaking at
 the federal level. Citizens have the opportunity to make their views and grievances
 heard through attendance at majlises held by the rulers of each emirate. Women
 may attend women's majlises presided over by the wives of the rulers.
 Although the rulers and ruling families by tradition are presumed to have the
 right to rule, their incumbency ultimately depends on the quality of their leadership
 
 
 1106
 
 and their responsiveness to their subjects' needs. Emirate rulers are accessible, in
 varying degrees, to citizens who have a problem or a request. The choice of a new
 emrate r      falls to the ruling family in consultation with other prominent tribal
 rulers.
 Women are free to hold government positions but there are few women in high-
 level government positions because they are relatively new to government service
 and because there continues to be strong family pressure against women entering
 the workplace. Although the UAE's Shi'a minority has enjoyed commercial success,
 few of their members manage to reach top positions in the Federal Government.
 The political dominance of the ruling families is intertwined with their substan-
 tial involvement and influence in economic life. The ruling families and their close
 allies control and profit from petroleum production and, with important merchant
 families, have a major stake in the UAE's commercial life. A complex system of dis-
 tribution of wealth, including through the federal and emirate governments, ensures
 generous subsidies and a high standard of living for most UAE citizens.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The UAE does not have any internal groups that monitor human rights, and there
 were no reports of such groups attempting to form. No outside human rights group
 was known to have sought permission to visit the UAE in 1992.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 Discrimination based on national origin, while not legally sanctioned, is prevalent
 in the UAE (see Section 1.d.). Employment immigration and security policy as well
 as cultural attitudes towards foreign workers are conditioned by national origin.
 There is some discrimination against the UAE's Shi'a minority, but it is apparently
 based on national origins rather than on their religious affiliation.
 Most UAE women still play a traditional family-centered role because of the fre-
 quency of early marriage and traditional attitudes about women's roles. However
 women's education continues to advance rapidly. Female enrollment at the UAE
 University, for example, now constitutes 70 percent of the student body. Opportuni-
 ties for women are growing in government service and in traditional occupations
 such as the media, education, and health. Women are officially encouraged to con-
 tinue their education, and government-sponsored women's centers provide adult
 education and technical training courses. The UAE military service accepts women
 volunteers and is expanding its training program for female officers and enlisted
 ranks.
 There are no restrictions on the right of UAE women to own property or to engage
 in marriage contracts as equal partners. A woman's property is not commingled
 with that of her husband. However, a woman may not take her children out of-the
 UAE without their father's permission. In cases of divorce, Islamic law is observed.
 The woman gets custody of children until they are 7 years of age. After this a child
 usually lives with his or her father unless there are circumstances that convince ju-
 dicial authorities that custody should be given to the mother. In divorce cases in
 which the mother is a non-Muslim or a foreigner, the court usually grants custody
 to the father regardless of the child's age. A woman who remarries forfeits her rig ht
 to the custody of children from a previous marriage. Polygamy is legal, with the
 stipulation that all wives be treated equally. In practice, few UAE men have more
 than one wife.
 Due to a deep respect for privacy, spousal abuse is rarely reported in the UAE.
 Knowledgeable sources report a low incidence of medical treatment for spousal
 abuse. However, when reported, the local police authorities will take action to pro-
 tect women from abuse. UAE laws also protect women from verbal abuse or harass-
 ment from men, and violators are subject to criminal action. There continue to be
 credible reports of abuse of female domestic servants by both UAE national and for-
 eign employers. In 1992 a small number of maids sought shelter from abusive em-
 ployers.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-UAE law is silent on the right of workers to organize
 unions and to strike, except that it is a criminal offense for public sector workers
 to strike. In practice, there are no unions and no strikes. Foreign workers who
 might attempt to organize a union risk deportation.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There is no legal provision
 for the right of workers to engage in collective bargaining. Most of the work force
 is foreign. Workers in the industrial and service sectors are normally employed
 under work contracts that are subject to review by the Ministry of Labor and Social
 Affairs. For the resolution of work-related disputes, workers must rely on concilia-
 
 
 1107
 tion committees organized by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, or on special
 labor courts. Domestic servants and agricultural workers are not covered by UAE
 labor laws and thus have great difficulty in obtaining any assistance in resolving
 labor disputes.
 There is manufacturing in the free port, but the same laws and regulations apply
 there as in the rest of the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is ille-
 gal and not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Labor regulations prohibit employ-
 ment of persons under age 15 and have special provisions for employing those aged
 15 to 18. Labor regulations allow contracts only for adult foreign workers. In Janu-
 ary 1993, the Government announced that new regulations for camel racing would
 be changed to eliminate the employment of small boys as jockeys in camel races.
 In addition, the Government announced that small children now employed as jock-
 eys would be returned to their parents. In 1992 the Government tolerated the em-
 ployment of 5- to 8-year-old boys who ride as jockeys in the dangerous local sport
 of camel racing. These children apparently enter the country illegally, often with the
 assistance of organized agents. There were several press reports m 1992 that Indian
 authorities broke up rings of agents who procured children to ride camels in the
 UAE. Reportedly underfed (the preferred weight for a camel jockey is under 40
 pounds), these boys are kept in conditions described as inhumane by a local judge
 ruling on a case in which two 10-year-old jockeys killed a 6-year-old boy who was
 perceived as threatening because he wanted to learn how to become a jockey. There
 are a number of children being treated in government hospitals for injuries sus-
 tained during riding accidents. When local police are summoned to deal with a labor
 dispute invoFng these children they are usually repatriated.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legislated or administrative mini-
 mum wage. Supply and demand determine salaries.However, according to the Min.
 istry of Labor and Social Affairs, there is an unofficial, unwritten minimum wage
 rate which would afford a worker and family a minimal standard of living. The
 Labor and Social Affairs Ministry reviews labor contracts and does not approve any
 contract that stipulates a clearly unacceptable wage.
 Work hours are restricted to 8 hours per day, 6 days per week, but these stand-
 ards are not strictly enforced. The law provides for a minimum of 24 days per year
 of annual leave plus 10 national and religious holidays.
 Most foreign workers receive subsidized housing, medical care, and homeward
 passage through their employers. The vast majority of such workers, however  do
 not earn the minimum salary ($1,000 per month) required for them to sponsor their
 families for a UAE residence visa. Foreign workers must have the approval of an
 existing employer in order to obtain a new work permit to move to a new job with
 a different employer.
 The Government sets health and safety standards, which are enforced by the Min-
 istry of Health, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, municipalities, and Civil
 Defense. Every large industrial concern is required to employ an occupational safety
 officer certified by the Ministry of Labor. If an accident occurs, a woroker is entitled
 to fair compensation. Health standards are not uniformly applied in the housing
 camps provided by employers. All workers have the right to complain to the Labor
 Ministry, whose officials are accessible to any grievant, and an effort is made to in-
 vestigate all co plaints. The Ministry, which oversees worker compensation, is,
 however, chronically understafed and underbudgeted so that complaints and com-
 pensation claims are backlogged.
 Foreign nationals from India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Bangladesh, and Sri
 Lanka continue to seek work in the UAE in large numbers. There ae Lmany om-
 plaints that recruiters in the country of origin use unscrupulous tactics to entice for-
 eign manual laborers and domestics to the UAE, promising false salaries and bene-
 fits. Such cases may be appealed to the Labor Ministry and, if this does not resolve
 the issue, to the courts. However, many laborers are reluctant to protest or to en-
 gage in such a lengthy process because of fear of reprisals by their employers. More-
 over, since the UAE tends to view foreign workers through the prism of their var-
 ious nationalities, employment policies, like immigration and security policies, have
 at times been conditioned upon national origin.
