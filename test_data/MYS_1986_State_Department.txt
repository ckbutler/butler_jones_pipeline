 MALAYSIA
 Malaysia is a multiethnic society. Malays comprise a bare
 majority of the population, the remainder consisting of a
 substantial Chinese (about 33 percent), large Indian (about 10
 percent), and several smaller minorities. Since independence in
 1957, Malaysia has had a parliamentary system of government
 based on free elections contested by several parties, almost all
 of which are racially based. The ruling National Front
 (composed of three major and several minor parties) has won a
 two-thirds or better majority in the federal Parliament in all
 seven general elections since 1957, but opposition parties are
 active and vocal participants in the political system and
 occasionally hold power at the state level. A strong free
 market economy, abundant natural resources, and a relatively
 small population have helped Malaysia become one of the most
 prosperous of the developing countries. In recent years, a
 worldwide commodity recession has slowed the nation's economic
 growth considerably, making management of relations among ethnic
 communities more difficult.
 Internal security in Malaysia has been seriously threatened
 twice. A major Communist insurrection began in 1948 and peaked
 in the early 1950's; it still smolders in a few border areas.
 In 1969 in intercommunal rioting following national elections,
 several hundred persons were reported to have died. In
 addition, the Government explicitly classifies the country's
 current serious drug problem as a threat to national security.
 The remnants of the Communist insurgency, the possibility of
 renewed communal conflict, and widespread drug abuse are cited
 by the Government as justification for laws allowing preventive
 detention of persons suspected of subversive activity or of
 other activities, including drug crimes.
 In comparison to previous regimes, Prime Minister Mahathir's
 administration has been relatively restrained in its-use of
 Malaysia's internal security legislation to deal with political
 offenses. The number detained under the Internal Security Act
 (ISA) reportedly has been sharply reduced to about 50, from
 about 500 when Mahathir took office in 1981. However, the
 Government has made clear its intention to continue to use
 security legislation when necessary in the future. Important
 events in 1986 include the arrest under the Internal Security
 Act, and release 5 months later, of 36 Islamic extremists
 involved in a shoot-out with police; a 3-month government ban on
 distribution of the Asian Wall Street Journal (later rescinded)
 together with the temporary expulsion of its two Kuala
 Lumpur-based reporters; and the acquittal of a prominent human
 rights lawyer indicted in 1985 on charges of sedition.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section i Respect for the Integrity of the Person, including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no reports of political killings by the Government or
 by any other organization.
 b. Disappearance
 There was no evidence of abduction, secret arrests, or
 clandestine detention attributable to the Government or to
 nongovernmental or opposition forces.

 MALAYSIA
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There was no evidence of torture. Allegations of cruel,
 inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment are rare.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.
 The Government can detain suspects without benefit of judicial
 review under three laws. The 1960 Internal Security Act (ISA),
 spawned by the Communist insurgency of the 1950's, is aimed at
 controlling internal subversion. Detainees must be informed of
 the charges against them and given the opportunity to protest
 those charges to an advisory board. The advisory board must
 also review each case at least every 6 months. However, neither
 advisory board decisions nor recommendations are binding on the
 Government, which also has the power to extend detention
 indefinitely in 2-year increments. According to a Home Ministry
 statement, the number of ISA detainees in June 1985 was 64. It
 is estimated, based on information from several sources, that
 the current figure has been reduced further to about 50 .
 Although members of legal opposition parties have from time to
 time been detained under the ISA, almost all current detainees
 are alleged members of the Communist party of Malaysia. Periods
 of detention for this group reportedly range from 14 years to
 under 1 year; the average is about 8 years. From January to
 June 1986, 36 Islamic extremists were detained under the ISA for
 their role in a November 1985 shoot-out with the police near the
 village of Memali, Kedah. Eighteen police and civilians were
 killed in the clash.
 The Emergency Ordinance of 1969 stemmed from that year's
 communal riots. The state of emergency has never been
 rescinded, although Parliament regained its legislative power,
 suspended as part of the emergency, in 1971. The Emergency
 Ordinance gives the Government the power to detain anyone "in
 the interests of the public safety or the defense of Malaysia."
 As under the ISA, detainees must be informed of the charges
 against them, and they can appeal to an advisory board. In
 contrast to the ISA, however, the Emergency Ordinance allows the
 Government to detain suspects for a maximum of 2 years, although
 upon release it can put them under "restricted residence" for an
 additional 2-year period. The Government has relied on the
 emergency ordinance to detain suspected major narcotics
 traffickers when it has insufficient evidence to prosecute them
 under drug laws. Based on figures provided by the Malaysian
 Government, it appears that in October 1986, about 400 suspects
 were in detention.
 The Dangerous Drugs Act of 1985, adopted after extensive public
 hearings by a parliamentary select committee, gives the
 Government a specific law under which suspected drug traffickers
 can be detained. It strengthens the Government's hand in that
 suspects can be held indefinitely for successive 2-year
 periods. However, certain due process safeguards not found in
 the Emergency Ordinance were incorporated in the antidrug law.
 An "inquiry officer" must both receive a copy of the police
 report to the Minister of Home Affairs which recommends
 detention and also submit his views to the Minister. Also, the
 opinion of the advisory board, following either its initial
 hearing or its periodic reviews of each case, is binding on the
 Minister. Finally, the act expires after 5 years unless
 reaffirmed by Parliament. About 150 suspects were in detention
 under this statute in October 1986.

 MALAYSIA
 Malaysia subscribes to International Labor Organization (ILO)
 Convention 105 which prohibits forced or compulsory labor.
 Malaysia has effective legal sanctions against such abuses, and
 forced labor does not appear to be practiced.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Malaysian judiciary is generally regarded by the public and
 the legal community as committed to the rule of law. Although
 the courts have rarely challenged legislation, they have not
 hesitated to rule against government prosecutors in specific
 cases, both'civil and criminal.
 Ordinary (non security-related) civil and criminal cases are
 tried under a fair and open judicial system derived from British
 jurisprudence. Charges must be levied against a defendant
 within 24 hours of arrest, and police must decide within 14 days
 whether to bring the case to court. Defendants have the right
 to counsel, and lawyers are able to represent clients without
 penalty to themselves. Bail is available, and strict rules of
 evidence apply in court. Defendants may appeal lower court
 decisions to the federal courts and, in criminal cases, may also
 appeal for clemency to the King or local state rulers, as
 appropriate.
 Persons detained under security legislation and for certain
 classes of crimes, if their cases are brought to trial, are
 tried under special procedures contained in the Essential
 (Security Cases) Regulations of 1975. The accused is allowed
 counsel but does not receive a statement of the evidence; trial
 is by a single judge without a jury; and witnesses may be
 examined in the absence of the accused. Admissible evidence
 includes hearsay and secondary evidence, testimony of children
 and spouses, self-incriminating statements to police, and
 information from seized records or communications. If the
 accused is found guilty, the judge must impose the maximum
 penalty. For certain internal security crimes, including the
 possession of firearms, the mandatory sentence is death. In
 1986 at least one person, Sim Kie Chon, was executed after
 conviction under the ISA for illegal possession of firearms.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 Under the ISA, the police may enter and search without warrant
 the homes of persons suspected of threatening national security
 and confiscate evidence from them.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.
 The Constitution guarantees free speech, and in practice there
 are very few constraints on freedom of expression in
 conversations or private communications. Freedom of the press
 is similarly guaranteed but is subject to important limitations
 grounded in ownership and legislation. The Government owns all
 of the country's radio stations and two of the three television
 stations. The third television station and most of the press
 are owned by groups close to the parties of the ruling National
 Front. Furthermore, by virtue of 1984 amendments to the
 Printing and Publications Act, the Government controls licenses
 for all other publications, including imported ones. The
 general result of these facts is that the media exercise
 considerable self-censorship.
 
 
 771
 MALAYSIA
 In late September the Government banned the Asian Wall Street
 Journal for 3 months and ordered the expulsion of its two
 correspondents because it was annoyed that articles in it which
 criticized government policies and officials reflected poorly on
 the country's image. The Malaysian Supreme Court subsequently
 ruled that the Government must "show cause" before revoking a
 correspondent's work permit. On November 14, conceding a
 "procedural lapse," the Government also lifted its ban on the
 circulation of the newspaper. The distribution of selected
 issues of international publications is occasionally delayed.
 An example of the Government's influence with the press was
 shown in the general elections in August, when coverage of
 ruling coalition candidates far exceeded that given to
 opposition office seekers. Still, one opposition party scored
 impressive gains.
 Two other statutes which constrain the media are the Sedition
 Act and the Official Secrets Act. The former prohibits public
 comment on "sensitive" issues such as the constitutionally
 guaranteed special position of the Malays in society. In 1985
 the Government brought charges under the Sedition Act against a
 prominent human rights activist and lawyer for his comments on
 the aforementioned Sim Kie Chon case. The lawyer had queried
 why Sim, a Chinese, was sentenced to death under the Internal
 Security Act for possession of a firearm while a former cabinet
 Minister, a Malay, was given a lesser sentence. In January
 1986, the lawyer was acquitted by the high court.
 In 1985 and 1986 one local and one'foreign reporter were fined
 under the Official Secrets Act (OSA) for possession of
 government documents. On October 27, the Government introduced
 in Parliament amendments to the OSA which would modify the
 existing 1972 Act by stipulating a mandatory minimum sentence of
 1 year's imprisonment, and by broadening the definition of
 "Official Secret" to include virtually all government
 information. On December 2, in response to widespread public
 criticism, the Government modified its controversial draft
 amendments to limit the prima facie definition of "Official
 Secret" to Cabinet and Cabinet Committee documents, State
 Executive Council documents, and those of its committees, and
 documents concerning National Security, Defense, and
 International Relations. On December 5, the lower house of
 Parliament passed the Government's controversial amendments to
 the 1972 Act.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Malaysian Constitution guarantees the rights of freedom of
 peaceful assembly and association. It also grants the
 Government extensive powers to limit those rights by legislation
 in the interest of security and public order. After the 1969
 communal riots, the Government passed laws greatly limiting the
 right to public assembly by large groups, particularly political
 rallies. This ban remained in force during the August election
 campaign, but in fact large assemblies were held by both
 government and opposition parties, often under the rubric of
 "ceramah" (ostensibly a religious teaching/discussion session).
 The controversial Societies Act empowers the Government in
 effect to prohibit societies which comment unfavorably on
 political or public issues; this Act is used by the Government
 to set limits to lobbying by groups, although not to suppress
 such activity entirely. Under the Universities and University
 College Act, student associations must be approved by the
 Ministry of Education and are prohibited from engaging in
 political activity.
 
 
 772
 MALAYSIA
 The Trade Unions Act of 1959 and the Industrial Relations Act of
 1967 govern the rights of workers to engage in trade union
 activity. The latter specifically prohibits any person from
 interfering with, restraining, or coercing a worker in the
 exercise of the right to form or participate in the lawful
 activities of a trade union. Unions may bargain collectively
 with an employer, form federations, and join international labor
 organizations. The law restricts an individual union to a
 single industry and gives the registrar of trade unions wide
 authority to determine the definition of an "industry.  Some
 union leaders claim this authority has been used to restrict the
 activities of certain unions. Federations of trade unions
 similarly may cover only a single trade or industry. As a
 result, only a federation for public servants and one for
 teachers have been registered. The Malaysian Trade Union
 Congress (MTUC), the main labor federation in the country, is
 registered under the Societies Act. MTUC leaders have in the
 past requested, unsuccessfully, registration as a federation
 under the Trade Unions Act.
 Although labor standards in free trade zones are the same as
 those in the rest of Malaysia, union leaders and some workers
 have been unhappy about their inability to obtain recognition
 for an electronics component industry union. Most electronics
 component factories are located in the free trade zones and are
 foreign owned. (Conditions of employment and wages in
 electronics component manufacturing plants are among the best in
 Malaysia's manufacturing sector.) When the plants were first
 established in the early 1970's, an attempt was made by the
 Electrical Industry Workers' Union (EIWU)to organize the
 workers. The registrar determined that the EIWU could not
 organize workers in electronics component factories because they
 were not part of the electrical product manufacturing industry.
 A second legal challenge was mounted by the Malaysian Trades
 Union Congress (MTUC) in the early 1980's when it attempted to
 organize electronics component workers. The High Court
 determined early in 1985 that the MTUC did not have standing in
 this matter as it does not represent electronic workers and is
 not a trade union. It is widely believed among union leaders
 that the Government, as an inducement to electronics component
 manufacturers in the free trade zones, has offered such firms
 varying periods of union-free operation.
 Labor legislation grants the right to strike to Malaysian
 workers. However, union leaders complain that 1980 amendments
 to the two acts noted above interfere with their right to strike
 and to bargain collectively without fear of coercion. Specific
 union charges about government interference with the right to
 strike and bargain collectively are contained in a complaint
 presented to the ILO by the MTUC. The MTUC alleged that the
 amendments to the Trade Union Ordinance of 1959 and the
 Industrial Relations Act of 1967, passed in May 1980, contain
 prohibitive and oppressive antiunion provisions which erode the
 basic rights of workers, restrict union activities, and result
 in government and employer interference in the internal
 administration of unions. In 1983 the ILO urged the Malaysian
 Government to amend these laws further to bring them into
 conformity with the Convention on the Right to Organize and-to
 Bargain Collectively. Many union leaders also believe that
 creation of the Industrial Court to handle industrial disputes
 weakened their legal position because at the same time they lost
 the right, in almost all cases, to take contract disputes to the
 regular courts. In 1985 the MTUC and the Malaysian Employers
 Federation conducted a joint seminar on Malaysia's labor laws in
 
 
 773
 MALAYSIA
 which Ministry of Labor personnel participated. This process is
 continuing but has yet to produce any results.
 As of December 1985, there were 369 individual unions in
 Malaysia with just over 600,000 members (10 percent of the labor
 force). Union membership declined during 1986, partly as a
 result of the replacement of union-organized plantation workers
 with unorganized contract labor and partly because a recession
 has slowed economic activity, especially in the most organized
 sectors of the economy. Unions are not permitted to engage in
 political activity, but individual trade union leaders have
 served in the Parliament, and individual union members may
 belong to political parties. Malaysian trade unions are free to
 associate with the appropriate International Trade Secretariats,
 and a number of Malaysian labor leaders play major roles in
 international labor affairs. The President of the National
 Union of Plantation Workers, P.P. Narayanan, is also president
 of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 c. Freedom of Religion.
 The official religion of Malaysia is Islam, and Malays are
 legally bound in some civil matters, e.g., family relations and
 diet, by Islamic religious laws administered by state rather
 than by federal authorities. An Islamic religious establishment
 is supported by government funds, and it is government policy to
 "infuse Islamic values" into the administration of Malaysia.
 However, the Constitution guarantees freedom of religion for
 all, and the Government has refused to accede to demands for the
 imposition of Islamic religious law in cases involving
 non-Muslims. Religious minorities, which include large Hindu,
 Buddhist, Sikh, and Christian communities, freely practice their
 faith without interference by the Government. Conversion is
 permitted, but proselytizing of Muslims is strongly discouraged.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Persons wishing to travel abroad must obtain passports, which
 have been denied in a few cases on what the Government terms
 security grounds. Travel to the Soviet Union and several
 Eastern bloc countries is restricted, although in 1985 controls
 on travel to some East European countries were reduced.
 Traditionally tight controls on travel of Malaysian Chinese to
 China also have been relaxed recently. They can visit China for
 medical treatment, to see relatives, to tour (if over age 60),
 and for business trips when they can satisfy the Government that
 such commerce will be of "net benefit" to Malaysia.
 Malaysia has provided first asylum to more than 200,000
 Vietnamese refugees since 1975. It has cooperated closely with
 international organizations and resettlement countries in
 facilitating the eventual movement of the refugees to those
 countries. Malaysia itself has resettled over 8,000 Khmer
 Muslim refugees, but has not accepted non-Muslim refugees for
 permanent settlement. At least 40,000 Philippine Muslims have
 permanently settled in Sabah since 1975, although they have not
 been offered citizenship.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Malaysia's parliamentary system is based on the British model.
 The Prime Minister and Cabinet are responsible to Parliament.
 Elections must be held at least once every 5 years. The
 
 
 774
 MALAYSIA
 opposition concedes that elections to date have been free and
 fair; votes are cast secretly and recorded accurately. Through
 the United Malays National Organization, Malays dominate the
 ruling national front coalition of ethnic-based parties which
 has controlled Parliament since independence. -Malays fill most
 important cabinet posts. The National Front parties benefit
 substantially from gerrymandered electoral districts.  In August
 1986, the National Front won 148 of the 177 seats in the House
 of Representatives. Although the opposition regularly
 criticizes the Government in Parliament, it rarely succeeds in
 influencing legislation.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Malaysian Government strongly resents criticism of its human
 rights record. In March ex-Foreign Minister Rithauddeen told
 Parliament that there was a "conspiracy" by Amnesty
 International to make Malaysia a target for pressure on human
 rights matters. He rejected any such criticism, maintaining it
 was the duty of all citizens to "counter efforts by outsiders to
 tarnish the country's image." He also struck out at local
 groups he claimed were "collaborating" with Amnesty
 International in its attention to Malaysia. While there are no
 organizations in Malaysia which deal specifically with the
 protection of human rights, a number of groups, including the
 Bar Council, a Muslim youth movement, and various public
 interest organizations, devote some time to the subject. The
 Government tolerates their activities but rarely responds to
 their inquiries or occasional press statements. The Government
 generally does not take an active role in international forums
 on human rights issues, maintaining that such issues are
 internal matters. However, the Prime Minister in particular has
 been very outspoken in criticism of South Africa for its
 apartheid policy.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Government implements on an extensive scale programs
 designed to boost the economic position of the ethnic Malay
 majority which remains poorer, on average, than other Malaysians
 despite its political dominance. As a result of these
 government programs and policies, non-Malay opportunities for
 education, government employment, and ownership of new
 homesteads are. limited.
 There are no restrictions on the political rights of Malaysian
 women. Government policy supports their full and equal
 participation in government, education, and the work force. The
 position of women in society is conditioned by the cultural and
 religious traditions of the country's major ethnic groups. With
 a general resurgence of Islamic piety among Malays, Malay women
 have in recent years tended toward close conformity with Koranic
 stipulations on women's roles.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 Various government regulations are designed to ensure that
 workers enjoy acceptable conditions of work. Work hours are not
 to exceed 8 hours per day or 48 hours per week, and vacation
 time must be granted. Factories maintain minimum standards of
 industrial safety and insurance plans. Employers must provide
 
 
 775
 MALAYSIA
 severance pay and contribute to the Employers Provident Fund
 (EPF) which provides retirement benefits. Some 90 percent of
 workers are covered by either the EPF or the government's own
 pension plan for public servants. However, there is no minimum
 wage except in a few minor occupations. In addition, many
 nonmanual employees paid over US$380 per month are not covered
 by the Employment Act.
 Plantation work is increasingly being done by contract workers,
 many of whom may be illegal immigrants from Indonesia. Working
 conditions for contract workers are significantly below those of
 direct hire plantation workers, many of whom belong to the
 National Union of Plantation Workers. Additionally, many of the
 immigrant workers, particularly the illegal ones, may not have
 access to Malaysia's excellent judicial labor system.
 Employment of children is covered by the Children and Young
 Persons (Employment) Act of 1966, which stipulates that no child
 under age 14 may be engaged in any employment except light work
 in a family enterprise, in public entertainment, work performed
 by the Government in a school or training institution, or
 employment as an approved apprentice. It is illegal for
 children to work more than 6 hours per day, more than 6 days per
 week, or at night.
