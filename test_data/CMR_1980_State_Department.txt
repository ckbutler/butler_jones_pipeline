 CAMEROON
 Cameroon, though splintered ethnically and diverse regionally,
 culturally, and religiously, has enjoyed political stability
 and economic and social progress under the same civilian
 leadership since 1960. Cameroon's complex domestic character,
 along with its unique history as the only African state to
 fuse former British and French territories, has made national
 unity one of the country's principal objectives. The former
 Federation of East and West Cameroon was made a unitary
 republic under the 1972 constitution. The government has
 pursued the development of national institutions, such as a
 single national political party (UNC) and a unified labor
 movement (UNTC). During the 1960's the government suppressed
 an ethnically based, ideologically motivated guerrilla chal-
 lenge. In recent years, as the threat of internal sub-
 version has receded, political detainees have been released
 and restrictions on civil liberties have been relaxed.
 Nevertheless, Cameroon remains an authoritarian state, where
 civil and political liberties are circumscribed. At the same
 time, the government has been relatively successful in utilizing
 the country's resources together with foreign assistance to
 meet the basic economic and social needs of the people.
 1.    Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Torture is proscribed implicitly in the constitution and
 specifically in criminal procedure, which makes evidence
 obtained by torture inadmissible. Nevertheless, there have
 been credible reports of harsh treatment during police
 interrogation and imprisonment in the past. Some police
 officers have been charged and found guilty of practicing
 torture.
 b.    Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Cameroonian penal code prohibits public servants from
 using force against any person except under extraordinary
 circumstances (e.g., a person resisting arrest). Government
 officials claim this prohibition is strictly enforced and
 cite several examples of prison sentences given policemen
 who physically abused others.   Amnesty International has
 reported allegations of harsh prison conditions and ill
 treatment of detainees, and there are reports of unnecessary
 use of force by the police, ranging in severity from bullying
 to brutality. Such incidents allegedly take place during
 checks for identification or other papers, apprehension of
 suspects, or interrogation at police stations.
 The Cameroonian government acknowledges that prison condi-
 tions are inadequate, and attributes this to a lack of
 resources, rather than deliberate neglect.  The diet and
 health care offered at the overcrowded prisons is minimal at
 best. Most prisoners supplement their diet with food brought
 *by family or friends during visiting hours. All prisoners
 are treated the same regardless of class, race, religion or
 
 
 37
 sex. Persons under "administrative detention" (i.e., poli-
 tical prisoners) are kept in special camps or prisons.
 The only kind of physical punishment permitted under the
 penal code is the death sentence, used for serious crimes
 such as homicide and armed robbery.   Other punishment is in
 the form of prison sentences. There are no summary executions
 in Cameroon.
 c. Disappearances
 Those detained adminstratively for reasons of national
 security, as described below, are not processed according to
 normal civil procedures. Amnesty International claims that
 some such prisoners have been held for many years. No such
 detention is known to have resulted in "permanent disappear-
 ance' or death.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 A person arrested on suspicion of committing an offense may
 not be held for more than 48 hours without a court order.
 After an investigating magistrate has determined that the
 case should be brought to trial and has issued a warrant to
 this effect, there is no limitation on how long the person
 charged may be held in "preventive detention" pending trial.
 Release on bail is infrequent. Nonetheless, the equivalent
 of habeas corpus does exist in Cameroon under Article 16 of
 the High Court Law of 1972 and has proven effective in
 seeking legal remedy for persons detained illegally. The
 main difference in the application of habeas corpus between
 the Anglophone and Francophone provinces of Cameroon is in
 procedure. Persons may be held in "administrative detention"
 under legislation pertaining to subversion. Such detention
 by local authorities is intially for three months, renewable
 for three more, and may be extended up to an additional 12
 months by the minister of territorial administration.
 Recent reports indicate that approximately 40 political
 prisoners were released in 1980, leaving less than 15 known
 prisoners in administrative detention.
 Under a state of emergency, local authorities also may order
 detention for up to one week of persons judged "dangerous to
 public security." The minister of territorial administration
 may order detention of such persons for up to two months,
 and the order may be renewed without limitation. A state of
 emergency is in effect in a limited area of west-central
 Cameroon where the insurgency in the 1960's took place,
 apparently as a precautionary measure which would permit
 the government to act swiftly in case of perceived threats
 to public security there.
 e.    Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Cameroonian law guarantees criminal defendants a fair public
 trial, including legal representation at state expense if
 necessary. Lawyers have unrestricted private access to
 defendants, and both lawyers and defendants are made fully
 aware of the charges and evidence. Legal representation is
 automatic in cases for which the death penalty or imprison-
 ment for ten years or more may be imposed. In practice,
 legal representation may not be available in cases involving
 lesser sentences because defendants are not aware of their
 rights or because they are unable to afford counsel.
 
 
 Courts are independent of executive and military control.
 Civilians can be tried by military courts if they are
 charged with committing a crime jointly with a soldier. Due
 process for military courts is the same as for civilian
 courts. Verdicts of both civil and military courts may be
 appealed to the appeals court at the provincial level and to
 the supreme court at the national level. With regard to
 judicial proceedings, the law does not distinguish betwen
 those accused of ordinary crimes and those accused of
 political offenses.
 f.     Invasion of the Home
 The Cameroonian penal code prohibits the entry into another's
 residence without permission unless such entry is made
 pursuant to a court order or under a state of emergency. In
 practice, indiscriminate and unauthorized entry into homes
 occurs during occasional police sweeps of the poorer residen-
 tial districts in searches for criminals. The authorities
 also at times demolish slum homes without adequate notice in
 land improvement projects.
 2.      Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 The government's main development priority in the current
 five-year development plan (1975-81) is agriculture and
 rural development. The plan is designed to increase small
 farm production, raise rural incomes, and meet the nation's
 food requirements through domestic production. Cameroon is
 already virtually self-sufficient in food production. The
 plan calls for substantial investment in agriculture,
 education, health care and other social services (which
 combined, accounted for nearly one-third of the 1979-80
 budget), as well as in transportation infrastructure.
 The right to own property is guaranteed in the consti-
 tution. Rural land tenure is recognized as long as farmers
 continue to use the land. Much of the country's cash crops,
 which account for about 55 percent of export earnings, is
 produced on small family farms. Rural farmers, many of whom
 are women, make up over 75 percent of the total population,
 estimated at 8 million in 1979. The population growth
 rate is estimated at 2.3 percent. The national active
 labor force participation rate is.48 percent, representing
 3.8 million people between ages 16-64.  Eighty percent of
 this labor force (3 million) is in rural areas engaged in
 farming or small business.
 In 1978 the government reported a 6 percent national unem-
 ployment rate with 12.2 percent in the urban areas and 4.3
 percent in the rural areas. Urban unemployment is high
 because of increased migration from the countryside to the
 cities. Both World Bank and International Monetary Fund
 studies indicate that these unemployment statistics are
 underestimated and state that more needs to be done to
 stimulate employment. In recognition of this, the government
 has planned to create 60,430 new jobs in the semi-public and
 private sectors and 28,713 in government institutions.
 Considering the recent real economic growth rate of over
 five percent per year, the expansion of employment has not
 kept pace with either the growth of the labor force or the
 intensified national investment of over 20 percent-of GNP
 in agriculture, infrastructure, and industry.
 
 
 39
 While per capita gross domestic production is estimated
 at $410 (1979), distribution of income is highly skewed in
 favor of urban dwellers. Taxation, however, also falls more
 heavily on the urban wage earner.
 Government programs are meeting the need for health services,
 education, and shelter with varying degrees of success. The
 government has begun planning to provide a program of
 national health care. The government subsidizes public
 education through the university level, although a fee is
 required at all levels. Literacy is estimated at 30
 percent (lower for women). The government, however, is
 trying to raise the literacy level through various educational
 programs. The government also has initiated a program to
 deal with increasing housing needs, particularly in the
 rapidly growing urban areas.
 Meeting basic needs of the rural population is made diffi-
 cult by the diversity of ethnic groups and ecological
 zones, and the inadequate transportation network which
 isolates rural areas from the urban centers. The rate of
 economic growth in the urban areas is far outstripping
 that of the rural areas, and there is a significant differ-
 ence between government services in the two areas. The
 current economic plan allocates upwards of 30 percent of
 its investment budget to the rural areas. With this allo-
 cation of domestic resources, supplemented by sizeable
 foreign developmental assistance, and with Teasonably
 effective implementation of its development programs, the
 government has made progress in meeting basic economic needs.
 Cameroonian women are active in the modern sector, although
 not proportionately in the upper levels of administration or
 the professions. In the urban areas they-are active in
 individual and commercial activities. Women in the tradi-
 tional sector have a fair amount of economic independence.
 Land, though usually inherited by males, is apportioned to
 women generously by the family heads; in the north, Fulani
 women can inherit land outright. The restraints on women's
 activities outside the family are more severe in the Muslim
 dominated areas. Although government programs largely
 have avoided the sensitive question of women's participation
 in economic development in the Muslim north, the national
 female labor force participation rate is 42 percent.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The Cameroonian constitution guarantees freedom of speech,
 press, religion, and assembly. In practice there are
 restrictions on these freedoms. Except for independent
 weeklies in Douala, Victoria and Bamenda, the Cameroonian
 press and radio is government-owned and controlled. Criti-
 cism of the government is discouraged and the media are
 used to support government programs and institutions. All
 media elements are inhibited by occasional intimidation and
 harassment of journalists and the possibility of censorship.
 As a result, self-censorship is widely practiced, parti-
 cularly with regard to political criticism. Opposition
 viewpoints are not ventilated in the media. The media have
 criticized inefficiency and unresponsiveness by the police
 and utility services. No newspapers have been closed but
 journalists who have not exercised restraint have in the
 past been banished to provincial assignments. Some foreign
 magazines have been seized by the government when articles
 have touched on areas considered sensitive.
 
 
 40
 Professors and students at the university are strongly
 discouraged from writing or publishing works critical of the
 Cameroonian government and its policies. The works of
 certain authors critical of the government may not be
 imported or read in Cameroon.
 The government encourages the expression and development
 of ethnic traditions within the framework of overall Cam-
 eroonian unity. Cameroon is a nation of Muslims, Christians
 and Animists. Followers of these religious beliefs do not
 appear to enjoy any particular advantage or suffer disadvan-
 tage. Freedom of religion is protected by law and generally
 respected in practice. Sects not accepting temporal authority,
 however, such as the Jehovah's Witnesses, are proscribed.
 The practice of witchcraft and sorcery is considered a crime
 under Cameroonian law and persons have been convicted and
 jailed under this statute.
 Freedom of assembly and association is guaranteed in law
 but in practice is restricted. The Cameroonian penal code
 prohibits public meetings, demonstrations or processions
 without prior government approval. Labor unions are incorpo-
 rated into the government-controlled single national party.
 They participate in a government regulated negotiation process
 but strikes are illegal. Business groups are organized under
 the government-sponsored chamber of commerce. Other interest
 groups have not been effectively organized.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within the country is not restricted by
 law. In practice, however, the police frequently stop
 travellers for checks of identity, tax receipts, and the
 like. These checks sometimes develop into incidents of
 petty harassment and bullying.
 Exit visas are required to leave the country. Often they are
 available only after long bureaucratic delays. In some
 cases, these delays may represent attempts by the government
 to discourage or even prevent departure. Women must have
 permission of their husbands to leave the country. Came-
 roonians leaving the country must deposit sums sufficient
 to buy a one-way return air ticket for repatriation should
 they become stranded abroad. There are no restrictions on
 the right of voluntary repatriation.
 Cameroon has offered safe-haven to many refugees from
 Equatorial Guinea (EG) in past years and from Chad during
 1980. Most of the 30,000 refugees from Equatorial Guinea
 returned to that country by late 1979 after the change of
 government there in mid-1979 and the declaration of general
 amnesty for all exiles. Following the outbreak of civil war
 in Chad (in Ndjamena) in March 1980, about 100,000 Chadian
 refugees fled to Northern Cameroon, where the government has
 taken an active role in providing food and shelter with the
 help of foreign donors. In general these refugees have been
 well treated. They are restricted to certain areas in
 Northern Cameroon. The Chadians are expected to be given
 safe-haven there until conditions permit their return to
 Chad. The government has given asylum in the past to some
 Equatorial Guinea political figures.
 
 
 c.   Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Cameroon is a one-party state. Opposition parties are not
 tolerated and all political activities must take place under
 the umbrella of the Cameroon National Union (UNC). Citizens
 who accept these constraints can participate in political
 activity at the local level. This often involves competition
 among factions representing different political points of
 view. For the majority of the Cameroonians who are not party
 activists, however, the political process involves little
 element of choice.
 Women enjoy equal rights with men under the constitution and
 are politically active in the UNC. An affiliated group, the
 Organization of UNC Women, was created in 1966 to develop
 and implement social and educational programs aimed at
 emancipating Cameroonian women. Women are members of the
 Central Committee, comprise ten percent of the Deputies in
 the National Assembly, and hold cabinet positions as well as
 other senior positions in the government. Their participa-
 tion and role in the government and society are growing.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Amnesty International regularly requests information
 from the Cameroonian government on the status of persons
 allegedly detained without formal charges and without public
 trial. At first, the government recognized no obligation to
 respond to .queries about specific individuals. It has
 recently stated that each such case is thoroughly investigated.
 Amnesty International states that the only responses received
 from the Cameroonian government have been denials that the
 individuals in question are detained in Cameroon. In 1980,
 Amnesty International requested the government to permit the
 inspection of prisons by an independent humanitarian organi-
 zation. The request was not acknowledged and no action is
 believed to have been taken by the government. President
 Ahidjo in February 1980 responded indirectly to Amnesty
 International's criticism by rejecting the charge that human
 rights are not respected in Cameroon. There are no organi-
 zations within Cameroon which observe, report or contest
 human rights violations. Cameroon does not participate in
 any regional human rights bodies.
