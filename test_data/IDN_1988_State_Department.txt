 INDONESIA
 President Soeharto and the Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI)--
 which include the military services and the police--are the
 preeminent institutions in Indonesia's "New Order" Government
 which came to power in the mid-1960's after an abortive coup
 backed by the Communist party. Since 1967 executive authority
 has been exercised by retired and active-duty military
 officers and civilian technocrats under President Soeharto's
 leadership. The partly elected, partly appointed Parliament
 (DPR) does not usually draft laws on its own but considers
 laws proposed by government departments and agencies. The
 People's Consultative Assembly (MPR)--consisting of the DPR's
 500 members and another 500 appointed members--meets every 5
 years to approve guidelines for government policy and elect
 the President and the Vice President. On March 11, the MPR
 reelected President Soeharto to a new 5-year term, with
 retired Lt. Gen. Sudharmono as Vice President.
 In reaction to the Sukarno era's legacy of political and
 economic turmoil, the Government's priorities have been
 stability, economic development, and social equity. It has
 achieved positive results in each area, particularly in the
 rural sector. Nevertheless, despite substantial increases in
 real incomes in the past 20 years, the country is still poor,
 with wide disparities in wealth and in access to the benefits
 of material progress.
 With a population of around 180 million, Indonesia is the
 fifth most populous country in the world and the largest in
 Southeast Asia. Since independence, Indonesian governments
 have sought to create a unique national identity and to
 accommodate a diversity of ethnic, linguistic, religious, and
 social groups, while assuring internal security and cohesion.
 The centerpiece of the Soeharto Government's political program
 is "Pancasila," an eclectic state ideology consisting of five
 broad principles: belief in one supreme god, belief in a just
 and civilized humanity, Indonesian national unity, democracy,
 and social justice. Under the Pancasila rubric, the Government
 successfully encourages religions to coexist in peace and
 emphasizes the major role of consultation and consensus in
 decisionmaking.
 The armed forces, including the police, number about 380,000.
 A little less than half of these serve in the army, which
 historically has been primarily concerned with internal
 security. Under a "dual function" concept, many military
 officers have been seconded to Parliament and the civilian
 bureaucracy at all government levels.
 Indonesia's mixed economy involves the State in nearly all
 sectors. The collapse in world oil prices has encouraged
 major government efforts at deregulation, aimed primarily at
 stimulating growth in nonoil sectors. Combined with the 1986
 devaluation, the deregulation measures helped increase nonoil
 exports by over 30 percent in 1987. Similar nonoil export
 growth is anticipated for 1988. Real gross domestic product
 (GDP) growth in 1988 is expected to exceed 4 percent. These
 growth rates, while significant in a period of economic
 adjustment, are not sufficient to provide employment for all
 of the 2 million new entrants in the labor market each year.
 Corruption and influence peddling are endemic and restrict
 growth and economic opportunity.

 INDONESIA
 In 1988 the Government continued efforts to consolidate
 control, promote development, and improve living standards in
 East Timor. The army continued to maintain a substantial
 presence in the province, where periodic skirmishes with
 Fretilin guerrillas produced an unknown but apparently small
 number of casualties on both sides. Restrictions remained on
 travel to and from East Timor, although the Government appeared
 to be easing access by diplomats and other foreigners through
 escorted visits and in December announced the end of special
 travel requirements as of January 1, 1989. In Irian Jaya,
 sporadic fighting occurred between the army and the
 Organization for a Free Papua (OPM) rebels, whose isolated
 acts of violence target Irianese villagers and settlers from
 elsewhere in Indonesia as well as government forces.
 Indonesia's human rights performance in 1988 was mixed.
 Positive aspects included the release from detention of
 several East Timorese suspected of supporting Fretilin; legal
 action against several police officials charged with
 mistreating prisoners; the considerable freedom of religion
 (although the Government has dealt harshly with efforts by
 Muslim activists to organize opposition); the significant role
 played by minority groups and women in government, the
 military, and the professions; and a modest opening of the
 political process that resulted from the debate over the
 President's choice ef vice President. Negative aspects
 included the abuse of prisoners, at times resulting in death;
 a policy of "shooting to wound" suspected criminals resisting
 arrest in Medan; significant restrictions on freedoms of the
 press and movement; and pervasive political controls which
 ensure continued military domination of the governmental
 system.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were no substantiated reports of killings for political
 reasons in 1988; one human rights group called on the
 Government to investigate the deaths in February of two
 members of the civilian militia in East Timor.
 b. Disappearance
 No exact figures or confirmed identities are available on the
 small number of disappearances widely believed to occur each
 year. Security forces, often acting outside the legal
 constraints of the Criminal Code, are thought to be
 responsible for disappearances that have occurred in East
 Timor and Irian Jaya. Reports are often unspecific and
 difficult to- confirm, although the Government has responded to
 inquiries about missing persons submitted through
 international organizations. Regularized International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)"access to prisons in East
 Timor and elsewhere in Indonesia has helped to locate some
 missing persons in past years.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There are frequent credible reports of torture and
 mistreatment of criminal suspects, detainees, and prisoners,
 
 
 810
 INDONESIA
 although the Government publicly condemns such practices. In
 one instance, eight convicts died of apparent dehydration and
 suffocation at sea while under transport from one facility to
 another. Standard police treatment of detainees, even in
 minor incidents, often results in physical abuse. Officials
 publicly acknowledged and condemned the existence of police
 brutality and unacceptable prison conditions. There have been
 allegations of torture of suspected Fretilin sympathizers in
 East Timor by security forces. The policy of "shooting to
 wound" suspected criminals allegedly attempting to elude
 arrest continued in Medan throughout 1988. The local press
 reported several such incidents each month, in which police
 shot suspects in the legs, often repeatedly. Many cases
 resulted in crippling injuries. The Government disciplined
 several police and prison officials charged with killing or
 mistreating prisoners or with making illegal arrests. Some of
 those were tried and sentenced to jail terms.
 There has been no repetition of the large-scale killing of
 suspected criminals that took place from 1982 to 1985, but
 reports circulated occasionally of unexplained killings. In a
 recent instance of a "mysterious killing," i.e., summary
 execution of suspected criminals, the Government said criminal
 gangs were responsible.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Criminal Procedures Code (KUHAP) contains protections
 against arbitrary arrest and detention and specifies the right
 of prisoners to legal counsel and notification of family,
 although in practice these safeguards frequently are not
 respected. KUHAP provisions are honored more often in urban
 areas than in small towns or remote provinces. Security
 agencies arrest and detain persons to intimidate and otherwise
 to inhibit activities they do not wish to take place. While
 such actions may have little or no legal basis, there are no
 legal mechanisms for redress.
 Emergency security provisions have permitted exceptions to
 KUHAP procedures under which arrests and detentions could be
 made by the Command for the Restoration of Security and Order
 (KOPKAMTIB). A Presidential Decree in September dissolved
 KOPKAMTIB and established in its place the Agency for
 Coordination of Assistance for the Consolidation of National
 Security (BAKORSTANAS). Indonesian law did not provide for
 the right to judicial review of the legality of detention by
 KOPKAMTIB. It had wide, special powers to detain and
 interrogate persons thought to threaten national security,
 particularly cases of suspected subversion, sabotage,
 secession, or corruption. Arrests or detentions under these
 powers were rarely if ever made public. Persons arrested and
 held under KOPKAMTIB provisions had no legal right to
 protection or legal aid. At year's end, tne precise functions
 and powers of BAKORSTANAS had yet to be clearly defined.
 Precise numbers of persons detained without trial were
 unavailable. Human rights observers estimate there may be as
 many as 500 throughout Indonesia.
 Some East Timorese exiled from their villages several years
 ago were permitted to return to their original homes in 1988,
 reflecting a general easing of conditions there. However,
 several hundred persons were reportedly detained in East Timor
 for unspecified security reasons just before President
 Suharto's November visit there. Almost all were released
 
 
 811
 INDONESIA
 within a week after the visit, but around 10 were still being
 held as of mid-December.
 With regard to forced or compulsory labor, see Section 6.c.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 As government employees, judges in Indonesia come under the
 jurisdiction of the executive branch, which limits the
 independence of the judiciary. The courts and the Ministry of
 Justice have wide authority to suspend or disbar attorneys
 from practicing their profession for behavior deemed
 inappropriate inside and outside the court. Corruption
 permeates the Indonesian legal system. In criminal
 proceedings, defendants are frequently able to buy their way
 out of prosecution. In civil cases, court decisions are
 sometimes influenced by the payment of bribes. The Government
 from time to time has taken action against particularly
 flagrant offenders, but by and large these abuses continue
 unchecked.
 In cases involving what could be defined broadly as "security"
 issues, particularly instances in which persons are being
 tried under the Subversion Provisions of 1963, the accused are
 rarely, if ever, found innocent. In all such security-related
 cases, it is widely believed the Government will ensure
 conviction irrespective of the evidence presented in court.
 Such convictions are aided by the court's ability to restrict
 evidence presented by the defense. Although the Government
 does-not provide data on the number of persons serving
 sentences for subversion, one reliable estimate suggests there
 may be several hundred. Several subversion trials took place
 in 1988, most related to alleged Muslim extremist activity.
 Human rights observers alleged that in many cases the accused
 were imprisoned for peaceful protest activities. They were
 always found guilty.
 As a result of increasing crime rates and shortages of
 judicial personnel, trials are frequently delayed. A
 three-judge panel conducts trials, hears evidence, decides
 guilt or innocence, and assesses punishment. Although the
 right of appeal is not absolute, it is observed in most
 cases. Initial judgments are rarely reversed, although
 sentences are occasionally reduced. Most court sessions are
 open to the public, and most defendants, if they can pay, have
 access to counsel. If destitute, defendants can find private
 legal help such as that provided by the Legal Aid Institute,
 or the court, at its discretion, can provide a limited amount
 of aid for those unable to afford legal assistance. The State
 must assure-legal assistance in capital cases.
 Two former Indonesian army and Communist Party members,
 implicated in the death of two generals during the 1965 coup
 attempt and sentenced to death in the late 1960's, were
 executed in mid-October. Foreign human rights groups have
 questioned the fairness of the trial procedures used to
 convict these and other individuals.
 The Minister of Justice announced in May that the well-known
 human rights activist Adnan Buyung Nasution could resume the
 law practice from which he had been suspended for I year for
 alleged contempt of court. Over government objections, a
 district court in July asserted its jurisdiction over the
 lawyer's suit against the Minister for abuse of power and
 illegality in ordering the suspension. The court's decision
 
 
 812
 INDONESIA
 upheld the Minister's right to cite Buyung with contempt in
 January 1986 under a law not issued until March that year and
 ordered Buyung to pay nominal court costs. He is expected to
 appeal.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Judicial warrants for searches are required except for cases
 involving suspected subversion, economic crimes, and
 corruption. However, forced or surreptitious entry by
 security agencies reportedly occurs periodically, especially.
 in East Timor. Security agencies also conduct surveillance of
 persons and residences for the purpose of intimidation. Both
 local and international telephone calls are believed to be
 monitored selectively, without legal restraint, by government
 security agencies. Special government approval is no longer
 needed for telephone communication between Jakarta and East
 Timor, since the installation in 1988 of four direct telephone
 lines. Although correspondence generally is not monitored,
 letter mail to and from East Timor is subject to official
 scrutiny.
 The importation of foreign publications and video tapes, which
 must be reviewed by government censors, requires a permit.
 Some foreign newspapers and magazines, especially from
 Australia, cannot be imported. The importation of Communist
 publications is prohibited.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There are significant restrictions on freedom of speech and
 press. Parliament has helped create a body of law delimiting
 the rights of individuals and of the Government, although in
 the absence of implementing regulations or effective judicial
 review different government agencies frequently interpret
 these laws as they choose. Agencies thus have considerable
 discretionary authority. Governmental concern about public
 statements or publications which could be perceived as
 critical of the Government is a major factor inhibiting the
 exercise of free speech and press. Direct criticism of top
 leaders and their relatives is not tolerated. Opposition
 groups are generally free to meet privately and formulate
 views, but they have trouble disseminating their views
 publicly because of media reluctance to risk official
 disapproval or because of informal government instructions not
 to publish the opinions of or news about prominent opposition
 figures. The Minister of Religion announced that Muslim
 preachers would not be censored or controlled during the
 widely attended-annual Muslim holidays. There were no
 reported arrests of Muslim preachers on that occasion, as has
 happened in past years.
 While the general lack of specific, clear guidelines on what
 is permissible has generated a significant degree of
 self-censorship both in public speaking and in the press, the
 limits of government tolerance are regularly tested. School
 faculties sometimes refrain from producing materials,
 including dissertations, which they believe might provoke
 government displeasure. Publishers also are unwilling to
 accept manuscripts dealing with controversial issues. Foreign
 books critical of the Government or dealing with sensitive
 topics, such as human rights, similarly are avoided by
 
 
 813
 INDONESIA
 importers. Foreign periodicals, readily available in
 Indonesia, are often censored by their private importers in
 order to avoid government confiscation of the materials. With
 few exceptions this self-censorship is thorough and effectively
 responds to government concerns. In 1988 there appeared to be
 some relaxation of censorship of foreign newspapers.
 The press is largely privately owned. While the Government
 supports the idea of a "free" press, it expects the media to
 be "responsible" by supporting national economic development
 goals and domestic stability. The Government closely monitors
 the media for material it finds unacceptable. In such
 instances, editors or journalists routinely receive oral
 instructions from government officials about news which cannot
 be reported. Articles and editorials do address and debate
 sensitive issues, however, and journalists sometimes have wide
 latitude within the vaguely defined limitations.
 Chinese-language publications, with the exception of one
 officially sanctioned daily newspaper, can neither be imported
 nor produced domestically. Chinese characters are routinely
 blotted out of foreign news photos and advertising. No laws
 prohibit speaking Chinese, but the Government lays heavy
 stress on the learning and use of the national language,
 Bahasa Indonesia.
 In 1988 the press received several written and oral warnings
 against providing employment to or publishing the writings of
 persons suspected of past Communist ties and downplaying the
 role of the banned Indonesian Communist Party in the 1965
 coup. The Attorney General banned several books, including
 some written or edited by Pramoedya Ananta Toer, on the
 grounds that they contained Communist teachings and ideology.
 The Attorney General also announced the Government's intention
 to investigate Pramoedya's publisher. Suara Pembaruan, the
 successor to a Jakarta daily newspaper banned in 1986,
 operated throughout the year subject to the same limitations
 as other publications.
 The Government continued to regulate closely resident and
 visiting foreign correspondents. Some were denied entry,
 although several U.S. journalists who previously had
 difficulty were admitted. Several Australian journalists were
 permitted to visit, continuing a trend of increased access by
 journalists from that country since they were banned in 1986.
 The Government occasionally reminds resident journalists of
 its prerogative to deny requests for visa extensions, although
 it did not deny any such requests in 1988.
 There is a single government-operated television network,
 although television signals from neighboring countries are
 received in some parts of Indonesia. A private company
 started a cable television service in Jakarta. The more than
 400 private radio stations may only use government-provided
 news programs.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Regional and national meetings of virtually all organizations,
 including labor organizations, must have government
 permission, and local jurisdictions often require prior
 approval for smaller, local gatherings as well. While such
 approval is usually granted, local authorities can and do
 sometimes withhold permission. Student gatherings are
 frequently the target of such disapprovals. In East Timor the
 
 
 814
 INDONESIA
 local government usually authorizes public assembly for social
 and ceremonial events and, as long as there is no perceived
 security risk, grants political parties permission to meet
 publicly.
 The 1985 "Social Organizations" (or "Ormas") Law requires all
 organizations, including recognized religions and
 associations, to adhere to the Pancasila state ideology. This
 provision is widely understood as prohibiting groups which
 advocate making Indonesia an Islamic state. The law empowers
 the Government to disband any organization it believes to be
 acting against the tenets of Pancasila. The Government
 disbanded two organizations in 1987, but it took no such
 actions in 1988. The law stipulates that government approval
 is required before any organization can accept funding from
 foreign donors.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.a-
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution provides for religious freedom for the four
 major religions recognized by the State--Islam, Christianity,
 Buddhism, and Hinduism. Indonesia has traditionally displayed
 a high degree of religious toleration. The Government has
 taken a very strong position against Muslim groups which
 advocate establishing an Islamic state or acknowledging only
 Islamic law, both of which are outlawed. In 1988 about a
 dozen Muslim activists were sentenced to prison terms for
 alleged subversive activities stemming from that prohibition.
 Although the Indonesian population is overwhelmingly Muslim,
 the practice and teaching of the other recognized faiths are
 respected. Many mystical and folk religions and sects also
 exist. Government leaders actually encourage some of these,
 but bannings occur periodically, affecting perhaps 20,000
 adherents. The Attorney General has said 382 cults are
 currently banned. While the Government often tolerates
 private practice of banned religions, local authorities
 occasionally harass adherents of such groups. The legal
 requirement to adhere to the governing Pancasila ideology
 extends to all religious and secular organizations.
 A 1972 letter of the Attorney General reiterated a
 Presidential Decree of 1962 banning membership in Jehovah's
 Witnesses and the Baha'i faith. Several Jehovah's Witnesses
 were reportedly arrested and their relatives put under
 surveillance. From time to time authorities harass or
 discriminate against Bahalis for their religious beliefs, and
 several have been strongly pressured to convert to Islam.
 Because the first tenet of Pancasila is belief in a supreme
 being, atheism is forbidden. Some animists in remote parts of
 Indonesia have reportedly been pressured to convert to Islam
 or Christianity in order to fulfill the requirement of belief
 in a supreme being. No legal bars forbid religious conversion
 between faiths, and conversions occur. However, proselytizing
 in heavily Islamic areas is seen as potentially disruptive and
 is discouraged.
 In many cases, foreign missionary activities are relatively
 unimpeded. In fact, they are welcomed in remoter districts,
 where government resources in fields such as education and
 health are insufficient. They make significant contributions
 in those fields in Irian Jaya, Kalimantan, and East. Timor.
 Recently, however, some foreign missionaries have faced
 
 
 815
 INDONESIA
 difficulty in renewing visas or residence permits. Normally,
 the Government does not allow foreign missionaries and other
 foreign workers to spend more than 10 years (15 in exceptional
 circumstances only) in Indonesia. Enforcement of this policy
 does not discriminate by sect or nationality. The Government
 reconfirmed its intention to reduce the numbers of foreign
 missionaries in order to encourage the employment of
 Indonesians. Foreign missionary work is subject to the
 funding stipulations of the Ormas Law discussed above.
 Official holidays include Christian, Hindu, and Buddhist, as
 well as Muslim, holy days. Indonesian Muslims, Christians,
 and Buddhists maintain active links with coreligionists inside
 and outside Indonesia. Travel to religious gatherings is
 permitted. Hajj trips to Mecca are available only through
 government-organized tours. The Government permits a set
 number of pilgrims to make the hajj annually.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are some restrictions on movement within Indonesia. The
 Government requires permits for changes of residence in
 certain areas, primarily to control the further shift of
 population from rural to urban locations. Since 1959
 noncitizen ethnic Chinese have been denied the right to run
 businesses in rural Indonesia. An estimated 2,000 noncitizen
 ethnic Chinese accepted a government offer of immigration
 amnesty which expired in September and could eventually allow
 them to obtain citizenship. The Government said the remainder
 would be tried as illegal immigrants, and it is reportedly
 making preparations for a holding camp on Sumba Island.
 Restrictions exist on movement by Indonesian and foreign
 citizens to and within East Timor and within parts of Irian
 Jaya. Since 1979 the Government has relocated many rural East
 Timorese living in the central and eastern parts of thd
 province to isolate them from Fretilin rebels and, according
 to the Government, to facilitate their access to health,
 education, and other government services. Most Timorese
 require permission to travel within the province. In some
 areas of East Timor, residents may not farm beyond their
 immediate village area and are restricted to their village
 itself during military operations in the area. Despite these
 restrictions, the Government eased access by some foreign
 observers to the province, as exemplified by an October visit
 by an Australian state chief minister, accompanying
 journalists, and former East Timor residents. In December the
 Government announced that as of January 1, 1989, special
 travel requirements would end for East Timorese traveling to
 other provinces and for Indonesians from other provinces
 traveling to East Timor.
 Former political detainees associated with the abortive 1965
 coup attempt are restricted in the exercise of their political
 rights, required to notify authorities of their movements, may
 not change their place of residence without official
 permission, and have restrictions placed on their employment.
 Members or alleged supporters of the banned Communist Party of
 Indonesia (PKI) outside Indonesia have been allowed to return
 only on a case by case basis. Government security officials
 said they were intensifying efforts to keep track of all of
 the 2.5 million former members of the PKI and some 20 million
 members of its front groups.
 
 
 816
 INDONESIA
 Officials took steps to revoke the passports of over 100
 alleged fugitives from justice charged with crimes, such as
 subversion, corruption and smuggling. In addition, the
 Government periodically restricts foreign travel of domestic
 critics and others in disfavor. Although reliable figures are
 not available, it is estimated that some 5,000 Indonesians
 currently are not permitted to leave the country. This number
 includes critics of the Government, those arrested in the
 student riots of 1974, and others. However, other critics of
 the Government are free to travel abroad, and a person banned
 at one time may be permitted to travel subsequently. Students
 do not need Government permission to go abroad to study. A
 departure tax of about $150, instituted to save foreign
 exchange, may deter some discretionary travel abroad.
 Under its refugee policy, Indonesia has given first asylum to
 over 102,000 Indochinese refugees since 1975. The Indochinese
 refugee population stood at about 2,400 at the end of 1988.
 The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Jakarta
 has documented that local government authorities pushed
 refugee boats away from Indonesian territory at least eight
 times in 1988. In one instance, one refugee was killed and
 another injured. Central government authorities have denied
 such "pushoffs" took place and reconfirmed Indonesia's policy
 of first asylum. Observers believe, however, that "pushoffs"
 continue to take place from time to time.
 Although no accurate figures are available, it is believed
 that some residents of Irian Jaya who in previous years had
 crossed into Papua New Guinea returned voluntarily across the
 border.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 tO Change Their Government
 The Government's authority is largely concentrated in the
 hands of a small group of active-duty and retired military
 officers and civilian technocrats led by President Soeharto.
 This system ensures the continued preeminence of the military
 in all fields of governmental activity. The Parliament,
 political parties, and the general public have little ability
 to influence government decisions or to change the system or
 its leadership.
 The Parliament considers laws presented to it by government
 departments and agencies but does not usually draft laws on
 its own. The Government seeks to resolve potential
 parliamentary concerns before the bills are officially
 presented. Parliament can change the text and occasionally
 intent of bills it reviews and did so in several instances in
 1988. Bills of major significance are often passed with
 little or no alteration.
 A 1975 law allows three political parties--one made up of four
 former Muslim political parties, and another of former
 nationalist and Christian parties. The third, GOLKAR, is a
 longstanding, government-sponsored organization of functional
 groups which serves a role similar to that of a political
 party. Party leaders are approved or named by the Government,
 and party activities are closely scrutinized and often guided
 by government authorities. These factors weaken the parties'
 election prospects and diminish their ability to represent
 effectively their constituents' concerns to the Government.
 Except during election campaigns, the two parties may only
 maintain nominal representatives called commissioners below
 
 
 817
 INDONESIA
 the district level. Formally, the same restriction applies to
 GOLKAR. However, this system gives GOLKAR an advantage, since
 its civil service members have constant access to small towns
 and villages because of their official duties. The Communist
 Party of Indonesia (PKI), the former Socialist Party, and a
 formerly powerful Muslim party linked with separatist
 rebellions in the late 1950's, Masyumi, are specifically
 banned. With rare exceptions, members of the first and many
 leaders of the last are not allowed to run for office or to be
 active politically. Most former PKI detainees are now
 permitted to vote.
 General elections for Parliament and for provincial and
 district assemblies are held every 5 years. GOLKAR won 73
 percent of the national vote in the last elections in 1987.
 All adult citizens, except active-duty members of the armed
 forces, convicted criminals serving prison sentences, and some
 former PKI members, are eligible to vote. Voters cast ballots
 for party lists of candidates. Voting is not mandatory, but
 strong social pressures ensure participation. Protest votes
 take the form of blank or deliberately spoiled ballots. In
 several villages in Java in 1988, voters used these means as
 well as ballots cast into unmarked ballot boxes to reject
 government-proposed candidates running unopposed for the
 position of village head.
 Under the 1985 election law, the Parliament elected in April
 1987 consists of 500 members, 400 elected by the voters and
 100 appointed by the Government from the armed forces. The
 People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) consists of Parliament
 plus 500 other members appointed by the President and by
 regional governments. The MPR, which convenes every 5 years,
 ended its most recent session in March 1988 after promulgating
 guidelines for government policy for the next 5 years and
 reelecting President Soeharto to a new 5-year term, with
 retired Lt. Gen. Sudharmono as Vice President. Although
 Sudharmono was the President's choice, there was open
 opposition to him and for the first time a competing candidate
 for the Vice Presidency. This was accompanied by modestly
 more open discussion of sensitive political issues in the
 press.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government considers outside investigations of alleged
 human rights violations to be interference in its internal
 affairs. Representatives of Amnesty International and other
 international human rights groups, for example, have been
 refused access to Indonesia. In 1988 the Government permitted
 representatives of Asia Watch to visit for the purpose of
 preparing a report on the rule of law, although Indonesian
 officials did not agree to discuss the subject with Asia
 Watch. Asia Watch's lengthy report, published in November,
 criticized what it described as -sweeping restraints on civil
 and political rights in Indonesia and East Timor." The
 Government uses its considerable powers to discourage
 meaningful human rights activities, including maintenance of
 close ties with foreign human rights organizaions.
 Under a 1985 agreement with the Government, the ICRC conducts
 regular visits to persons jailed in connection with armed
 resistance in East Timor; provides medical and food aid to
 detainees and their families; carries out medical and
 
 
 818
 INDONESIA
 nutritional surveys in vulnerable villages in East Timor;
 arranges reunification of divided families in East Timor and
 abroad (mainly Portugal); and arranges repatriation to
 Portugal of former Portuguese civil servants and their
 families in East Timor. In addition, the ICRC is permitted to
 visit prisoners convicted of participation in the 1965
 Communist-backed attempted coup. There are no indications
 that the Government has decided to allow access by the ICRC or
 any other international humanitarian group to. the numerous
 Muslim activists held prisoner in Indonesia. The Government
 has in the past provided some information on disappearances
 requested by the U.N. Human Rights Commission and by
 international humanitarian organizations.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Some Indonesian women enjoy a high degree of economic and
 social freedom. Women occupy important midlevel positions in
 the civil service, educational institutions, labor unions, the
 military, the professions, and private business. The Cabinet
 appointed in 1988 includes 2 women out of a total of 41
 positions. Although legislation guarantees women equal
 treatment, women seldom receive equal pay for equal work. In
 addition to a government-sponsored women's organization in
 which membership and participation are strongly encouraged for
 the spouses of civil servants, several voluntary, private
 groups work to advance women's legal, economic, and political
 rights. Chief among these is the Congress of Indonesian
 Women, an umbrella organization for some 55 women's groups.
 Although many people of Chinese ancestry resident in Indonesia
 have achieved marked success in business and the professions,
 strong official and informal discrimination affects many other
 ethnic Chinese. They are pressured to take Indonesian names.
 While encouraged to become citizens, some Chinese find legal
 avenues to citizenship blocked or are discouraged by the
 time-consuming and expensive task of obtaining citizenship
 documents. Chinese who have been unable to obtain Indonesian
 citizenship can lose their right to residence should they be
 abroad for a period of more than 3 months. Government
 regulations prohibit the operation of all-Chinese schools and
 institutions of higher learning, teaching in Chinese
 languages, the formation of exclusively Chinese cultural
 groups or trade associations, and the use of Chinese
 characters on signboards or in publications. However, these
 restrictions are not always observed in practice, and social
 and religious groups which are, in effect, all-Chinese are not
 proscribed and do exist.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Indonesian workers in the private sector are organized in a
 single national body--the All Indonesia Workers Union (SPSI).
 The SPSI consists of approximately 10,220 local unions and has
 a membership of about 3 million. There is pressure on its
 officials to join the government-sponsored GOLKAR political
 organization and GOLKAR members dominate the leadership. The
 total work force is about 70 million. The SPSI is the only
 union or federation that meets the requirements for legal
 recognition. These requirements are representation in at
 least 20 of the 27 provinces, branch offices in at least 100
 districts, and 1,000 local units at plant level.
 
 
 819
 INDONESIA
 Nevertheless, a number of other groups and professional
 organizations func-ion as quasi-trade unions and operate
 openly. Some are sanctioned by the Government and others are
 not. Unions draw up their own constitutions and rules and
 elect their representatives. Regulations ensure the integrity
 of the process. The Government views unions as an essential
 component of its development plans, with the role of
 increasing worker participation in development, maintaining
 industrial peace, and raising member consciousness and
 understanding of Pancasila as it applies to industrial
 relations. The SPSI performs these functions and has had some
 success in negotiating collective bargaining agreements.
 The SPSI publicly addresses all matters affecting the work
 force, though criticisms, evaluations, and observations are
 formulated within the framework of Pancasila industrial
 relations, which emphasize consultation among the parties and
 avoidance of confrontation.
 Government approval is needed for meetings held outside SPSI
 headquarters. Permission is routinely given to SPSI and to
 other nonregistered organizations overtly functioning as
 unions. The SPSI represents workers before the International
 Labor organization (ILO). The Ormas Law discussed above
 governs the activities of SPSI and the quasi-unions. Although
 the SPSI maintains extensive international contacts, it is not
 affiliated with any international trade union organization,
 except the ASEAN Trade Union Council. Some of the trade
 unions not legally recognized by the Government, however, are
 associated with international trade union bodies.
 All workers organized in labor unions have a legal right to
 strike with the exception of employees in the 21 industries
 designated by a Presidential Decree in 1963 as vital to the
 national interest. These industries employ about 170,000
 workers. A union must notify the local manpower office that
 its attempts to resolve disagreements through negotiations
 have failed and that the union will go on strike. No approval
 is required. While there have been some exceptions in
 practice, civil servants and employees of state enterprises do
 not have the right to join unions or to strike. They must
 belong to the Indonesian Corps of Civil Servants (KORPRI)--a
 nonunion association.
 By government regulation, a separate and compulsory dispute
 resolution and appeals process exists for civil servants and
 employees in "vital" industries to protect their interests in
 the event of a labor dispute. In the private sector,
 excluding the industries deemed vital by the 1963 Decree,
 arbitration is not compulsory. In the event of an industrial
 dispute, the parties submit their case to an administrative
 tribunal on which they have representatives. The parties
 themselves decide the means of resolving the dispute.
 Indonesia has ratified ILO Convention No. 98 on the Right to
 Organize and Collective Bargaining, but has not ratified
 Convention No. 87 on Freedom of Association and Protection of
 the Right to Organize.
 The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial
 Organizations (AFL-CIO) has expressed its belief that
 Indonesian workers are denied the right of association, denied
 the right to bargain collectively, and that the Government
 controls the private sector and insists on too broad a
 
 
 820
 INDONESIA
 definition of "state employee." The ILO's Committee on
 Freedom of Association has under consideration a 1987
 complaint by the International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions which alleges that Indonesian legislation restricts
 trade union rights, contrary to the. principles of freedom of
 association and the provisions of ILO Convention No. 98. The
 Committee requested, at its November 1988 session, that the
 Government take steps to amend its legislation in some of
 these areas and to provide additional information on others.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 The right to bargain collectively -is guaranteed by law.
 Collective bargaining agreements are vigorously endorsed by
 the Department of Manpower and viewed as hallmarks of
 Pancasila industrial relations. They are the principal
 instruments for achieving a sense of coresponsibility for
 industrial relations. The overwhelming majority of the SPSI's
 collective bargaining agreements are negotiated and concluded
 bilaterally with the employers.
 The law protects collective bargaining agreements and the
 negotiating process by imposing obligations on both the union
 and the employer. Both parties are obligated to execute
 agreements upon request and to bargain in good faith. Once an
 employer is notified that 25 employees have joined the union,
 it is under a statutory obligation to bargain, and the union
 has an absolute right to conclude a labor agreement. As a
 transitional stage to encourage union organization, employment
 regulations require that every company employing 25 or more
 employees issue a company regulation covering terms-and
 conditions of employment. There are no laws which prevent
 collective bargaining from taking place in export processing
 zones, and some of the companies in such zones have SPSI
 units, but there are no collective bargaining agreements in
 the zones.
 Regulations expressly forbid employers from prejudging or
 harassing any employee because of union membership, and
 employees are urged to report harassment to the Government.
 The SPSI claims, nevertheless, that its members and those
 wishing to form SPSI units are the objects- of employer
 discrimination. Companies are requited to provide office
 space for local union headquarters; to allow union officers
 time off from the job to conduct union business; and to grant
 liberal leave, consistent with maintaining normal operations
 of the firm, for training and attending regional meetings of
 the SPSI.
 Labor disputes are resolved by a system of regional and
 central tripartite committees. These bodies hear the
 contentions of all parties and issue executable, enforceable
 decisions. The parties can elect binding bipartite
 arbitration in lieu of the tripartite settlement mechanism.
 The Minister of Manpower can nullify decisions of the central
 committees on grounds of legality or national interest.
 Decisions of the regional or central committees and decisions
 of private arbitrators can be enforced through the courts.
 Although technically the Minister of Manpower's decision can
 be appealed to the courts, in practice it is rarely done.
 Workers can organize without restriction in a private
 enterprise even if it is designated vital by the Government.
 
 
 821
 INDONESIA
 If the State has a partial interest, the enterprise is
 considered to be in the public service domain, but this does
 not limit organizing. There are a significant number of
 government/private joint ventures which have labor unions and
 which bargain collectively.
 The 1987 ICFTU complaint alleged that Indonesian regulations
 permit only the SPSI to register as a legitimate trade union,
 thereby conflicting with the ILO convention to encourage and
 promote collective bargaining, and that laws in place do not
 satisfy the antiunion discrimination requirement of ILO
 Convention No. 98. Several organizations carry out trade
 union functions independent of the SPSI. Regulations
 promulgated in October 1986, which address ICFTU allegations
 of union discrimination, were not cited in the complaint. The
 ICFTU complaint also alleged that public servants and
 employees involved in public undertakings or in enterprises in
 which the State participates must belong to KORPRI; that
 KORPRI does not and cannot perform trade union functions; and
 that compulsory membership of these employees in KORPRI
 negates the right to organize freely.
 By law, civil servants and employees of state enterprises must
 belong to KORPRI, an association chaired by the Minister of
 Home Affairs. KORPRI has autonomy and mechanisms for
 protecting its members. The KORPRI employment relations
 bureau, for example, represents employees in the settlement of
 disputes. There is also an appeal level for dispute
 settlement called the employees advisory board. KORPRI
 defends its ability to protect workers by noting that its
 members generally enjoy a higher standard of living than do
 workers in the private sector. KORPRI members in state
 enterprises are permitted to negotiate agreements on working
 conditions. These are usually in the form of company
 regulations rather than collective agreements.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is strictly prohibited and in practice it does
 not exist. Indonesia has agreed to be bound by ILO Convention
 No. 29 concerning forced labor. No reports charge the use of
 forced labor in Indonesia in modern times.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 On February 7, 1987, the Indonesian Department of Manpower
 issued new regulations on child labor, which note that
 Indonesia's child protection laws have not been properly
 carried out. The new regulations also acknowledge a class of
 children who have to work to support their families and
 themselves. Such employment must be with the permission. of
 the childs parents or guardians. Dangerous work is
 specifically forbidden. For children under age 14, the
 working day is limited to 4 hours, night work is forbidden,
 and wages are to be paid at the prevailing rate. Employers
 with youths under age 14 on the payroll are required to
 cooperate with public authorities to assure that the children
 have an opportunity to get an elementary education within the
 framework of the compulsory schooling law. Enforcement of the
 child labor laws has improved substantially by the new
 regulations. Employers are now required to report in detail
 on every child employed by name, age, date, time of
 employment, and line of work. The Manpower Department is to
 conduct periodic inspections, and sanctions for violations are
 specified. Nonetheless, child labor and inadequate protection
 
 
 822
 IND-NESrA
 for working children continue to be serious problems in
 Indonesia, despite government efforts to strengthen the law in
 the area. The Government is on record as actively supporting
 programs and private organizations that promote and publicize
 child welfare and protection and has a liaison person who
 maintains contact with such groups. With the 1987
 regulations, labor inspectors at the district level have the
 mandate to inspect factories to ensure enforcement.
 Inspectors have been tasked with checking closely cigarette
 companies and agricultural sites where violations have
 occurred in the past. The Government's approach to date,
 however, has been mainly to persuade and attempt to teach
 employers rather than to penalize.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The law establishes 7-hour workdays and 40-hour workweeks,
 with 1/2 hour of rest for each 4 hours of work. In the
 absence of a national minimum wage, minimum wages are
 established for each region and for sectors and subsectors
 within the region by regional wage councils working under the
 supervision of the National Wages Council. This is a
 quadripartite body consisting of representatives from labor,
 management, government, and the universities. It establishes
 a basic physical need for each province--a monetary amount
 enabling a single worker or family to meet basic needs of
 nutrition, clothing, and shelter. The annually calculated
 figure reflects changes in the local Consumer Price Index
 (CPI) for food, clothing, housing, transportation, and other
 family needs. Factors considered by the quadripartite bodies
 in setting minimum wage rates include changes in the local
 CPI, skill level of workers, local supply of manpower, and the
 ability of firms to pay. Many minimum wage rates fall short
 of providing the decent standard of living the Government
 envisages. The minimum wage in the capital of Jakarta ranges
 between the equivalent of $ 0.94 and $1.23 per day, depending
 on the industry.
 Wage levels do not account for total labor costs. An
 extensive body of labor law and ministerial regulation provide
 workers with: vacation pay, maternity leave, public holidays,
 generous overtime and sick leave pay, guaranteed severance and
 service pay, paid leave for personal and family occasions, and
 protection from delay in wage payments. In addition, workers
 receive transportation allowances, food allowances in cash or
 kind or both, and holiday bonuses. Workers in more modern
 facilities often receive health benefits, social security
 contributions, and free meals.
 While there is no legal differentiation between workers in
 free export zones and those who work elsewhere, companies in
 free export zones can obtain specific exemptions from
 applicable regulations upon request. One such company has
 obtained permission from the Department of Manpower to deviate
 from the normal working hours. Observance of the minimum wage
 figure varies from sector to sector and from region to region,
 and there are no reliable figures on overall compliance.
 GDP per capita in 1986 was only $453. Figures from 1983, the
 latest available, show that 26 percent of urban dwellers and
 44 percent of rural population live below the absolute poverty
 level as defined by the World Bank.
 An extensive body of law and ministerial regulations provide
 for minimum standards of industrial health and safety, an area
 
 
 823
 INDONESIA
 still in the early stages of development that has received
 greatly increased emphasis by the Department of Manpower over
 the last 2 years. Safety and health programs in the country's
 100,500 larger, registered industries in the nonoil sector are
 hampered by a limited number of qualified inspectors (less
 than 1,200); the slowness with which the firms established the
 required plant safety committees (only about 4,500 as of March
 1987); and the need for more and better training of government
 inspectors and plant safety personnel.
 In January the Manpower Department launched a month-long
 national health and safety campaign whose primary goal was to
 sensitize Ministry staff, firms, and workers to the importance
 of carrying out effective safety and health programs in the
 workplace. The Department called for a more coordinated
 effort between Government, private institutions, and the labor
 force in developing programs which address safety and health
 concerns in the workplace and it requested the Association of
 Indonesian Technical Inspectors to increase educational and
 traininq programs. The Department also entered into a
 contract with a private foundation-to assist in developing
 safety and health programs which can be put into place in
 offices, factories, workshops, and shopping centers throughout
 the country.
