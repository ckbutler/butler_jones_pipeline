 GUYANA
 Since Guyana became independent in 1966, the People's
 National Congress (PNC) Party led by Prime Minister,
 now Executive President, Forbes Burnham, has dominated
 the nation's political life. The PNC draws its principal
 support from Guyanese of African descent (approximately
 40 percent of the population). It has declared itself
 a socialist party, operating on Marxist-Leninist
 principles, with the goal of making Guyana a nonaligned
 socialist state.
 Guyanese of East Indian origin, over 50 percent of the
 total population, traditionally have backed the main
 opposition party, the People's Progressive Party (PPP),
 headed by former Premier Cheddi Jagan. The PPP is
 an orthodox, Moscow-aligned communist party. Support
 for the PPP appears to have weakened significantly
 over the past several years. Both major racial groups
 have supported their respective parties more from
 ethnic loyalties than from political conviction.
 Both parties have sought to exploit racial animosities
 for political advantage.
 The opposition Working People's Alliance (WPA), a
 small multi-ethnic, radical leftist group which formally
 became a political party in mid-1979, also professes
 a commitment to building a socialist country. The
 WPA had made moderate gains in membership over the
 past few years, but the death of one of its leaders,
 Dr. Walter Rodney, under suspicious circumstances
 in a 1980 bomb explosion, has seriously retarded
 its growth. In addition to these parties, there
 exist a handful of small, generally moderate or conservative
 political groupings. Guyana's new constitution,
 promulgated in October 1980, gives extensive powers
 to the executive president.
 Then-Prime Minister Burnham in 1974 declared the
 paramountcy of the PNC over all other institutions,
 political or otherwise, in Guyana. During 1981 there
 has been a continued blurring of the distinction
 between the ruling party and the government. The
 PNC has access to unaudited public funds and government
 property. It has complete control of the government
 media and uses patronage extensively in the 80 percent
 of the economy under government control.
 The Guyanese human rights environment continued to
 deteriorate in 1981. As the Guyanese economic, social
 and political environment has continued to worsen,
 the government has increasingly responded with stern
 measures to control its citizens. The government
 has also reacted strongly at times to perceived threats
 from an opposition which increasingly despairs of
 ever taking power legally.

 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 The Guyanese constitution prohibits torture, but
 there have been credible reports that prisoners have
 been beaten with rubber truncheons, kicked and burned
 with cigarette butts during detention and interrogation.
 The Guyana Human Rights Association (GHRA) has publicly
 cited two specific examples of police violence against
 prisoners resulting, in one case, in a broken arm,
 and, in another case, in "severely impaired" eyesight.
 Five individuals charged with plotting to overthrow
 the government in 1979 have had preliminary inquiries
 against them dismissed on two separate occasions
 by a magistrate who held that their signed confessions,
 which had apparently been obtained through police
 beatings and coercion, were unconvincing evidence.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The constitution prohibits such treatment or punishment.
 However, critics have charged that Guyanese prisons
 and police station lock-ups, as well as the treatment
 of prisoners and detainees, fail to meet internationally
 accepted standards. Although prisons are overcrowded
 and conditions are spartan, the government has attempted
 to provide prisoners with an adequate diet and medical
 care in spite of its critical economic problems.
 There has been an apparent increase in police use
 of lethal force~during the past year. "The GHRA in
 January 1981 listed 19 instances during the preceding
 18 months in which police-shot and killed suspects;
 no inquiries have been held regarding the killings.
 Guyana retains the death penalty, but the last execution
 took place in 1968. Since then, all those who have
 beewsentenced to death have had their sentence commuted.
 c. Disappearances
 There havebeen no reports of persons having been
 abductedr secretly arrested or held in clandestine
 detention by official or quasi-offical security forces
 during 1981.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The constitution provides that no person may be deprived
 of personal liberty except as authorized by law.
 Guyanese lawyers have increasingly complained that
 because of intentional and unintentional administrative
 delays, the right of habeas corpus has often been dis-
 regarded in Guyana. Persons associated with opposition
 political groups have frequently been detained under
 the national security act for short periods of time
 without charge. The act permits detention without
 formal charge for up to three months. There have also
 been credible reports that hundreds were detained
 without charge during the PNC biennial party congress in
 August 1981 and released, with little or no explanation
 or. justification, at the conclusion of the congress.
 
 
 452
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Guyanese constitution guarantees the right to a
 fair trial by a court of law. Although the independence
 of the judiciary is generally respected in ordinary
 civil and criminal cases, that independence is at
 times overridden when a case has political implications.
 When five individuals charged with treason were released
 by a magistrate, who ruled that the director of public
 prosecution had not established a prima facie case
 against the defendents, the case was twice reopened
 on orders of the latter official.
 More than a few instances lend credibility to opposition-
 party allegations of questionable judicial independence.
 For example, a WPA leader acquitted of arson charges
 was nevertheless prevented by government authorities
 from leaving the country; whereas a senior government
 official's son, who was charged with wounding with
 intent to commit grievous bodily harm, was released
 on $167 bail and allowed to depart the country.
 In another case, a judge fined an opposition party
 lawyer and Jamaican citizen $1,667 for not declaring,
 on departure from Guyana, two gift vouchers valued
 at some $40. In fact, the vouchers had been legally
 acquired for export purposes, and the state counsel
 acknowledged that the lawyer had innocently made
 a false declaration -- the vouchers were in a sealed
 envelope which he had been asked to carry.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The security act allows the police, without a warrant,
 to search for and seize illegal weapons, ammunition
 and explosives. There continue to be numerous reports
 of searches of homes carried out in violation of
 constitutional guarantees. Police have conducted
 searches of the homes and offices of suspected opponents
 of the government, allegedly looking for weapons, and
 have seized what the government has termed "subversive"
 literature.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The past year has seen a continued erosion of press
 freedom in Guyana. The ruling party has further
 strengthened its control over government media, venting
 opposition views in most cases only when such views
 coincide with or advance government policies.
 Non-government newspapers and newssheets, however, still
 appear in reduced format, circulation and frequency
 of publication. The government continues to deny
 opposition publications import licenses to acquire
 adequate supplies of newsprint, claiming shortage of
 foreign exchange for the proposed purchases. However,
 the government also refused without formal explanation
 to grant the independent "Catholic Standard" permission
 to accept a gift of bond paper from the Papal Nuncio
 in Trinidad and Tobago, although no foreign exchange
 would have been involved in the transaction. As a
 result of the government's newsprint import restrictions,
 the "Standard" was forced to cease publication temporarily
 on Easter Sunday. The government has since authorized
 the sale of limited amounts of newsprint from government
 
 
 453
 stocks to both the "Standard" and the "Mirror," the
 media organ of the PPP. Both newspapers publish
 four-page weekly tabloids. At the same time, the
 government-owned "Sunday Chronicle" has increased
 its size by 16 pages to its current 48-page format.
 The ruling party, the military and police, the Trade
 Union Congress and public corporations continue to
 publish newspapers without apparent newsprint limitations.
 Outside sources of information remain available on
 a limited basis to Guyanese. The anti-PNC "Caribbean
 Contact" continues to be imported from Barbados, but
 deliveries are limited and irregular. VOA, BBC,
 Radio Antilles and regional English-language radio
 stations, along with various shortwave broadcasts,
 can be heard in Guyana. The BBC World Service news is
 rebroadcast twice daily over one of the two government
 radio stations. "Time,* "Newsweek" and a few other
 Western magazines are available in limited quantity
 and at a high cost. Publications from North Korea,
 the People's Republic of China and other socialist
 and communist countries are readily available and
 often free.
 The government maintains wire-sevice contracts with
 Associated Press and Inter-Press service. These
 facilities have been put under sole control of the
 newly-formed Guyana News Agency, which reviews, selects
 and edits news items and features for distribution
 to the government-owned newspapers and radio stations.
 News Is frequently distorted or suppressed. There
 is no television in Guyana. The government has claimed
 that this arrangement conforms with a "new information
 order" in which "the media are indissolubly tied
 up with the social and economic objectives within
 which they operate." The government has taken a
 strong stand in support of the proposed new world
 information order and hosted a nonaligned conference
 on this issue in May 1981.
 Although freedom of assembly Is guaranteed in the
 Guyanese constitution, this freedom is limited in
 practice. Pro-government organizations and groups
 experience no difficulties in receiving police per-
 mission for public meetings and rallies. Although
 opposition groups theoretically enjoy the same rights,
 they are occasionally refused permission to hold
 similar events or granted authorization on short
 notice. The government generally permits opposition
 groups to use sound vans to advertise public meetings.
 The government has consistently refused to allow
 any opposition marches, whereas government and PNC
 marches are routinely approved.
 The government resorted to violence to break up an
 unauthorized but peaceful opposition march in September
 1981. Government agents continue to monitor which
 individuals attend opposition rallies, and many Guyanese
 fear government reprisals for attending these functions.
 Members of opposition groups and of non-political
 groups and associations have been subjected to frequent
 harassment for criticism of the government. They
 often experience increased difficulty in obtaining
 tax clearances for overseas travel and foreign exchange
 
 
 454
 permits, suffer loss of employment, frequent searches
 of homes, protracted court preceedings and excessive
 searches at the airport.
 Academic freedoms have also suffered over the past
 year. Four University of Guyana professors, for
 example, were threatened with disciplinary action,
 including possible dismissal, for comments included
 in their annual departmental reports. Three of the
 professors had referred to the June 1980 bomb death
 of WPA activist Walter Rodney as an "assassination."
 The fourth professor had criticized the government's
 control of and intrusion into university programs.
 There also have been numerous credible allegations that
 government agents attend classes of anti-government
 professors and report to government officials on
 classroom comments and proceedings.
 Trade union freedoms have been further eroded over the
 past year. The national trade union body, the Guyana
 Trade Union Congress (TUC), has for all intents and
 purposes been completely subordinated to the ruling party.
 There have been credible allegations of government
 meddling in individual union elections to ensure
 that pro-government officers are selected. Unions
 which have attempted to pursue a politically independent
 path have been subjected to membership raids, personal
 attacks on union leaders and government foot-dragging
 on outstanding industrial disputes. Collective bargaining
 has virtually disappeared in Guyana as the government
 increasingly avoids substantive negotations and instead
 simply informs the TUC and individual unions of government
 decisions. The government reserves the right to
 term virtually any strike "political" and therefore
 subject to "political" responses by the government.
 Workers justifiably fear government reprisals for
 participation in strike action.
 Freedom of religion is enshrined in the Guyanese
 constitution and generally respected. There is no
 official state religion, and the government exercises
 no apparent discrimination against local religious
 groups. During the past year, the government has
 intervened to pressure the head of the Guyanese Anglican
 Church to back down on disciplinary action taken
 against a PNC activist priest who had been found
 to have violated his priestly vows. On occasion,
 the Guyanese government has sharply criticized the
 Guyanese Catholic Church for anti-government statements.
 Both the PNC and the PPP have attempted, with varying
 degrees of success, to affiliate and subordinate
 religious bodies to political parties.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Except for some isolated Amerindian areas protected
 by the government, there is freedom to move about the
 country. Opponents of the government have been stopped
 on highways by security forces and subjected to searches
 and harassment. The government continues to prohibit
 certain opposition members from travelling abroad
 and subjects many critics of the government to unreasonable
 searches and delays at the airport. Persons who
 are not involved in opposition politics are generally
 permitted to emigrate and travel. Tourist and business
 
 
 455
 travel abroad by Guyanese is hampered by the nation's
 strict foreign exchange laws and by the difficulties
 many experience in meeting foreign visa requirements.
 Despite these problems, Guyanese continue to emigrate
 in large numbers. Political opponents of the government
 have not been denied re-entry into Guyana.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 By law, all citizens are eligible to participate
 in the political process, and citizenship may not
 be denied on political grounds. In fact, participation
 in opposition political groups has led to reprisals
 by the government. These reprisals have included
 dismissal from employment, interruption of supplies
 to businessmen, attacks in the official press, police
 harassment, transfers to remote sections of the country
 and denial of earned promotions and benefits.
 Events over the past several years, especially the
 controversial 1978 constitutional referendum and
 December 1980 general elections, have caused many
 Guyanese to opt out of the political process. The
 vast majority do not profess allegiance to any of the
 existing political parties. Although the Indo-Guyanese
 constitute the majority of Guyana's population, the
 overwhelming majority of all senior governmental posts,
 public service positions, ruling party membership
 and military and police are occupied by Afro-Guyanese.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Foreign observers have been allowed to look into alleged
 human rights violations in Guyana. The government
 has charged that human rights groups from other than
 Third World countries employ much harsher human rights
 criteria on Third World nations than on developed
 nations.
 The Guyana Human Rights Association (GERA), formally
 incorporated in October 1979 and termed "anti-government'
 in the state-controlled media, periodically issues
 statements denouncing specific allegations of human
 rights violations in Guyana. The GHRA occasionally
 has met with government officials to discuss perceived
 human rights problems in the country. The GERA in
 June 1981 coordinated a visit to Guyana by the executive
 secretary of the Commission on International Affairs
 of the World Council of Churches (WCC) and the head
 of the WCC human rights office for Latin America.
 The WCC submitted to the United Nations a complaint
 against the Guyana government for alleged human
 rights violations.
 Amnesty International has not received a response
 to its request to the Guyana government for an independent
 inquiry into the death of WPA leader Dr. Walter Rodney
 in 1980, nor a response concerning allegations about
 the circumstances of the killing of a WPA activist
 by the police earlier that year.
 Four dissident Guyanese trade unions in 1980 submitted
 a complaint to the International Labor Organization
 (ILO) about government non-implementation of several
 
 89-510 0 - 82 - 30
 
 
 456
 public sector collective agreements and various alleged
 anti-union measures by the Guyana government. The
 government vigorously defended its actions, and in
 January 1981 the ILO committee on freedom of association
 accepted in large part the government's explanations
 and arguments.
 The government has continued to exhibit an abiding
 interest in human rights problems in southern Africa.
 Early in 1981 the government expelled from Guyana
 a British cricketer who had previously competed in
 sporting events in South Africa, in alleged contra-
 vention of the Commonwealth countries' 1977 Gleneagles
 agreement. The government has also, in coordination
 with the nonaligned movement, sponsored a five-day
 forum to discuss southern Africa. With the exception
 of criticism of human rights violations in southern
 Africa, the government has not been particularly
 active or vocal in international efforts relating
 to the promotion of human rights.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 A per capita gross national product of $700, according
 to the World Bank, ranks Guyana among the poorest
 countries of the Latin American/Caribbean region.
 More than 50 percent of the Guyanese people live
 in conditions of poverty, although the lot of the
 poor relative to other classes is better than in
 many other developing countries.
 During recent years, Guyana's economy has experienced
 stagnant or negative growth rates and balance of
 payments deficits. Faced with an increasingly negative
 level of net international reserves (minus $152 million
 as of July 1981), the government further restricted
 imports during 1981. This caused an increasing number
 of consumer goods to disappear, and shortages of
 spare parts and equipment have continued to affect
 adversely the nation's productive capability. Price
 controls on selected items such as flour, cooking
 oil and some agricultural products have contributed
 to shortages and, consequently, to a thriving black
 market.
 Because of a faulty distribution system, rural areas
 have suffered more from these shortages than have
 urban areas. Frequent and lengthy electrical outages,
 caused by equipment breakdowns, oil shortages and
 personnel inadequacies in the state-owned electricity
 company, continued to affect production and the general
 quality of life.
 The poor performance of most of the state-run cor-
 porations has forced the government to continue relying
 heavily upon foreign assistance to carry out an ambitious
 investment program, largely aimed at diversifying the
 economy and, to a lesser extent, raising health and
 educational standards. Facing the same problems
 as the rest of the economy, compounded by government
 favoritism toward the public sector, the small private
 sector has generally stagnated.
 The government states that its oft-repeated objectives
 of housing, clothing and feeding the nation take
 precedence over traditional political rights. It has
 
 
 457
 had some success in meeting these goals despite the
 deteriorating economic situation. The government has
 provided some subsidized housing but considerbly less
 than the national requirements. Political favoritism
 has also affected the allocation of housing. Guyana
 continues to emphasize self-sufficiency in food pro-
 duction. Although cases of moderate to severe mal-
 nutrition exist, particularly in rural areas, most
 of the population has access to sufficient food.
 Life expectancy at birth is 68 years. Health care
 is provided virtually free to the consumer, but its
 increasingly poor quality has driven even lower class
 patients to private facilities. As a consequence
 of continued losses of skilled personnel, due to
 emigration, the system is heavily dependent on foreign
 doctors. Health care suffers from a a grave lack
 of qualified personnel, serious drug and equipment
 shortages, overcrowded and unsanitary facilities
 and insufficient health-related education. Much
 of the country lacks adequate supplies of potable
 water.
 The most recent figure on adult literacy dates from
 1970, when the rate was 91.3 percent. The primary
 school enrollment ratio is estimated at 99 percent.
 Bducation through the university level is free, but
 there are severe shortages in material and qualified
 teachers. The overall quality of education continues
 to decline. Although the government spends large
 sums annually to send students abroad for training,
 the selection process frequently is biased in favor
 of PNC supportersi even so, many of those sent abroad
 fail to return to Guyana. Opponents of the regime,
 pointing as evidence to the sudden transfers of school
 directors and teachers suspected of links to the
 opposition, have charged that the ruling party and
 the government seek to politicize the education process.
