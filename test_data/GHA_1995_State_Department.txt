 GHANA
 Ghana continues its transition from a single-party, authoritarian system to a con-
 stitutional democracy. Flight Lieutenant (ret.) Jerry John Rawlings has ruled
 Ghana for 15 years. He became the first President of the Fourth Republic following
 controversial elections in 1992. This ended 11 years of authoritarian rule under
 Rawlings and his Provisional National Defense Council (PNDC), which had seized
 power from an elected government in 1981. While acknowledging irregularities,
 international monitors accepted the validity of the 1992 presidential election results.
 Four opposition parties, however, claimed massive fraud in the election and subse-
 quently boycotted the December 1992 parliamentary elections, leaving the Presi-
 dent's coalition in full control of Parliament and the Government. The Constitution
 calls for a system of checks and balances, with an executive branch headed by the
 President, a unicameral Parliament, an independent judiciary, and several autono-
 mous commissions, such as the Commission or Human Rights and Administrative
 Justice (CHRAJ).
 Several security organizations report to various government departments. The po-
 lice, under the jurisdiction of an eight-member Police Council, are responsible for
 maintaining law and order. The Bureau of National Investigations (BNI) handles
 cases considered critical to state security. It is an independent department that an-
 swers directly to the executive branch. Credible allegations continue of police in-
 volvement in human rights abuses, especially in areas remote from the capital. Al-
 though the security apparatus is controlled by and responsive to the Government,
 monitoring, supervision, and education of the police in particular remain poor.
 After years of economic mismanagement, Ghana is trying to put its economy back
 on a sustainable growth track. The economy remains highly dependent on agri-
 culture, with about 45 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) derived from this
 sector. Gold, cocoa, and timber are traditional sources of export earnings. The Gov-
 ernment has announced its intention to privatize numerous state-owned enterprises,
 but progress has been slow to date. The nontraditional export sector is growing but
 still makes up a very small proportion of the overall economy. Weak performance
 in the agricultural sector in 1994 resulted in real GDP growth of 3.8 percent, barely
 ahead of annual population growth of about 3 percent.
 Progress in respect for human rights was mixed, after several years in which the
 situation had unquestionably been improving. The small but independent press,
 human rights monitoring groups, and opposition parties were vigorous and out-
 spoken in criticizing various aspects of government policy. Even the government-
 owned media, which reach by far the largest audience and have long been silent
 about government policy, felt sufficiently confident to criticize individual agencies
 and departments. Nevertheless, doubts remain as to the Government's willingness
 to permit free and independent broadcast journalism. With the release of journalist
 Gershon Dompreh in February after 8 years in prison for possession of classified
 
 
 government documents, there remain no further known political prisoners or detain-
 ees.
 Police were implicated in the beatings of criminal suspects; at least one prisoner
 died in custody, almost certainly as a result of severe beatings inflicted by guards.
 Abuses stemming from pretrial detentions continue, and prison conditions remain
 harsh. Although the Government, through its CHRAJ, instituted programs aimed at
 educating the police and military to respect constitutionally guaranteed rights, there
 is no independent framework to review or scrutinize the security forces' actions.
 Human rights abuses, such as beatings and detention without charge, still go unre-
 ported, although individual awareness of constitutionally guaranteed rights is in-
 creasing, along with government and independent press reporting of such incidents.
 However, traditional practices result in considerable discrimination and abuse of
 women, with violence against women a particular problem.
 In the year's most disturbing development, on May 11 unknown persons fired
 upon peaceful demonstrators in the process of dispersing, killing four persons. At
 year's end, it was still unclear who had been ultimately responsible for arming the
 counter-protestors, but there were credible accusations that the Minister for Youth
 and Sports was responsible. However, the Government failed to establish an inde-
 pendent commission to investigate the incident, thereby staining its human rights
 record.
 In contrast, the Government supported its high-profile CHRAJ in its investiga-
 tions and mediation of cases. Although the Commission has the authority to arbi-
 trate individual cases, it has no enforcement powers. It has, however, been active
 in educating public officials and community leaders and in critically examining:
 charges of corruption against high-ranking government officials; the Governments
 performance in prison administration and prison conditions; and illegal government
 confiscations of property.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were two reported deaths of
 suspects in police custody. In January the government press reported in consider-
 able detail that police had arrested a 35-year-old man from Tetrem in the Ashanti
 region for stealing cassava. He attempted to escape but was recaptured and severely
 beaten with batons by policemen. He was not hospitalized for 4 days and died short-
 ly thereafter. His autopsy revealed extensive beatings. The CHRAJ reports that the
 offending officers have been suspended from service and are currently awaiting
 trial.
 In June the press reported another death of a suspect in police custody. In this
 case, police discovered a 22-year-old man in New Tafo, Eastern region hanged in his
 cell. Based upon reported evidence, the police appear to have been innocent of
 wrongdoing. The police insisted that the death was a suicide, but the deceased's par-
 ents claimed that a self-performed hanging was impossible in this cell and that au-
 thorities had buried his body too hastily. As detailed in the government press, an
 investigation by the Special Police Command exonerated the police, stating that a
 post mortem investigation confirmed death by hanging and that the body in fact had
 en released to the family.
 The government press reported in September that a suspect in Kade was shot and
 killed by police while in custody, despite the fact that he had been granted bail and
 was to have been released 2 months previously. According to the press, the family
 requested an inquiry by the Inspector General of Police, but by year's end it was
 unknown if such an investigation would be undertaken.
 The responsibility of elements in the ruling party for killing four protesters and
 bystanders during a May demonstration is unknown but appears likely (see Section
 2.b.).
 Journalist Kwesi Pratt was unsuccessful in his continued efforts to persuade the
 Government to investigate extrajudicial killings in the early years of PNDC rule, de-
 spite police professions in 1993 of willingness to investigate such killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution states that the dignity of all persons shall be inviolable and that
 no one shall be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment
 or punishment, or any other condition that detracts from human dignity. Nonethe-
 less, there were credible reports that members of the police beat prisoners and other
 citizens. However, the police showed restrain in handling large crowds, including
 during antigovernment demonstrations in May (see Section 2.b.).
 
 
 108
 There were several press accounts of investigations by police authorities in cases
 of police brutality. However, the results made public were generally those in which
 suspects were exonerated.
 Prisons are in most cases very poorly maintained, and conditions are extremely
 harsh. In February CHRAJ reported that prisons were unsanitary and overcrowded,
 that conditions can be considered cruel, inhuman, or degrading, as defined by the
 United Nations, and also were in violation of Ghana's own Constitution. The Com-
 missioner further acknowledged that prisons provide inadequate nutrition and medi-
 cal services to inmates. Although the Government has occasionally commuted the
 sentences of ill or aged prisoners, its failure to provide adequate and timely medical
 care to prisoners has resulted in deaths. In April the press reported that several
 small children were imprisoned with their mothers. The Ghana Prisons Service took
 immediate action, placing the children with other family members or orphanages.
 CHRAJ inspections in August revealed that youth and adult inmates were housed
 together.
 The Government allows monitoring of prison conditions by representatives of the
 International Committee of the Red Cross.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides for protection
 against arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile and states that an individual detained
 shall be informed immediately, in a language the detained person understands, of
 the reasons for the detention, and of the right to a lawyer and to an interpreter,
 the latter at state expense. It also requires judicial warrants for arrest and provides
 for arraignment within 48 hours. In practice, however, many abuses occur, including
 detention without charge for longer than 48 hours and failure to obtain a warrant
 for arrest.
 The court has unlimited discretion regarding the setting of bail, which can be ex-
 cessive. It may refuse to release prisoners on bail and instead remand them without
 charge for an indefinite period, subject to weekly review by judicial authorities. It
 is common to remand a prisoner to investigative custody. The Constitution requires
 however, that a detainee who has not been tried within a "reasonable" time shall
 be released either unconditionally or subject to conditions necessary to ensure that
 he appears at a later date for court proceedings. Approximately 30 percent of the
 prison population consists of pretrial detainees. Despite the provisions of the law
 abuses occur. People are sometimes detained for trivial offenses or unsubstantiated
 accusations.
 In one highly publicized case, a murder suspect, a citizen of Burkina Faso, was
 released after 16 years' remand. His release was the result of the CHRAJ's inves-
 tigation of prison conditions. After learning of his plight, the Commission initiated
 legal proceedings resulting in his release.
 In June eight detainees in a Cape Coast prison, with the support of other inmates,
 revolted, demanding their constitutionally guaranteed right to a speedy trial. Ac-
 cording to a report in the government press, some remanded suspects have been in
 prison for 2 to 3 years.
 There were no known political arrests in 1995. The Government does not practice
 forced exile and encourages citizens with valuable skills who are living abroad to
 return, including dissidents. Some former government and discredited PNDC offi-
 cials have returned and resumed careers and political activities.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government posed no serious challenges to judicial independence dur-
 ing the year. However, the Ghana Bar Association protested the confirmation of
 Chief Justice Abban, alleging that he is unqualified for the position and that the
 President had forced his confirmation through Parliament without sufficient time
 for debate or public hearings. There were no charges of judicial corruption. Never-
 theless, the integrity of the legal system is compromised by a severe lack of finan-
 cial, human, and material resources in the judicial service.
 The Constitution establishes two basic levels of courts: superior and lower. The
 superior courts include the Supreme Court, the Appeals Court, the High Court, and
 regional tribunals. Parliament may establish lower courts or tribunals by decree.
 Legal safeguards are based on British legal procedures. Defendants are presumed
 innocent, trials are public, and defendants have a right to be present, to be rep-
 resented by an attorney (at public expense if necessary), to present evidence, and
 to cross-examine witnesses. In practice, authorities respect these safeguards.
 The CHRAJ's charter provides for it to investigate alleged violations of human
 rights and take action to remedy proven violations. To date, it has held workshops
 to educate the public, traditional leaders, the police, and the military on human
 rights issues. It mediates and settles cases brought to it by individuals with griev-
 ances against government agencies or private companies. In 1993 and 1994 (the
 most recent figures), the CHRAJ received over 3,000 petitions in its offices around
 
 
 109
 the country and disposed of over 1,000. About 70 percent of the complaints lodged
 with the Commission were labor and workplace related.
 The Chieftaincy Act of 1971 gives village and other traditional chiefs powers to
 mediate local matters, including authority to enforce customary tribal laws dealing
 with such matters as divorce, child custody, and property disputes.
 There were no reports of political prisoners. The last known political prisoner was
 Gershon Dompreh, released in January 1995.
 f. Arbitray Interference with Privacy, Family. Home, or Correspondence.-Observ-
 ers assume that the Government continues to engage in surveillance of citizens en-
 gaged in activity which it deems objectionable. In the past, this included monitoring
 of telephones and mail.
 Although the law requires judicial search warrants, police do not always obtain
 them. The Constitution provides that a person shall be free from interference within
 the privacy of his home, property, correspondence, or communication. This article
 has yet to be tested.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and press, and opposition political parties and others have used these freedoms to
 criticize the Government. In general, the Government has not suppressed the exer-
 cise of freedom of speech by the print media but has continually pressured the gov-
 ernment-run media for conformity. Also, it has yet to implement free speech or free
 press for broadcasting. The Government dominates the print and electronic media,
 controlling the radio and television stations and the two daily newspapers.
 The official media continue to emphasize positive aspects of government policies,
 although they also report charges of corruption or mismanagement in government
 ministries and state-owned enterprises. The state-owned media do not directly criti-
 cize government policies or President Rawlings, although they often print articles
 that criticize individual governmental agencies. The Government occasionally sub-
 jects journalists to discipline or dismissal for articles deemed unacceptable. On occa-
 sion, the government-owned media printed editorials critical of the Government but
 which did not criticize top officials.
 The independent press continues to publish unimpeded, with newspapers and
 magazines critical of the Government, including personal attacks on the President,
 his wife, and his close advisers. However, independent newspapers and magazines
 tend to be small and poorly financed, with little circulation outside major cities.
 There are accusations that the Government indirectly manipulates the independent
 press by refusing to do business with companies that advertise in opposition news-
 papers. However, advertising is steadily increasing in the independent newspapers.
 Foreign periodicals are sold in Accra and other major cities. Issues containing arti-
 cles critical of the Government circulate freely.
 Most Ghanaians obtain their news from the    overnment-owned electronic media
 and British Broadcasting Corporation radio. Undler the Constitution, individuals are
 free to own radio and television stations. However, independent broadcasters have
 encountered countless obstacles and delays in their attempts to gain access to the
 government-monopolized airwaves. One firm, the Independent Media Corporation of
 Ghana (IMCG), began broadcasting in November 1994 after having waited for al-
 most 1 year without result in their application for a license. Several weeks after
 IMCG's appearance on the airwaves, the police seized its transmission equipment,
 citing the station's failure to obtain authorization to broadcast. The equipment re-
 mains confiscated despite a High Court ruling that the police had acted illegally and
 that the equipment should be returned.
 For the greater part of the year, the Government procrastinated in allocating fre-
 quencies to numerous private applicants. A list of the first frequency recipients ap-
 peared in July and comprised 36 organizations, including IMCG. This was the first
 critical step toward independent broadcasting in Ghana. Despite the constitutional
 prohibition of "impediments to the establishment of private press or media," the new
 frequency holders must pay a nonrefundable "commitment fee" in order to operate.
 Meanwhile, there are still no genuinely autonomous radio stations. One radio sta-
 tion, Radio Joy, appeared unexpectedly in April without authorization from the Min-
 istry of information or the Frequency Allocation Board. Its directors, many of whom
 are associated with high government officials, negotiated a special deal with the
 government-run Ghana Broadcasting Corporation to obtain one of its unused fre-
 quencies. The issue of allowing independent broadcasting companies to operate, and
 therefore of providing the opposition with a stronger political voice, will increase in
 importance as Ghana approaches major elections in late 1996.
 Civil suits for libel are allowed, and the Criminal Libel Law holds the potential
 for inhibiting the freedom of the press. This law allows criminal prosecution in cases
 
 
 110
 
 where a false report injures the credit or reputation of the State. This is at odds
 with the Constitution, which prohibits criminal prosecution for the publication of
 any item, true or not by any individual. Currently a publisher and an editor of an
 dependent paper, charged with criminal libel, are free on bail but awaiting trial.
 State attorneys are prosecuting the case based on defamatory remarks made about
 the first lady, whom they define as a government official. In early 1995, a journalist
 was accused of insulting the Chief Justice in print and served 30 days in prison for
 contempt of court.
 There has been no restriction of academic freedom on university campuses. The
 National Union of Ghanian Students, one of the more vocal critics of the Govern-
 ment is allowed to organize and hold meetings.
 b. Kreedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of peaceful assembly and association; it does not require permits for dem-
 onstrations. However, Parliament passed a public order bill in late 1994 requiring
 that all organizers of "special events" or "processions" inform the olice of their in-
 tentions so that the police can institute precautionary measures. The new law also
 provides for curfews and arrest without warrants in specified instances.
 The Government's commitment to respect the right of peaceful assembly was
 drawn into serious question when unknown personskilled four prtestors after an
 otherwise orderly demonstration in Accra. Demonstrators organized by the AFC
 marched peacefully on May 11 to protest the Government's new value added tax,
 but they were fired upon by counter-demonstrators when dispersing. Although the
 AFC and the independent press praised police conduct during the demonstration,
 they also provided credible evidence that it was the Minister of Youth and Sports
 who had organized and armed the counter-demonstrators. The Government has ig-
 nored repeated requests to establish an independent commission to investigate the
 affair. Instead, the Minister of the Interior released a statement in September
 claiming that a police committee was unable to identify any specific individuals re-
 sponsible for the shootings, and the matter was thus closed. The police committee's
 report has never been publicly released.
 The Government's likely involvement and its failure to take decisive action to re-
 solve the case of these four killings constitute the biggest stain on Ghana's 1995
 human rights record.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice.
 There is no state-favored religion and no apparent advantages or disadvantages
 attached to membership in any particular sect or religion. Foreign missionary
 groups have generally operated throughout the country with a minimum of formal
 restrictions.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens and foreigners are free to move throughout the country with-
 out special permission. Police checkpoints exist countrywide to prevent smuggling,
 but most are left unmanned during daylight hours. Roadblocks and car searches are
 a normal part of nighttime travel in Accra.
 Citizens are generally free to travel internationally and to emigrate or to be repa-
 triated from other countries. Since Ghana is a member of the Economic Community
 of West African States, Ghanaians may travel without visas for up to 90 days in
 member states.
 Since March 1994, members of the Konkomba tribe in the Northern region have
 been afraid to enter towns and cities in that region due to ongoing ethnic conflicts
 (see Section 5). For the Konkomba, who rely on trading agricultural products as
 their sole source of income, the inability to travel is a tremendous hardship. Since
 March 1994, a number of Konkomba have sought refuge in Togo as a result of eth-
 nic conflict in the north.
 The Government has a liberal policy of accepting refugees from other West Afri-
 can nations, and Ghana continues to host substantial refugee populations, including
 approximately 94,000 Togolese who fled to Ghana in 1993 and an estimated 20,000
 Liberians.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens last exercised the right to change their government through a democratic
 process in presidential elections held in 1992. International observers noted serious
 problems in the electoral process but concluded, on balance, that they did not
 change the outcome. However, opposition parties protested the results by boycotting
 subsequent parliamentary elections.
 Thus, except for 3 independent members, all 200 Members of Parliament belong
 to one of the three parties that supported President Rawlings, whose NDC party
 
 
 won 95 percent of the seats in the parliamentary and presidential elections of 1992.
 The Government has taken some steps to bring the opposition into the political
 process, including electoral reform. The NDC lost its first by-election ever in July
 to an independent candidate. Although the loss was likely due to a split in an NDC
 alliance, this defeat could perhaps hbe interpreted as a sign of rising public dis-
 content with the political status quo.
 In preparation for major elections in 1996, the Government created a National
 Electoral- Commission to supervise voting. All significant political parties are rep-
 resented on the Commission.
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, and there are no
 obstacles to the participation of women in government. Several ministers and Coun-
 cil of State memers are women. There are 16 female parliamentarians.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights organizations continued to grow in number and strength, but the
 threat of government interference may hinder their ability to operate freely. The
 Government has drafted a bill that would require NGO's to register with a National
 Advisory Council. This Council, consisting primarily of government appointees,
 would have the authority to deny, suspend, or cancel an NGO's right to operate. The
 bill, which would also apply to international NGO's, remained pending at year's end.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, dis-
 ability, language, or social status. The courts are specifically empowered to enforce
 these prohibitions, although enforcement by the authorities is generally inadequate,
 in part due to limited financial resources.
 Women.-Violence against women, including rape and wife beating, remains a sig-
 nificantproblem. These abuses usually go unreported and seldom come before the
 courts. The police tend not to intervene in domestic disputes. However, the media
 increasingly report cases of assault and rape.
 Women continue to experience societal discrimination. Women in urban centers
 and those with skills and training encounter little overt bias, but resistance to
 women in nontraditional roles persists. Women, especially in rural areas, remain
 subject to burdensome labor conditions and traditional male. dominance. Often deep-
 ly entrenched traditions and the use of traditional courts to handle family matters
 deny them rightful inheritances and property, a legally registered marriage (and
 with it, certain legal rights), recourse to divorce, and the maintenance and custody
 of children, all provided for by law.
 Women's rights groups are active in educational campaigns and in programs to
 provide vocational training, legal aid, and other support to women. The Government
 is also active in educational programs in support of women's rights.
 Children.-Within the limits of its resources, the Government is committed to pro-
 tecting the rights and welfare of children. There is little or no discrimination
 against females in education, but irls and women frequently drop out due to soci-
 etal or economic pressures. Statistics show an equal male to female ratio in school
 enrollments in grade 1, dropping to 2 to 1 by grade 6, 4 to 1 at the secondary level,
 and 9 to 1 at the university level.
 There are several traditional discriminatory practices that are injurious to female
 health and development. In particular, female genital mutilation (FGM), which is
 widely condemned by international health experts as damaging to both physical and
 psychological health, is a serious problem. According to one study, the percentage
 of women who have undergone this procedure may be as high as 30 percent, al-
 though most observers believe 15 percent to be more accurate. FGM is practiced
 mostly in Muslim communities in the far northeastern and northwestern parts of
 the country. As of 1994, FGM became a criminal act, and courts have convicted at
 least one practitioner to date.
 Another practice, found primarily in the Volta region, is an especially severe
 abuse and a flagrant violation of children's rights. The tro-kosi (or "vestal virgin")
 system is a traditional practice in which a young girl, usually under the ag of 10,
 is made a slave to a fetish shrine for offenses allegedly committed by a member of
 the girl's family. The belief is that if someone in that family has committed a crime,
 such as stealing, members of the family may begin to die in large numbers unless
 a young girl is given to the local fetish shrine to atone for the offense. The girl be-
 comes the property of the fetish priest and is often required to perform sexual fa-
 vors. These girls are seldom allowed to go to school and must work on the priest's
 farm and perform other labors for him, but the girls' families must provide food for
 
 
 112
 their meals. When the fetish slave dies or is released, usually without skills or the
 likelihood of marriage, the family is expected to replace her with another young girl
 for the fetish shrine. Although the Constitution outlaws slavery, the Parliament has
 yet to pass a law explicitly prohibiting tro-kosi. The practice persists because of
 deeply entrenched traditional beliefs to which even high-ranking officials reportedly
 adhere. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that legislation alone would eliminate the prac-
 tice. There are an estimated 1,000 fetish slaves bound to various shrines.
 Other traditional practices that violate the human rights of children are forced
 childhood marriages and tribal scarring, deep cuts made to the face to show mem-
 bership in a particular tribe. The prostitution of female children exists despite its
 illegality.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution specifically provides for the rights of
 people with disabilities, including protection against exploitation and discrimination.
 It also states that "as far as practicable, every place to which the public has access
 shall have appropriate facilities for disabled persons." In practice, however, this pro-
 vision has yet toe implemented.
 National/Racial IEthnic Minorities.-Although the Government plays down the
 importance of ethnic differences, its opponents occasionally complain that it is domi-
 nated by the Ewe ethnic group from eastern Ghana. The President and many of his
 close advisers are Ewe, but many ministers are of other ethnic origins.
 There were continuing tensions and violence between ethnic groups in the north-
 ern region, which left as many as 20,000 dead and 100,000 injured m 1994 and 150
 dead in 1995. Peace negotiations, underway since the initial violence in 1994, have
 not made substantive progress, and the Government has done little to push the ne-
 gotiations forward and bring an end to the violence (see also Section 2.d.).
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-This right is restricted, as the Trades Union Ordi-
 nance confers broad powers on the Government to refuse to register a trade union.
 However, neither the PNDC nor the present Government has interfered with the
 right of workers to associate in labor unions.
 About 9 percent of workers belong to unions, a figure that has been declining
 slowly over the past several years. The Industrial Relations Act (IRA), initially writ-
 ten in 1958, amended in 1965 and 1972, governs trade unions and their activities.
 The Trades Union Congress (TUC) is the only existing confederation, although it
 has no legal monopoly. In recent years it has been led by experienced union leaders
 who, aided by a revised union constitution and by-laws, continued to define an au-
 tonomous role for the TUC within the NDC regime. Since the 1992 elections, the
 TUC has taken a somewhat more confrontational stance vis-a-vis the Government
 and has criticized some of its economic policies. Civil servants have their own union,
 the Civil Servants Association, which operates outside of the TUC umbrella. Govern-
 ment employees of several different departments and agencies went out on strike
 this year without government retribution.
 The law recognizes the right to strike. Under the IRA, the Government estab-
 lished a system of settling disputes, first through conciliation, then through arbitra-
 tion. A union may call a legal strike if negotiations and mediation fail. However,
 because no union has ever gone through the complete process, there have been no
 legal strikes since independence. The University Teachers Association of Ghana
 went on strike to protest the absence of pay increases, effectively closing the na-
 tion's university system for most of the academic year. The IRA prohibits retribution
 against strikers, and this law is enforced. There has been no progress in implement-
 ing the Government's declared intention to establish labor tribunals to arbitrate in-
 dustrial disputes certified as deadlocked.
 Unions have the right to affiliate with international bodies. The TUC is affiliated
 with the Organization of African Trade Union Unity, headquartered in Accra and
 is also a member of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The IRA provides a frame-
 work for collective bargaining and some protection against antiumon discrimination
 as well. Trade unions engage in collective bargaining for wages and benefits with
 both private and state-owned enterprises without government interference. The
 Government, labor, and employers negotiate together, however, through a tripartite
 commission to set minimum standards for wages and working conditions. The law
 requires employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination to reinstate workers
 fired for union activities. No union leaders have been detained in recent years for
 union or other activities.
 There is one operating export processing zone (EPZ), with legislation approving
 others imminent.EPZ's are subject to the same labor laws as in the rest of the coun-
 try.
 
 
 113
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced labor,
 and it is not known to be practiced except in the tro-kosi system (see Section 5).
 The International Labor Organization (ILO) continues to urge the Government to
 revise various legal provisions that permit imprisonment with an obligation to per-
 form labor for offenses that are not countenanced under ILO Convention 105.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Labor legislation sets a minimum
 employment age of 15 and prohibits night work and certain types of hazardous labor
 for those under 18 years of age. In practice, child employment is widespread, and
 young children of school age often perform menial tasks during the day in the mar-
 ket or collect fares on local buses. Observance of minimum age laws is eroded by
 local custom and economic circumstances that encourage children to work to help
 their families.
 Officials only occasionally punish violators of regulations which prohibit heavy
 labor and night work for children. Inspectors from the Ministry of Labor and Social
 Welfare are responsible for enforcement of child labor regulations. They visit each
 workplace annually and make spot checks whenever they receive allegations of vio-
 lations.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-In 1991 minimum standards for wages and
 working conditions were set by a tripartite commission composed of representatives
 of the Government, labor, and employers. The daily minimum wage, revised in 1995,
 combines wages with customary benefits, such as a transportation allowance. The
 current daily minimum wage is the equivalent of $1.00 (1,200 cedis). This sum is
 insufficient or a single wage earner to support a family. In most cases households
 have multiple wage earners, some family farming, and other family based commer-
 cial activities.
 The law sets the maximum workweek at 45 hours, with one break of at least 36
 consecutive hours every 7 days. Through collective bargaining, however, the basic
 workweek for most unionized workers is 40 hours. Occupational safety and health
 regulations are in effect, and the Labor Department of the Ministry of Health and
 Social Welfare occasionally imposes sanctions on violators. Safety inspectors are few,
 however, and poorly trained. They take action if matters are called- to their atten-
 tion, but lack the resources to seek out violations. Workers have the right to with-
 draw themselves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to continued em-
 ployment, but they rarely exercise this right.
