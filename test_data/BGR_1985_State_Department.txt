 BULGARIA
 Bulgaria is a Marxist-Leninist state ruled by the Bulgarian
 Communist Party. The Communist leadership holds a monopoly of
 power and seeks to direct and control all political, economic,
 social, and cultural activities. A second, much smaller
 party, the Bulgarian National Agrarian Union, is represented
 in the Government and the National Assembly (Parliament) but
 is totally subservient to the Communist Party. No other
 political parties are tolerated.
 An omnipresent network of state security police and militia at
 all levels of society has succeeded in suppressing most open
 expressions of opposition to the regime.
 The combined effects of economic mismanagement and poor
 weather brought about a decline in economic growth in 1985.
 There were shortages of some basic commodities and of energy,
 and electric power had to be rationed nationwide.
 The Bulgarian Constitution provides for certain basic rights,
 including the right to citizenship, work, rest, access to
 health care and free education, free speech and press,
 association and demonstration, and freedom of worship. In
 practice, these freedoms are abridged or circumscribed to
 varying degrees, and they may not be exercised in any way
 detrimental to Communist Party control. All challenges to
 this control are met quickly, firmly, and harshly.
 The human rights situation in Bulgaria deteriorated sharply
 during 1985. In a departure from past practice, the regime
 compelled the entire Turkish-speaking minority, some 600,000-
 900,000 persons, to abandon their Turkish and Muslim names and
 adopt Bulgarian and Christian ones. Army troops and the
 paramilitary militia enforced the name change decree, often at
 gunpoint. A media campaign claimed that minority members were
 spontaneously, simultaneously, and voluntarily rediscovering
 their authentic Bulgarian heritage, which had allegedly been
 repressed hundreds of years earlier during Ottoman times.
 This contradicted the regime's former recognition of the
 Turkish minority. Use of the Turkish language was forbidden
 in 1985 (a ban enforced by fines), Islamic religious
 observances were derided in the media, some practices were
 banned outright, and worshipers suffered official harassment.
 Beatings and mistreatment of political prisoners continued, as
 did arbitrary arrest and detention of persons critical of the
 authorities. The Government maintained its constant,
 widespread interference in the affairs of its citizens through
 its system of surveillance, electronic monitoring, mail
 censorship, and control of information.
 Reported acts of terror in 1985 included the bombing, with
 fatalities, of a train near Bunovo, as well as bombings of a
 hotel in Sliven and a munitions plant in Plovdiv, among other
 incidents. The identity of those carrying out such acts and
 their motivations, however, are not known.
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Regime-controlled media deny any violence occurred during the
 Government's forcible name-change campaign against ethnic
 
 
 927
 BULGARIA
 Turks, but officials privately have admitted "excesses."
 Numerous sources report deaths and injuries caused by security
 forces, including the Army, among Turkish-Bulgarians resisting
 this repression of their cultural identity. The number of
 deaths is variously estimated to range anywhere between a few
 dozen and several hundred, with injuries suffered by many more
 people, but these figures are impossible to confirm. Some
 Bulgarian police and security personnel were also reported
 killed or wounded. The casualties were incurred mainly in
 rural parts of Kurdzhali, Sliven, Ruse, and Razgrad districts
 from December 1984 to February 1985.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known cases of disappearance during 1985 at the
 hands of official or quasi-official security forces.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 According to credible reports by human rights advocates and
 their families, beatings continued to be a feature of
 imprisonment in Bulgaria. Many persons apprehended while
 attempting to leave Bulgaria without authorization have
 reportedly suffered severe abuse at the hands of border
 guards. Political prisoners, including intellectuals, are
 held together with common criminals and subjected to brutal
 treatment by these elements as well as by their guards. These
 practices are confirmed by veteran inmates from various
 prisons, including Sofia's Central Prison and forced labor
 camps at Devnia, Belene Island, and Debelt. A dissident legal
 scholar, Yanko Yankov, is reported to have been badly beaten
 by guards at Pazardzhik Prison and to have been denied medical
 treatment. According to a dissident former graduate student
 confined at Debelt, the guards there delegate the task of
 beating political offenders to criminal inmates.
 Prison conditions reportedly vary. According to one prisoner,
 cells at Sofia's central prison went unheated during the early
 months of 1985, but despite the winter temperatures inmates
 were not issued any additional clothing. On the other hand, a
 penal veteran referred to Stara Zagora Prison as a relative
 "paradise" where a correct regime is followed despite Spartan
 conditions. At the Razvigor Street Jail in Sofia, prisoners
 are held two to a cell during pretrial investigations. The
 cells measure one and a half by two paces and are furnished
 only with a plank bed or pallet. Each cell is illuminated
 around the clock by a single naked bulb. The diet is poor.
 There are no exercise or recreation areas, although detainees
 may remain at Razvigor for several months. While Razvigor
 inmates endure lengthy interrogation sessions, there are no
 known complaints of beating in this jail.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Bulgarians may be detained, tried, and punished for many
 actions which elsewhere are considered political in nature.
 For example, there are many credible reports that ethnic Turks
 were confined in 1985 as actual or merely potential resisters
 to .forced name changes. Similarly, unauthorized
 demonstrations, public expression critical of the Government,
 or the mere act of entering a Western embassy by Bulgarians
 can bring interrogation, detention, or arrest for having
 committed a "crime" even though such activity is not illegal.
 
 
 928
 BULGARIA
 Although the principle of habeas corpus exists under the
 Bulgarian Criminal Code, it appears to have been grossly
 violated during the Government's repression of the Turkish
 minority. On paper, the law stipulates that preliminary
 detention is limited to 10 days, and then only when evidence
 appears to justify later indictment. However, several cases
 are known of persons being confined for longer periods without
 charges being lodged. Following arraignment, the law permits
 detention for up to 6 months before indictment. Under
 Bulgaria's Criminal Code the accused must be informed of the
 charges against him.
 Through administrative regulation, persons may also be subject
 to an informal system of control in which they are detained at
 their place of residence and must appear at the local police
 station several times daily. Another form of punishment is
 forced change of domicile or internal exile. A person's right
 to live in a certain town may be revoked, and he may be
 required to move to a town far away from family and familiar
 surroundings. Banished persons are often sent to remote
 villages to perform agricultural labor. Their identity cards
 are stamped to note restriction to a particular locality.
 Should exiles or persons under such administrative control
 leave despite these prohibitions, they may face actual
 imprisonment. One such case in 1985 involved a person named
 Iliya Minev who was sentenced to 5 months' imprisonment for
 violating the terms of an administrative order restricting his
 movement.
 Political offenders are required to do hard labor. For
 example, forced labor internees are assigned to the most
 hazardous jobs at the Devnia chemical plant but at rates of
 pay considerably below those of their nonprisoner coworkers.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Bulgarian law and common practice provide for public trial in
 criminal cases. Defendants are entitled to counsel, but only
 after the preliminary investigation, sometimes lasting many
 weeks,.has been completed and an indictment prepared. When
 legal counsel is finally available to the accused, it often
 cooperates with the prosecution. In.theory, the accused is
 informed of the charges against him, but recent practice
 indicates that detainees are often not told precisely under
 what statutes they are being held.
 Bulgaria releases no figures on the number of political
 prisoners and detainees. Several thousand such-persons is a
 reasonable estimate for 1985, including those caught while
 trying to escape across the country's borders, as well as
 Turkish-Bulgarians .rounded up in the early months of the
 year.
 Special court procedures are followed in cases involving state
 security. Trials with political implications, such as the
 proceedings against Yanko Yankov and a confederate, Tseko
 Tsekov, for "defamation of the state," are not open to the
 public. At Yankov's trial, the court refused to enter a
 portion of his testimony into the transcript when it became
 evident that this material could embarrass a close relative of
 a high government official.
 Generally, the Bulgarian judicial system seeks to maintain at
 least-the.appearance of observing legal norms. However,
 
 
 929
 BULGARIA
 although the laws themselves are codified, published, and
 readily available for reference, numerous procedural and
 administrative regulations are not. Frequently, such
 regulations, access to which is restricted, are invoked
 arbitrarily. The defendant and his counsel have little
 recourse, since the validity or applicability of the
 -regulation in question cannot be challenged. These procedural
 regulations play a central role in the judicial system and
 enable the Government and its prosecutors to manipulate the
 circumstances and outcome of trials. Despite such
 restrictions, some defense lawyers enjoy a reputation among
 defendants for courage and honesty despite pressure on them
 from the security apparatus.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government interferes in the private lives of its citizens
 in many ways. An elaborate system of informers directed by
 the party and security apparatus, represented in virtually all
 workplaces, residential areas, and social organizations,
 monitors the daily lives of Bulgarians for signs of dissidence
 or other unacceptable behavior. Bulgarians assume that
 security personnel may monitor their telephone conversations
 and read their mail.
 In October 1985 the authorities reimposed a curfew on youths
 of middle school age and younger. Adolescents no longer may
 attend evening film or theater performances without adult
 accompaniment. A decree effective November 1, 1985 also
 stipulates that boys must wear short hair while girls with
 long hair must adhere to a particular style. A stricter
 student dress code has been imposed, and teachers were warned
 that they are to be judged henceforth by the level of
 discipline and behavior of their students. The decree also
 compels unemployed persons aged between 15 and 30 to accept
 jobs assigned to them or to find jobs on their own.
 Sanctity of the home is nominally safeguarded by law, and
 police may not legally search property without prior
 permission from a court or prosecutor. However, searches may
 be undertaken in urgent situations before judicial permission
 is given. The authorities are required to issue an itemized
 receipt for property confiscated during a search. In one
 recent case, a defendant facing trial refused to sign this
 document, charging that it contained falsehoods. In court,
 the defendant reported that his signature was forged on the
 document, but a judge admitted it as evidence over the defense
 lawyer's protest.
 The Government regiments the private lives of its citizens.
 In May 1985 the National Assembly enacted a revised Family
 Code incorporating controversial features that made divorce
 more difficult to obtain. Its intention was to promote family
 stability and population growth. The Code regularizes a
 process whereby a couple's employers are brought into
 mandatory marriage reconcilation efforts even if both parties
 to the marriage are intent on its dissolution.
 Virtually all citizens are members of "mass" political
 organizations. Children and young adults belong to the
 Pioneers and Komsomol, while their elders join the Fatherland
 Front, a mass organization, or, in the case of the elite, the
 Communist Party. There appears to be strong pressure on all
 
 
 930
 BULGARIA
 citizens at least to pay dues and become nominal members of
 these organizations. Those who refuse--an extremely small
 percentage of the population--are likely to be denied normal
 promotions and other benefits and to come under official
 scrutiny.
 The Governmeht attempts to insulate the populace from most
 kinds of contact with non-Communist foreign influence.
 International mail and telephone conversations are closely
 monitored, and Western shortwave radio broadcasts have been
 subjected to periodic jamming. The voice of America is not
 jammed, however. Western news publications, except for those
 of Communist parties, are usually not on-sale. Authorities
 make them available at hotels on a very limited basis when
 important international meetings convene, e.g. UNESCO's
 October-November 1985 conference in Sofia. Even then,
 however, security personnel seek to prevent Bulgarians from
 buying Western newspapers and magazines.
 Some foreign citizens of Bulgarian ancestry have been denied
 the opportunity of staying in homes of their Bulgarian
 relatives and friends while visiting the country and have been
 told to stay in hotels.
 The Bulgarian Government's campaign during 1985 of forced
 cultural assimilation of Bulgarian citizens who are ethnic
 Turks was a particularly gross example of arbitrary
 interference into the private lives of individuals. Those who
 refused to accept new Bulgarian and Christian names were
 threatened or arrested, and some were reportedly killed by
 security forces which swept through predominantly Turkish
 settlements in southern and northeastern Bulgaria. New
 identity cards were issued, and essential services, even
 medical care, were denied to persons presenting the old
 documents with Turkish or Muslim names. The assimilation
 campaign included a ban on speaking Turkish.and wearing
 Turkish-style clothing. Records, including medical files,
 were altered to match the new names.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for certain basic rights, including
 freedom of speech and press. In practice, these freedoms are
 circumscribed and may not be exercised in any way that might
 weaken the Communist Party's monopoly of power. Press, radio,
 and television are under total regime control, with no
 alternatives tolerated. Laws provide severe punishments for
 anyone convicted of criticizing the State. The dissemination
 of "untruthful remarks which might increase mistrust of state
 power or cause confusion in society" is proscribed. The
 unauthorized disclosure of certain information, e.g.,
 unpublished economic statistics, is illegal and subject to
 serious penalties.
 Although censorship does not exist officially, the media
 operate within well-understood party and government guidelines
 and practices. International news is usually limited to that
 provided by the government news agency or official Soviet
 sources. Forbidden topics in the Bulgarian press include
 unauthorized criticism of party and state leaders, of
 Communist ideology, and other Communist countries,
 particularly the U.S.S.R. As for cultural matters within the
 
 
 931
 BULGARIA
 country, the media promote only ethnic Bulgarian achievements,
 excluding recognition of minority contributions (e.g.,
 Macedonian, Gypsy, Turkish, or Pomak) to national life. The
 previously Turkish-language newspaper Yeni Isik became Nova
 Svetlina, a Bulgarian-language periodical which was used
 extensively by the authorities in their campaign against
 Turkish culture and customs.
 In addition to the all-pervasive party control of the media,
 self-censorship is practiced carefully by virtually the entire
 population. For example, acceptable themes are assigned to
 authors at annual Writers Union congresses, and those not
 following the directives are unlikely to have their works
 published.
 There have also been instances of interference with academic
 inquiry in the social sciences. A revision of history
 undertaken in 1985 attempted to demonstrate that Bulgarian
 Turks were really ethnic Bulgars whose ancestors had allegedly
 been pressured during Ottoman times to adopt the Turkish
 language and customs and the Islamic faith. References to the
 minority as "Turks" became taboo. This revision contradicted
 Communist party publications appearing as late as March 1984,
 which lauded the contributions of "Bulgarian Turks" in
 national construction.
 A person is able to send criticism, suggestions, and
 complaints by letter to newspapers and to National Assembly
 representatives on a broad.range of topics such as inadequate
 service from public agencies and housing shortages. None of
 the letters published, however,-goes beyond criticism of
 specific economic or service shortfalls or failure of
 lower-level officials in government -administration. On some
 occasions, an issue of social policy is opened to limited
 public discussion. For example, some debate on the draft for
 a new Family Code was permitted, but despite widely-expressed
 dissatisfaction with the Code's restrictive features, it was
 enacted into law without significant changes.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association and
 demonstration. In practice, the State decides which social
 and political organizations may exist. Private associations
 are totally unknown, and the law provides for punishment of
 anyone "founding an illegal, antistate organization." In
 Mikhailovgrad, a human rights group of about 16 persons was
 broken up in 1984, and its members were all arrested. Freedom
 of assembly is a right granted only to legally constituted
 organizations and only for approved purposes. Attendance at
 public demonstrations is a duty assigned- by schools and
 enterprises to their members. In late 1984 and early 1985,
 unauthorized demonstrations by ethnic Turks to protest forced
 cultural assimilation occurred in some southern Bulgarian
 towns. These gatherings were forcibly disrupted.
 All Bulgarian labor unions are organized and totally
 controlled by the Communist Party. According to the unions'
 official statutes enacted in 1982, their purpose is to educate
 their members in a spirit of affection and devotion to the
 party, to instill patriotism and loyalty to the Soviet Union,
 and to prepare working people for Communist society. Union
 members are not in a position to negotiate or strike for
 better pay or working conditions, nor may they organize
 
 
 932
 BULGARIA
 outside the existing unibns. Union leaders represent the
 interests of management, and there is no mechanism for
 collective bargaining.
 The unions have not defended workers dismissed from jobs
 because of political transgressions. Such workers are
 sometimes blacklisted by security authorities, effectively
 barring them from further employment. Bulgarian trade unions
 are assigned a role in ensuring the job safety and general
 social welfare of their members. Bulgarian trade unions
 maintain ties with Communist-controlled unions and labor
 confederations abroad, and Bulgaria is a member of the
 International Labor Organization.
 Lawyers, doctors, artists, musicians, writers, and academics
 are represented by professional associations which also have
 the party-assigned function of controlling their membership
 Professional associations have contacts with their foreign--
 including Western--counterparts and arrange foreign travel for
 trusted members to attend conferences and take part in
 international exchanges.
 c.-Freedom of Religion
 Although the Constitution provides for freedom of worship, the
 authorities espouse atheism and discourage religion. Openly
 expressed religious conviction is incompatible with party
 membership or the attainment of responsible government
 position.- Nevertheless, a number of faiths are recognized,
 including Islam, Judaism, and various Christian
 denominations. Banned, however, are the Ba'hai faith and the
 Dunovist sect, an indigenous movement which flourished in
 pre-Communist Bulgaria. Relations between the Government and
 church organizations are regulated by the Committee for
 Questions of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church and Religious
 Cults, which is organized under the Ministry of'Foreign
 Affairs.. It reviews all clerical appointments, and on
 occasion, as happened during 1985 to the Evangelicals, will
 impose a candidate of its own over the opposition of local
 congregations.
 The Bulgarian Orthodox Church, the established religion before
 the Communists took power, is the largest and most acceptable
 in the Government's view. This is in recognition of the
 Orthodox Church's historical and cultural role in Bulgaria's
 past, as well as of its continuing appeal to ordinary
 Bulgarians. The Orthodox Church receives substantial
 government financial support, and in return voices concurrence
 with Government propaganda on such themes as peace and
 disarmament.
 The Orthodox Church is allowed to print a newspaper, distill
 and market some alcoholic beverages, and sell religious
 articles such as candles, small jewelry crosses, etc. A
 Bulgarian-language Biblewas published in 1982 in only 2,000
 copies and distributed domestically, but it is now out of
 print. Although the authorities tend not to interfere with
 older worshipers, they try to dissuade young churchgoers from
 entering churches or circulate among them demanding to see
 their identity cards.
 Ethnic Turks make up the majority of Bulgaria's Muslims, the
 remainder being Gypsies or Slavic Pomaks. Muslim believers
 have been inhibited from practicing their religion by the
 
 
 933
 BULGARIA
 closure of many mosques and by prohibitions against religious
 education of children. Although Sofia's main mosque is being
 slowly renovated with some government funds, many other
 mosques throughout the country have fallen into disrepair, or
 have been converted to other uses, e.g. a barbershop in
 Pleven. Many Muslim graveyards have been obliterated.
 Certain architecturally notable mosques, as at Razgrad and
 Shumen, have been preserved as "cultural monuments" but are
 closed to actual worship.
 Muslims have no access to Korans, which are not printed in
 Bulgaria. Since the Communist takeover in 1944, only three
 Bulgarian Muslims have been permitted to undertake the Hajj,
 or pilgrimage, to Mecca. Muslim rites of circumcision and
 burial are banned, as is the observance of religious
 holidays. In 1985, Communist newspapers openly ridiculed the
 Muslim practices of almsgiving on certain holidays and fasting
 during the month of Ramadan. Bulgaria permits ritual
 slaughterers from Arab countries to come and supervise the
 preparation of mutton for export to their lands, but these
 meat supplies are not released to domestic Bulgarian Muslim
 consumers.
 Bulgaria's Jewish minority of about 5,000 mainly middle-aged
 and elderly persons is free to attend worship services. Jews
 in Bulgaria have not suffered anti-Semitic repression. A
 number have traveled to Israel and have received family
 visitors from that country. Sofia's Sephardic Synagogue
 received some government funds for refurbishing as a national
 architectural monument, but work is at a standstill. The
 synagogue's prayer books are old, and no replacements are
 available. No kosher meat is obtainable. However, Jews are
 permitted to bake and distribute Passover matzoh bread without
 hindrance. Sofia's Jewish Cultural Center emphasizes the
 community's ethnic, not religious, identity. This Center
 publishes a secular newspaper stressing pro-Communist,
 anti-Zionist themes.
 Roman Catholics are few in number, and divided between
 followers of the Latin and Uniate rites. Church sermons hew
 closely to topics of personal piety and avoid social and
 political issues. In 1985, after years of applying for
 residence permission, Sofia's Latin-Rite Roman Catholic priest
 was granted authorization to remain overnight in the capital.
 He had formerly been required by the militia to commute daily
 from his home outside the city. The church's candidate for a
 successor to the Bishop of Plovdiv has been rejected by the
 Bulgarian Government, and the see remains vacant.
 No religious groups may engage in open proselytizing, and
 foreign missionary activity is banned in Bulgaria. Formal
 religious education of children is prohibited, but some
 youngsters do enter churches with family members for
 services. Several denominations have privately complained
 about the lack of scriptural materials.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Government controls where Bulgarians live, work, and
 travel. All Bulgarians carry a personal identity card with
 them at all times stating their legal place of residence and
 work. Without this card, they cannot purchase domestic
 airline tickets, register at a hotel, or seek any kind of
 
 
 934
 BULGARIA
 social service such as medical assistance. To change one's
 place of residence or work is a complicated process unless the
 change is at the Government's initiative and convenience.
 Moves to Sofia and other major cities from smaller settlements
 are especially difficult because of the official desire to
 control urban growth. Travel within the country by Bulgarians
 is generally unrestricted except in border zones. In 1985,
 however, roadblocks were common in regions where the Turkish
 minority is concentrated. Foreign travelers often were
 prohibited from entering these nominally open areas. Truck
 drivers from Turkey transiting Bulgaria to and from Central
 Europe were restricted to the main highway and prohibited from
 stopping.
 Foreign travel by Bulgarian citizens is extremely restricted,
 except to Eastern European Communist countries. Bulgarian
 citizens must have a passport for foreign travel and an exit
 visa specifying the destination for each trip. If they go to
 a country not mentioned in the exit permit, they can face
 serious complications upon their return home. Applications
 for exit documents often are refused because the travel is
 deemed "not in the interest of the state" or "not suitable in
 view of the present international situation." Frequently no
 explanation at all is given for the refusal. Applications for
 purely tourist travel to the West are rarely granted, except
 to trusted and highly placed persons. Even then, the spouse
 or minor children almost always must remain in Bulgaria.
 Emigration is possible under Bulgarian law, but it is rarely
 permitted. Despite Turkey's 1985 offer to accept ethnic Turks
 wishing to emigrate, Bulgarian officials warned that ethnic
 Turks expressing interest in doing so would be forcibly
 resettled elsewhere in Bulgaria. However, the Government
 occasionally permits members of divided families, including
 spouses, to join immediate relatives in the West in accordance
 with the Helsinki Final Act. In 1985, the authorities
 resolved 16 of 18 longstanding divided family cases involving
 American citizens or permanent residents, but new cases
 developed as passports for emigration were denied to other
 persons. The Government imposes an education fee on recent
 college graduates who seek to emigrate without first
 fulfilling a mandatory period of public service. This period
 was recently extended from 3 to 5 years for medical doctors.
 There were sporadic reports in 1985 of demands by Bulgarian
 authorities for hard currency payments for permission to
 emigrate for family reunification in the West.
 The Government encourages the repatriation of ethnic
 Bulgarians residing abroad although the right of repatriation
 is not guaranteed. A number of Bulgarian-born foreign
 residents and citizens voluntarily return to Bulgaria each
 year to live in retirement. It is Bulgarian policy to return
 to their home countries potential refugees from other Warsaw
 Pact states who have tried to cross the Bulgarian border into
 Greece, Turkey, or Yugoslavia.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change their Government
 Bulgaria is governed by a small ruling elite representing the
 Bulgarian Communist Party. Rank-and-file party members have
 little, if any, political power or opportunity to change the
 party's policies. Nonparty members are effectively denied any
 role in influencing the policies of their Government or in
 
 
 935
 BULGARIA
 changing its form. Political pluralism and free participation
 in the political process are essentially nonexistent.
 Domestic opposition to the State or party is dealt with
 promptly and severely.
 Bulgaria does not have free elections. The regime tries to
 maintain the appearance of pluralism through the participation
 of the Bulgarian National Agrarian Union in the Government and
 the National Assembly. The Communist and Agrarian Parties,
 together with labor, youth, and other organizations, comprise
 the Fatherland Front. The Front and its constituent bodies
 all are ultimately controlled by the Communist Party, to which
 the Constitution gives clear primacy. The Agrarians run
 separate candidates in some districts, but they do not compete
 against Communist candidates or face any other opposition.
 They hold about one-fourth of the seats in the National
 Assembly, but all assembly votes are unanimous. The National
 Assembly, which normally meets for fewer than four brief
 sessions a year, has no independent role in governing. No
 debate of alternatives takes place in its chambers, and the
 Assembly has never failed to endorse regime policy.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 With the exception of one representative of the U.S. Helsinki
 Watch Committee in October, who was not allowed to meet with
 Bulgarian citizens, Bulgaria has not admitted any independent
 group to investigate questions of human rights violations and
 has not responded to or communicated with any nongovernmental
 human rights groups. It is a member of the United Nations
 Human Rights Commission. The Government rejects all criticism
 of its domestic situation as intervention in internal matters,
 yet Bulgarian media report in detail on human rights problems
 in Chile, El Salvador, and South Africa. Following the 1984
 arrest of human rights activists in Mikhailovgrad, no private
 organizations are known to have met in defense of individual
 liberties.
 Amnesty International in its 1985 Report (covering the year
 1984) expressed concern about the imprisonment of prisoners of
 conscience, allegations of ill-treatment of political
 prisoners, and the use of the death penalty. Freedom House
 rated Bulgaria "not free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 During the past four decades, Bulgaria, with a population of
 just under 9 million, has changed from an overwhelmingly
 agricultural country to one with a mix of industry and
 agriculture. Communist rulers have emphasized state ownership
 of nearly all means of production, rapid economic growth,
 central control over the economy, and industrial development.
 The country remains a large producer of agricultural goods,
 and Bulgarians may sell produce raised on their own private
 plots.
 In 1985 daily life was disrupted by a nationwide regimen of
 electric power rationing that resulted from fuel shortages.
 In some areas, the use of water was restricted. Officially
 there is no unemployment, but during 1985 the Bulgarian press
 began openly to criticize traditional policies guarazlteeing
 job security as a disincentive to production efficiency.
 
 
 936
 BULGARIA
 Legislation considered in 1985 would provide for dismissal of
 enterprise managers who failed to meet their assigned goals.
 Although Bulgaria has poor people, there do not appear to be
 overwhelming disparities of poverty and wealth. Success in
 the party or Government results more in the acquisition of
 privileges than great personal fortunes.
 Bulgaria has achieved success in feeding, educating, and
 providing for the essential needs of its citizens. A system
 of government facilities caters to the health needs of
 citizens. Life expectancy at birth in 1985 averaged 72.71
 years, and the infant'mortality rate was 16.20 per 1,000 live
 births. Medical care appears to be adequate. Bulgarian
 leaders have expressed concern about the country's falling
 population growth rate (0.3 percent) and have established
 financial incentives for people to marry and for families to
 have more children. Despite extensive construction of new
 public apartment buildings in the past decade, however, an
 urban housing shortage continues. Students are not charged
 tuition for education through the university level. A system
 of merit selection governs university admission, although
 certain priorities and privileges go to the children of the
 influential. Adult literacy is high.
 Employment practices seem to be in compliance with the legal
 minimum working age of 16 years. The workweek is set at 42.5
 hours, but participation in unpaid supplementary "brigades"
 can lengthen working hours on various occasions during the
 year. The State sets wage scales, including minimum.wages,
 and defines minimum pensions. The Labor Code and regulations
 on pensions are now under review. A national labor safety
 program exists, but standards of enforcement vary greatly
 among productive enterprises.
 Women are guaranteed equal rights with men, and all citizens
 are declared to be equal before the law, regardless of-
 national origin, creed, social status, education, or sex.
 Bulgarian women do not appear to suffer overt discrimination
 as regards educational and professional opportunities.
 One-half of the openings for university students available
 each year are reserved by law for women, who consequently are

 occupations in areas such as farming, light industry, and
 cleaning and maintenance.
