 ETHIOPIA
 A coalition of ethnic-based insurgencies toppled the repressive
 regime of President Mengistu Haile-Mariam in late May, bringing
 profound political changes to Ethiopia. The former president
 flew into exile in Zimbabwe after losing a series of decisive
 battles to an umbrella group known as the Ethiopian People's
 Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). In addition, the
 Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) seized the Red Sea
 coastline, ending a long struggle for control of the former
 Italian colony of Eritrea. In July a broad-based national
 conference adopted a charter establishing a multiparty
 Transitional Government (TG) to organize democratic and
 multiparty national elections before 1994. EPRDF Secretary
 General Meles Zenawi was elected President of the TG. The
 National Conference also acknowledged a separate provisional
 government for Eritrea under EPLF Secretary General Issaias
 Afwerki and endorsed an internationally supervised referendum
 on Eritrea's political future to be held in 2 years.
 The new leadership quickly dismantled the extensive military
 and security apparatus of the Mengistu government, including
 the police and surveillance operations by neighborhood
 committees known as kebeles. The joint military/police force
 of the TG consists of some 120,000 to 140,000 EPRDF regulars.
 While retaining the kebele structure for administrative
 purposes, the TG instituted a parallel system of thousands of
 "Peace and Stability Committees" with sweeping powers of
 investigation, arrest, and detention. Complicating the picture
 were thousands of armed followers of other political groups
 represented in the TG. At year's end, the TG had not been able
 to eliminate armed ethnic clashes, particularly in the
 countryside. In Eritrea, approximately 90,000 EPLF regulars
 made up the provisional government's military/security force.
 The civil war extended into the principal food producing and
 coffee growing areas of Ethiopia, which was already one of the
 world's least developed countries with an annual per capita
 income of $120. When Mengistu's government finally collapsed,
 over a million civilians had been displaced by war; food and
 fuel shortages were chronic; the national treasury was empty;
 foreign exchange was reduced to less than 1 day of imports; and
 inflation reached an annual rate of 21 percent. At year's end,
 both the TG and EPLF provisional government had under
 consideration draft plans calling for partial privatization and
 market oriented reforms, leading in the direction of a mixed
 economy.
 Civil war remained the primary factor affecting human rights
 during the first 5 months. All parties to the conflict
 committed major violations, including summary executions,
 although the majority of these came from the Mengistu forces
 (see Section 1.g.). The change of government brought a
 significant improvement in human rights, particularly with
 respect to freedom of speech, assembly, association, religion,
 and travel. The new leaders in both Addis Ababa and Asmara
 stated their commitment to the establishment of multiparty
 democracy and rule of law with full respect for human rights.
 They began important investigations into extrajudicial killings
 and disappearances by the Mengistu regime. Nevertheless, there
 were new and serious human rights abuses, notably in the hasty,
 ill-prepared expulsions of non-Eritreans from Eritrea; in the
 detentions without charge of thousands of former Mengistu
 government officials; in the political disenfranchisement of
 former members of the now banned Workers' Party of Ethiopia
 (WPE); in the use of force in response to growing criminal
 
 
 119
 ETHIOPIA
 activity and political challenges; and, above all, in the
 continuing ethnic instability and politically motivated
 violence, which by the end of 1991 had taken several thousand
 lives.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 -Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial.Killing
 The Mengistu government carried out thousands of political and
 extrajudicial killings during its 17 years in power. The
 victims' of these killings were suspected opponents of the
 regime or-sympathizers with any number of opposition groups;
 ethnic Eritreans, Oromos, and Tigrayans were frequently
 targeted. Captured insurgents were often executed.
 Throughout the civil war, EPRDF forces generally abided by
 conduct codes which forbid the killing of unarmed prisoners.
 However, they frequently executed summarily accused looters,
 whether civilian or military, including EPRDF members. EPRDF
 radio appeals in March to the general public in Gonder and
 Gojam to apprehend escaping Mengistu government officials
 probably sparked some unnecessary killings, but those
 surrendering to the EPRDF.were given protection. Faced with
 demonstrations during the first 2 days following their takeover
 of Addis Ababa, the EPRDF acknowledged shooting at least nine
 demonstrators dead, some of them armed. A number of accused
 looters were also executed without trial. There were-no
 instances, however, of extrajudicial killing of former Mengistu
 government officials.
 After the TG came to power in July, there were dozens of
 instances of violent clashes in the countryside-between local
 military elements of political parties within the TG. In a
 number of instances, rival groups repeatedly engaged in
 politically or ethnically motivated killings. The ready
 availability of automatic weapons contributed to the problem.
 In one such case, hundreds of members of one ethnic group were
 slain by a rival group armed with automatic-weapons on the
 shores of Lake Abaya in early June. EPRDF and Oromo Liberation
 Front (OLF) troops clashed in the Arsi region in November and
 in the Welega and Harerge regions in December. Also in ,
 December, local EPRDF forces fired on a motorcade carrying the
 leader of the Sidamo Liberation Movement (SLM) in Awasa (Sidamo
 region), resulting in at least one death. In this and other
 cases, the national.leadership-of the political groups
 intervened to mediate and investigate. When wrongdoing was-
 uncovered,.the EPRDF appeared more likely to discipline its
 members than other political groups.
 In Eritrea the Mengistu government summarily executed dozens of
 civilians 4uring the first 5 months of the year. EPLF
 assassination teams also targeted civilians whom it accused of
 collaboratimg with the Mengistu government. ..At least four
 civilians, including a member of the Mengistu government's
 national parliament, were assassinated early in the year.
 Since the EPLF provisional government took power in Eritrea in
 late May, there have been no allegations of politically
 motivated or extrajudicial killings.
 
 
 120
 ETHIOPIA
 b. Disappearance
 In previous years, thousands of suspected opponents of the
 Mengistu government disappeared, and a number of Mengistu
 government officials also disappeared in areas falling under
 insurgent control.
 Since the TG came to power in Addis Ababa, there have been
 charges and countercharges among its various political parties
 of politically motivated violence in the countryside, including
 some disappearances of party workers.
 In Eritrea, the former director of the Asmara police hospital
 disappeared after being taken into EPLF custody in May.
 International human rights organizations tried to trace reports
 that a half-dozen other persons, most arrested in Addis Ababa
 and repatriated to Eritrea, also disappeared while in EPLF
 custody.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 During the Mengistu era, both pelitical and criminal prisoners
 were routinely subjected to physical abuse and torture,
 including beatings and whippings, electrical shocks, and
 suffocation, during interrogations. Female detainees were
 frequently raped. Under the TG, Ethiopian television has aired
 testimony from former victims of such torture.
 There have been no allegations of torture in Ethiopian jails,
 prisons, or detention centers since Mengistu's ouster. Three
 weeks after capturing Addis Ababa, the interim EPRDF
 administration announced that all detained Mengistu government
 officials would be treated humanely. The National Charter of
 the TG abjures torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading
 treatment or punishment.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Despite protections contained in the 1987 constitution,
 citizens suspected of opposing the Mengistu government were
 subject to arrest and detention without charge or judicial
 review. In addition, thousands were detained without charge
 over the years under states of emergency declared by the
 Mengistu government in Eritrea and Tigray, which permitted
 indefinite detention.
 At the beginning of 1991, Mengistu's government was believed to
 have an estimated 500 persons under political detention, most
 of them without charge. In the days immediately preceding the
 EPRDF capture of Addis Ababa, Mengistu government jailers set
 free most prisoners held in the city, criminal as well as
 political. The TG denied inheriting any political prisoners
 detained by the Mengistu government. The Mengistu government
 did not use exile as a means of political control, but more
 than 1 million citizens fled the country during the Mengistu
 years to escape war and persecution.
 The TG National Charter approved in July prohibits arbitrary
 arrest, detention, and exile. Since their seizure of power in
 late May, however, the new authorities have detained thousands
 of civilians without charge, the largest number being senior
 Mengistu government or WPE officials arrested solely because of
 the position they held. Also detained were former Mengistu
 government officials accused of corruption or believed involved
 
 
 ETHIOPIA
 in violations of humanitarian law. While thousands were
 subsequently released, additional suspects continued to be
 arrested on the recommendation of local Peace and Stability
 Committees throughout the country, In addition, the TG set up
 "Complaints Review and Grievance Clearing Committees" to
 investigate allegations of'corruption or abuse of power.
 At year's end, the TG authorities acknowledged having 1,522
 Mengistu government civilians under detention who had still not
 been charged-a consequence, TG officials said, of abolishing
 the Mengistu police force (formally charged with
 'investigations) and suspending Mengistu public prosecutors and
 judges., In addition, other civilians, perhaps hundreds, have
 been detained without charge by the EPRDF or other political
 organizations around the country. In November the TG detained
 four nationals from neighboring Djibouti without charge,
 reportedly at the behest of the Djiboutian authorities. In the
 absence of a police force, investigations became the
 responsibility of EPRDF administrators, local Peace and
 Stability Committees, Complaints Review Committees, and
 personnel from the newly reconstituted Ministries of Internal
 Affairs and Defense. The new judicial system was not yet in
 place at the end of 1991.
 With support from international donors, the TG demobilized the-
 majority of the 350,000 to 450,000 soldiers from the defeated
 Mengistu army. According to the International Committee of the
 Red Cross (ICRC), of the 250,000 former soldiers originally
 held in TG detention facilities, all but 13,275 had been
 released-by the end of 1991. Of those still in -detention,
 9,500 were disabled war veterans accommodated for humanitarian-
 reasons, and 1,100 were former officers detainedofor possible
 war crimes trials.
 In Eritrea the Mengistu government had detained hundreds of
 civilians suspected of sympathizing with the EPLF during the
 first 5 months of the year. In the port of Aseb, several
 hundred ethnic Eritreans and Tigrayanswere also detained,
 including drivers operating U.N. vehicles delivering relief
 food. Of the 85,000 Mengistu military captured by the EPLF in
 May (see Section l.g.), all but 900 had been repatriated to
 Ethiopia by the end of the year. While no formal charges had
 been brought against the 900, all were suspected of war
 crimes.- Under an agreement with the TG, these 900 were to be
 repatriated to Ethiopia for possible trial. In addition, the
 EPLF acknowledged having detained 300 Mengistu government and
 WPE officials still under detention without charge in December,
 as well as 600 other civilians accused of criminal offenses.
 While difficult to evaluate, some human rights monitoring
 groups believe the number of civilians detained in Eritrea at
 year's end was several times the figure given by the EPLF.
 The EPLF provisional government published new civil and
 criminal codes on September 15 which contain a full range of
 judicial safeguards, including habeas corpus and a 48-hour
 limit on detention without charge (with the possibility of no
 more than two 14-day extensions with judicial authorization).
 The EPLF provisional government does not use exile as a means
 of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 For the first 5 months of 1991, the judicial system was based
 on the 1987 Mengistu government's constitution which
 established'a Supreme Court and regional courts elected by the
 
 
 122
 ETHIOPIA
 respective parliaments. Separate military courts handled not
 only trials involving the Mengistu government military but were
 also set up in contested areas. Despite constitutional
 provisions for judicial independence and public trials, cases
 deemed political in nature were often subject to manipulation
 and meddling by senior Mengistu officials.
 The EPRDF capture of power brought sweeping changes in the
 judicial system: the Mengistu government's Ministries of
 Defense and Internal Affairs were disbanded and reorganized
 only after a delay of 7 weeks; the entire police force was
 dismissed (customs police and traffic police were later
 reinstated); and government judges and public prosecutors were
 suspended. EPRDF soldiers initially assumed all police
 functions, but within weeks Peace and Stability Committees had
 been established at most local and regional levels. On June
 18, the EPRDF announced that all trials of Mengistu government
 detainees would be fair and public, follow due process, be open
 to international observers, with defendants having the right to
 counsel. The TG National Charter approved in July also
 promised fair and public trials before independent and
 impartial tribunals, presumption of innocence, and no ex post
 facto criminal laws.
 As of late 1991, no trials of former Mengistu governnient
 officials had begun. TG Ministers of Justice and Internal
 Affairs were first appointed in August. By year's end, the
 TG's overworked Council of Representatives still had not
 established the independent judiciary called for in the July
 Charter. The Council passed legislation at the end of December
 establishing new police forces at the national and regional
 level. A draft proposal to establish an office of the special
 prosecutor for the cases of former Mengistu officials was
 circulating. Investigations proceeded throughout the year,
 however, carried out variously by local Peace and Stability
 Committees which sometimes gathered testimony in public
 meetings, Complaints Review and Grievance Clearing Committees
 in the workplace, EPRDF administrators, and personiiel from the
 newly reconstituted Ministries of Internal Affairs and
 Defense. The Council banned former WPE members from any
 political activity, and hundreds of former WPE members lost
 their jobs in some ministries, including noncareer diplomats
 abroad. Others in the civil service, many of whom had joined
 the WPE reluctantly or in order to further their careers, found
 themselves increasingly harassed by their TG superiors.
 In Eritrea the EPLF provisional government established a
 separate judiciary in September. At the apex of the EPLF
 provisional government's judicial system is a 12-member High
 Court made up of legal professionals appointed by the EPLF
 provisional government's Justice Secretary, who was responsible
 for court administration. Appointments to lower courts were
 made by the President of the High Court. Some judges from the
 Mengistu government were retained. To ensure judicial
 independence, judges were given immunity from arrest and were
 subject to removal only by an independent committee.
 Investigations into alleged wrongdoing were the reponsibility
 of the EPLF provisional government's Secretary for Security,
 whereas prosecutions fell to a newly established Attorney
 General's office. The Eritrean court system became functional
 only in November, and there had been no trials of former
 Mengistu government officials by year's end.
 
 
 123
 ETHIOPIA
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Mengistu government's police and security ignored
 constitutional requirements to obtain warrants for the search
 of offices or private homes, monitoring mail, or conducting
 visual and electronic surveillance, and operated extensive nets
 of informers, especially through urban kebeles.
 During the first several weeks after their capture of Addis
 Ababa and other cities, EPRDF forces conducted house-to-house
 searches'(sometimes involving forced entry) for firearms and
 former Mengistu officials in hiding. The TG National-Charter
 approved in July prohibits arbitrary interference in privacy,
 family,, home, or correspondence. Nevertheless, complaints
 remained common about'intrusions into private premises by the
 frequently rotated EPRDF'troops who provided public security in
 urban areas in the absence of a police force. Local Peace and
 Stability Committees often appeared to act arbitrarily in
 authorizing searches and arrests by the EPRDF. Unlicensed
 possession of firearms continued to bedevil TG authorities, and
 private and commercial vehicles were subject to random
 searches. Former WPE members were required to report to their
 local Committee every Sunday; failure to do so could result in
 arrest.
 The July National Charter explicitly condemned the Mengistu
 government's previous coercive policies of resettlement and
 villagization and promised priority attention to the
 rehabilitation of persons uprooted under these prbgrams.
 In Eritrea the EPLF also engaged'in'searches of homes and
 offices for firearms and Mengistu government officials in
 hiding. By October the EPLF provisional government authorities
 said legal protections against warrantless searches were in
 place.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 Untold thousands of civilians died in the civil war which ended
 in May 1991. All parties to the conflict it times engaged in
 military operations with scant regard for civilian lives.
 There is no reliable estimate of the number of civilian
 casualties during the final months of the war.
 The Mengistu g6vernment stepped up its enlistment efforts to
 include all veterans, retired police and security officers, and
 reservists, some in their 50's and 60's. Despite guidance that
 new recruits be 18 years or older, some recruits as young as 14
 were caught up in indiscriminate sweeps outside schools or in
 marketplaces. Lethal force was sometimes used in stopping
 those trying to avoid recruitment. While relying primarily on
 volunteers, the EPLF, EPRDF, and OLF on occasion enlisted
 minors, some as young as those conscripted by Mengistu's
 government.
 The retreating Mengistu government military units generally
 exercised good discipline with regard to treatment of civilians
 in the final months of the war. In some instances, however,
 such as in Nekemte (Welega region) in late March, in Ambo
 (Shewa region) in mid-April, and in western Eritrea in late
 May, there were credible allegations of robbery, rape,
 beatings, and killings of civilians by undisciplined Mengistu
 troops. EPRDF and EPLF soldiers showed a high degree of
 
 
 124
 ETHIOPIA
 discipline and ii  behavior toward civilians throughout the
 final stages 6ftie war.
 Upwards of 1,000 civilians died on May 28 while attempting to
 loot a munitions plant booby-trapped by the Mengistu government
 in the Addis Ababa suburb of Gulele. Another 140 civilians
 died and 150 were wounded when former Mengistu government
 military personnel sabotaged a munitions dump in the Nefas Silk
 suburb'on June 4. The explosion and resulting fire also left
 7,000 homeless.
 Treatment of captured Mengistu government military personnel
 was reportedly good, thereby enabling the insurgents to recruit
 large numbers into their ranks. Nevertheless, the former rebel
 groups and the Mengistu government alike refused to accord
 those captured prisoner of war status and barred the ICRC
 access throughout the course of the war. Shortly after
 capturing Asmara, the EPLF expelled an ICRC medical team there
 that had been assisting with war wounded. The ICRC office in
 Addis Ababa remained open after the EPRDF took power and worked
 closely with the TG in setting up transit camps for demobilized
 Mengistu government soldiers. In December the TG authorized
 the ICRC to visit all former Mengistu government and WPE
 civilians remaining in detention.
 The international relief structure largely held together
 throughout the year, although military operations occasionally
 interfered with the flow of relief. While not as a result of
 deliberate effort by the Mengistu government or its opponents,
 the war seriously disrupted the flow of relief to Somali and
 Sudanese refugee camps in the southeast and southwest,
 resulting in serious food ration deficits in some camps.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press did not exist under the Mengistu
 government. The government strictly controlled the content of
 the state-owned and -operated information media, and individual
 expression of unauthorized political opinions or views could
 and did result in imprisonment.
 The TG's National Charter, approved in July, provides for
 freedom of opinion and expression and the right to impart these
 through any media, although, pending action on a new press law,
 all broadcast and most print media remained under state control
 through the end of 1991. Nevertheless, individuals and
 political groups, including those critical of the TG, had
 access to the state-controlled media. A TG proclamation
 guaranteeing free and equal access by all political
 organizations to state-controlled broadcast and print media
 took effect in November and appeared to be respected in
 practice. Three political parties (the EPRDF, the OLF, and the
 Oromo People's Democratic Organization, or OP.DO) began
 publishing their own newspapers in the fall. Ethiopia's first
 independent tabloid newspaper began appearing irregularly by
 year's end. Owing to lack of foreign exchange, newsprint
 remained in short supply, and foreign magazines and newspapers
 were not readily available.
 In Eritrea the EPLF provisional government 'abolished the
 Mengistu government's censorship boards. It imposed no
 restrictions on independent newspakers, and four small
 newspapers printed by Eritrean religious organizations
 
 
 125
 ETHIOPIA
 circulated freely. In September the EPLFgovernment introduced
 a new government newspaper, which due to shortage of newsprint
 was published only twice, a week. The availability of foreign
 magazines and newspapers was also restricted due to lack of
 foreign exchange. -The state-controlled newspaper and radio
 broadcasts allowed access to opposition views.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly and association expanded greatly during
 1091. Despite constitutional guarantees, the Mengistu
 government did not'allow citizens to organize or demonstrate
 against official policies, andit influenced or controlled most
 organizations in the country.
 The day after entering Addis Ababa, the EPRDF banned
 demonstrations after several turned violent. In'the weeks that
 followed, however, the EPRDF interim administration permitted
 dozens of peaceful demonstrations. The July National Charter
 endorsed freedom of association, peaceable assembly, and.the
 right to engage in unrestricted political activity and to
 organize political parties. On August 15, the TG issued a
 proclamation recognizing the right to demonstrate, and popular
 demonstrations became routine around the country, including
 those protesting TG policies.
 While there was a proliferation of political organizations (59,
 by the end of the year) after the TG was formed, not all
 political parties were.free to organize. Mengistu's WPE and
 its various appendages were dissolved after the EPRDF seized
 power in late May. The ban was later endorsed by the TG's
 Council of Representatives in August.
 While not formally banned, certain expatriate groups which
 reject the principles of the National Charter were also not
 free to organize in the country, among them: the Coalition of
 Ethiopian Democratic Forces, the Ethiopian People's
 Revolutionary Party, and the All-Ethiopian Socialist Movement
 (MEISON). On August 15, the TG issued a proclamation requiring
 organizers to inform authorities of public political meetings
 48 hours in advance. While implementation of the proclamation
 did not prove restrictive to organizations which gave notice,
 in some cases local EPRDF administrators in the countryside
 cited the proclamation as justification for breaking up
 unauthorized political meetings and sometimes arresting
 participants. In November three executives of the United
 Democratic Nationals (UDN) party were arrested after
 participants in an authorized UDN demonstration attacked TG
 security personnel. 'The UDN leaders were charged with
 responsibility for the incident under the terms of their
 demonstration permit, and a trial in one of the civilian courts
 still functioning'was scheduled for .January 1992. As of the
 end of 1991, the need for procedures for registering political
 parties and other organizations was under discussion in the TG
 Council of Representatives.
 In Eritrea, by contrast, the EPLF was synonymous with the
 provisional government, and there were no restrictions on the
 freedom of assembly; no permits for meetings were required.
 EPLF provisional government leaders declared all individuals
 and groups were entitled to express their views freely in the
 period leading up to the referendum. As of late 1991, no rules
 for the registration of political or other organizations had
 been drafted.
 
 
 126
 ETHIOPIA
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Following the 1974 revolution, the Ethiopian Orthodox Church
 lost its status as state church and saw its extensive land
 holdings-perhaps as much as 30 percent of all cultivated land
 at the time-confiscated by the State. Under the Mengistu
 government, all religions were declared equal, but WPE members
 were prohibited from religious worship services, and references
 to any deity were not allowed to appear in the media. Certain
 religions, particularly foreign Protestant evangelical
 organizations, were persecuted for alleged political
 activities, their leaders arrested, their followers sometimes
 killed, and many churches closed. The Jehovah's Witnesses were
 totally banned.
 Since coming to power in July, TG officials have advocated
 complete freedom of religion. The July National Charter
 guaranteed freedom of religion, including private and public
 worship and the right of conversion. Across southern Ethiopia,
 the TG returned hundreds of Protestant churches closed by the
 Mengistu government in the late 1970's. It lifted the ban on
 the Jehovah's Witnesses; 4,000 adherents held their first Bible
 study in public in September. The construction of some
 mosques, halted 15 years ago, resumed. Links with foreign
 religious bodies were freely allowed.
 The TG authorities appeared to intervene, however, in Ethiopian
 Orthodox Church affairs in late August, forcing the Ethiopian
 Orthodox Patriarch from office, allegedly for cooperation with
 the Mengistu government. The Ethiopian Orthodox Holy Synod
 named a committee to oversee church affairs until a new
 Patriarch could be elected.
 In interconfessional violence in the second half of the year,
 churches and mosques were burned and hundreds may have died.
 TG authorities attempted to mediate the disputes.
 Most of Ethiopia's small Jewish population, known as Beta
 Israel or "Falasha" (a word meaning immigrant or outsider),
 left their traditional homelands in Gonder and Tigray during
 1990 and emigrated to Israel in 1991. By year's end,
 approximately 4,500 Jews were believed to remain in Ethiopia,
 and emigration processing was already under way for these few.
 There were no reports of violence or discrimination against
 Jews or "Feres Mora" (Jewish converts to Christianity) by
 either Mengistu or TG officials during the year.
 In Eritrea the EPLF provisional government also proclaimed
 freedom of religion. The EPLF provisional government announced
 its intention to return church property confiscated by the
 former government and pledged not to interfere in internal
 religious matters. Religious schools closed by the Mengistu
 government were encouraged to reopen.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 During the first 5 months of the year, freedom of movement
 around the country was increasingly restricted by the civil war
 and deteriorating security conditions. Foreign travel,
 emigration, and repatriation were severely restricted by
 Mengistu government policies. In late May, the interim
 government of Lt. General Tesfaye Gebre-Kidan oversaw the
 emergency humanitarian airlift of 14,000 Jews from Addis Ababa
 to Israel.
 
 
 127
 ETHIOPIA
 The National Charter adopted in July recognizes freedom of
 movement, including the right to foreign travel and
 emigration. Citizens no longer require permission for local
 travel; however, there were credible reports that some local TG
 officials discouraged migration between regions in order to
 dampen ethnic tensions. Authorities maintained that Jews have
 the same right of emigration as other citizens without special
 government-to-government agreements that characterized the
 Mengistu regime. Emigration of individual Jews resumed in
 September. The TG also declared that all citizens remaining in
 exile were welcome to return.
 Despite its own domestic turmoil, Ethiopia was host during the
 year to hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing civil war and
 instability in Somalia and Sudan. The TG has been cooperative
 with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
 and other international agencies and generally adheres to
 international norms for refugees. However the TG did not
 maintain a continuous presence in Somali and Sudanese
 refugee/returnee camps, as had the Mengistu government.
 Refugee protection-remained problematic throughout the year.
 In southeastern Ethiopia, approximately 400,000 to 500,000
 Somali refugees were joined by 350,000 Ethiopian returnees
 driven out by fighting in Somalia. An estimated 100,000 Somali
 refugees spontaneously returned to northwest Somalia by the end
 of 1991. There were credible reports of-military recruitment
 among war-displaced: refugees/returnees by the OLF and various
 ethnic Somali-based political groups. Such recruitment
 continued in the second half of the year,'despite TG
 injunctions. In southwestern Ethiopia, the Sudanese People's
 Liberhtion Army (SPLA) forcibly recruited refugees, from
 refugee camps which the SPLA was allowed to control by the
 Mengistu government, into its armed forces. Following -
 Mengistu's fall in late May, the SPLA evacuated, in some cases
 forcibly, tens of thousands of Sudanese refugees from these
 long established camps; less than 10,000 had-returned to
 Ethiopia by year's end.
 In Eritrea tens of thousands of non-Eritrean civilians fled
 during the final stages of the war. Despite intense
 internationalcriticism, the EPLE provisional government
 hastily repatriated to Ethiopia-85,000 former members-of the
 Mengistu military and about 50,000 dependents in June and
 July. Although denying it was making forced expulsions, the
 provisional government also arranged the repatriation to
 Ethiopia of tens of thousands of other non-Eritreans. In
 December the EPLF provisional government expelled 495 orphans
 whom it deemed non-Eritrean. Nonetheless, tens of thousands of
 non-Eritreans have opted to remain in Eritrea. Following the
 announcement of.a general amnesty on June 22,'thousands of
 Eritrean refugees returned voluntarily from Sudan. By year's
 end, the EPLF provisional government had not promulgated an
 emigration/immigration law.
 Section 3 Respect-for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Ethiopians have not enjoyed the right to change their
 government peacefully at any time in the last century. In
 1991, however, the collapse of Mengistu's authoritarian rule
 brought to power new political forces with the express
 intention of creating a multiparty system which, if
 implemented, would enable citizens to change their government
 through democratic elections. For the first 5 months of the
 
 
 128
 ETHIOPIA
 year, political power in the Mengistu government was formally
 institutionalized in the WPE, the only legal party.
 Despite its overwhelming military advantage, the EPRDF invited
 27 political and ethnic organizations to attend a July 1-5
 National Conference held in Addis Ababa. Conference
 l3rticipants agreed on a National Charter that spelled out
 universal guarantees of human rights, recognized the right of
 self-determination for all Ethiopian peoples, and set out a
 timetable for establishing a multiparty democracy by January
 1994 at the latest. The National Conference also set up a
 multiparty Transitional Government (TG) to administer the
 country until a new constitution is drafted and national
 elections held. The coalition of ethnic-based insurgencies
 that toppled the Mengistu government in midyear has attempted
 to forge a new political consensus based on recognition of the
 country's ethnic and linguistic diversity.
 The TG consists of a quasi-legislative Council of
 Representatives (87 members representing 32 political and
 ethnic groups), a Council of Ministers (17 members representing
 7 groups), and an independent judiciary (not yet established by
 year's end). The Cabinet announced in August also included the
 first female minister in Ethiopian history. The EPRDF
 (actually a coalition of four parties) does not enjoy
 majorities in either the Council of Representatives or the
 Council of Ministers, but it captured most of the key positions
 in the Transitional Government (President, Prime Minister,
 Foreign Affairs, Defense, Internal Affairs). EPRDF officials
 are also predominant in the "provisional administrative
 committees" in cities and towns outside the capital. Local and
 regional elections planned for October were delayed until 1992
 as the Council of Representatives debated how to redraw the
 administrative boundaries to reflect ethnic divisions and
 election procedures.
 In Eritrea, on the other hand, the EPLF administers a one-party
 provisional government tasked with governing until an -
 internationally supervised referendum on Eritrea's political
 future can be held. With the general population evenly divided
 between Christians and Muslims, the EPLF emphasized religious
 balance in leadership positions: five of the nine members of
 the EPLF Politburo are Muslim, and Muslims hold half of the
 portfolios in the EPLF provisional government cabinet.
 Delegates to the Addis Ababa National Conference in July, which
 the EPLF attended as an observer, supported interim
 administration for Eritrea and recognized the Eritrean people's
 right to self-determination through an internationally
 supervised referendum, which the EPLF agreed to defer for up to
 2 years. In September the EPLF provisional government invited
 U.N. assistance in supervising the referendum, and in December
 the TG officially requested U.N. assistance in the Eritrean
 referendum. Once the referendum is held, EPLF leaders said
 they plan to convene a constituent assembly to draft a new
 constitution based on a multiparty political system and
 democratic elections.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude.Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In October a group of private citizens organized Ethiopia's
 first independent human rights monitoring body: the Ethiopian
 Human Rights Council (EHRCO), headed by a prominent academic
 and frequent critic of the TG. Also in October, two other
 
 
 ETHIOPIA
 private groups formed to further political dialog-and promote
 respect for democratic rights: the Ethiopian Congress for
 Democracy-(ECD) and Forum-84. All three groups have been
 allowed to operate freely and have access to state-controlled
 media to broadcast information about their activities. As of
 December, there had been no attempts to form any-local human
 rights monitoring group in Eritrea.
 The Mengistu government had a long record of resistance to
 international efforts to investigate human rights-abuses. The
 new TG has been generally willing to discuss human rights
 concerns with diplomatic missions and international and
 nongovernmental organizations. Amnesty International
 representatives had their first free and unrestricted visit to
 Ethiopia in-July and visited again in December to investigate
 alleged violations of human rights. An Africa Watch delegation
 visited Ethiopia in October. Both groups were received by
 high-level TG officials and given prominent coverage in the
 state-controlled media.
 In Eritrea the EPLF provisional government expelled the ICRC
 shortly after seizing power in-May, but in December agreed to a
 reestablished ICRC presence to cooperate with local authorities
 in the field of orthopedics. EPLF officials agreed in
 principle that international and nongovernmental organizations
 be allowed access to investigate human rights conditions. In
 December the EPLF provisional government received an Amnesty
 International delegation.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,.
 ,Language, or Social Status
 More than 72 disparate ethnic groups, most having their own
 tribal languages, make up Ethiopia's population of over 50
 million. The inability of the Mengistu government to deal in a
 noncoercive manner with the political and socioeconomic
 aspirations of these various groups contributed decisively to
 its downfall. The National Charter affirms the right of all
 Ethiopian peoples to preserve separate languages and
 identities, with recourse to self-determination, including
 independence.
 The TG abolished the Mengistu government's Revolutionary
 Ethiopian Women's Association (REWA), an appendage of the
 banned WPE, and detained the former chairwoman without charge.
 No successor organization has been formed.
 Despite protections afforded them in the 1987 constitution,
 women are accorded low social status in many traditional
 cultures in the country. U.N. studies document marriage at
 very young ages, hard and time-consuming labor, unequal
 employment opportunities, and below average wages in urban
 areas. However, women in the-major Ethiopian ethnic groups
 (Amhara, Oromo, Tigrayan) enjoy certain economic and legal
 rights equal to men; they may inherit, sell, or buy property,
 and engage freely in commerce. Despite a large number of
 female soldiers in the EPRDF forces, women are not well
 represented in leadership positions in the EPRDF or any of the
 other newly formed parties.
 The TG has established a national committee on traditional
 practices considered harmful to women. Among them: female
 circumcision (affecting fourth-fifths of all Ethiopian women);
 tatooing (a possible means of AIDS virus transmission);
 insertion of lip and ear plates among some southwestern tribes;
 
 
 130
 ETHIOPIA
 nutritional taboos; and child marriage. Domestic violence
 remains common. While women have recourse to police protection
 and official prosecution in cases of domestic violence,
 societal norms and fear of loss of the social security that
 marriage provides inhibit many women from seeking legal
 redress. The TG established a new desk for women's rights in
 the Ministry of Justice.
 In Eritfea the EPLF provisional government worked to
 accommodate nine indigenous ethnic groups and Christian-Muslim
 divisions in the Eritrean population of 3 to 4 million. Women
 in Eritrea are accorded inferior social status in many
 traditional cultures. Nevertheless, participation by women in
 the armed struggle-one-third of EPLF fighters were female---is
 working to change attitudes. Six women sit on the 71-member
 EPLF Central Committee. The EPLF provisional government
 codified a broad range of rights for Eritrean women in
 mid-September, including guarantees of equal educational
 opportunity; land ownership, equal pay for equal work, and
 other economic and legal rights; and legal sanctions against
 domestic violence. The campaign against dangerous traditional
 practices, including female circumcision, nutritional taboos,
 and traditional birth methods was taken up by the National
 Union of Eritrean Women.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Under the Mengistu government, the nonagricultural labor force
 was mandatorily organized into a single trade union federation,
 the Ethiopian Trade Union (ETU), under the control of the
 ruling WPE. Agricultural workers were organized in the
 Ethiopian Peasant's Association (EPA), also under WPE control.
 Despite guarantees in the 1987 constitution, workers and
 farmers were not permitted to organize outside the ETU and EPA,
 and the WPE approved candidate slates for all union officials.
 The right to strike was recognized in principle, but forbidden
 in practice.
 Upon taking power, the Transitional Government (TG) dissolved
 the ETU and EPA at the national level. The TG National Charter
 recognizes the right to form and join trade unions. Beginning
 in July, the TG organized elections for new union officials at
 the factory-level, barring former members of the WPE and
 security personnel from voting and holding office. Similar
 elections were held in those peasant associations that survived
 the transition.
 By the end of 1991, no new new national bodies for workers and
 peasants had yet been established, but planning was under way
 by the TG for convening a national labor congress to discuss
 the issue. The TG's Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs was
 responsible for drafting a new labor code; in the interim, the
 existing 1975 Labor Code remained in effect. Under this Code,
 the right of affiliation to international organizations was
 reserved to the ETU. Despite its dissolution, the ETU
 technically remained an affiliate of the Communist-dominated
 World Federation of Trade Unions at the end of the year.
 Workers were free to form and join unions of their own choosing
 without TG authorization, and this right was exercised
 extensively. The 1975 Labor Code prohibited discrimination
 against union members by management, but union members claimed
 that occasional harassment continued. By October approximately
 
 
 131
 ETHIOPIA
 1,500 unions-existed at the plant and factory level. These
 unions iwere free of state interference, but the new political
 parties especially the EPRDF have been involved in the
 formation of some unions. In the absence of official
 quidelinds, TG officials have been tolerant of strikes and
 protests in the workplace. Management frequently accused the
 TG of being over indulgent with labor demands. In one such
 case, EPRDF troops responded to charges by a local labor union
 by arresting at gunpoint two midlevel managers at one of the
 capital's leading hotels; they remained under arrest on charges
 of corruption at year's end.
 Upon taking power in Eritrea, the EPLF provisional government
 similarly dissolved the ETU and EPA. On September 15, the EPLF"
 provisional government published a new Labor Code which accords
 workers the right to join unions of their choice and'the right
 to strike. Eritrean courts were given the power to order
 workeris to delay strikes for 50 days pending-negotiations.
 Should negotiations-fail, unions are required to 5ive the EPLF
 provisional government Labor Department a further 7-day notice
 before any strike. There were no strikes in Eritrea in 1991.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 In principle the Mengistu government accepted international
 conventions on collective-bargaining and signed hundreds of
 individual c6llective bargdining agreements over the last
 decade. In practice, collective bargaining, did not exist;
 wages were set by the government in the public sector and by
 employers with government oversight in the private sector.
 The 1975 Labor Code includes the right to organize and bargain
 collectively. Under the 1975 Code, wages are to be set in
 negotiations between unions and management. If no agreement-
 can be reached, a disputes committee is formed, composed of two
 representatives-each from the union and management and a ,
 committed chairman (usually a member of management). If an
 agreement still cannot be found, the dispute goes to the
 Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs for settlement. Within a
 month of taking power, the TG's Prime'Minister announced that
 all collective bargaining agreements negotiated by the Mengistu
 government, frozen since 1990, were valid. Given the-condition
 of the economy, there were no wage increases in state-owned
 enterprises as of late 1991.
 In Eritrea the EPLF provisional government's new Labor Code
 published in mid-September explicitly recognized collective
 bargaining and outlined an--11-step process for reaching
 agreements. "
 There are-no export processing zones in the country.
 c. Prohibition of'Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Slavery was officially abolished in Ethiopia in 1942, but legal
 codes did not address the issue of forced or compulsory labor.
 Under Mengistu's government, citizens were sometimes called on
 to perform certain civic-obligations, including "volunteer"
 assistance in community work projects.- In factories, workers
 were also expected to volunteer extra hours at no pay so that
 production quotas could be met.
 The TG's National Charter adopted in July proscribes slavery
 and involuntary servitude. Local TG officials outside of Addis
 Ababa continued to call on residents to volunteer for
 
 
 132
 ETHIOPIA
 uncompensated community work projects, such as road building
 and emergency road repair. Industries were operating at less
 than half capacity at year's end; in those state-owned
 factories still functioning, workers were still sometimes
 compelled by factory managers to "volunteer" labor in order to
 meet quotas, which could result in cash bonuses.
 In Eritrea forced and compulsory labor was barred under the
 EPLF provisional government's new Labor Code published in
 mid-September. However, there were unconfirmed reports in late
 1991 that some former Mengistu government detainees still held
 in Eritrea without charge had been put to hard labor.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Under the 1975 Labor Code, contract employment of children
 under the age of 14 is prohibited. Both the Mengistu
 government and the new TG appeared to respect this restriction
 in factories, shops, and among domestic workers. The Ministry
 of Labor and Social Affairs was active in enforcing these
 provisions in state-owned enterprises. Nevertheless, underaged
 children were frequently seen peddling and begging on city
 streets or working in the fields in rural areas throughout the
 year.
 In Eritrea the EPLF's new Labor Code published in mid-September
 raised the minimum age for employment to 18. The provisional
 government has also made education compulsory through age 18.
 It remains to be seen how effectively it will be enforced.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The statutory minimum wage, unchanged since 1974, remained low
 and woefully insufficient to provide a decent standard of
 living for an urban worker and family. On the other hand, only
 unskilled day laborers usually receive such a low wage. In
 addition, fringe benefits not required by law (transportation,
 meals, clothing, medical care, shelter) raise the effective
 minimum wage. Low-paid workers often supplement their income
 by holding multiple jobs, with help from the extended family,
 and through subsistence farming. The Ministry of Labor and
 Social Affairs was respozisible for enforcing compliance under
 both the Mengistu government and the Transitional Government.
 The 1975 Labor Code, observed by both the Mengistu government
 and the TG, establishes an 8-hour workday and a 48-hour
 workweek. The maximum legal workweek appeared to be respected
 in practice with the exception of previously noted
 uncompensated "volunteer" labor to meet factory quotas. The
 1975 Code also empowers the Ministry of Labor and Social
 Affairs "to determine protective devices" and to advise on the
 health and safety of workers. Compensation for occupational
 injuries and disabilities is mandatory. The Ministry's
 effectiveness in enforcing health and safety standards
 continues to be hampered by lack of resources.
 In Eritrea the EPLF provisional government's new Labor Code
 published in mid-September retains many provisions of the 1975
 Code, including: a very low minimum wage, an 8-hour workday
 and 48-hour workweek, and stipulations that the health and
 safety of workers be safeguarded, but the degree of enforcement
 is unknown.
