 HUNGARY
 The leadership of the (Communist) Hungarian Socialist Workers
 Party maintains a complete monopoly on political power.
 Although most civil rights are prescribed by the Constitution,
 in practice the exercise of such rights is often arbitrarily
 restricted. Beginning in the 1960's, the party gradually
 eased internal controls and fostered a greater degree of
 economic well-being. Political expression is still tightly
 controlled, and participation in the political process is not
 possible outside the limits set by the party.
 The Soviet Union has maintained military forces in Hungary
 since the end of World War II. In excess of 60,000 Soviet
 soldiers are currently stationed there.
 The secret police and other coercive institutions are active
 but have become more circumspect. The 1968 police
 surveillance law, the 1984 and 1985 decrees on police powers,
 and other such decrees have strengthened the power of the
 police to search citizens without cause and tightened state
 control over duplicating machines and over persons without
 regular employment.
 Economic reform, launched in 1968, is still the key to
 Hungary's relatively tolerant domestic policies. After years
 of belt-tightening, the Government is trying to cope with
 growing popular unhappiness about rising prices and a
 stationary, if not declining, standard of living by allowing
 modest wage increases and moving ahead with economic reforms.
 Hungarians as a whole are significantly freer of the type of
 economic restrictions and state interference in private life
 which characterize other Warsaw Pact members.
 Hungary's human rights record was marred by some negative
 political developments. Implementation of the liberalized
 issuance of passports, for example, remains spotty. The
 authorities in February disallowed a proposed march by
 environmentalists protesting construction of a dam; the police
 forcibly dispersed those who defied the ban. The police
 displayed even less tolerance when they clashed, 1 month
 later, with youths commemorating the 1848 uprising and calling
 for greater freedoms. Extra security measures taken on
 October 23, the 30th anniversary of the 1956 revolution,
 epitomized the overall trend of maintaining firm control over
 potential demonstrations.
 Because of the 1956 anniversary, the authorities were
 especially sensitive to any criticism of General Secretary
 Kadar and the regime's legitimacy. As a consequence, a
 regional literary review was temporarily suspended, and a
 popular playwright was banned from the legal media.
 Furthermore, young artists who sought to publicize the failed
 revolution were threatened with administrative sanctions,
 including expulsion from Budapest. Samizdat (clandestine
 publishing) operations continued to function and even expand,
 although both publishers and distributors were periodically
 subjected to house searches, spot fines, and occasional
 confiscation of printing equipment.

 HUNGARY
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There is no evidence that killing for political motives
 occurred.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reported disappearances.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 No known instances of torture have occurred in Hungary in
 recent years. Citizens, in principle, may bring complaints
 against the police.
 There are three levels of punitive incarceration in Hungary:
 "workhouse," which allows some privileges of visiting, outside
 work, and leaving; "jail," which is more punitive; and
 "prison," which means a maximum-security penitentiary.
 Confinement conditions vary in relation to the category of
 incarceration, but all levels are believed to provide adequate
 diet and health care. Hardened criminals are confined
 separately from those convicted of petty crimes. With varying
 degrees of frequency, depending on levels of imprisonment,
 prisoners have rights to visitation by family members, other
 relatives, and friends. There does not appear to be
 systematic mistreatment of prisoners. Nevertheless, according
 to recent reports, Jozsef Peller, a Catholic conscientious
 objector incarcerated in the Budapest military prison, is
 being mistreated by the prison staff.
 Hungarians very rarely engage in the abuse of psychiatry, i.e.
 the commitment of sane persons to institutions for the
 mentally ill as a form of punishment, but there was one report
 of such practice in 1986. Laszlo Rusai, an unemployed teacher
 and Hungarian dissident, was confined to a mental health
 hospital reportedly after challenging the official
 interpretation of the 1956 revolution and displaying a poster
 about it from his window. The Government, however, denied
 that Rusai's confinement in a psychiatric facility was a
 political sanction.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Citizens are generally free from arbitrary arrest. Upon
 arrest, a detainee must be informed in writing of the offense
 he or she is suspected of having committed and may be held at
 a police station for a maximum of 72 hours before charges must
 be filed. There is no right of bail or provisional pretrial
 liberty. In cases of suspicion for major crimes, a person can
 be held in jail 30 days before trial, renewable twice for a
 maximum of 3 months.
 The penal code contains an article on incitement which permits
 officials to prosecute for a wide range of utterances or
 statements. It is not clear how many cases of incitement
 involve political matters. A penal code provision concerning
 "espionage" provides for punishing "a person who obtains,
 collects, or gives out data which can be used against the
 
 
 942
 HUNGARY
 Hungarian People's Republic with the purpose of forwarding
 them to a foreign government or organization .......Neither the
 nature of the data transmitted nor the nature of the recipient
 organization is clearly defined, thus allowing a broad
 interpretation by the authorities of the kind of "data"
 considered to be proscribed. The police surveillance law was
 strengthened in 1985 to permit the police to place under
 surveillance or in internal exile any citizen or resident of
 Hungary above the age of 16 (rather than 18) for a period of 2
 years (rather than 1 year), renewable for an additional year,
 if that person's attitude represents a permanent danger to the
 internal order or public security of the country. The law has
 not been used in 1986 for political purposes.
 Under an amendment to the Criminal Code which went into effect
 in 1985, a person "who is capable of working but follows a way
 of life of vagrancy" may be punished by loss of liberty for up
 to 2 years or by reformatory and educative labor or by a
 fine. Under this law, work-shirkers may be sentenced to a
 specific workplace, such as a state farm, a mine, or the state
 railways. Many Gypsies have been sentenced under this law.
 There is no evidence to date that the law has been used
 against political dissidents. Forced labor, within the
 meaning of the International Labor Organization's definition,
 has not been employed in Hungary.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There are few closed trials in Hungary. The Constitution
 stipulates that all court proceedings are open, except for
 cases specifically exempted by law. Those which are closed
 usually involve "national security," not otherwise defined.
 In general, judicial procedures are investigatory rather than
 adversarial in nature. There is no trial by jury. Defendants
 have the right to choose their own counsel. Nonpolitical
 trials are more likely to be handled in an impartial manner
 than are trials involving offenses considered to be political.
 It is believed that a number of citizens, including some who
 opted to flee instead of serving in the military, have been
 incarcerated for attempting to leave Hungary without
 government permission. Exact numbers are not known.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution provides for citizens' personal freedom and
 inviolability, the secrecy of correspondence, and the privacy
 of the home, but these provisions are violated when it is in
 the State's interest to do so. Search warrants are generally
 obtained. House searches are conducted by a court order and
 must be carried out in the presence of two witnesses. A
 written inventory of items removed from the premises must be
 prepared. These procedures are generally adhered to. In
 politically motivated cases, however, police do conduct house
 searches without warrants on the pretext of "suspected housing
 code violations."
 Since the 1960's, Hungarian authorities have become more
 tolerant with respect to a person's private activities.
 Formal systems for gathering information on people, such as
 the widespread use of informers and block wardens and overt
 intrusions of the police into the daily life of persons, have
 been substantially curtailed. It is widely assumed, however,
 that private telephone lines are tapped and correspondence
 
 
 943
 HUNGARY
 opened when the authorities have an interest in doing so.
 Hungarians may subscribe to Western publications although such
 subscriptions are expensive in Hungary. Parents who seek to
 provide religious instruction to their children in their homes
 are not harassed. Membership in the Communist Party or in
 party youth and other organizations is not mandatory, though
 the absence of membership may have an adverse impact upon
 career possibilities in some fields. While not compulsory,
 membership in the party's youth and other mass organizations
 (trade unions and professional associations) is a requirement
 for a successful career.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution guarantees free speech and free press, but
 these rights are qualified by the need to conform to the
 "interests of socialism and the people." The Government has
 shown a general willingness to tolerate some expressions of
 dissent without explicit reply or rejoinder. It is prepared,
 however, to harass political dissidents to keep them in check
 and has occasionally expelled them or encouraged their
 emigration to the West. No prominent dissidents were arrested
 in 1986 for opposition activity.
 An unknown number of persons, however, were arrested for
 expressing anti-Communist and/or antiregime utterances. Most
 of these arrests occurred in public, often after the arrestee
 had been drinking. In cases such as these, the arrestee is
 usually charged with incitement. The number of such offenses
 is obfuscated in the official statistics which lump incitement
 with petty nonpolitical offenses.
 In a significant case affecting freedom of speech, one of
 Hungary's foremost playwrights, Istvan Csurka, authorized
 Radio Free Europe to broadcast remarks made in New York on
 March 15 about the alleged genocide of Hungarians elsewhere in
 Europe. As a result, in July the authorities decided to bar
 Csurka from all access to the established media. In response
 to this ban, Csurka declared that he would not return to the
 publishing field until "those morbid circumstances which
 resulted in my suspension will be eliminated." In an August
 interview, Deputy Minister of Culture Vajda claimed that
 Csurka failed to demonstrate "elemental loyalty" by
 cooperating with "propaganda centers" opposed to socialism and
 the Hungarian Government. Csurka's uncensored comments about
 the plight of ethnic Hungarians living in Romania'
 Transylvania and in Slovakia apparently conflicted with
 Hungarian policy on this subject.
 Dissident activity in Hungary remains largely confined to
 several hundred intellectuals who live primarily in Budapest,
 although numbers of working-class youths have also been
 arrested for expressing dissatisfaction with the system.
 Hungarian dissidents meet regularly for private discussion of
 political and other topics. Hungary's economic progress
 during the last decade, its emphasis on consumerism, and its
 willingness to permit more frequent travel to the West than do
 other Warsaw Pact states have served to undercut the appeal of
 dissidents to a broader public. However, the governmental
 decision to go ahead with a highly controversial dam on the
 Hungarian-Czechoslovakian border has increased the public
 appeal of those dissidents most concerned with the environment.
 
 
 944
 HUNGARY
 Nevertheless, even this group of antidam environmentalists was
 effectively barred from presenting its position in the
 established media and had to rely on samizdat (self-published)
 publications plus political advertisements placed in Austrian
 newspapers to convey its views. In response, the Government
 attacked the environmentalists for using the Vienna papers
 rather than for the substance of their arguments.
 Party and government authorities closely supervise the press,
 radio, and television, which are government owned and must
 adhere to the party's ideological guidelines. On September 1,
 1986, the Hungarian press law came into effect and superseded
 a myriad of administrative measures previously in force. The
 new law essentially codifies existing practice but also
 includes some new restrictions and new liberalizations.
 Although some carefully nuanced differing views occasionally
 appear in the press, they are usually well within the general
 constraints imposed by the party. Hungary permits access to
 Western literature, films, television programs, and
 publications. As of 1985, Western periodicals, including the
 International Herald Tribune, Le Monde, the Sunday Times of
 London, and Die Presse, were made available for local currency
 at centrally located kiosks and transportation centers.
 Infrequently, Western viewpoints can be heard on Hungarian
 radio and television. These may be the views of a Western
 spokesperson, broadcast together with those of other
 participants in a panel discussion, or straight reporting of a
 Western official's comments on a topical international issue,
 such as U.S.-Soviet relations. Hungary does not normally jam
 Western radio broadcasts. However, some 1985 broadcasts
 carrying interviews with former Hungarian Prime Minister
 Andras Hegedus and some 1986 programing about the 1956 events
 may have been interfered with. Austrian and Yugoslav radio
 and television broadcasts reach much of the country.
 Pervasive self-censorship in cultural and media circles
 determines the boundaries of free expression. The public
 medium which enjoys the greatest degree of freedom of
 political expression is film, although the more politically
 controversial examples are typically withheld from public
 distribution until the authorities deem fit. The authorities
 have banned the circulation of certain books, magazines, and
 articles considered not to conform with accepted positions.
 The right to publish is restricted for political reasons. For
 example, the June 1986 edition of the regional literary
 journal "Tiszataj" was suspended because of the poems by the
 controversial poet Gaspar Nagy and unflattering commentary
 about the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. In an unusual interview
 in August, Deputy Minister of Culture Vajda claimed that the
 suspension was a result of a "series of errors in publication
 policy... (and) a lack of responsible and democratic workshop
 operations." The journal was later allowed to resume
 publication.
 Several groups of dissidents are active in the preparation and
 distribution of prohibited articles and books in samzidat
 form. Since 1982, the authorities have engaged in a periodic
 campaign of harassment against these activists. Occasional
 press articles have attacked the dissidents and their alleged
 Western supporters. A high level of activity, however,
 continues, and the variety of samizdat expanded in 1986. No
 arrests of samizdat editors or distributors for engaging in
 their illegal activities occurred in 1986. However, the
 
 
 HUNGARY
 police in Budapest regularly exercised their power to impose
 fines on persons involved in unauthorized publishing and
 periodically subjected them to various forms of harassment and
 house searches..
 On September 1, 1986, the Hungarian press law came into effect
 and superseded a myriad of administrative measures previously
 in force. How the new law will influence the limited freedom
 of the press remains to be seen.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Although the Constitution guarantees freedom of assembly and
 the right to form associations, government approval or tacit
 acceptance is required for the exercise of these rights. Such
 approval was not forthcoming when some environmentalists
 wished to hold an "environmental walk" last February to protest
 the Government's decision to participate in the construction
 of a Danube River dam. Those who defied the police ban,
 mostly Austrians, were dispersed by the police. Similiarly,
 unauthorized gatherings of young people on March 15, one of
 Hungary's most important national holidays, resulted in a
 violent clash with the police on Chain Bridge in Budapest.
 The authorities are more tolerant of gatherings in private
 homes. Dissidents sponsor "open houses" on a regular basis
 and Budapest's "flying university" resumed meetings recently
 at which academicians and dissidents lectured on topics not
 discussed elsewhere.
 The Hungarian National Trade Union Council, the largest of all
 mass organizations, is for the most part controlled and
 directed by the party. It serves the purpose of
 indoctrinating workers in party policy as well as representing
 worker interests within certain bounds. The chairman of the
 council is a member of the party Politburo. He represents the
 council in meetings with the party leadership and with the
 Government over labor policy, economic planning, prices,
 wages, and other economic issues. At the local and enterprise
 level, the council has a veto right over state nominations of
 managers and administers a system of shop distribution of bonus
 money, profit sharing, enterprise-controlled housing, health
 care, union vacation plans, and other benefits. Stewards can
 veto management decisions on personnel actions, plant safety,
 and other work-related issues which do not comply with
 collective agreements and labor regulations. Disputed
 questions are referred to higher authorities for arbitration.
 The Constitution does not provide for the right to strike.
 Although work stoppages have reportedly taken place in local
 industries in recent years, there has not been a major strike
 affecting an entire industrial sector in over a quarter of a
 century.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Although freedom of conscience and freedom of religious
 practice are guaranteed in the Constitution, they are subject
 to restrictions. The State in principle opposes but does not
 rigorously impede the practice of religion. Steadfastly
 committed to atheism, the authorities for tactical reasons
 profess the acceptability of believers and nonbelievers
 working together in the interest of "Socialist society." All
 denominations that will accept the Socialist state are
 officially recognized. The Government has generally
 
 
 946
 HUNGARY
 maintained good relations with the hierarchies of the major
 religious denominations, many of which have representatives in
 the Parliament. Professed religious beliefs, however, can
 limit the citizen's advancement in government, industry, and
 the professions. Since 1985 party members have not been
 allowed to attend religious services in the capacity of
 believers.
 There are 19 significant religious denominations in Hungary
 which are recognized by the State, plus several minor sects,
 such as Jehovah's Witnesses. Sizable religious groups include
 Roman Catholics (about 5.25 million), Reformed Calvinists (2
 million), Evangelical Lutherans (0.5 million), and Jews
 (100,000). The total number of persons manifesting some
 religious belief is estimated at 8.5 million out of a
 population of 10.7 million.
 Religious denominations in Hungary have generally good access
 to religious materials, including Bibles and prayer books. In
 many cases, they print their own. They also publish
 periodicals and newspapers, subject to the same state control
 as nonreligious publications.
 Helsinki Watch reported one incident of government suppression
 of religious activity in 1986. On May 11 police broke up a
 service of the Faith Christian Fellowship in Zalaegerszeg and
 temporarily detained the pastor. The worshipers' identity
 cards were confiscated. The police claimed the service was
 illegal. The Fellowship's first application for recognition
 as an official religion was turned down, and a second is still
 pending.
 Churches do not act as organizing centers for dissent. The
 authorities have not detained or arrested any clergy, but
 approximately 117 young men were sentenced to prison terms
 ranging up to 3 years for refusing military service. A right
 of conscientious objection to military service is only
 recognized for two small denominations, the Nazarenes and the
 Seventh-Day Adventists, because it is a precept of these
 religions.
 The major religions have theological training institutes,
 whose capacity is approximately adequate to the number of
 candidates. The State permits limited construction of new
 places of worship. A new synagogue opened in Siofok in June,
 the first since 1945. At the request of the late Catholic
 primate, Cardinal Lekai, a new church is being built in a
 newly populous suburb of-Budapest. In the last 20 years,
 approximately 50 new Baptist churches have been built in
 Hungary. The Baptist construction, partially funded by
 overseas contributions, illustrates the close connections
 Hungarians maintain with their coreligionists and hierarchies
 in other countries. Religious leaders may generally travel
 abroad so long as they have adequate hard currency resources
 to fund the trip.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 All adult citizens are issued an identity booklet, which they
 must carry at all times. They must register with local police
 when moving from one locality to another. However, no
 permission is required for moving within Hungary, except to
 Budapest, where overcrowding has led the Government to
 restrict the number of new inhabitants.
 
 
 947
 HUNGARY
 Foreign travel is relatively easy, the chief constraint being
 restrictions on the amount of hard currency available.
 Hungarian citizens may travel freely in Eastern Europe with
 visas required only for the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. They
 may travel to the West on family visits once a year if
 relatives abroad pay the costs. Nonfamily trips are allowed
 every 3 years, and a modest hard currency allotment is
 available. According to Hungarian sources, 5.5 million
 Hungarians traveled abroad in 1985, of whom 800,000 went to
 non-Communist countries. However, the Government reserves the
 right to refuse permission to travel in cases of "state
 security." This provision of the law continues to be invoked
 to refuse some dissidents passports.
 Emigration for those of working age is allowed only for
 reasons of family reunification, defined as joining a parent,
 spouse, or child abroad. It can be refused if the relative is
 abroad without permission from the Government, until 5 years
 have passed since that person's departure. However, the law
 provides for exceptions to all restrictions in individual
 cases, and persons who are refused permission to emigrate may
 appeal and reapply. Reapplications are sometimes successful,
 especially if there are special humanitarian considerations.
 Approximately 90 percent of Hungarians who are eligible to
 apply to emigrate for purposes of family reunification receive
 permission. Permission is virtually guaranteed to a Hungarian
 over 55 years of age.
 Those who do not receive permission to emigrate normally
 suffer no official sanctions, such as loss of employment or
 housing. Emigrants are allowed to take a modest amount of
 personal property with them. Persons who have emigrated
 legally from Hungary may apply to return for resettlement, but
 their right to return is not guaranteed. They must establish
 that there is housing and employment or other income available
 to them. Persons who have emigrated without permission (i.e.,
 failed to return from a visit abroad), are subject to civil,
 but not criminal, penalties. Any prosecution usually results
 in a suspended sentence and/or fine. They are usually not
 allowed to travel abroad again for 5 years. More serious
 penalties, such as loss of employment, sometimes are imposed.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Hungary is ruled by the leadership of the Hungarian Socialist
 Workers Party. Political participation is not possible
 outside the party or party-sanctioned organizations. The
 Constitution states that the Hungarian Socialist Workers Party
 represents the "working class" and the "interests of the
 whole of the society." The party uses mass organizations such
 as the Patriotic People's Front, trade unions, and the
 Communist Youth League to elicit public support. To a growing
 extent, the party invites the opinions and recommendations of
 nonparty organizations (for example, cooperative associations)
 on policy proposals in which they have an interest, but
 implementation is at the discretion of the party.
 In the 1985 elections, 90 percent of all the seats in the
 National Assembly and all seats in local councils were
 contested by at least two candidates. Although candidates did
 not necessarily have to be members of the Communist Party, all
 had to announce that they accepted the platform of the
 party-controlled Patriotic People's Front and had been deemed
 acceptable by that body. No other political parties were
 
 
 948
 HUNGARY
 allowed. Several members of the democratic opposition who
 sought nomination as candidates were barred from participation
 in the election. The party has stated that it recognizes a
 need to go beyond the development of new electoral forms if
 the elections are to attract genuine public interest, and the
 National Assembly and local councils are to become more
 significant institutions. To date, little has been done to
 fulfill this objective.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government refuses to accept outside charges or
 investigations of alleged human rights violations on the
 grounds that this is "interference in internal affairs."
 Hungary has shown, however, a willingness to engage in
 discussions with other countries on all aspects of the
 Helsinki Final Act, including its human rights provisions.
 This tolerance did not extend to allowing the privately
 organized International Helsinki Federation to hold a cultural
 symposium in a hotel during the opening of the 1985 Cultural
 Forum. The symposium was, however, held in private
 apartments.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Both in theory and in practice, Hungary is sensitive and
 responsive to the cultural aspirations of its recognized
 ethnic minorities. Schools providing instruction in the
 mother tongue and varieties of ethnic expression are
 encouraged on a nondiscriminatory basis. A major reason for
 this policy is the hope of creating a "demonstration effect"
 which will indirectly benefit the millions of Hungarians
 living as minorities in adjacent countries, Although national
 minority groups are encouraged to form their own associations,
 nonnational groups do not enjoy the same degree of freedom.
 When a number of young Jewish people held informal meetings in
 private homes during the summer and fall of 1986 to discuss
 the history and problems of Jewish culture, the sponsors were
 told to desist by the police.
 A large number of Gypsies (estimates range up to 5 percent of
 the population) live in Hungary. They are not recognized as
 an official minority. The Government engages in many programs
 specifically designed to raise the standard of living of
 Gypsies and to help them to adjust to the mainstream of
 Hungarian life. Gypsies are on the average, however,
 considerably less well educated and poorer than the majority
 Magyar population or the recognized ethnic minorities. Candid
 discussion continues to appear in the press and specialized
 literature about the social and economic difficulties
 experienced by Gypsies, including the fact that considerable
 popular prejudice against them exists.
 Women account for one-eighth of the management positions in
 Hungarian industry and agriculture. Approximately half of
 them attained these positions in the past 5 years. Women's
 share of senior positions, such as general director at state
 industrial complexes, is considerably lower. Women's share of
 professional positions has been increasing. About 8 percent
 of Hungarian women are professionals, compared to nearly 9
 percent of men.
 
 
 949
 HUNGARY
 More than one-fifth of the members of the National Assembly
 are women. There are very few women at top levels in the
 Government or party. Only one deputy premier and one other
 member of the 23-person Council of Ministers is a woman. In
 the 21-member Presidential Council, there are only 4 women.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The minimum age for the employment of children is 15, with
 restrictions pertaining to shifts and night work. There are
 no restrictions on minors older than 16 years of age.
 Although there is no national minimum wage in Hungary, wage
 charts are set for each profession according to the
 qualifications of the jobholder. The average official
 workweek is approximately 45 hours. All Hungarians have a
 right to a minimum of 15 days' paid vacation per year; they are
 entitled to 1 additional day for each 3 years of service.
