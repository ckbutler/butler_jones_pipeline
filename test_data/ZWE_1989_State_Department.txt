 ZIMBABWE
 Zimbabwe is governed by President Robert Mugabe and his
 Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), who have dominated the
 legislative and executive branches of government since
 independence. In late 1987, Mugabe signed a unity accord with
 Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) leader Joshua Nkomo
 intended to merge the two parties and fulfill the President's
 publicly stated intention to establish a one-party state. in
 1989 the Zimbabwe Unity Movement (ZUM), a new opposition
 party, emerged with former ZANU stalwart Edgar Tekere as its
 chief. The new party contested seats in 1989 by-elections and
 pledged to run candidates for all 120 parliamentary seats in
 the expected 1990 general election. The Government has
 attempted to restrict ZUM's rise through the arrest and
 detention of its members and restrictions on its ability to
 campaign and have access to the media.
 The armed forces, which number about 50,000 members, are
 primarily deployed to combat Mozambican National Resistance
 (RENAMO) incursions into villages along the eastern border and
 protect various transportation corridors in Mozambique. The
 Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) is responsible for maintaining
 law and order. The Central Intelligence Organization (CIO),
 attached to the President's office, has police powers and can
 arrest, detain, and interrogate suspects ii internal security-
 cases, The CIO has often been accused of human rights abuses,
 including the use of torture.
 Zimbabwe's economy has strong agricultural and mining sectors
 and a diversified manufacturing base. The economy is
 vulnerable to drought and falling commodity prices and is
 hampered by high taxes, price controls, restrictive labor
 regulations, and a chronic shortage of foreign exchange. With
 its important export-import capacity heavily dependent on rail
 links that pass through South Africa, Zimbabwe has undertaken
 a major effort, with Western donor support, to revitalize the
 rail-port system through Mozambique to the town of Beira.
 The unity agreement led to a marked decrease in the number of
 human rights abuses by the Government; a significant exception
 has been the detention of ZUM followers, union members, and
 student leaders. The major incidents of 1989 included RENAMO
 attacks into Zimbabwe which resulted in the murder, kidnaping,
 and disappearance of Zimbabwean citizens, the bombing of a
 house formerly occupied by the African National Congress
 (ANC), the closure of the University of Zimbabwe and the
 arrest of student leaders, the detention and firing of workers
 striking for better wages, and the detention without bail of
 the head of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions for alleged
 subversive activities. In a mandatory relocation program, the
 Goverment moved over 9,000 villagers into protected areas to
 shield them from RENAMO attacks. The Government used these
 attacks to justify continuing the state of emergency (SOE)
 which the Parliament routinely ratifies every 6 months.
 Principal areas of human rights abuse in 1989 included
 torture, arbitrary detention, harassment of lawyers and human
 rights monitors, continued restrictions on freedom of speech
 and press, assembly and association, the right of citizens to
 change their government, and societal violence against women.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political  nd Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reports of political killings or summary
 executions by government security forces in 1989. RENAMO
 forces operating across the Mozambique-Zimbabw'e border
 continued to commit atrocities, including arbitrary killings
 of innocent civilians in both Zimbabwe-and Mozambique. In
 February 1989,.the Minister of Home Affairs reported that
 there had been 420 RENADHO attacks in the preceding 6 months,
 with 93 Zimbabwean civilians killed.
 b. Disappearance
 Human rights observers in both Harare and Bulawayo reported
 that in 1989 t-bere were no new cases of disappearance
 attributable to the Government. There has been, however, no
 progress in locating any of the people, almost all of whom
 were from Ndebele tribal regions, who disappeared in
 1982-1985. Estimates of the number of disappeared ranged from
 at least 80 to as many as 400, The Government has never made
 a serious effort to account for these missing persons. Human
 rights organizations have pointed out that'the ZANU-ZAPU unity
 accord has meant that the Government has not been called to
 account for past abuses.
 Credible reports indicate hundreds of Zimbabweans continue to
 be abducted by RENAMO from the eastern border areas, and many
 never return from Mozambique where it is believed they are
 killed or forced to work for RENAMO.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Human rights organizations, including Amnesty International
 (AI), have stressed the problem of torture in Zimbabwe,
 especially by officials of the CIO. Detainees in securitj
 cases are often held incommunicado in the initial stage, and
 it is at this point that torture most often occurs, according
 to human rights observers. Firsthand reports in 1989
 indicated that torture continued to be employed in some
 security cases, especially cases involving suspected South
 African and RENAMO agents. The case of Leslie Lesia, a South
 African trader who had been beaten so severely in 1988 that
 both of his legs were broken, again commanded international
 attention in 1989. Senior government officials strongly deny
 that torture is condoned but admit that isolated unauthorized
 instances have occurred. Lo6al human rights officials claimed
 that security officials on a routine basis physically abused
 displaced Mozambicans suspected of being RENAMO supporters.
 Police brutality in political and ordinary criminal cases is
 also a problem. In June baton-wielding riot police used
 excessive force in breaking up a university meeting addressed
 by Edgar Tekere. Black Zimbaweans often appear not to report
 instances of police brutality out of fear of reprisals and the
 perception that they will not receive much public attention.
 Occasionally, police are prosecuted on charges of brutality
 but rarely are severely punished. In one 1989 case, the
 authorities harassed and then detained an attorney defending a
 victim of police brutality.
 
 
 The Supreme Court abolished the use of whipping as a form of
 punishment in June 1989.
 d. Arbi-trary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The police must inform an arrested person of the charges
 against him before he is taken into custody. After completion
 of police questioning, the accused is asked to sign a
 statement which lists his replies to all the queries. The
 accused has the right to answer all questions in the presence
 of an attorney. The police (the arresting detail) must then
 decide if the accused should be released on bail or on his own
 recognizance. A Gweru magistrate hos recently complained that
 many people are needlessly detained for petty crimes because
 police often fail to exercise their right to grant bail.
 However, respected Harare human rights observers opine that
 pretrial rights are generally respected, but occasionally
 inexperienced magistrates and overzealous police officers do
 not inform defendants of their rights.
 Zimbabwean criminal law requires that a person arrested on a
 criminal charge must have a preliminary hearing before a
 magistrate within 48 hours, and the law is respected in
 practice. At that hearing, the magistrate decides whether the
 arrested person should be released on bail or held in custody
 until trial. However, in cases involving the SOE, the
 Minister of Home Affairs can issue a certificate which denies
 bail to a person under arrest even if the court has approved
 it. The Government has often used this prerogative in
 security-related or exchange control violations.
 The Government has extensive detention authority 1n political
 and security cases. The SOE has been in continuous effect in
 Zimbabwe since 1965, and it permits indefinite detention
 without trial "in the interests of public safety or public
 order." The Minister of Home Affairs, who has broad powers
 under the SOE, has presented a motion every 6 months since
 that time calling for extension of the SOE. The Parliament
 has passed the motion 21 times, and on each occasion, the
 President then signed a proclamation extending the SOE.
 Under the SOE implementing legislation, the Emergency Powers
 Act (EPA), persons may be detained without an arrest warrant
 and held for up to 7 days before being informed of the reasons
 for detention. The law states that a detainee has the right
 to see a lawyer "without delay" after arrest, must receive
 enough specific detail of the charges to make meaningful
 representations, and after 30 days must appear before an
 independent review tribunal. This tribunal can recommend to
 the Minister of Home Affairs that the detainee be released if
 evidence is insufficient to warrant continued incarceration.
 The Minister may, however, recommend to the President that the
 detainee continue to be held. In practice, due to procedural
 delays, a detainee may have to wait several months before
 appearing before the review tribunal. In the past, the
 President has generally followed the tribunal's
 recommendations to release, but in 1988 twice he overruled the
 tribunal. In one of those cases the Government finally
 released, in August 1989, four whites (including Leslie Lesia)
 who had been held for 2 years for allegedly spying for South
 Africa.
 Every defendant has the right to select a lawyer of his or her
 choosing. In civil cases, the indigent can apply to have the
 Government supply an attorney. Unfortunately, this right is
 
 
 438
 ZIMBABWE
 not widely known, which prevents the majority of the poor from
 taking advantage of it. In capital cases, the Government will
 provide an attorney to all defendants unable to afford one.
 In certain cases that pertain to the SOE, the Catholic
 Commission for Justice and Peace will often provide an
 attorney at no cost to the defendant.
 The most common reasons for detention under the EPA are
 suspected dissident activity and spying for foreign powers,
 particularly South Africa. In 1989 the authorities detained
 and charged a ZUM supporter with using South African supplied-
 fundst6 purchase arms from a military installation in Mutare,
 a city'It turned'out he had never visited. In another case, a
 repatriate from South Africa was charged in 1989 with
 attempting to:spy on African National Congress houses in
 Bulawayo and Harare. Although the Government initially held
 him but did not formally charge him under emergency powers, it
 subsequently denied him bail and then charged him under the
 Official Secrets Act for attempted espionage. The
 professionalism of police investigations has been eroded
 because of-the ease with which persons can be detained under
 EPA regulations without any solid evidence of wrongdoing.
 In most cases,,after the initial detention the Government
 ultimately orders the arrest and charging of persons under the
 Law and Order Maintenance Act (LOMA), which provides sanctions
 for political crimes. (Sometimes the charging comes under the
 Official Secrets Act.) Such action then becomes part of a
 judicial process with recourse to a court trial. In 1989, 22
 ZUM activists were arrested under the Act and charged with
 engaging in political activity without first obtaining
 permission. Fifteen university student leaders were arrested
 for publishing antigovernment documents, and another 4 were
 arrested during the 1989 campus demonstrations (see Section
 2.b.). In addition, a senior trade union official was
 arrested for speaking in support of the students. The
 students and union leader were subsequently released, although
 the union leader spent 42 days in solitary confiniement (see
 Section 6.a.).
 The Government used its prerogative to deny bail in these
 cases. However, the students petitioned the High Court which
 subsequently ordered their release on the condition that they
 report to the police once a-week. This condition has since
 been removed. None of the persons charged under LOMA had been
 tried by the end of the year.
 It is not known exactly how many persons are currently
 detained on politically related charges. Although the
 Minister of Home Affairs denied that any Zimbabweans are being
 detained on the basis of political activities, reliable
 estimates point to 10 long-term detainees. Approximately 200
 Ndebele arrested and convicted prior to the 1988 amnesty
 remained in detention. Human rights observers report,
 however, that there are far fewer detainees in 1989 than there
 were in 1988. There is also very little information available
 on numbers of persons being detained by military forces in the
 conflict with RENAMO.
 A number of persons, including Reverend Ndabiningi Sithole,
 remain in exile. With regard to forced or compulsory labor,
 see Section 6.c.
 
 
 439
 ZIMBABWE
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Zimbabwe's legal system is based on a mixture of Roman-Dutch
 and English common law practices and procedures and consists
 of magisterial courts, a High Court, and a Supreme Court. In
 most instances, defendants must retain their own legal counsel
 because there is limited provision for public defenders.
 Defense counsel can present evidence and confront witnesses.
 Approximately 90 percent of defendants are not represented'by
 -counsel. The right to appeal exists in all cases and is
 automatic in cases where a death penalty is imposed. All
 trials are open to the public, except in rare cases in which
 the Government orders-that the proceedings be held in camera,
 e.g., in certain security cases involving alleged South
 African agents.
 The judiciary is generally independent and persons brought to
 trial can be assured of a fair public hearing. Although there
 are at present 500 lawyers in Zimbabwe, there is a shortage of
 experienced magistrates. Zimbabwe's judicial system is hard
 -pressed to cope with ordinary criminal cases. There is a lag
 of 3 years in case and law reporting.
 In the past, the Government has generally abided by court
 decisions even when it strongly opposed the ruling. However,
 security officials have recently been ignoring High Court
 rulings. In October trade union leader Morgan Tsvangirai was
 detained again as he departed a local police station following
 another High Court order that authorities release him. In
 1989 police ignored a High Court order to investigate the fate
 of nine ZAPU supporters who disappeared in 1985.
 In a related matter, the 1989 Africa Watch report stated that
 another worrying recent development has been the use of
 threats and criminal charges against lawyers acting in
 important political cases. According to the report, they
 experienced harassment in varying degrees of severity.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 The Constitution formally protects citizens from arbitrary
 search or entry, but under emergency regulations a police
 officer may stop and search any person or enter any area
 without a warrant when the officer has "reasonable grounds"
 for believing evidence of a crime may exist. It is widely
 believed that the Government monitors private correspondence
 and telephones, particularly with overseas partners.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Zimbabwe Constitution provides for freedom of expression
 but allows for legislation limiting this freedom when the
 "interest of defense, public safety, public order, state
 economic interests, public morality and public health" are
 involved. In practice, the Government interprets broadly its
 power to discourage free speech, and at public events it is
 generally assumed that speakers are under surveillance and may
 be subject to follow-up questioning by the CIO if the remarks
 are judged too controversial. The LOM4A provides for the
 prosecution of persons who make racially inflammatory
 remarks. Notwithstanding the Government's efforts to limit
 criticism in Parliament in 1989, there was discussion of
 
 
 several controversial issues, such as corruption, military
 involvement in Mozambique, and the movement toward a one-party
 system.
 Zimbabwe's major print media (five English-language newspapers
 and one vernacular broadsheet) are influenced through the Mass
 Media Trust, a quasi-governmental institution set up after
 independence. There are also smaller, privately owned print
 media, including a widely read economic newspaper. Television
 and radio are wholly government owned. Senior media officials
 follow the.official government and ruling party line closely
 and practice a high degree of self-censorship. Press coverage
 which disputes the main lines of government policy, criticizes
 the ruling party, or questions the actions of senior
 government or party officials is increasingly rare.
 The Government uses various methods to keep the media in
 line. In 1989, following a scandal involving the GoVernment's
 purchase of automobiles (the Willowvale auto scandal), which
 eventually led to the resignations of several Cabinet
 ministers, the authorities transferred or promoted several
 investigative reporters of the Bulawayo Chronicle in what was
 widely interpreted as a government attempt to prevent
 reporters from widening the probe. Similarly, government
 authorities suspended two employees of the Zimbabwe
 Broadcasting Corporation from their positions for reporting a
 press conference by ZUM founder Edgar Tekere and interviewing
 a University of Zimbabwe professor on the feasibility of new
 government investment guidelines. While media coverage of ZUM
 rallies and speeches is almost nonexistent, numerous articles
 detailing the arrests of ZUM activists for allegedly violating
 the Law and Order (Maintenance) Act regularly appear in the
 news.
 Academic freedom was seriously affected by events in 1989.
 The University, which has an enrollment of 9,000 students, was
 closed after police officers broke up a student protest
 demonstration (see Section 2.b. below).
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Constitution formally provides for the right of assembly
 and association for political and nonpolitical organizations,
 including a broad spectrum of economic, professional, social,
 and recreational activities. In practice, there are serious
 obstacles to the full exercise of this right, particularly in
 the case of political associations.
 Police permits are required for public meetings and political
 rallies. Organizations must pay the town council (usually
 controlled by ZANU) to use civic centers and stadiums.
 Reliable reports indicate that on many occasions town council
 members changed the rules for renting public places to ZUM
 members for holding election ralllies after police had granted
 permission to hold the rallies.
 In September University of Zimbabwe students attempted to hold
 a seminar to mark the anniversary of a major demonstration
 held in 1988 against corruption. The Government banned the
 seminar, and security forces were despatched to disperse
 students trying to conduct the meeting. The Student
 Representative Council (SRC) then issued a statement
 protesting the police action as a violation of academic and
 intellectual freedom. In response the police arrested two SRC
 leaders, Arthur Mutambara and Enoch Chikweche, for publishing
 
 
 441
 ZIMBABWE
 a statement offensive to government leaders. As news of the
 arrests spread, 300 students assembled to protest. In the
 course of this demonstration, the students burned an
 automobile belonging to the University Vice Chancellor, and
 police were again called in to quell the disturbances, using
 tear gas and riot sticks. The police arrested 70 students,
 and the University was then closed. It reopened briefly to
 allow students to take final exams, but the Vice Chancellor
 required all students to sign a document pledging not to
 participate in demonstrations: The University was then closed
 again and remained closed at the end of the year.
 There are numerous nonpolitical business and employers'
 organizations, professional associations, and recreational and
 sports clubs. These are generally free of governmental
 interference as long as their activities are viewed as
 nonpolitical.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.c.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is respected in Zimbabwe. There is no
 state religion. Denominations are permitted to worship
 openly, pursue social and charitable activities, and maintain
 ties with affiliates and coreligionists abroad. Religious
 belief is neither a handicap nor an advantage in terms of
 professional or political advancement. Many government
 leaders received their education in mission schools, and a
 number of senior ZANU officials are, in fact, clergymen.
 Elective courses in religious studies are part of the
 secondary school curriculum.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Travel at home and abroad is not generally subject to official
 restrictions, although travel restrictions have been
 occasionally applied against those whom it was believed might
 criticize the Government before foreign audiences. This
 practice does not appear to be widespread. A far more serious
 practical obstacle to foreign travel is currency control which
 severely limits the amount of foreign currency Zimbabwean
 nationals can take out of the country. Travel in the areas
 contested with RENAMO is not officially restricted but can be
 dangerous. The Government has instituted a "villagization"
 policy creating centralized villages in areas where RENAMO
 attacks occur. Immigration is not restricted, although
 persons who have left the country are not guaranteed the right
 to return if they were not born in Zimbabwe. Applicants must
 be able to demonstrate proof of livelihood. Repatriates from
 South Africa are always suspected of being in the employment
 of the South African intelligence community.
 At the end of 1989, the registered refugee population was
 estimated at 80,000, of whom 79,500 were Mozambicans located
 in four rural camps along the eastern border. The remainder,
 mainly South Africans, were located in Harare and Bulawayo.
 An estimated 100,000 Mozambicans, many of them migrant
 farmers, are self-settled in rural areas in the east. Adult
 males of military age (18-35) among this population are being
 relocated into the official camps. The Government fears that
 RENAMO guerrillas infiltrate Zimbabwe in the guise of these
 Mozambican refugees and has declared its intention to
 
 
 442
 ZIMBABWE
 repatriate most of them. While Zimbabwe has acceded to a
 number of international agreements permitting the free entry
 of refugees, in 1989 it sought to keep its border closed to
 new refugees, thus seriously consfricting the right of first
 asylum.  IA 1989 expulsions of arriving refugees numbered some
 3,000 who were the object of government suspicion as RENAMO
 sympathizers.
 The Ministry of Labor, Manpower Planning, and Social Welfare
 is responsible for refugee affairs. Within the Ministry, a
 commissioner for refugees oversees the administration of the
 camps and coordinates international and other assistance
 activities. Using the Zimbabwe Refugee Act of 1983 as the
 legal basis for the determination of eligibility for refugee
 status, a Zimbabwe refugee committee interviews applicants for
 asylum. A negative decision can be appealed to the Minister,
 whose decision is final. This formal process applies to
 persons mainly in Harare rather than along the border. In
 1989 Zimbabwe refused to grant refugee status to several ANC
 members who had quit the organization. Former ANC members
 were forced to seek refuge in other countries.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 In 1989 Zimbabwe was officially a pluralist parliamentary
 democracy with a popularly elected House of Assembly, and
 citizens still had the right to change their government
 through democratic means. Elections held in the latter part
 of 1989 were contested by multiple candidates from ZANU, ZAPU,
 and ZUM as well as by some independents. However, there were
 widely reported irregularities in these elections. With the
 ZANU-ZAPU unity agreement and government efforts to limit the
 growth of the new ZUM party, Zimbabwe was becoming a de facto
 one-party state.
 President Mugabe and his Cabinet are the preeminent political
 figures, and the ruling party, ZANU (fully unified with the
 former ZAPU opposition party), is the dominant political
 organization in the country. Following the amendment of the
 Constitution in 1987 to create a strong executive presidency,
 Robert Mugabe, who previously served as Prime Minister, became
 in 1988 both the Head of State and Head of Government.
 Elected in 1988 by an electoral college made up of the two
 houses of Parliament, in 1990 the executive President will be
 selected by popular election to a term of 6 years. The
 President appoints the Vice President and the rest of the
 Cabinet, who serve at his pleasure.
 The Parliament contains two chambers: the House of Assembly
 and the Senate. Eighty of the 100 members of the House of
 Assembly are popularly elected from specific constituencies to
 5-year terms. Twenty members are nominated by the ruling
 party and elected by the House of Assembly. Members of the
 upper house (the Senate) are appointed by the President.
 Since the unity agreement, which helped break down the
 traditional party rivalries, there has emerged a vigorous
 "back bench" in the House of Assembly which has confronted the
 Government on a number of issues.
 In particular, the debate over Zimbabwe's political future
 sharpened in 1989 with the formation in April of the Zimbabwe
 Unity Movement (ZUM), led by former ZANU Secretary General
 Edgar Tekere. Tekere has criticized corruption and the size
 of government as well as the movement toward a one-party
 
 
 443
 ZIMBABWE
 system. Tekere is from the east, which has been hit hard by
 the RENAMO incursions and military conflict, and he has also
 advocated military withdrawal from Mozambique.
 President Mugabe and other senior ZANU officials have
 indicated a desire for a one-party state and have taken a
 series of steps to counter ZUM activities. Reliable sources
 accused the ruling party of blocking free and fair campaigning
 in a June by-election held near Harare to choose a replacement
 for senior Minister Nyagumbo, who committed suicide in the
 wake of the Willowvale car scandal. During the campaign, the
 authorities detained 15 ZUM leaders for 5 days, prohibited ZUM
 political rallies, and denied ZUM media coverage. The ZANU
 candidate won, but the ZUM4 candidate received 25 percent of
 the vote, indicating some popular support for a two-party
 system. Moreover, there were widespread irregularities
 including reports of ZANU payments to people who did not live
 in the constituency to vote for its candidate. In the
 November by-election, there were widespread irregularities as
 well in favor of ZANU candidates. Observers charged ZANU with
 stuffing ballot boxes to keep ZUM candidates from winning.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government is highly sensitive to charges by international
 nongovernmental organizations of human rights abuses in
 Zimbabwe. The Government permits the International Committee
 of the Red Cross (ICRC) to maintain a regional office in
 Harare. It cooperates with the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to assist Mozambican, South
 African, and other refugees but does not accord UNHCR regular,
 unrestricted access to Mozambican refugee camps. Admonitions
 to the security services about refugee protection have fallen
 on deaf ears in the border areas.
 The Government often has been critical of nongovernmental
 groups. For example, the Minister of Home Affairs, in
 response to the October 1989 Africa Watch report on Zimbabwe,
 warned the organization "to avoid meddling in our internal
 affairs." In 1986 the Government declared Amnesty
 International an "enemy of the people" and thieatened that
 anyone who supplied the organization with information would be
 detained. AI is still not permitted to operate in Zimbabwe.
 Private Zimbabwean groups supporting efforts to increase
 public awareness of human rights operate in Zimbabwe. In
 particular, the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace
 (CCJP) investigates complaints from private persons about
 human rights abuses in Zimbabwe and conveys its findings to
 the Government. Other local groups include the Bulawayo-based
 Legal Projects Center and the Harare-based Legal Resources
 Foundation, which operate libraries and information centers
 and train lawyers in humanitarian law. The Legal Projects
 Center also provides a legal aid clinic which handles matters
 ranging from locating missing detainees to domestic disputes.
 These groups in the past have operated without government
 hindrance, but in 1989 the lawyers for the CCJP and the Legal
 Resources Center were detained briefly or harassed by false
 charges in cases relating to human rights (see Section l.e.).
 
 
 444
 ZIMBABWE
 Section-5 Discrimination Based.on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Government services in Zimbabwe ate provided on a
 nondiscriminatory basis, and the Government has been able to
 work with the previously "whites only" infrastructure in urban
 areas to provide health and other social services to all. In
 many rural areas, however, the neglect of the preindependence
 period still leaves the Government struggling to provide
 minimum care. Blacks on most commercial farms are still
 dependent mainly on white farmers to meet basic health care
 and educational needs.
 In social terms, Zimbabwe remains a racially stratified
 country despite bans against official discrimination. While
 schools, churches, and clubs are all integrated, there is
 limited social interaction between racial groups. The
 "colored" (mixed race) community has complained of
 discrimination in the allocation of civil service jobs, but
 President Mugabe made two "colored" ministerial-level
 appointments and appointed a Zimbabwean of Chinese heritage as
 Minister of Education,
 The status of women in Zimbabwe has advanced steadily even
 though traditional attitudes and practices persist, especially
 in rural areas. Since independence, the Government has
 enacted major laws aimed at enhancing women's rights and
 countering certain traditional practices, some of which are
 based on the view of women as dependents or minors. For
 example, the Legal Age of Majority Act and the Matrimonial
 Causes Act recognize the capacity of women to act
 independently of their husbands or fathers and to own
 property. Judges on the high courts have adjudicated cases
 upholding women's rights, including the right of women to
 inherit property. In 1981 the Ministry of Cooperative and
 Community Development and Women's Affairs was established to
 facilitate the involvement of women in national development.
 Nevertheless, many women remain severely disadvantaged in
 Zimbabwean society. Ignorance of reforms, illiteracy,
 economic dependency, and prevailing social norms prevent rural
 women in particular from benefiting equally from these
 changes. Women are still vulnerable to customary practices
 that operate against their personal rights. Zimbabwean law
 prohibits "kuzvarira," the practice of pledging a young woman
 to marriage with a partner not of her choosing. However,
 unless the woman is well educated and outspoken, marriages
 based on "kuzvarira" still take place. The Matrimonial Causes
 Act has removed the customary obligation of a groom to pay
 "lobola" (a bride price) to the parents of his would-be wife,
 but the practice of "lobola" continues to be widespread. The
 Child Protection Society of Zimbabwe has challenged the
 customary practice of offering a young girl as compensatory
 payment in interfamily disputes, but it persists.
 A considerable expansion of the nation's education system has
 resulted in an increase in the absolute number of girls being
 educated but has not altered the pattern of male domination of
 the higher levels of education. Though legislation prohibits
 discrimination in employment on the basis of gender, women are
 concentrated in the lower echelons of the work force.
 Domestic violence against women, especially wife beating, is
 believed to be prevalent in Zimbabwe. A 1988 survey uncovered
 over 1,600 police investigations of domestic assault in the
 
 
 445
 ZIMBABWE
 southern townships of Harare alone. The police often treat
 violence against women as a domestic rather than a criminal
 matter and are reluctant to intervene. Well-informed sources
 report that most victims of domestic violence, fearing the
 loss of economic support, withdraw charges or fail to report
 the incidents. Although the number of reported rape cases has
 increased substantially, laws dealing with assault and rape
 present substantive and procedural problems for women. A
 -women's action group has urged police to improve their
 services by giving women a full explanation of court
 procedures and possible defense attorney tactics before they
 appear in court. The Government has assigned community
 relations liaison officers to police precincts to counsel
 victims of sexual assault. These officers held workshops on
 rape for their fellow officers to inform them about victims'
 rights. Respected government officials and medical
 practicioners report that female genital mutilation is not
 widespread in Zimbabwe.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Under the Labor Relations Act, workers enjoy freedom of
 association, have the right to elect their representatives,
 publish newsletters, and set programs and policies which
 reflect the political and economic interests of labor. The
 Act specifies that workers may constitute workers' committees
 in each plant and a trade union in each industrial sector and
 elect appropriate officers. The Act specifies further that
 workers* committees and trade unions must be registered with,
 the Ministry of Labor, but it also seeks to protect workers'
 organizations from arbitrary government interference. The
 Government does not control or restrict labor, but it has
 powerful levers affecting labor, notably in the handling of
 strikes and setting wages.
 Since independence, the Government has encouraged trade unions
 in the same industry to amalgamate. The process of
 amalgamation was completed in 1987. About 17 percent of the
 salaried work force is organized in 22 trade unions which are
 members of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), the
 umbrella confederation of the trade union movement. The ZCTU
 is the voice of organized labor, and its officers and members
 frequently speak or comment on social issues in public
 forums. ZCTU officers are elected by the delegates of
 affiliated trade unions at biennial conventions, most recently
 in July 1988. Neither the Government nor any political party
 nor any ethnic or tribal group has a preponderant influence in
 the trade union movement. Most trade unions suffer from
 meager budgets which prevent them from conducting a greater
 range of organizing and educational activities.
 Workers have the right to strike providing that the union
 advises the Government 2 weeks in advance of its intention to
 do so. The right to strike is further limited by the right of
 the Government to declare a specific industry to be essential
 and therefore not subject to strike action. In practice, the
 Government has employed a broad interpretation of what
 essential industries are, and strikes in Zimbabwe have been
 few and largely unsuccessful. In June 1989, after long
 negotiations with the Government over the terms of their
 employment, medical interns went on strike, and the Government
 arrested more than 70 striking doctbrs. Responding to an
 appeal from President Mugabe, the interns returned to work and

 their pay.was later increased. Another, more serious wildcat
 strike oc4urred in July when 2,000 railroad mechanics walked
 off their jobs. They were eventually joined by other railroad
 workers. 'The Government declared'the strike illegal but did
 not attempt to arrest the workerd. Instead, the Government
 persuaded strikers to return to work by promising them an
 additional .Wage increase. However, when another wildcat
 strike took place 10 days after this settlement, 60 railway
 workers were summarily dismissed. In September, 1,500 postal
 and telecommunications technicians, seeking higher wages than
 those granted by the Government, engaged in a week-long
 strike. The Government used its emergency powers to dismiss
 the workers but rehired them later once it was clear
 indigenous replacements were not available. In October, after
 issuing a press statement supporting the students' right to
 protest government actions, the ZCTU Secretary General was
 detained, held in solitary confinement for 42 days, and
 charged with attempting to incite the public to revolt against
 the Government. In November the Commonwealth Trade Union
 Council (CTUC) field representative was deported after he
 protested the ZCTU Secretary General's detention.
 The ZCTU and its officials are active in the international
 labor movement and are affiliated with the Trade Union.
 Coordinating Council and the Organization Qf African Trade
 UniOn Unity. The ZCTU has friendly relations with the
 Brussels-based International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions (ICFTU) and its affiliates (including the American
 Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations),
 as well as with the Communist-controlled World Federation of
 Trade Unions.
 Zimbabwe has been a member of the International Labor
 Organization (ILO) since 1980 but has ratified neither ILO
 Convention 87 regarding freedom of association nor Convention
 98 on bargaining collectively.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Under the Labor Relations Act, workers have the right to
 organize. Workers' committees are empowered to negotiate with
 the management of a particular plant the conditions of labor
 in the workplace. Wages are negotiated on an industrywide
 basis but are effectively limited by the Government's minimum
 wage system. In the case of a union-organized industry, the
 employers association meets directly with a particular trade
 union. In certain cases when there is no trade union
 representing a specific industry, representatives of the
 organized workers meet with the employers' association under
 the mediation of labor relations officers from the Ministry of
 Labor.
 Perceiving that workers are at a disadvantage in negotiations
 with better financed and better educated managers, the
 Government believes it is responsible for assisting workers
 with legislation and intervention with employers. The Labor
 Relations Act provides considerable job security for workers.
 Under the Act, a worker may not be fired without the Labor
 Ministry's concurrence that the dismissal is justified. Labor
 relations officers are authorized to handle worker grievances
 within the plant. Their decisions may be appealed to the
 regional hearing officer of the Ministry of Labor, and finally
 to a special Labor Relations Tribunal, over which the Chief
 Justice presides.

 ZIMBABWE
 In April 1989, Labor Minister Nkomo recommended that all labor
 laws be consolidated. He also announced the intention to open
 up the labor market to permit greater freedom for labor and
 management to negotiate wage increases. In past years, the
 Government would announce minimum wage increases prior to the
 start of the collective-bargaining season that became, in
 effect--given the Government's refusal to ratify settlements
 which exceeded the minimum wage--the target for wage
 agreements. Though the Government has not completely
 withdrawn from setting wage increase standards, it now sets
 parameters for wage negotiations, and all collective
 bargaining agreements must be ratified by the Labor Ministry.
 The Government does not promote or support antiunion
 discrimination. There are no export processing zones in
 Zimbabwe.
 c. Prohibitions of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Compulsory labor is prohibited by law in Zimbabwe and is not
 practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Under Zimbabwean labor regulations, the minimum age for the
 formal wage sector is 18, but it is possible to begin an
 apprenticeship at 16. In this sector, minimum age regulations
 are generally enforced. However, the Government does not
 attempt to-enforce these regulations for children employed in
 household-enterprises, e.g., family farms.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Conditions of labor are regulated by the Government according
 to industry. The Government publishes labor regulations, for
 each of the 22 industrial sectors, based on previously
 negotiated collective bargaining agreements. These
 regulations specify wages, hours, holiday schemes, and
 required safety measures. -The average workweek is 44 hours,
 and.the law prescribes a minimum of one 24-hour rest period
 per week. The minimum wage for-the agro-industrial sector is
 $96a month. The employer also usually provides housing,
 food, and:'medic-al care to workers. On commercial farms, the
 employer may provide schooling for the workers' children.
 Citing the results of a 1981 government-sponsored wage and
 price survey, the ZCTU pointed out that current mandated
 minimum wages are between 50-75 percent below the adjusted
 poverty level determined by the survey. In many instances,
 workers must also rely on second jobs, extended family help,
 or some subsistence farming to-meet a minimum standard of
 living.
 Labor relations officers from the Ministry of Labor are
 assigned to monitor developments in each plant to ensure that
 government minimum wage poli-cy and occupational and safety
 regulations are being observed.
