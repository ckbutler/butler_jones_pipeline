 HAITI
 Haiti has been ruled by two extraconstitutional governments since army enlisted
 men overthrew democratically elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in Be pter-
 ber 1991. From October 1991 until June 199, a provisional government, with Jo-
 seph Nerette as President and Jean-Jac ues  onorat as Prime Minister governed
 with the support of the armed forces and a parliamentary plurality. In June 1992
 both Nerette and Honorat resigned, and Parliament approved-with a questionable
 Senate majority-Marc Bazin to head a new "consensus Government asPrime Min-
 ister. No replacement was named for Nerette as president. Support for this arrange-
 ment by Armed Forces Commander General Cedras as well as rower ranking officers
 and soldiers was essential to installing the Basin Government. Bazin's mandate was
 to negotiate a solution to the constitutional crisis with President Aristide, now in
 exile in the United States, and to end the economic embargo and diplomatic isola-
 tion of Haiti imposed pursuant to resolutions approved by the Organization of Amer-
 ican States (OA) after Aristide's ouster. There have been several OAS-sponsored
 efforts to promote negotiations between representatives of Aristide and the de facto
 authorities in Haiti (the most recent occurring in Washington in September) which
 resulted in the OAS sending a team of 18 civilian observers to Haiti with the mon-
 itoring of human rights as part of its mandate.
 The Haitian armed forces are responsible for state security and have considerable
 legal and institutional autonomy. According to the U.S. Arms Control and Disar-
 mament Agency, total military expenditures for 1989 were $45 million. There are
 no plans to reduce these expenditures in the near future. In both urban and rural
 areas, armed forces units serve as police, although the Constitution calls for a sepa-
 ration of the two forces. The armed forces committed numerous and serious human
 rights violations in the aftermath of Aristide's ouster. Thereafter official, politically
 motivated violence and repreassion against active regime opponents decline , but in-
 discriminate violence remained substantial, especially in rural areas, where 70 to
 80 percent of Haitians live.
 Haiti is the poorest and most densely populated country in the Western Hemi-
 sphere. The economy is characterized by a heavy dependence on imports, a mostly
 rural population living on rapidly eroding land, wide disparities of income and a
 small manufacturing base. The economy declined in recent years, largely because
 of political instability and erratic management. That decline continued im 1992 and
 was aggravated by the trade embargo as well as the suspension of all but inter-
 nationa humanitarian assistance following the September 1991 coup d'etat.
 Haitians suffered frequent human rights abuses throughout 1992 including
 extrajudicial killings by security forces, disappearances, beatings and other mis-
 treatment of detainees and prisoners, arbitrary arrest and detention and executive
 interference with the judicial process. While the worst of these abuses occurred
 under the Nerette-Honorat Government, they continued under the Basin Govern-
 ment. Neither postcoup Government forcefully denounced or seriously attempted to
 restrain abuses by elements of the armed forces, or to prevent the military from sti-
 fling any organized pro-Aristide sentiment following the 1991 coup. Both the Bazin
 Government and its parliamentary opposition announced initiatives on human
 rights, but delayed passing legislation to reform and reinforce law enforcement and
 the judiciary. At years end, widespread abuses continued, and there was no evi-
 dence either. that the military was willing to stop such practices or that the civilian
 Government was able to bring the military under control.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, including Freedom from
 a. Political and other Extrnjudicial Kidling.-The year 1992 did not see the same
 degree of wide-scale political violence that followed the September 1991 coup d'etat
 and claimed between 300 and 400 victims. It is difficult to assess the actual number
 of political and extrajudicial killings because judicial authorities rarely conduct
 criminal investigations into any unexplained deaths, including violent ones such as
 murder, whether political or not. Levels of violence remained high and were exacer-
 bated by the manifest unwillingness of the two postcup governments to pursue
 criminal justice, particularly in cases of politically_ moti~val murder. _Dozens of
 murders, presumed to be political, were carred out by individuals in authority act-
 ing without apparent fear of punishment. Brutality, including claims of frequent in-
 
 
 422
 juries, by elements of the armed forces was particularly severe in Port au Prince
 slums, such as the Cite Soleil and Carrefour districts, and in Haiti's remote prov-
 inces.
 Some of the documented political killings durn the year included the January
 torture and murder of Aristide supporter Jean-Claude Museau by police in the
 southern town of Les Cayes; the May 26 killing of businessman Georgs lzmery,
 brother of Aristide activist Antoine Izmery; and the August 18 deaths of three
 Aristide activists, shot by police as they put up political posters. The last incident
 occurred during the visit of an OAS fact-finding and mediation mission to Haiti led
 by Secretary General Baena Soares.
 The bodyguard of Aristide's Prime Minister-designate Rene Theodore was shot to
 death on January 25 during an attack on a political meeting at Theodore's party
 headquarters. Reliable evidence points to the complicity of former national intel-
 ligence chief Leopold Clerjeune in the commando-style raid by over a dozen men,
 some in police uniforms, armed with assault rifles and submachine guns and carry-
 igradios. Theodore and other national political figures resent were beaten.
 No serious investigation of these killings has been undertaken by judicial or mili-
 tary authorities, nor is any anticipated. The July 19-20 trial for the 1991 murder
 of I puty Astrel Charles by a section chief (the sheriff or constable of a locality)
 resulted in a life sentence for the defendant. It was the only homicide case with po-
 litical implications prosecuted by judicial authorities, with army cooperation, during
 the year.
 In the case of the killing of former Duvalierist cabinet minister Roger Lafontant,
 the Haitian army officer who was the penitentiary commander at the time of
 Lafontant's murder claimed in a 1992 discussion with U S. Government officials to
 have received a personal telephone call from President Aristide on the evening of
 Se ptember 29, 1991 ordering him to kill Lafontant. The enlisted man who admitted
 killing Lafontant that night told U S. officials in 1992 that he was aware of the re-
 ported order from Prsident Arstide. The enlisted man has since declined to talk
 with U.S. officials. A spokesman for President Aristide has denied these charges.
 b. Disappearane.-There were no reports of disappearances while President
 Aristide was in office. There were dozens of reported disappearances in the months
 following the September 1991 coup, but Haitian human rights advocates point out
 that because many Aristide activists had gone into hiding, it was very difficult to
 verifyr these reports. For example, a Haitian press association announced the dis-
 appearance of a Radio Soleil correspondent in June but learned subsequently the
 journalist was in hiding. Aristide supporter Milot Batista was reportedly abducted
 on June 1 in Port au Prince. City hospitals and other authorities had no record of
 the missing person reports that family members claim they made. Credible sources
 allege, however, that Batista is actually in hiding.
 Other reports detail disappearances that did not seem to be cases of individuals
 in hiding. On June 25 armed men abducted the driver of Senator Thureb Delpe, who
 is believed dead. Alix Mondesir, founder of a small political organization of reformist
 former soldiers, was kidnaped Augst 27. Local television stations broadcast taped
 appeals from family members for his release, but thus far his whereabouts remain
 unknown Amthoug the body of Radio Gaaxie correspondent Felix Lamy has not
 been found, there is little hope the journalist, kidnaped by armed men December
 10, 1991, is still alive. In December three members of the Conacom political party
 disappeared; two were subsequently found murdered and the third remains missing.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Brutal beatings with fists and clubs, torture, and other cruel treatment of detainees
 are common. Ill-treatment remains widespread, particularly the threat of ill-treat-
 ment used by police and soldiers to extort money from detainees and their families.
 Prison conditions are abysmal Detainees regularly have no access to legal counsel
 and continue to suffer rm a lack of the most basic hygienic facilities as well as
 inadequate food and health care. Children are regularly detained together with
 adults in violation of the rule that children should be detained separately. Although
 the 1987 Constitution calls for prisons to be administered by the Ministry of Justice,
 the army continues to control them.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exie-Arbitrary arrest and detention remain
 among the most persistent human rights abuses in Haiti. According to the Constitu-
 tion, a person mar be arrested only if apprehended during the commission of a
 crime or if a judicial warrant has been issued for the srrest. In practice, however,
 arbitrary arrest and detention as well as interrogation without legal counsel present
 are common and are frequently used by soldiers and provincial officials to intimi-
 date and extort money from the populace. Although cases of arbitrary arrest and
 detention occurred during the Aristide prsidency (in one instance despite a court
 
 
 423
 order for the individuars release), they increased dramatically in the postcoup cli-
 mate of crackdown and reprisal
 The 1987 Constitution calls for the separation of the police from the military, with
 the police placed under Justice Ministry authority. In November the de facto regime
 announced its intention to separate the police from the army and named an
 interministerial commission to study means to do so. However, enabling legislation
 aimed at separating the police from the army, and installing a rural police force to
 replace the infamous section chiefs, had not been enacted at years end, both be-
 cause of opposition on the part of elements of the military and because the Par-
 liament is divided and paralyzed by the country's political crisis.
 Section chiefs commonly obtain their positions by bribing the military command-
 ers who appoint them, recouping their 'investment" in turn by accepting money
 from numerous 'deputies* who extort money from the peasant population. Politically
 active clergy were frequently victims of arbitrary arrest and harassment by the mili-
 tary, as pa!t of a more general intimidation campaign against Aristide sympathiz-
 ers, particlarly in the countryside.
 Arrests and harassment of journalists are frequent and form part of an overall
 postcoup crackdown against the media. The best known case is that of radio re-
 porter Paul Jean Mario, arrested in November 1991 on charges of complicity in the
 bu    g of a police barracks. Mario was finally released in April 1992 after charges
 were.dropped. In February two reporters, one from the British Broadcasting Cor-
 poration and another from the Chicago Tribune, were detained for 8 hours and
 threatened with death by a provincial section chief. The two were investigating re-
 ports that the villagers' houses had been burned by the section chief in retaliation
 or f  ng to pay nn protection money. Although they made clear their status as
 lists, the section chief detained the two and threatened to kill them.
 e.IDeniol of Fair Publi Tria.-This right is widely and severely abridged. The
 Constitution provides for an independent judiciary and the right to a fair public
 trial and expressly denies police and judicial authorities the right to interrogate per-
 sons charged with a crime unless the suspect has legal counsel present or waives
 this right. Nevertheless, interrogation without legal counsel present is the norm,
 and the use of beatings and torture to extract confessions is widespread. Moreover,
 contempt for the judiciary dating back to the Duvalier regime rendered it a vestigial
 branch of government, understaffed, poorly trained, and inadequately compensated.
 Six years after the Duvaliers' fall, the judicial branch's lamentable state has not
 changed. All governments since 1986 have continued the practice of appointing and
 removing judges at will and of exerting political influence at every stage of the judi-
 cial process.
 The Constitution also mandates an elaborate system of local administration,
 among whose duties is the nomination of badly needed new jude    Legislation im-
 plementing and funding local administration languished in Parliament most of the
 year, hostage to partisan wrangling over Haiti's ongoing political deadlock. Under
 the Aristide presidency, efforts were made to put local administration in place. Fol-
 lowing the September 1991 coup, these nascent structures were widely dismantled,
 and local police and army officials stepped into the power vacuum in Haiti's rural
 areas.
 The Code of Criminal Procedure does not clearly assign responsibility to inves-
 tigate crimes, and there are no penalties for delay or inaction. Authority to pros-
 ecute is divided among police, prosecutors, and investigating magistrates. Overlap-
 ping authority invites the abdication of responsibility and encourages tacit complic-
 ity in widespread corruption.
 The Code also stipulates two criminal court sessions per year to try all major
 crimes requiring a jury trial. These sessions usually last onl 2 weeks, and in some
 years only one session is held. Failure to reform the Code as resulted in a huge
 backlog, with detainees sometimes waiting years in pretrial detention for a court
 date. On October 6, there were 400 inmates, including 60 soldiers at Port an
 Prince's National Penitentiary. Of the 400, 28 were serving sentences. All others,
 including the soldiers were awaiting trial or court-martial proceedings. If the ac-
 cused is ultimately tried and found innocent, he has no recourse against the Govern-
 ment for time already served.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-During
 and after the September 1991 coup and throughout 1992, there were many credible
 reports of soldiers and other armed persons entering private homes for illegal pur-
 poses. Soldiers and their plainclothes "deputies" violently raided poor quarters of
 Port au Prince at least a dozen times during 1992 to silence support for President
 Aristide, to search for illegal weapons, and, according to credible sources, to loot pri-
 vate homes with impunity.
 
 
 424
 Similar arbitrary searches were equally common in the provinces, with clergy sus-
 pected of pro-Aristide sympathies a particular target. In August 1992, several dozen
 police and soldiers ransacked the rectory of the cathedral in the southern town of
 Jermie.
 Police roadblocks are frequently set up, especially during periods of real or per-
 ceived political tension. The discovery of pro-Aristide posters or literature during a
 police search of a house or vehicle frequently results in illegal arrest. There are
 credible reports that police and military have also interfered with private cor-
 respondence during such searches.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and the press is provided
 for by the Constitution but was often abridged by violence and intimidation, particu-
 larly in the immediate aftermath of the 1991 coup. With an illiter   rate of ap-
 proximately 80 percent broadcast media especially radio, have unusual importance,
 and independent broadcast media have been particular targets. Two radio journal-
 ists were killed following the coup, one disappeared (see Section 1.b.), and many
 were arrested and otherwise intimidated. A number of journalists have left the
 country.
 There are currently 14 radio stations operating in Port au Prince. Four radio sta-
 tions operating before the coup have closed permanently. News broadcasts exercise
 sporadic self-censorship, conditioned by events and political tensions. The Bain
 Government made overtures to the independent media aimed at reopening radio
 stations violently shut down during the coup. Most reopened, but some remained
 closed. Print media enjoyed greater freedom, possibly as a result of their relatively
 small readership. Two independent newspapers operate in Port au Prince, and pro-
 Aristide weeklies published in the United States were freely sold in the streets.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, but these rights have been severely restricted
 since the coup d'etat. There were credible reports from all parts of Haiti that the
 de facto Government engaged in a systematic effort to inhibit any type of associa-
 tion. Soldiers fired into the air to disperse gatherings. Some community organizers,
 even of nonpolitical organizations, were arrested and sometimes beaten, harassed,
 or intimidated into fleeing their own communities. Most civic education, community
 health, and literacy organizations were prevented from operating normally. Reports
 of the forceful dispersal of peaceful assemblies declined later in 1992, apparently
 more from civilian reluctance to try to congregate than from any lessening of the
 army's determination to prevent civil unrest.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Religion is an integral part of Haitian life and culture
 and is practiced widely. Roman Catholicism and voodoo (a mixture of African ani-
 mism and Christianity) are the two major religions. Members of various Protestant
 denominations and foreign missionary groups openly proselytize in Haiti. There are
 no government restrictions on missionary activities, affiliations with overseas coreli-
 gionists, or religious instruction or publishing.
 Grassroots lieration theology organizations in the countryside remain a strong
 base of support for President -Aristide. These groups and their leaders have been
 particular targets of the army. Activist foreign and Haitian clergy have been victims
 of short-term arrests clearly intended to harass and intimidate. These arrests often
 followed the discovery of pro-Aristide materials during illegal military searches of
 homes, vehicles, and even church rectories.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The provisional Government which took power immediately after the
 coup restricted travel within and outside the country, especially for Aristide's min-
 isters and advisors.
 There were few cases of government restriction on travel after the immediate
 postoup period. Port au Prince Mayor Evans Paul, who was arrested while trying
 to leave the country and beaten by police in 1991, was detained at the airport in
 early 1992. Paul subsequently left the country several times without serious inci-
 dent, albeit with some petty harassment. In August a pro-Aristide journalist was
 arrested at the border crossing between Haiti and the Dominican Republic. She was
 detained for several hours and ultimately released on orders from military authori-
 ties in Port au Prince.
 Although" the clandestine departure of migrants is technically a violation of Hai-
 tian immigration law, the authorities have made only token efforts to interfer with
 the migration, occasionally in the form of solicting small bribes to permit departure.
 Since Febru, the US. Emassy in Port au Prince has conducted Creole-language
 interviews with over 3,000 repatriates, without finding a single credible claim of
 mistreatment or retribution against any Haitian for  having attempted to leave
 
 
 425
 Haiti. Repatriated Haitian boat people do face, of course, the same harsh conditions
 and lawlessness facing Haitians in general. Recently authorities have begun to de-
 tain and prosecute suspected organizers of the voyages. Particularly in the imme-
 diate aftermath of the coup, tens of thousands of Haitian fled from urban slums to
 the relatively grater security of the countryside. Others have moved from one area
 to another to distance themselves from abusive local authorities.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The right of citizens to change their government was forcibly abridged in Septem-
 ber 1991 when rebellious soldiers forced the duly elected President to flee the coun-
 try after a military coup. Mot senior members of Aristide's administration either
 went into hiding, fled the country, or took refuge in foreign embassies.
 The Parliament was elected along with President Aristide at the end of 1990. Its
 elected members remain in place and have played a continuing significant role in
 political events since the coup d'etat. In the months following the coup, a majority
 of the legislature consistently supported ongoing OAS efforts to mediate a solution
 to the political crisis. The prsent 'consensus" Government has the support of this
 parliamentary majority. Despite reports that some of this support has been pur-
 chased with bribes, mot legislators backing the current Government appear to be
 providing support in the hope that it will fulfil its mandate to negotiate an end to
 beth the political crisis and the OAS embargo.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 About a dozen local human rights groups operted in Haiti in 1992. Five attor-
 neys in Port au Prince offeredpro bno  lal defense assiatance. All of the local
 human rights groups call upon these five for legl assistance. Organization officas
 report occasional threats but can operate relatively freely. Ironicaly, Jean-Jacques
 Honorat's human rights organization, ChadL ontinued to issue monthly bulletins
 denouncing human rights abuses thrughout Honort's tenure as Prime Minister of
 the tist postcoup Government.
 Representiati   of A e      i a   tional and other Us  . and foreign human
 rights organizations visited Haiti regulany. These groups generally operatod freely,
 but were often prevented from conducting prison inspections and from interviewing
 prisoners.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sefi   Religon, assistnce   or ctial status
 Some 9 percent of Haiti    can a e  e ats of African slaves who won ther war
 of independence from France in 1804. Most others are mulatto or of Europan, Mid-
 dle Eastern, North American, or Latin Americano    . Haitian law makes no dis-
 tinctions based on race. Howev tere are longstanding social and poelitical animos-
 ities among these venious groups, many of which dte back before Haiti's revolution-
 ary period. Ther reve two official languages in Haiti: Creole, which is spoken by vir-
 tualy al Haitians and French, which is spoken by abut 20 percent of the popu-
 lation. ThOse unable to read, write, and speak renc are limitd in their politicalm
 and economic activities. Many argue that the country's French-speaking elite have
 used languag requirements as a barrier to the advancement of the country's dis-
 advantaged
 Officially, there is no discrimination against women. Women have occupied promi-
 nent positions in bth the public and private sectors in recent years. In some social
 strata, however, women's roles have been limited by tradition. Peasant women re-
 main largely in the traditional occupations of farming, marketing, and domestic
 tasks. Violence against women is known to occur with some frequency, but there are
 no statistics to document its extent. Because of societal traditions, domestic violence
 is generally not reported to police authorities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and the Labor Code guarantee the
 right of association. Workers, including those in the public sector, are specifically
 granted the right to form and join unions without prior government authorization.
 However, a union, which must have a minimum of 10 members, is required to reg-
 ister with the Minist  of Social Affairs within 60 days of its establishment. Union
 membership, margina2before last year's coup and even more so now, is estimated
 at 1 percent of the total labor force. There are five principal labor federations in
 Haiti: the Autonomous Central of Haitian Workers- the National Confederation of
 Haitian Teachers; the Federation of Unionized Workers; the Confederation of Hai-
 tian Workers; and the Independent General Organization of Haitian Workers. Each
 
 
 426
 of these organizations maintains some affiliation with various international labor or-
 ganizations.
 There is widespread repression and violence against trade union activities by the
 military authorities. Many union leaders have gone into hiding and closed their of-
 fices. Unions, as well as all other citizen groups or assemblies, may only meet with
 the express written permission of the military. Established unions of telephone,
 electrical, and journalism workers have either had leadership changes forced upon
 them by the military or have been completely replaced. There are also allegations
 of intimidation of agricultural union leaders by arrests, beatings, and banning of
 meetings.
 Tripartite negotiations (labor management, and government) begun in 1986 to re-
 vise the Labor Code were concluded n May. The revised code recognizes the right
 to strike but restricts the duration of certain types of strikes, as did the previous
 code. It code also stipulates that the Ministry of Social Affairs must recognize work-
 ers' right to strike in each case before the strike is legal. The revised code has yet
 to be approved by the Parlianient. There were no major public or private sector
 strikes in 1992. This is not attributable to labor/management harmony but rather
 to the atmosphere of severe repression that followed the coup d'etat and to the eco-
 nomic impact of the OAS embargo.
 b. The Right to Organize and Barain Collectively.-Trade union organizing ac-
 tivities are protected by the Labor Code, and those who interfere with this right
 may be fined. Employers, however, still routinely attempt to prevent workers from
 organizing labor unions, and government enforcement remains mostly ineffective.
 FS-men trade unionists were allegedly fired in May by a U.S. manufacturing firm
 which told them it was not a proper time for a union. While union activities have
 been curtailed by the de facto authorities, job loss as a result of economic conditions
 has had a far more damaging impact on union activities. Although there are no sta-
 tistics available on the number of jobs lost following the coup, fair estimates put the
 figure at 75 percent or about 30,000 jobs.
 Collective bargaining, which has never been widespread in Haiti, was nonexistent
 in 1992.
 While Haiti has no export processing zones as such, prior to the OAS trade em-
 bargo it did have a sizable export-oriented assembly sector. The Haitian Labor Code
 does not distinquish between industry producing for the local market and that pro-
 ducing for export. Many assembly sector jobs were unionized, probably to a greater
 extent than the industrial sector in general, as the assembly sector itself was better
 organized. Because assembly sector companies were the focus of developmental ef-
 forts, they received greater outside scrutiny and were consequently somewhat more
 generous with benefits such as on-site medical care, vitamin supplements, interest-
 free loans, and subsidized meals than domestically oriented producers. As the as-
 sembly sector has shrunk to approximately one-quarter of its precoup size in terms
 of employment, unions that were particularly strong in the assembly sector have de-
 clined accordingly.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, but enforcement of these rovisions is practically nonexistent.
 The common practice of forced domestic labor by children in Haiti, called restavek
 in Haitian Creole, continued unabated during 1992. There are an estimated 109,000
 restavek children in Haiti. Their situation was cited in a recent U.N. study as an
 example of slavery practiced in the 20th century. Young children from rural families
 are "adopted" and educated' by more affluent city dwellers to serve as unpaid do-
 mestic labor. The children are compelled to work long hours, receive poor nourish-
 ment, little or no education, and are frequently beaten and sexually abused. Most
 of Port au Prince's large population of street children are runaway restaveks, and
 child prostitution rings are alleged to purchase restavek children from their "adop-
 tive families." Local human rights groups do not regard the plight of restavek chi-
 dren as a priority, and do not report on abuses of children or actively seek to im-
 p rove their situation. The Justice and Social Affairs Ministries of the two postcoup
 Governments were equally silent on the issue.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The minimum employment age for
 minors in all sectors is 15 years. Fierce adult competition for jobs ensures that child
 labor is not a factor in the industrial sector. Children under 15 commonly work at
 odd jobs in both rural and urban settings in Haiti to supplement family income. En-
 forcement of child labor laws is the responsibility of the Ministry of Social Affairs
 but has been criticized by the International Labor Organization as inadequate.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage is set by law. A few weeks
 before the Se tember 1991 coup, Parliament passed a new minimum wage for work-
 ers in the infustrial sector. Although technically it became law before the coup, the
 legislation was never published in the Official Gazette; nevertheless, companies in
 
 
 427
 the assembly sector have already adopted it. Even if it were widely applied in the
 private sector, the revised minimum wage would not provide a worker and family
 with a decent living. The minimum w    law applies also to  icultural workers
 but is not enforced.aThus the mjority of Haitians, who work in the agricultural sec-
 tor must survive on considerably leas than the minimum wa
 The Labor Code governs individual employment contracta.he Code sets the nor-
 mal workday at 8 hours and the workweek at 48 hours, with 24 hours of rest on
 Sunday. It also establishes minimum health and safety standards particularly for
 hazardus occupations. The Government has not systematicall enforced labor laws
 regarding wages and minimum health and safety reoulations. These laws and regu-
 lations are somewhat better observed in the industrial sector, which is concentrated
 in the Port au Prince area and is more accessible to outside scrutiny.
