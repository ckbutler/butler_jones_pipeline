 YEMEN*
 The Republic of Yemen (ROY) was proclaimed on May 22, 1990,
 following 6 months of negotiations on unification by the
 political leadership of the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) and the
 People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY). On May 21, the
 two legislatures ratified an amended unity Constitution.
 Sanaa was designated the capital. Following unification, a
 5-member Presidential Council and 45-member Consultative
 Council were established. A Parliament was formed, comprising
 the legislatures of the two Yemens plus 31 newly appointed
 members. The Parliament, which will sit for a 30-month
 transitional period, began passing legislation to establish
 the institutions, ministries, and legal codes for the new
 State. The laws of the YAR and PDRY remain in effect in their
 respective parts of the country until new legislation valid
 for all of united Yemen is enacted. The first multiparty
 election for a united Yemeni Parliament is planned for
 November 1992.
 Leaders of the former YAR and PDRY dominate the new Republic's
 Government. Senior military officers and technocrats from the
 north have joined their opposite numbers from the PDRY
 government and ruling Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP) to share
 power in the new State. The central Government in Sanaa
 exercises its authority in all parts of the country, but
 tribal leaders, particularly in the north and east, retain
 significant prerogatives, such as tax collecting and mediating
 disputes.
 Although the two states' security services were technically
 abolished just before unification, a combined security service
 continues to exist as part of the Ministry of Interior. Its
 officers have broad discretion over national security issues,
 including the power to detain citizens for questioning; to
 monitor personal activities, telephone conversations, and
 correspondence; and to search homes, despite constitutional
 prohibitions against these practices.
 The ROY is a poor country of 12 million people with a
 rudimentary physical and social infrastructure. Two different
 economic systems-the north's basically free market economy
 and the south's heavenly, and formerly avowedly Marxist,
 government-regulated ecomomy--are merging along the lines of a
 market economy. The Government controls prices on some basic
 commodities but has relaxe& foreign exchange controls.
 Agriculture, oil, and workers' remittances dominate the Roy
 economy, with oil exports providing a large percentage of
 government revenues. Saudi Arabi.'s decision in September to
 make Yemenis working there comply with all visa, residency,
 and investment regulations, together with Iraq's invasion of
 Kuwait, have forced an estimated 750,000 Yemenis to return
 home. Yemen will lose considerable remittance income as a
 result. The full impact of the Saudi decision on the Yemeni
 economy has yet to be assessed.
 *On May 22, 1990, the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) and the
 People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY) united to form
 the Republic of Yemen (ROY). This report covers the YAR and
 PDRY up to unification and the ROY since unification. On
 April 30, 1990, the United States and the PDRY reestablished
 diplomatic relations, severed in 1969. Because of the lack of
 diplobatic relations between 169 and 1990, it is difficult to
 comment authoritatively on conditions in the former PDRY.
 
 
 1678
 Civil liberties remain significantly restricted, but there was
 improvement with respect to freedom of speech and preps and
 assembly. Some political prisoners in the former PDRY were
 released following an .amnesty, bit others remain unaccounted
 for. Major human-rights concerns include abuse of prisoners
 and detainees, arbitrary detention, and the lack of fair trial
 in security cases. Informal and some institutionalized
 discrimination exists against Yemeni citizens with a
 non-Yemeni parent. Tribal and traditional social customs
 continue to restrint-women's public role in society.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN'RIGHTS
 Section-1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no confirmed reports that ROY government agencies
 executed individuals for political reasons. A Muslim activist
 was killed in a Sanaa mosque by two presidential guards in
 September; the Government stated that the murder was due to
 personal reasons. The guards were detained and questioned,
 but there was no information on any further action.
 b. Disappearance
 There are occasional reports of Yemenis disappearing, following
 detention by the security forces or tribal or factional
 infighting. Most such detainees are eventually released.
 Female relatives of men imprisoned or missing after the bloody
 coup of January 13, 1986, in Aden demonstrated there in March,
 demanding information about missing relatives. PDRY officials
 denied that anyone was still imprisoned for the events of
 January 1986, but agreed to pay compensation to the families
 of those killed or missing from 1967 to 1986. In its 1990
 Report, covering 1989, Amnesty International (AI) noted that
 the fate of 16 political detainees who disappeared after
 arrest in the PDRY between 1967 and 1975 remains unknown. AI
 also noted that 12 persons arrested in the YAR for political
 reasons in previous years were reported in 1989 to have
 "disappeared" from custody. The U.S. National Academy of
 Science's committee on human rights expressed to the PDRY
 Government its concern about the disappearance of a South
 Yemeni doctor following his arrest in January 1986; the
 Government did not respond.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 -Treatment or Punishment
 Although the ROY, YAR, and PDRY Constitutions all proscribe
 physical torture, security officials reportedly resort with
 impunity to force or the threat of force to extract
 information from detainees. Most informed Yemenis believe the
 security forces engage in torture on occasion, although there
 were no public reports in 1990. AI's 1990 Report cites
 specific cases of torture of detainees in previous years.
 The YAR legal code is based on Islamic Shari'a law, which
 allows for such punishments as stoning for adultery,
 amputation for stealing, and beheading for murder; however,
 these penalties are rarely imposed. The ROY Constitution
 prohibits "physical punishment and degrading treatment" at the
 time of arrest or during jail or detention. While the new
 
 
 1679
 YEMEN
 Government has announced its intent to do away with the use of
 shackles, they continue to be used in Sanaa prisons. Mentally
 ill persons are occasionally shackled.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 There were continuing reports of arbitrary arrest in the ROY.
 Detainees are sometimes held without charge for extended
 periods of time,-despite a ROY constitutional provision
 limiting to 24 hours the time the police may hold a suspect
 without judicial concurrence. Persons, or their relatives,
 are sometimes detained without charge while the payment of
 compensation by the detainee's relatives to the victim or the
 victim's relatives is negotiated.
 Legal procedures which allow prisoners to notify relatives and
 lawyers upon their arrest are seldom observed, or observed
 only upon payment of a bribe, especially in cases of arrests
 by security officials. When foreigners were arrested,
 consular notification was late or nohexistent in the former
 YAR but prompt in the former PDRY. In at least one case
 involving the arrest of foreign citizens, ROY authorities
 promptly notified foreign missions.
 The ROY Constitution prohibits the exile of Yemeni citizens or
 the prevention of their return to Yemen. Many political
 dissidents returned to Yemen from self-imposed exile in the
 more liberal political climate of 1990.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The new Republic's judicial system is in flux. The ROY
 Constitution calls for an independent judiciary but does not
 spell out how the court system is to be organized. The
 transitional Parliament passed a law establishing the court
 system, setting out qualifications for judges and creating,
 for the first time in either Yemen, a Supreme Court, However,
 the Presidential Council returned the law to Parliament to
 resolve certain points thought to be unconstitutional.
 The YAR had three court systems: Shari'a, Commercial, and
 State Security. The Shari'a (Islamic) Courts had jurisdiction
 in all cases outside the domain of the other two, although
 there was some overlap in commercial cases. The Shari'a
 Courts, viewed within their traditional Islamic context (e.g.,
 there are no jury trials), were fair and impartial. If the
 defendant was brought to trial, he was informed of the charges
 against him at the conclusion of the police investigation.
 The judge actively questioned witnesses. Attorneys were
 allowed to counsel their clients but could not address the
 court or examine witnesses. Litigants in Commercial Courts
 could generally expect a fair and open trial with legal
 counsel, although tribal ties and bribery are said to have
 played a role in some judicial proceedings. Defendants in the
 Shari'a and Commercial Courts enjoyed the right of appeal and
 generally open court sessions. The Shari'a and Commercial
 Courts were largely independent of the executive, but all
 decisions, as in the State Security Courts, were subject to
 presidential review and confirmation. The YAR State Security
 Courts were convened by the President to try specific cases of
 espionage or other antigovernment .activity. Rights normally
 afforded the accused were subject to suspension in security
 cases. There is no indication that the State Security Courts
 were convened in 1990.
 
 
 1680
 In the PDRY, there was no separation of powers, according to
 the constitution, between the executive, legislative, and the
 judiciary. There was only one state power vested in "the
 sovereignty of the working people". There were three court
 systems--magistrate or divisional courts, provincial courts,
 and military courts--as well as a Supreme Court in Aden.
 Magistrates' courts had jurisdiction over most crimes, traffic
 offenses, juvenile cases, family cases, housing and agrarian
 disputes, and minor civil-matters. Provincial courts had
 jurisdiction over serious criminal cases involving the death
 sentence or long prison terms, inheritance cases, major civil
 claims, and appeals from magistrates' courts. The military
 courts had jurisdiction-over crimes within the armed forces. -
 The Supreme Court, under the PDRY constitution, supervised the
 other courts, heard appeals from the provincial courts, and
 interpreted the Constitution and fundamental laws.
 In the PDRY, many persons were believed to have been
 imprisoned wihout trial. Legal procedures for the protection
 of the accused were routinely ignored or manipulated. The
 (former president) Ali Nasir exile movement charged the PDRY
 .Government with conducting a show trial in 1989 of 14 persons
 charged with treason before the same judges who convicted and
 sentenced to death other Ali Nasir supporters in 1987, but
 there-was no independent confirmation of this allegation.
 The number -of political prisoners in the ROY is difficult to
 estimate. The Governments of the YAR and the PDRY denied the
 existence of political prisoners. AI's 1990 report on the YAR
 claimed that at least 26 political detainees arrested in
 previous year.s xemained ,in detention without charge or trial
 at the beginning-of-'1989, while its report.,n the PDRY stated
 that at least 45 suspected government opponents remained under
 detention without charge or tr-al. .In.J-anuary,'following the
 withdrawal from political-life bf former PDRY President Ali
 -asir, PDRY authorities announced an amnesty fot political
 prisoners, including 22 Ali Nasir supporters sentenned in 1986
 and 11 sentenced in 1989. The 33 released may include some of
 the 45 mentioned as being detained in AI's 1990 Report. In
 addition, the PDRY Supreme People's Council's Presidium
 decided in April to pardon Ali Nasir supporters sentenced in
 absentia to prison terms in 1986 as well as those convicted in
 a 1982 case.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Pxiva-y,,:Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The ROY Constitution specifically provides for thp freedom and
 confidentiality of mail, telephones, telegrams, and other
 means of communication, except in cases determined by law and
 a court order. The Constitution also specifies that
 residences, places of worship, and educational institutions
 are not to be searched except in cases specified by law.
 Nevertheless, security forces routinely search homes, monitor
 telephones, read personal mail, and otherwise intrude into
 personal matters under the stated justification that national
 security is believed to be-threatened.
 The routine stopping and searching automobiles and demanding
 identification -at checkpoints throughout the country
 diminished somewhat after unification.
 
 
 1681
 YEMEN
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The new ROY Constitution provides for freedom of speech and
 press "within the limits of the law." Many Yemenis are
 cautious in exercising their freedom of speech. Discussions
 at social gatherings are generally frank, but some Yemenis
 believe they may experience difficulty if security agents
 overhear them criticizing particular government leaders.
 After unification, there was significant relaxation of
 restrictions on freedom of the press. A new press law was
 passed on December 26, 1990, but no authoritative version of
 it was available at the end of the year. Several dozen new
 independent newspapers, representing diverse political
 viewpoints, began publication. Some criticized government
 leaders by name, and many criticized the Government's domestic
 policies. These new papers are distributed widely throughout
 Yemen. Nonetheless, the Government censored or stopped
 distribution of independent papers that commented on sensitive
 issues related to the Gulf crisis and on the ROY's relations
 with Saudi Arabia.
 The Ministry of Information owns and operates Yemen's radio
 and television stations, as well as several major newspapers.
 Yemen's two television channels regularly broadcast
 parliamentary sessions.
 A number of foreign English-language and Arabic-language
 newspapers and magazines are available in the cities.
 Occasionally, the Government has prevented the distribution of
 foreign Arabic language publications deemed to contain
 material critical of Yemen and its leaders.
 Self-censorship is sometimes practiced at Sanaa University,
 where professors and senior adminstrators require a security
 clearance before being hired. Most professors, including
 numerous expatriates, do not complain of government
 interference in their teaching programs or curriculum
 development.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Article 39 of the new ROY Constitution provides for freedom of
 association. Following unification, professional, labor,
 educational, and social organizations of the former YAR and
 PDRY began to unite, although philosophical differences
 between Muslim activists and leftists on occasion hindered the
 formation of unified organizations. These organizations must
 be registered with the Ministry of Social Security and Social
 Affairs.
 There were a number of demonstrations concerning missing and
 imprisoned persons, women's rights, and secondary school and
 university curriculums, most of which took place in what was
 formerly the PDRY. Citizens also occasionally demonstrated in
 front of Parliament and provincial government offices to voice
 their views on domestic economic issues. The Minister of
 Interior formally reiterated the right of Yemeni citizens to
 demonstrate peacefully.
 All government ministries and major organizations have
 security representatives on their staffs. Contact between
 Yemenis and foreigners, particularly diplomats, is selectively
 
 
 1682
 YE24EN
 monitored by the security forces. Official invitations and
 requests for appointments from diplomats to senior government
 officials, whether in Sanaa or Aden, must be sent through the
 Foreign Ministry, although contacts with businessmen and
 parliamentarians are routine. Yemeni visitors to foreign
 tmbassies and consulated are sometimes questioned by security
 guards. These procedures tend to discourage contact between
 Yemenis and diplomats.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Islam is the state religion in the ROY, and there are some
 restrictions on the practice of other religions. Most Yemenis
 are Muslims, either members of the Zaydi (Shi'a) sect or the
 Shafi'i (Sunni) school of jurisprudence. Historically, the
 Zaydis enjoyed greater political influence in the north.
 Shafi'is- form the majority in the united Yemen. Distinctions
 between the two sects are becoming blurred and were often more
 geographic and tribal than sectarian. The two Islamic
 communities coexist with little friction and have relatively
 few doctrinal differences. Islamic associations with ties to
 pan-Islamic organizations enjoy a degree of freedom, including
 the right to operate schools largely independent of the
 national school system. Radical Islamic revival is not a
 major force in the ROY, although Muslim activists increasingly
 assert their points of view on social and political issues.
 The ROY Constitution retains a requirement that senior
 government officials and Members of Parliament swear an oath
 to Allah. �
 Almost all of the once substantial Yemeni Jewish population
 has emigrated to Israel, but 1,000 to 1,500 remain, mostly in
 rural areas in the north. There are no synagogues, but Jews
 are permitted to practice their religion, including religious
 instruction, in private homes. The Government makes a point
 of ensuring that no impediment to this right exists. Although
 religious materials are not published in Hebrew in the ROY, the
 Government has allowed foreign Jewish groups to distribute
 Hebrew-language religious materials and religious articles
 .such as phylacteries and prayer shawls.
 There are no indigenous Christian Yemenis. Foreign Christians
 and the Indian-origin Christian community of Aden, like Jews,
 are permitted to conduct private services, but churches are
 not allowed. Foreign clergy are not allowed to proselytize,
 but some teach or work in social services.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The ROY constitutional freedom of travel within Yemen for
 Yemenis is respected throughout the country, although there
 are some checkpoints on major roads. Foreigners must register
 and receive permission to travel outside the capital.
 American tourists were detained in 1990 for traveling to areas
 outside Sanaa without permission.
 Many Yemenis historically have sought employment abroad. The
 Government does not restrict emigration, partly in recognition
 of the importance to the economy of foreign remittances.
 Procedures for obtaining passports and the necessary exit
 visas are sometimes onerous, especially for Yemeni men who
 have not completed their military service. Yemeni citizens,
 whether Jews or Muslims, are not allowed to travel to Israel.
 
 
 1683
 YEMEN
 There are about 1,100 Eritrean refugees from Ethiopia at a
 camp near the coastal town of al-Khawkha. Several thousand
 more Eritrean and Somali refugees are scattered throughout the
 country. The Government closely monitors all political
 activity by these refugees. Many of the Palestinians who
 arrived in Yemen from Lebanon in 1982-83 have departed; the
 remainder live in a camp near Sanaa and are closely watched by
 security forces. The movement and activity of the
 Palestinians are restricted. Other Palestininans reside in
 Aden, where they have traditionally enjoyed greater freedom of
 movement and activity. On the whole, Palestinians have not
 been able to assimilate into Yemeni society, largely due to
 its conservative tribal nature.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 In practice, citizens of both the YAR and the PDRY were unable
 peacefully to change the government. Political parties had
 been banned in the YAR, where the YAR Constitution prohibited
 them, and only one party was permitted in the PDRY, the Yemeni
 Socialist Party (YSP). In the ROY, citizens have the
 theoretical right under their Constitution to change their
 government in the future by secret ballot in periodic
 multiparty elections. These guarantees will be tested for the
 first time in November 1992, when the first elections for a
 united Yemeni Parliament are scheduled.
 All the top leaders of the YAR and the PDRY remained in power
 after Yemeni unification. Even before unification, while
 technically illegal in both the YAR and the PDRY, new
 political parties started forming. Article 39 of the ROY
 Constitution, allowing freedom of association for political,
 professional, and labor organizations, is generally
 interpreted as permitting political parties. During the year
 members of the Government, parliamentary committees, and some
 40 political parties debated the merits of a proposed new
 political parties. and elections law. President Saleh, Vice
 President Ai-Bidh, Prime Minister AI-Attas, Speaker of the
 Parliament Nu'man, and other senior government leaders all
 expressed their intention to establish a multiparty political
 system. Under the arrangements in force during the 30-month
 transitional period, the transitional Parliament is charged
 with enacting new laws to unify ministries, other government
 bodies, and legal codes until the first unified Yemeni
 Parliament is elected in November 1992. The 301-member
 transitional Parliament consists of 159 members from the
 former YAR Consultative Assembly, 111 members from the former
 PDRY Supreme People's Council (including 10 women), and 31
 specially appointed members. It held its inaugural session
 May 26. The ROY Constitution gives broad powers to the
 Parliament; these include electing the Presidential Council,
 withdrawing confidence from the Government, questioning the
 Prime Minister and government ministers, ratifying
 international agreements, and approving the budget.
 A five-member Presidential Council with broad executive powers
 was selected on the day of Yemeni unification, May 22. Its
 Chairman is the former YAR President, Ali Abdullah Saleh, and
 its Vice Chairman, the YSP Secretary General Ali Salem
 Al-bidh. Two days later Prime Mixnister Haydar Abu Bakr
 Al-attas (former Chairman of the Presidium of the PDRY's
 Supreme People's Council), who was appointed by the
 Presidential Council, formed a 39-minister Government, divided
 
 
 1684
 YEMEN
 evenly between northerners and southerners. In addition, a
 45-member Consultative Council was appointed by the
 Presidential Council to advise the Government on broad policy
 issues. This body is not called for in the Constitution, but
 is a transitional institution which will disppear at the end
 of a 30-month period.
 The majority of Members of Parliament, all members of the
 Presidential Council, and most government ministers belong to
 one of Yemen's two dominant political organizations, the
 former YAR's General People's Congress (GPC) and the former
 PDRY's YSP. However, there are distinct groupings with
 overlapping agenda within the Parliament: rightists,
 leftists, Socialists, traditional tribesmen, technocrats, and
 Muslim activists. Although the transitional Parliament is not
 organized on a party basis, some of the parties other than the
 YSP and the GPC are represented in it.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The ROY Government permitted AI to investigate prison
 conditions and allegations regarding political prisoners in
 October and November. In the past, neither the YAR nor PDRY
 had permitted any organization to investigate p6ssible human
 rights violations. However, AI did not release its report,
 nor did the Government formally respond in public to any
 private comments by AI.
 Local human rights advocates attemped to form a Yemeni chapter
 of the Arab Organization for Human Rights, but philosophical
 differences between leftists and Muslim activists have
 delayed its formation.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Article 27 of the ROY Constitution provides that: "Citizens
 are equal in the eyes of the law. They are equal iii rights
 and public duties without any discrimination because of sex,
 color, origin, language, occupation, social status, or
 religious belief."
 Jews usually live in relative harmony with their Muslim
 neighbors, and there were no reports in 1990 of incidents
 involving government-inspired or condoned harassment. Violent
 incidents do occur periodically, especially in the countryside.
 In the past the YAR Government made, and the ROY Government
 continues to make, consistent efforts to protect the largely
 rural, isolated Jewish community, both at the local level and,
 when necessary, through the intervention of senior government
 officials in Sanaa.
 Jews travel freely within Yemen. Two Jews traveled to the
 United States in 1990 for medical treatment and family
 reunification. Travelers to the ROY have been able to meet
 with members of the Jewish community.
 A substantial number of Yemeni citizens with a non-Yemeni
 parent do not enjoy the full range of their constitutional
 rights. These people, known as muwallidin, face both
 institutionalized and informal discrimination. Sanaa
 University, which is administered by the Government,
 advertises openings for teaching and senior administrative
 
 
 1685
 YEMEN
 positions with the stipulation that both parents of applicants
 must be Yemeni citizens. The same is true for applicants to
 Yemen's military academy. However, the two-Yemeni-parents
 rule is rarely enforced at Sanaa University. Discrimination
 against muwallidin is not universal or pervasive. Many senior
 government officials, including ministers, are muwallidin.
 Some muwallidin complain that they are required to pay
 substantial bribes to receive resident permits, passports, and
 other official documentation. Another smaller group known as
 akhdam, the descendants of former slaves, also faces
 persistent societal discrimination.
 The Constitution does not provide for equality of women under
 the law and restrictions on women are imposed by culture and
 tradition and by law. Since a uniform family law was not
 passed for the united Yemen in 1990, the laws in effect in the
 former YAR and PDRY remained in effect in those parts of the
 united Yemen. In 1988 the YAR Government ratified a 1981
 International Labor Organization (ILO) agreement mandating
 equality of opportunity and treatment in the workplace for men
 and women. In the 1988 YAR Consultative Assembly elections,
 the YAR Government upheld the right of women to vote but bowed
 to Muslim traditionalists in pressuring women candidates not
 to seek election.
 YAR family law is dominated by tribal customs and local
 traditions, influenced and modified by Islamic (Shari'a) law.
 Polygamy is allowed under Islamic law and occasionally
 practiced. The institution of dowry payments, whether the
 Islamic "mahr" paid by the husband to the wife upon divorce or
 tribal customary payments made by the groom to the bride's
 family or to the bride, is widespread. The amount of payments
 is steadily increasing in spite of government attempts to
 limit the amount.
 The postindependence PDRY Government introduced legislation to
 emancipate Yemeni women. One 1974 law, modeled after the
 divorce law of Tunisia, restricted polygamy by requiring the
 official permission of the court for a second marriage,
 prohibited child marriages, and provided for a considerable
 degree of female protection, including equal rights in
 divorce. Despite these laws, there are still frequent cases of
 polygamy, child marriage, and arbitrary divorce throughout
 Yemen, especially in the more traditional, rural areas.
 Particularly in Aden, women now work in middle-level jobs in
 several ministries and also in banks and other businesses.
 Yemen's largest factory group employs women on the same pay
 scale as men, and women there have risen through the ranks to
 lower management positions. There are female judges and
 lawyers in Aden. After sharp debate, the new Parliament voted
 in September not to discriminate by sex in enumerating the
 qualifications for judges, prosecutors, and lawyers.
 Societal pressures often force women to defer to the guidance
 of male colleagues and the general supervision of male
 relatives. Women seeking exit visas are often asked to prove
 that male relatives do not object to their travel. Education
 for women in significant numbers began in the YAR only at the
 end of the civil war in 1970; education for women in the PDRY
 was more advanced. The literacy rate for women is
 substantially less than it is for men.
 A form of female genital mutilation, clitorectomy is practiced
 in the Red Sea coastal region (the Tihama), especially among
 
 
 1686
 Yemenis of African origin. The extent of the practice is
 unknown.  While some individual government health workers in
 the Tihama actively discourage clitorectomy, there is no
 government directive or guidance against the practice.
 Conservative social mores prevent public discussion or
 government acknowledgement of the practice.
 Wife beating and other physical abuse of women occurs in
 Yemeni families, but there is virtually no public discussion
 of the subject and little is known about its extent. The
 woman victim usually turns to her male relatives to pressure
 the perpetrator to stop the abuse; she can seek a legal remedy
 in court, but social traditions usually impel women and their'
 male relatives to seek mediation to keep the matter within the
 extended family.
 The government-sponsored women's associations of the former
 YAR and PDRY, which promoted female education and civic
 responsibilities, merged in 1990.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 As the united Yemen has not yet enacted a new labor code, the
 labor codes for the former YAR and PDRY remain in effect for
 their respective parts of the ROY.
 In both the YAR and PDRY, labor unions were closely
 controlled, if not organized, by the Government. Under the
 YAR labor code, a union may be set up by 100 or more workers
 upon application to and approval by government authorities.
 The code prescribes a single union system with one union
 committee per enterprise, one union branch per locality, one
 general union per economic sector, and one national umbrella
 organization, which was the Yemeni Trade Union Confederation.
 Government employees and some categories of farm workers are
 excluded from union membership. The YAR labor code prohibits
 unions from engaging in any political activity, and their
 financial records are subject to government oversight. YAR
 trade unions were reported to-be under heavy security forces'
 influence and were not known to challenge the government.
 In the YAR, labor-related legislation neither allows nor
 disallows strikes. At least one union-sanctioned strike
 occurred in the Marib oil fields in 1990. There were several
 wildcat strikes, particularly by truck drivers.
 In the PDRY the General Federation of Trade Unions (GFTU), the
 PDRY's only labor association, was under close YSP control.
 Nevertheless, 1990 witnessed the first strikes in 20 years in
 South Yemen. In January, February, and March, workers in most
 major sectors--the ports, the Aden oil refinery, utilities,
 communications, textiles, government ministries, fisheries,
 construction, tobacco, pharmaceuticals, and hospitals--struck
 for higher wages and better working conditions. Strikes in
 some sectors, most notably at the ports and the oil refinery,
 continued after unification. The PDRY Government resolved
 most strikes by promising higher wages and improved working
 conditions.
 The YAR and PDRY labor confederations merged in 1990, forming
 the Yemeni Confederation of Labor Unions (YCLU). It is
 affiliated with the International Confederation of Arab Trade
 Unions and the Communist-controlled World Federation of Trade
 
 
 1687
 
 Unions. The ILO's Committee on the Application of Standards
 criticized Yemen in 1990 for not supplying required reports in
 1989.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Although the YAR labor code calls on employers to treat
 workers
 correctly, it does not contain provisions to ensure worker
 protection against acts of discrimination by employers, nor
 does it provide a legal framework for a free collective
 bargaining system. There is no bargaining, and there are no
 collective agreements in force. The YAR had been criticized
 by the ILO for portions of the labor code in conflict with ILO
 conventions. Until a new labor code is passed for the ROY,
 workers in the former YAR enjoy limited protections under the
 YAR labor code. There is no export processing zone in the
 former YAR.
 In the PDRY, the State, through the YSP-controlled unions,
 purported to represent the rights of the workers. There was
 no collective bargaining, and there were no nongovernmental
 bodies that addressed labor grievances. Nevertheless, the
 wave of strikes in 1990 necessitated bargaining between
 workers and state management. A small special export
 processing zone was established in the port of Aden but
 remained inactive while a larger free zone in Aden was under
 discussion.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced or compulsory labor is forbidden by the ROY
 Constitutioa. There are no reports of forced or compulsory
 labor in Yemen.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 In the YAR, there was no minimum age for employment of
 children, but compulsory education requirements--when
 enforced--had the same effect. These requirements were
 generally ignored, however. Labor by minors aged 12 to 14 was
 regulated by the labor code.
 In the PDRY, the labor code prohibited the employment of
 children (defined as between 7 and 12 years of age) and young
 persons (between 12 and 16 years of age). However, apprentice
 employment of young person 14 years and older was permitted.
 Throughout Yemen, child labor is common. It is particularly
 prevalent in rural areas, where it is sanctioned by family
 custom or, in the case of some areas in the south, is
 performed in the context of work on family, cooperative, or
 state farms.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 There was no minimum wage in the YAR. The legal daily minimum
 wage in the PDRY was $13.54. The prevailing daily wage for
 unskilled labor in the ROY is $12-15, which allows a very
 modest standard of living for a worker with a family. YAR
 legal codes prescribed a maximum 8-hour workday (6 during
 Ramadan), but some workshops operate 10- or 12-hour shifts
 without penalty. The YAR labor code does not prescribe the
 number of workdays, only that the maximum workweek consist of
 48 hours. The PDRY labor code stipulates a 42-hour workweek.

 YEMEN
 In the YAR, the rights of workers were enunciated by law, but
 labor regulations were not strictly enforced. The YAR
 Ministry of Labor, upon a formal employee complaint of a
 violation of the labor code, investigated the complaint and,
 if found valid, sought restitution from the employer.
 Enforcement of the labor code was more prevalent against
 employers of large numbers of expatriate workers and against
 foreign employers of Yemeni workers. Occasional stricter
 enforcement of the labor code against large employers of
 foreign workers likely occurs because it is easier to monitor
 expatriate workers who require work and residence permits and
 are often on government-to- government contracts. However,
 stricter enforcement of the labor code against foreign
 employers of Yemenis probably reflects a conscious effort by
 the ROY to discriminate against these employers.
 Local production in the north is largely based on agriculture
 and cottage industries. Hiring often depends on family and
 tribal connections. While working conditions are sometimes
 harsh, consistent with the prevailing subsistence economy, the
 YAR government set general safety requirements for larger
 concerns and occasionally checked to see if they were being
 observed.
 In the former PDRY, there was legislation regulating
 conditions of labor, but there was no mechanism for effective
 enforcement. Labor legislation was uniform throughout the
 former PDRY but labor practice was not. Many, perhaps most,
 workers in the south are farmers, many of whom work on
 state-controlled or cooperative farms. Those in more isolated
 rural areas enjoy a greater degree of independence.
