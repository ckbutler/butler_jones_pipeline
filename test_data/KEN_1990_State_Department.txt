 KENYA
 Kenya, which has had elected civilian government since
 independence in 1963, has been a de jure one-party state since
 a constitutional amendment in 1982. President Daniel T. arap
 Moi remains firmly in control of both the Government and the
 sole party, the Kenyan African National Union (KANU). KANU
 membership is a prerequisite for participation in politics in
 Kenya. The popularly elected National Assembly (a unicameral
 parliament) of 188 members (including 10 appointed by the
 President and 2 ex officio members) has little independent
 power in national political affairs, but its sessions provide
 a forum for its members to raise local or regional issues.
 The internal security apparatus includes the police Criminal
 Investigation Department (CID), the paramilitary general
 services unit (GSU, and the Directorate of Security and
 Intelligence (DSI or Special Branch. The CID and Specia-}
 Branch investigate criminal activity and are also used to
 monitor dissidents and others whom the State considers
 subversive. The internal security apparatus has been used to
 intimidate and harass politicians, opponents of the
 Government, and dissidents, frequently by calling them En for
 questioning on political topics, and it has committed some
 abuses. General Services Unit personnel were employed in
 February and July 1990 to suppress rioting.
 Kenya's modern, market-oriented economy includes a
 well-developed private sector for trade and light
 manufacturing as well as an agricultural sector that provides
 food for local consumptioa and substantial exports of coffee,
 tea, and other commodities. The well-developed tourism
 industry remained the top foreign exchange earner in 1990 but
 suffered setbacks from riots in July and subsequent political
 tensions that resulted in major cancelations. Although
 economic growth continued, a persistently high population
 growth rate contributed to a serious and growing problem of
 unemployment.
 During 1990 the Government responded to agitation for
 political change by further restricting human rights and, at
 year's end, by taking a number of positive, but limited,
 steps. Early in the year, some Kenyans began to call for a
 review of Kenya's political structure and adoption of a
 multiparty system. After a period of vigorous but peaceful
 debate on the issue, the Government, acting on the belief that
 a public rally in support of a multiparty system was to be
 held on July 7 under the sponsorship of former cabinet
 ministers Kenneth Matiba and Charles Rubia, detained Rubia,
 Matiba, and four others under the Preservation of Public
 Security Act (PPSA) and banned the rally. However, on July 7
 rioting broke out in Nairobi and other towns. The Government,
 responding forcibly, restored order by July 11. At least 20
 people died, more than 70 were injured, and over 1,000 were
 arrested. Subsequently, the Government charged approximately
 100 persons with sedition, most of them for possessing public
 domain material which was critical of the Government.
 Throughout the remainder of the year, the Government continued
 to intimidate and harass a number of other persons advocating
 political reform, including union leaders, former Members of
 Parliament (M.P.'s), associates of unpopular government
 critics. In October the Government arrested former M.P. Koigi
 Wa Wamwere. Wamwere and six others were charged with treason.
 
 
 KENYA
 The Government also banned the preeminent magazine involved in
 the multiparty debate, the Nairobi Law Monthly, (but the ban
 was lifted by the High Court), banned one non-Christian
 religious group, and brought criminal charges against members
 of another sect. In response to pressure for political
 change, the party established a Review Committee to examine
 the electoral process, nomination rules, and disciplinary
 procedures. The Review Committee held hearings country-wide
 during July and August (see Section 3), and at year's end the
 party abolished queue-voting and modified several other
 electoral procedures in response to citizen comments. In a
 related development, President Moi initiated, and Parliament
 passed, a constitutional amendment to interpose a tribunal,
 appointed by the President, in case of removal from office of
 judges and several other public officials. Areas of human
 rights abuse included abuse of prisoners, arbitrary arrest and
 detention, and restrictions on freedom of speech, press,
 assembly, association, and the right to change one's
 government.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 Foreign Minister Robert Ouko was murdered in mid-February
 under mysterious circumstances. At the request of the Kenyan
 Government a team of Scotland Yard investigators began an
 investigation February 20. The final report, delivered to the
 Kenyan Government September 28, had not been released to the
 public by the end of 1990. President Moi, who promised to
 find and punish the perpetrators, appointed a judicial
 commission of inquiry October 1 to continue the investigation
 into Ouko's death. At year's end the commission was still
 taking testimony. There has been no official conclusion as to
 the guilty party.
 The security forces and demonstrators clashed at the site of a
 banned rally on July 7, touching off disturbances that lasted
 several days, and which resulted in 20 persons killed and 70
 injured. The Government attributed the casualties to
 rampaging mobs or traffic accidents caused by the rioting and
 claimed that an unspecified number were shot by security
 forces while looting, stealing, or burning vehicles.
 A suspect, Rajirdagane Baraki, died September 18 while under
 treatment for wounds allegedly inflicted while in police
 custody. The incident was investigated, but no charges were
 brought.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, and Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Torture is proscribed under the Constitution, but there
 continued to be credible reports of police brutality and abuse
 of prisoners in 1990. Four persons charged July 25 with
 taking part in a meeting to overthrow the Government claimed
 before the High Court that they were subjected to extremely
 harsh conditions in police custody. The men, George Anyona,
 
 
 169
 KENYA
 twice detained and a former M.P.; Isaiah Ngotho Kariuki, a
 university lecturer; Dr. Edward Akongo Oyugi, also a
 university lecturer; and Augustus Njeru Kathangu, a KANU Party
 official, charged that they were interrogated while naked and
 kept incommunicado in dark rooms flooded with water. They
 also charged that they were not allowed to speak freely with
 their attorneys and other visitors. In early October, the
 four withdrew their suit against the Government for
 mistreatment and asked that their cases proceed to trial
 immediately.
 Koigi Wa Wamwere and his coaccused, who were charged with
 treason late in the year-, alleged that they were tortured and
 subjected to inhuman treatment. In an affidavit filed
 December 17, Wamwere claimed to have been subjected to
 psychological abuse and.physical discomfort in an effort to
 compel him to make statements.
 A Presbyterian minister jailed for 6 years on a sedition
 charge, .Reverend Lawford Imunde, appealed to the High Court
 for immediate release in April, alleging that his guilty plea
 was extracted by Special Branch officers through cruelty,
 torture, inhuman treatment, and false promises ofrelease.
 The appeal was denied (see also Section I.e.Y. In.March an
 ex-detainee, David Mukaru Ng'ang' a. unsuccessful-ly sought-an.
 injunction to restrain the Commissioner of Palice from ï¿½
 arresting- detaining, harassing or otherwise wulawfully.
 intimidating hrm.- He claimed that he had been subjected to
 physical and mental torture when-detained for 90 days in 1989
 under the PPSA. Ngangra said he was forced to stay naked for
 long periods and kept in water, There were-few instances, in
 1990 of officials being tried and punished for human rights
 abuses. In:one instance the Government paid compensation to
 the family of a Zairean who died in police custody. Three
 police officers in Kakamega were charged with the murder of a
 student and his brother who died during a.confrontation.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution provides that arrested persons (other.than-
 those detained under the Preservation of Public Security Act)
 shall be brought before a court "as soon as is reasonably
 practicable," and that if such person is not brought within 24
 hours of his arrest -or from the commencement of his detention,.
 the burden-of explanation is on. the authorities,. The
 Constitution was amended in 1988 to allow the police to hold
 people suspected of capital offenses for 14 days before being
 brought before a court. Capital offenses include such crimes
 as murder and treason. In practice, suspects in noncapital
 crimes are often.held incommunicado for- 2 to 3 week, before
 being brought before a court. Often, family members bring
 lawsuits to compel authorities to produce "missing" prisoners.
 The PPSA allows the State to detain a person indefinitely
 without charges or trial upon a.determination "that it is
 necessary for the preservation of public security."
 "Preservation of public security," a holdover from colonial
 days, includes "prevention and suppression of -rebellion,
 mutiny, violence, intimidation, disorder and crime, unlawful
 attempts and conspiracies to overthrow the Government or the
 Constitution," and several other grounds." A formal detention
 order must be signed and published in the Kenya Gazette.
 There is no judicial review of the legality of detention.
 Detention cases are reviewed by a board appointed by the
 
 
 170
 KENYA
 President which meets in camera every 6 months, but the
 Government is not bound by this board's recommendations.
 In 1990 there were six detentions under the PPSA: Kenneth
 Matiba, the former Minister of Transport and Communications;
 Charles Rubia, former Mayor of Nairobi; Raila Odinga, a
 businessman and son of a former Vice President; Gitobu
 Imanyara, Nairobi Law Monthly editor; John Khaminwa, attorney
 representing Matiba and Rubia; and Mohamed Ibrahim, an
 attorney with Waruhiu and Muite advocates. These were the
 first detentions under the PPSA since President Moi freed
 seven detainees in 1989. At the end of 1990, Matiba, Rubia,
 and Odinga remained in detention.
 Matiba and Rubia came to prominence in the multiparty debate
 when they issued a statement in May calling on President Moi
 to direct Parliament to repeal the amendment which made Kenya
 a de jure one-party state, to dissolve parliament, and to call
 new elections. On June 20, Kenyan police attempted to arrest
 the two for holding an illegal meeting while Matiba and Rubia
 were consulting with their attorney. The police did not
 present a warrant and left without arresting them. Matiba and
 Rubia later applied for a permit to hold a July 7 rally on the
 multiparty issue. No permit was issued, and Matiba and Rubia
 said publicly that they would not hold the rally. In the face
 of rumors that supporters of the two planned to hold the rally
 without a permit, Kenyan police took Matiba and Rubia into
 custody July 4, and they were officially detained July 5.
 Raila Odinga, an associate of Matiba and Rubia, was arrested
 July 5 and officially detained July 10. He has been detained
 twice before. His father, former Vice President Jaramogi
 Oginga Odinga, is an outspoken critic of the Government.
 In a major crackdown on its critics, the Government went on to
 detain other persons connected with Matiba and Rubia.
 Attorney John Khaminwa was arrested July 4 when he went to a
 Nairobi police station to inquire about his clients'
 whereabouts. Mohamed Ibrahim, an ethnic Somali who publicly
 refused to submit to the Kenya Government's requirement that
 ethnic Somali Kenyans register and carry a special
 identification document, was also arrested July 4 (see also
 Section 5). On July 5 police arrested Nairobi Law Monthly
 editor Gitobu Imanyara. Detention orders for Khaminwa,
 Ibrahim, and Imanyara were published July 10, and they were
 held until July 26. In all six cases of detention, the
 families of the detainees were not told where the men were
 held, and the families filed habeas corpus petitions demanding
 that the Government file charges or release them. When
 Imanyara was released, he was turned over immediately to the
 CID for questioning and was later charged with publishing a
 seditious publication (see also Section 2.a.).
 The Government brought sedition charges against four persons
 July 25 and charged they were holding a meeting to plan its
 overthrow and had in their possession issues of a British
 publication, Africa Confidential, containing articles critical
 of the Kenya Government. The four, George Anyona, Isaiah
 Ngotho Kariuki, Dr. Edward Akong'o Oyugi, and Augustus
 Kathangu, remained in jail at year's end. Their three
 applications for bail were denied.
 The Government crackdown on dissidents continued in the fall.
 Former MP Koigi Wa Wamwere was arrested October 9 for
 allegedly possessing illegal weapons and plotting to organize
 
 
 171
 KENYA
 illegal street vendors and private bus operators to
 participate in acts of violence. Wamwere, who had been
 detained on two previous occasions under the PPSA, had been
 living in exile in Norway. On December 17, Wamwere filed an
 affidavit alleging he had been kidnaped by Kenyan authorities
 during a visit to Uganda. His brother, Charles Kuria, was
 jailed for 4 years, for alleged membership in a clandestine
 organization. Lawyers Rumba Kinuthia and Mirugi Kariuki were
 picked up October 8 by 30 plainclothes police who raided their
 homes at 3 a.m., reportedly looking for arms smuggled in by
 Wamwere.
 The Government charged Koigi Wa Wamwere, attorneys Rumba
 Kinuthia and Mirugi Kariuki, and another man, Geoffrey
 Kariuki, with treason October 19. The Government accused
 Wamwere and the others of seeking to organize illegal hawkers
 and others "to participate in acts of violence and
 lawlessness, and generally to promote a defiant culture." On
 December 11, three other persons who had been charged with
 misprision (concealment) of treason were added to the case.
 They are Joseph Mwaura Kinuthia, Hosea Mwaura Kinuthia, and
 Harun Wakaba. A number of other prominent persons were also
 briefly held in early October for questioning in connection
 with Wamwere's activities.  These included a number ofM-P.'s
 or former M.P.'s and Wanguhu Ng'ang'a, a businessman and
 contributor to the Nairobi Law Monthly. One of those arrested
 was M.P. Christopher Kamuyu, who was charged with possession
 of a banned magazine. Most of the persons picked up for
 questioning are of Kikuyu ethnic origin.
 In many other cases, the number of which is difficult to
 gauge, Kenyans were held in police custody for periods ranging
 from a few hours to several days without being charged or
 officially detained under any specific authority. The purpose
 seemed to be intimidation of government critics. Some of
 those incIude Kimondo Kirui, Rubia's- former chief campaigner,
 Joseph Mwaura Nderi, former chairman of the banned Matatu
 Vehicles Owners Association, and Joseph Gichuku, a Matiba
 supporter and hotel owner. Some 1,000 persons were charged
 with rioting and looting during disturbances that took place
 July 7-10 and sentenced to between 3 months' and 2 years'.
 imprisonment or released on bond of approximately $450 each.
 Traditionally, neither exile nor threat of exile has been used
 by the Government as a means of intimidation or punishment.
 However, two Kenyan dissidents resorted to self-exile in
 1990. Neither was formally charged with any crime. During a
 Government campaign in March against "rumor-mongering," in
 which a number of prominent critics were questioned, David
 Mukaru Ng'ang'a fled the country. Ng'ang'a, a former
 university lecturer, had spent 5 of the last 8 years in jail,
 without charge or trial under the PPSA. After his release in
 1989, Ng'ang'a sued the Government seeking damages for torture
 and illegal detention. After avoiding a March 10 attempt by
 plainclothes police to bring him in for questioning, on March
 12 Ng'ang'a filed an application for an injunction against
 arrest and an application of advance bail. On March 19 the
 High Court rejected the application, and on March 29 Ng'ang'a
 disappeared from sight. He later was accepted in Europe as a
 refugee. President Moi subsequently invited Ng'ang'a to
 return home without fear. One of the Government's most
 outspoken critics, Gibson Kamau Kuria, was allowed to leave
 the country July 11 after spending 4 days in the U.S.
 Embassy. Kuria, a former detainee, went into hiding July 5
 after former cabinet ministers Kenneth Matiba and Charles
 
 
 172
 KENYA
 Rubia were detained. Kuria, who was detained in 1987 for 10
 months as he prepared to sue the Government for allegedly
 torturing prisoners, received the 1988 Robert F. Kennedy
 Memorial human rights award, although the Government refused
 to give him a passport to attend the award ceremony (see
 Section 2.d.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Kenya's legal system, as defined in the Judicature Act of
 1967, is based on the Kenyan Constitution, laws passed by
 Parliament, and common law or court precedent. Customary law
 is used as a guide in civil matters affecting people of the
 same ethnic group so long as it does not conflict with
 statutory law. Kenya does not have the jury system. The
 court system consists of a Court of Appeals, a High Court, and
 two levels of magistrates' courts where most criminal and
 civil cases originate. Civilians are tried in civilian
 courts, and verdicts may be appealed to the High Court and
 ultimately to the Court of Appeals. Kenyans do not have a
 right to legal counsel except in certain capital cases. Most
 persons tried for capital offenses are provided counsel free
 of charge if they cannot afford it. Military personnel are
 tried by military courts, and verdicts may be appealed.
 Attorneys for military personnel are appointed on a case-by-
 case basis by the Chief Justice.
 The President appoints the Chief Justice and other members of
 the Court of Appeal and the High Court with the advice of the
 judicial service commission. The President also appoints the
 Attorney General.
 The President's power over the judicial system was increased
 through constitutional amendments adopted in 1986 and 1988,
 which gave the President unlimited authority to remove the
 Attorney General, the Auditor General, and High Court Judges.
 In November President Moi directed the Attorney General to
 draft a bill revising the constitutional provisions on
 security of tenure of the judiciary, the attorney general,
 auditor general, and controller. The bill, passed in
 December, requires that a tribunal be impaneled in each case
 in which a question arises of removing a judge, the Attorney
 General, or the Controller for misconduct. However, most
 members of the panel are to be appointed by the President in
 each case. The effect of the amendment is that the President
 no longer has sole authority over the removal of a judge. In
 December President Moi announced that he would make the office
 of the Director of Public Prosecutions a tenured office.
 A particularly egregious example of denial of a fair trial is
 the case of Reverend Lawford Imunde (see also Section l.c.).
 He was sentenced to 6 years in prison after pleading guilty to
 three counts of sedition. Imunde was detained for 13 days
 after his arrest and charged only after his spouse went to the
 press. The evidence of his sedition was a note in his diary
 saying "the death of Dr. Ouko had implications on stability,"
 criticism of the government statement issued after Dr. Ouko's
 death, which implied that Ouko had shot and burnt himself, and
 his possession of two allegedly seditious articles: "African
 Independent States and Human Rights" and "Education for All
 but the Very Few." Imunde had no representation during the
 trial, when he reportedly accused the National Council of
 Churches of Kenya of belonging to a conspiracy to destabilize
 the Moi Government. After sentencing, Imunde had an apparent
 change of heart and asked the court to reconsider his case and
 
 
 173
 KENYA
 change his plea to innocent. Imunde claimed his confession
 was extracted through torture and promises of release. He
 also revealed a deal he alleged was offered by police, namely,
 to refrain from seeking legal counsel, apologize to President
 Moi, plead guilty to sedition, and accuse religious
 organizations of trying to destabilize the Government, in
 exchange for a light noncustodial sentence. Imunde's appeal
 was filed in November, but the hearing had not been scheduled
 as of year's end.
 In some cases, fair trial is precluded by legislation. A
 relic of the. colonial period, enacted in 1948, the Chief's
 Authority Act gives low-level administration officials-, called
 chiefs, wide-ranging powers including the power to arrest and
 hoId individuals and to restrict a person's movement. The Act
 is- subject to abuse. In one instance, 13 people who failed to
 attend a required tree-planting ceremony were jailed 2Y days
 without the option of a fine. Tire Kenya lawr reform commission
 has recommended that the law be abolished.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with-Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence.
 Searches without warrants are allowed under the Constitution
 in certain instances "to promote the public benefit,"
 including security cases. Security officials also conduct
 searches without warrants- to apprehend suspected criminals or
 to seize property-suspected to be stolen. Homes of suspected
 dissidents have been searched without warrants
 Security forces reportedly employ a variety of surveillance
 techniques, including electronic surveillance and a network of
 informers. For example, two security officials were placed
 outside of one attorney's office for about 1 month. The
 security men stopped clients leaving the office and demanded
 their identity. The attorney filed suit in June asking the
 High Court to rule that the interference and-harassment by
 Special Branch officers as he cbnsulted with his clients,
 Kenneth Matiba and Charles Rubia, was illegal and a
 contravention of his right to protectiorr against arbitrary
 entry on his premises. The Court had not ruled on the case by
 year's end.
 There have been attacks on the families of persons critical of
 the Government. The wife of Kenneth Matiba suffered a
 fractured skull during an attack by a gang June 14 at the
 family's home. Matiba was not at home at the time. Although
 the Government has denied any involvement and arrested several
 suspects, robbery is an unlikely motive, since less than $100
 was taken from the home.
 On November 21, the Nairobi City Commission demolished
 Kibagare village on the Western outskirts of Nairobi, leaving
 some 30,000 people homeless. The Government has offered
 little explanation except to charge that the slums are
 inhabited by criminal elements who are also a security risk.
 In May the City Commission demolished Muoroto shanty village
 in central Nairobi, leaving several thousand homeless.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and press and
 outlaws discrimination against any Kenyan on grounds of
 
 
 174
 KENYA
 political opinion. However, in practice the exercise of these
 rights continues to be restricted. Some 30 persons were
 arrested in 1990 on charges of disturbing the peace which
 included a wide range of actions from street preaching
 critical of the Government to flashing two fingers to show
 support for multiparty politics in Kenya. Parliament rarely
 debates national issues such as foreign policy.
 Government and KANU officials' attacks in the press on
 outspoken politicians, clergymen, and lawyers, as well as the
 detention provisions of the PPSA, discourage public exchange
 of views on sensitive issues. Despite these limitations,
 Kenyan press reporting on local issues remains spirited. The
 press fully reported commentary critical of the Government
 during the KANU Review Committee hearings.
 One television station and all radio stations are owned and
 controlled by the Government. A second television station is
 owned by KANU and adheres to self-imposed guidelines. The
 KANU-owned outlet carries Cable News Network (CNN) programs,
 generally without restriction, although at times stories on
 Kenya have been deleted.
 Privately owned newspapers and journals are published in
 Kenya, and there is no systematic censorship of the press,
 although the press practices self-censorship and confines its
 commentary within usually understood but legally undefined
 limits. The press criticizes some government policies and
 frequently government officials and politicians but never the
 President. At times the Government intervenes to tell editors
 how to handle sensitive stories. When former Vice President
 Oginga Odinga sent an open letter to the President with
 scathing criticism of the one-party system, only foreign
 networks, and later two local magazines, carried the message.
 The Kenyan broadcast media and daily press were apparently
 instructed not to carry the message. It was later published
 in the Nairobi Law Monthly and Finance Magazine. However, in
 October and again in November police seized issues of Finance
 Magazine (not banned) from street vendors for carrying
 controversial articles.
 Constitutional rights have been particularly circumscribed in
 political/security cases involving possession of allegedly
 seditious documents and music. The documents are, for the
 most part, in the public domain. In the latter half of 1990,
 some 75 persons were charged with sedition in cases which
 appear to consist mainly of possession of any material
 critical of the Government. For example, the nephew of former
 Vice President Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, Joseph Ager, was
 arrested for alleged possession of an Africa Confidential
 issue containing the article "Kenya, the Security Home Boys."
 Possession of the article, which criticizes corruption in the
 Government, has been cited as grounds for sedition charges in
 over 20 cases.
 In 1990 the Government banned one magazine, the Nairobi Law
 Monthly, and police harassed street vendors for selling the
 magazine. A High Court ruling suspended the ban a week later,
 but the Government continued to harass vendors and confiscate
 copies until mid-October. The Government ban was in response
 to the publication of an issue on recommendations for
 political change given to the KANU Review Committee. The
 Government has employed in the past the practice of banning
 magazines that covered politically sensitive issues. The
 Nairobi Law Monthly joined three other proscribed periodicals,
 
 
 KENYA
 Development Agenda and the Financial Review, banned in 1989,
 and Beyond, a publication of the National Council of Churches
 of Kenya, which was banned in 1988.
 The editor of the Nairobi Law Monthly, Gitobu Imanyara, was
 charged with sedition and with failing to comply with the
 provisions of the Books and Newspapers Act. The Government
 also revived an old criminal charge against him, which had
 earlier been suspended pending high court review of
 constitutional objections. The sedition charge referred to
 Imanyara's publication of an issue entitled "The Historic
 Debate" in- July which dealt with- democracy and multiparty
 politics in Kenya. At the end of 1990 no hearing date had
 been set on any of Imanyara's-cases. The Government had not
 granted consent to the public prosecutor to prosecute on the
 sedition charge.
 The Government, in what appears to be an arbitrary decision
 citing no legalauthority, has made possession of music
 cassettes containing songs critical of the Government grounds
 for sedition charges. The Government never officially banned
 the cassettes in question. Police arrested some 30 shop
 owners and musicians for producing, selling, or possessing
 "seditious" cassettes, many of which are folk songs commenting
 on the author's version of current events. One group of cases
 was dropped in early October, but an unknown number of others
 were still pending at the end of December. '
 Newspapers, magazines, and books from abroad are readily
 available. In November, however, the Government would not
 allow an issue of Newsweek into the country because it
 included an article "prejudicial" to Kenya. Some copies
 nevertheless managed to enter and were sold to the public. In
 December, one issue of the International Herald Tribune,
 containing an article critical of the Government, was not
 distributed.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly but is
 seriously limited by the Public Order and Police Act, which
 gives authorities power to control public gatherings, defined
 as meetings of three or more persons. It is illegal to
 convene an unlicensed meeting. In June police broke up
 meetings being held in attorney Paul Muite's office stating
 that the participants had no permit for such a gathering. The
 Government refused to issue a permit to former cabinet
 ministers Matiba and Rubia to hold a public rally in July on
 the multiparty debate.
 Freedom of association is governed by the Societies Act which
 states that every association must be registered or exempted
 from registration by the registrar of societies. Some groups
 have had difficulty obtaining registration or have been
 deregistered'(see Section 2.c.). With the exception of civil
 servants, who are required to join KANU, Kenyans are not bound
 legally to join any political organization. Although the
 party and the Government emphasize that it is voluntary, KANU
 party membership is a prerequisite for voting and holding
 public office. No other political party is permitted.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Kenya has no state religion. Freedom of worship is
 acknowledged in the Constitution and generally allowed, but
 
 
 176
 KENYA
 churches new to Kenya must obtain government approval to be
 registered. The Government can also withdraw its approval and
 "deregister" a church as it did in February to the Kikuyu
 (tribe) based religious group called the Tent of the Living
 God. The Government deregistered the group on the grounds of
 maintaining peace and order.
 Also in February, 27 members of another predominantly Kikuyu
 religious group, the Church of Christ (which mixes
 non-Christian forms of worship with Christian beliefs) were
 remanded into custody and charged with holding an unlicensed
 meeting. In October three members received jail terms of 4 to
 6 months for disturbing the peace.
 Foreign missionaries of many denominations are permitted to
 work in Kenya, though on occasion the President and other
 officials have publicly questioned the motives of certain
 missionaries and accused them of interfering in politics. One
 American missionary was told to leave in 1990 after giving a
 sermon criticizing the Government.
 Many churches in Kenya have become increasingly vocal in
 demanding political reform. The Catholic bishops in an open
 letter to the Government in June expressed concern over the
 increasing identification of the party with the Government and
 party abuse of power. They called for a national dialog on
 the issues. The Church of the Province of Kenya (CPK) also
 called for political reform, including the dissolution of
 Parliament, restoration of an independent judiciary, and a
 limit to presidential tenure. Church leaders have been
 publicly accused of subversion and sedition by government
 officials for their outspoken views, although none has been
 arrested or detained, with the exception of Reverend Imunde
 (see Section i.e.). KANU party youth group members harassed
 CPK Bishop Okullu in retaliation for his sermons calling for
 political reform. One high ranking government official, who
 also holds a powerful position in the party, said the party
 youth were simply carrying out their duties. President Moi
 warned on October I0 that the clergy did not understand the
 distinction between canon law, which applies to the spiritual,
 and state law which applies to all. "If they preach hatred,
 they will be prosecuted."
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Kenyans can travel freely within the country, although travel
 in the northeastern areas remains dangerous due to highway
 banditry, and persons traveling by road there are advised to
 travel in convoys headed by Kenyan police.
 Kenya does not generally prohibit emigration of its citizens
 but on occasion does prevent travel abroad, usually by critics
 of the Government. The Government does not regard the
 issuance of passports to its citizens as a right and reserves
 :the authority to issue or deny passports at its discretion or
 to request their return. In 1990 attorney Gibson Kamau Kuria
 was still unable to obtain his passport. In 1989 the
 Government confiscated (and still holds) attorney Paul Muite's
 passport when he returned from the U.S. where he had traveled
 to accept an award for Gibson Kuria. There was no known
 instance of citizenship being revoked for political reasons.

 KENYA
 In 1990 Kenya continued to deny permanent resettlement to most
 of the over 12,000 registered refugees in the country--a trend
 which began in the last quarter of 1988.
 The Government conducted a major roundup of illegal aliens,
 particularly Ugandans, in October, in which refugees with
 valid documents were affected. Refugees with valid refugee
 documents, including from the United Nations High Commissioner
 for Refugees (UNHCR), were swept up along with the rest, and,
 according to press accounts, these documents were taken away
 from them. The Nairobi Police Commissioner announced on
 October 23 that over 1,000 persons had been arrested, mainly
 Ugandans, on the grounr of illegal residence ir Kenya.
 Many were brought before the courts- but many did not receive
 any form of judicial or administrative review. If illegal
 residence was admitted, the person was immediately deported.
 The roundups had stopped by year's end. However, the
 Government had begun refusing to renew monthly residence
 permits of mandated refugees and had given them 7 days t.
 leave the country. Since the Government had been denying most
 of the asylum seekers' claims, as noted above, the pool of
 mandate refugees had grown to some 7,000 to 8,000 by year's
 end.
 In late 1989, a government campaign to screen ethnic Somalis
 to identify those illegally residing in Kenya prompted a
 number of Somalis to flee into neighboring countries to avoid
 deportation. The Government reportedly began the campaign
 because of its belief that illegal Somalis were. involved in
 animal poaching and banditry. While the screening practice
 ended irt March 1990, over 200 ethnic Somalis who claimed to
 hold Kenyan citizenship were still outside the country by
 year's end. In late 1990 there were also unconfirmed reports
 of Kenyan authorities blocking the passage of Somali refugees
 into northeastern Kenya, where they were seeking safety from
 civil conflict in Somalia. There were two known similar
 incidents in 1989 (see Section 5).
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Citizens cannot change the system of government in Kenya or
 replace the party in power through the electoral process. The
 Constitution prohibits formation of any political party other
 than KANU, and President Moi and a small group of advisers
 control all major policy decisions within the Government and
 the party. Since 1964, when Kenya adopted a presidential
 system, the party's candidate for President has been
 unopposed. President Moi was reelected in 1988 to a third
 5-year term. Numerous candidates compete irt party and
 parliamentary elections--also held every 5 years--but all
 candidates must be KANU members.
 In response to increasing pressure for political pluralism and
 complaints about unfair practices and corruption in the
 electoral system, the party established a Review Committee in
 June to examine the election rules. Its mandate was to
 reexamine the nomination and election procedures and KANU's
 disciplinary rules, with its focus on the 70 percent rule, the
 queuing system, and the issue of expulsion of members as a
 disciplinary measure. The Committee, chaired by the Vice
 President, held nationwide hearings during which a broad cross
 section of Kenyans expressed their views on political matters,
 
 
 178
 KENYA
 including aspects of Kenya's politics outside the scope of the
 Committee's terms of reference.
 In December the KANU special Delegates' Conference agreed to
 adopt the recommendations of the KANU Review Committee,
 including those to abolish queue-voting, the 70-percent rule,
 and expulsion of party members. The abolition of queue-voting
 means that the KANU constitution's nomination rules will be
 changed so that nomination-stage elections by the party for
 civic and parliamentary candidates are by secret ballot. The
 Committee also recommended, and the delegates accepted, the
 abolishing of expulsions from the party as a disciplinary
 measure, and suggested instead suspension for a specific
 period as the most severe punishment for errant members.
 The KANU revisions do away with a 1988 law that instituted the
 controversial queuing system for selecting KANU nominees in
 lieu of secret balloting. It required that voters line up
 behind a photo of the candidate they support, with obvious
 potential for election fraud and voter intimidation. The 70
 percent rule allowed candidates who received 70 percent of the
 vote in the queuing stage to be automatically elected without
 having to contest the second-stage secret ballot election.
 Opponents of the rule charged that this is a quick road to
 Parliament and prone to abuse, since voter turnout in the
 nomination stage is in many cases less than 10 percent of
 registered voters.
 In December President Moi told the KANU special Delegates'
 Conference that any qualified Kenyan should be cleared by the
 party to stand for nomination. Unlike in the past, where
 those denied party clearance appealed to the President, Moi
 proposed that the KANU constitution be amended to enable the
 aggrieved party to appeal to a court of law. The party
 implemented the change December 18, although it remains to be
 seen whether lack of headquarters clearance will be used to
 deny candidates a place on the ballot.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no local organizations solely devoted to
 investigating human rights abuses, but the Law Society of
 Kenya, some church groups, and individual attorneys function
 as de facto human rights groups. However, they face serious
 obstacles, including harsh government criticism, restrictions
 on free speech and assembly, and, in the case of some
 attorneys, police mistreatment. The Government reacts
 negatively to criticism of its human rights record, at home
 and abroad, and discourages Kenyans from providing outside
 human rights groups with information. President Moi publicly
 attacked expressions of concern from outside groups on the
 human rights situation, particularly comments on detainees, as
 interference in Kenya's internal affairs.
 The visit in September of the Committee to Protect Journalists
 was the only visit to Kenya by a major human rights group in
 1990. However, the Lawyers Committee on Human Rights and the
 American and New York City Bar Associations sent observers to
 the November trial of attorney Pheroze Nowrojee charged with
 contempt of court for publishing a letter concerning the case
 of a driver implicated in the death of Bishop Muge, an
 outspoken Government critic, who died in an car crash last
 August.
 
 
 KENYA
 In October President Moi denied Norway's offer to provide a
 foreign attorney to represent former parliamentarian Koigi Wa
 Wamwere, arrested on treason charges.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Kenya is a diverse country that does not-mandate legal
 discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, language,
 or social status. However, Kenyans of Somali ethnic origin
 have beenrsingled out. They are the only ethnic group in
 Kenya for which the Government requires an additional form of
 identification stating that they are Kenyan citizens. At
 least 200 Somalis with disputed citizenslhip claims were
 deported after the Government instituted-a-requirement in
 November 1989 that all ethnic Somalis carry an additfonal
 identity card. Ethnic Somalis must-have their claim to Kenyan
 citizenship verified through a "screening" process involving
 verification by a panel of Somali elders. This screening
 effort continued through the first 3 months of 1990 and then
 was phased out, although its practical effects remained. The
 screening has been widely criticized as discriminatory,
 unconstitutional, and.without a basis in law. Ethnic Somalis
 must still produce upon'demand their Kenyan identification
 card and a second identification verifying origin. Both cards
 are also required in order to apply for a passport, and
 airlines are further required to submit passports held by
 Kenyan Somalis for verification before issuing tickets to such
 persons. In December the National Assembly amended the
 "Registration-of Persons Act" to provide a legal basis to the
 Somali registration requirement.
 Members of all ethnic groups may run for office, and ethnic
 representation at the minister and assistant minister level is
 broad. The Asian community, numbering about 65,000, accounts
 for a disproportionate share of the nation's economic wealth-
 and output. Very few Asians participate in electoral politics.
 There is no legal discrimination against women, but
 traditional culture and attitudes have long prescribed.
 subordinate roles for women. Women may own property and
 businesses. Women's roles are particularly restricted in
 rural areas where they account for 75 percent of the total
 agricultural work force. Rural families are more reluctant to
 invest in educating girls than in educating boys, especially
 at the higher levels. The number of girls and boys in school
 are roughly equal at the primary and secondary levels, but men
 outnumber women almost two to one in higher education. Women
 may own property and businesses and are increasingly active in
 the modern economy. However, the ntuber of women in
 professional roles is still limited. The number of female
 unemployed is double that of men. Women sometimes receive
 lower rates of pay than men performing the same job, and
 disparities in fringe benefits occur, e.g, some businesses
 give housing allowances to men but not to married women.
 Polygamy is not legal for people married under the Christian
 Marriage Act,_ but it is permitted-for those who marry under
 African customary law. Kenya's law of succession, which
 governs inheritance rights, provides for equal treatment of
 male and female children (in contrast to much customary law
 which favors the eldest male children).
 The Government strongly condemns extreme violence against
 women, specifically murder, female circumcision, rape, and
 
 
 180
 KENYA
 incest. In many cases, rapists, particularly of minors, are
 given sentences of up to 14 years in prison. Domestic
 violence, particularly wife beating, is a problem, but there
 is very little information available on the extent of the
 problem. The Government is not as vocal on the subject and
 the media rarely report wife beating (although there have been
 media reports of husbands charged with murdering their
 wives). In practice, most cases of domestic violence are
 settled outside of the courts. The maximum legal penalty is 5
 years in prison. Women can also sue for civil damages.
 Women's groups have taken up the issue of domestic violence.
 The Kenya chapter of the International Federation of Women's
 Lawyers has published a free brochure in English and Swahili
 on women'.s legal rights, explaining that women may bring
 criminal charges against a spouse who beats them.
 Female circumcision is illegal but still practiced by some
 Kenyan ethnic groups. The Government officially discourages
 the practice and in August charged four women with murder in
 the death of a girl they circumcised. There were also press
 reports that community-forced circumcision of married women is
 increasing.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Civil servants have been barred from forming or joining unions
 since President Moi deregistered the Kenya Civil Servants
 Union about 10 years ago. All civil servants are required to
 be members of KANU. Other workers are free to join unions of
 their own choosing.
 There are 29 unions in Kenya representing approximately
 385,000 workers, or 3 percent of the country's workforce and
 slightly more than 20 percent of workers in the modern wage
 sector. Except for the 160,000 member Kenya National Union of
 Teachers (KNUT), all unions must be affiliated with one
 central body--the Central Organization of Trade Unions
 (COTU). COTU-is nominally independent of the Government and
 KANU; however, that independence is circumscribed by the fact
 that the President, as a result of the powers vested in him by
 the 1965 decree establishing COTU, can remove from office the
 central body's senior leaders. Nevertheless, a KANU special
 delegates conference in December rejected a proposal to
 formalize the alliance between KANU and COTU.
 The law provides that only seven workers are required to
 establish a union. In order to deregister a union
 involuntarily, the Registrar of Trade Unions must give the
 union 60 days in which the union can challenge the
 deregistration notice; an appeal of the Registrar's final
 decision can be brought before the High Court.
 The Trade Disputes Act permits workers to strike provided that
 21 days have elapsed following the submission to the Minister
 of Labor of a written report detailing the nature of the
 dispute. The Minister, following discussions with
 representatives of the workers and employers, can either
 attempt to mediate the dispute himself, nominate an individual
 to investigate the dispute and propose a solution, or refer
 the matter to the Industrial Court, a body consisting of five
 judges who are appointed by the President and whose decisions
 are final.
 
 
 181
 KENYA
 The military, police, prison guards and members of the
 National Youth Service are precluded by law from striking.
 Other civil servants, like their private sector counterparts,
 can strike following the 21 day notice period (28 days if it
 is an essential service--e.g., water services, health
 services, educational services, air traffic control services,
 etc.); however, the Labor Minister can refer the dispute to
 the Industrial Court for a binding determination. While
 Kenya's civil servants have been precluded for some 10 years
 from establishing or joining unions, the Trade Disputes Act,
 last revised in 1980, still gives civil servants the
 theoretical right to strike.
 In October President Moi intimidated the leadership of the
 KNUT into calling off a threatened strike prompted by the
 Government's failure to implement a new scheme of benefits
 accorded tQ certain categories of teachers. Since wQrkers are
 not permitted by law to strike over disputes referred by-the
 Labor Minister to the Industrial Court, there are few-
 nonwildcat strikes. However, workers are entitled to strike
 if an employer fails re abide by the decision of the Court.
 In 1189 there were 121 strikes, mostly of a-wildcat nature-.
 These- work actions involved 21,279- workers and resulted in the
 loss of 45,993 man-days.
 Kenya has ratified International Labor Organization (ILOY
 Convention 98 on the right to organize and-collective
 bargaining, but not ILO Convention 87 on freedom of
 association- Internationally, COTU is affiliated only with
 the continent-wide organization of-African Trade Unity. Its
 constituent unions, however, are free to establish linkages
 with international trade secretariats of their choosing-
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 While not having the force of law, the 1962 Industrial
 Relations Charter, executed by the Government, CQTU, and the
 Federation of Kenya Employers; gives workers the right to
 engage in legitimate trade union organizational activities.
 Section 54 of the Trade Disputes Act makes it illegal for
 employers to intimidate workers.
 Both the Trade Disputes Act and the Charter authorize
 collective bargaining between unions and employers. Wages are
 established in the context of negotiations between unions and
 management. The Minister of Labor, however, pursuant to the
 authority vested in him by the Regulation of Wages -and
 Conditions of Employment Act, has decreed that wage- increases
 cannot exceed 75 percent of the annual rate of inflation.
 Collective bargaining agreements must be registered with the
 Industrial Court for the purpose of guaranteeing adherence to
 any wage guidelines promulgated by the Labor Minister. In
 1989 there were 384 agreements registered with the Court.
 Some 232,000 workers were covered by these accords.
 On November 23, Parliament passed the Export Processing Zones
 Act. The legislation, which envisions the creation of at
 least three such zones, is silent on the issue of worker
 rights. Following discussions with Labor Ministry officials,
 and leaders of the COTU and the Federation of Kenya Employers,
 it is unclear what rights, if any, will be accorded to workers
 employed in the zones.
 
 
 182
 KENYA
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 The Constitution prohibits forced labor and there were no
 known allegations concerning forced labor in 1990. Under the
 Chiefs' Authority Act a local authority can require people to
 perform community services in the context of an emergency, but
 there were no known instances of this practice in 1990.
 People so employed must be paid the prevailing wage for such
 employment. The ILO's Committee of Experts has found these
 and other provisions of Kenyan law not in conformance with ILO
 Conventions 29 and 105 concerning forced labor, both of which
 Kenya has ratified.
 d. Minimum Age for the Employment of Children
 The Employment Act of 1976 proscribes the employment in any
 industrial undertaking of children under the age of 16. This
 Act applies neither to the agricultural sector, where the
 overwhelming majority of the labor force is employed, nor to
 children serving as apprentices under the terms of the
 Industrial Training Act. Ministry of Labor officers are
 authorized to.enforce the Minimum Age Statute. Enforcement is
 limited, but violations are not widespread.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The legal minimum wage for workers in the wage sector varies
 by location, age, and skills. On May 25, 1990, the minimum
 wage was raised on average some 11 percent. In the rural
 areas of the country, the amount paid is $23 per month; the
 highest minimum wage is for drivers and cashiers in Nairobi
 and in Mombasa, i.e. $90 per month. Given the double digit
 inflation and currency depreciation, most workers are, at
 best, only able to eke out a marginal existence. The
 Regulation of Wages and Conditions of Employment Act limits
 the normal workweek to 52 hours. Night-time employees,
 however, can be employed for 60 hours a week. As is the case
 with respect to minimum age limitations, the Act specifically
 excludes agricultural workers from its purview. An employee
 in the nonagricultural sector is entitled to 1 rest day in a
 week. There are also provisions for annual leave and sick
 leave. With respect to limits on overtime, the law provides
 that the total hours worked (i.e. regular time plus overtime)
 in any 2 week period for night workers cannot exceed 144
 hours; for other workers the limit is 120 hours. The Ministry
 of Labor is tasked with enforcing these regulations, but
 according to ministry officials reported violations are few.
 The Factories Act of 1951 sets forth detailed health and
 safety standards in the nonagricultural sector; the Act was
 amended in 1990 to expand its coverage to the "non-industrial
 sector" which presumably includes agriculture. Health and
 safety inspectors have the authority to inspect factories and
 work sites if they have reason to believe that a violation of
 the Act has occurred or upon a complaint of a worker. In
 practice, inspectors, who are relatively few in number,
 respond only to worker complaints. If the alleged violation
 appears to have a basis in fact, the inspector can bring the
 complaint before a magistrate. The latter has the authority
 to order the factory or plant in question to rectify the
 dangerous practice or condition. If the violation is
 egregious, the magistrate can close the work site completely.
 Workers who file complaints are not protected by the Factories
 Act.
