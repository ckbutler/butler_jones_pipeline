 KENYA
 -Kenya's political system and atmosphere are among the
 more open and lively in Africa. The Kenyan Government
 takes pride in the fact that the fundamental rights
 and liberties of its citizens are enumerated in the
 constitution, and in the existence of an independent
 judiciary to protect those freedoms. Nevertheless,
 the government also has and sometimes uses detention
 provisions and other restrictive powers, which it
 strongly defends as necessary in order to maintain
 law, order and public security. These powers have
 sometimes been used to silence critics of the senior
 leadership.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There is no indication that torture is practiced in
 Kenya.
 b; Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There are effective legal safeguards against cruel,
 inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, although
 prison conditions are very poor.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Political detention is permitted under the Public
 Security Act. Detainees must be informed of the rea-
 sons for their detention within five days of arrest,
 and they have the right to review of their cases
 every six months by a special tribunal. The tribunal
 is, however, appointed by the President, meets in
 camera, and its decisions are non-binding. The
 incidence of politically motivated arrests under
 these provisions since independence has been low.
 Recent cases, however, include two prominent dissident
 members of Parliament arrested in the aftermath of
 the March 1975 murder of a leading parliamentary
 critic of the regime, the arrest in May 1977 of a
 vocal parliamentary backbencher who had alleged
 corruption on the part of high government officials,
 
 
 57
 and the arrest at the end of 1977 of a prominent
 novelist whose works strongly criticized the Kenyan
 elite. The total number of persons thought to be
 detained at present under presidential order is
 estimated at less than ten.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 In detention cases under the Public Security Act, the
 authority of the regular courts is limited to ensur-
 ing compliance with certain procedural rights; the
 courts cannot question the need for the detention.
 This exception aside, the right to a fair public
 trail is respected in Kenya.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The generally high standard of impartiality of the
 Kenyan courts has been paralleled by respect for due
 process on the part of Kenyan authorities. As a
 consequence, the sanctity of the home and other key
 concepts of English Common Law are respected in
 Kenya.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 Kenya's economic development policies, emphasizing
 free enterprise and the profit motive, have produced
 a record of economic growth that is unusually good
 for Africa. The government has developed a number of
 policies responding directly to the fundamental needs
 of the poorer segments of the population. These
 programs include both regulatory measures such as
 controls on the price of basic foodstuffs and develop-
 ment programs aimed at employment generation in the
 urban areas and improvement of conditions for small-
 holders in the rural areas. Health care and education
 are also priority areas for government development
 spending. These policies notwithstanding, however,
 major gaps exist between the haves and the have nots
 in Kenya.
 High-level corruption is a problem in Kenya. It is
 not clear, however, to what extent corruption has
 
 22-145 0 - 78 - 5
 
 
 actually diverted resources away from uses which
 would raise the overall standard of living and benefit
 the poor majority.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 and Assembly
 Freedom of expression and communication in Kenya can
 be restricted under various sections of the penal
 code. The existence and occasional use of the deten-
 tion laws exerts an inhibiting influence on public
 exchange of views on sensitive political topics. The
 government openly discourages student political
 activism, which in 1975 resulted in the temporary
 closure of the University of Nairobi. Although there
 is no formal censorship of news copy, government
 guidelines are issued on politically sensitive issues
 and are usually observed by the media. There is also
 a degree of self-censorship. However, Kenya's press
 is active and assertive in reporting and commenting
 on internal developments.
 Freedoms of assembly and association are limited by
 the Public Order and Police Act which gives local
 administrative authorities and police wide powers to
 control public meetings. It is an offense not only
 to convene an unlicensed meeting, but also to attend
 one. With these powers, the government can prevent
 meetings by political opponents; the Act has been
 used in a few cases. Similarly, under the Societies
 Act the government can refuse to register any society
 that it believes may pursue activities harmful to
 public security. One opposition political party
 remains proscribed under this Act, and the government
 used the same powers to ban the Jehovah's Witnesses
 in 1973; in the latter case, however, the government
 later revoked the ban when threatened with a court
 test of its constitutionality.
 Kenya's trade union movement is active and vociferous.
 There is full freedom of religion in Kenya.

 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel and Emigration
 Under the presidential detention power, individuals
 may be restricted in their movements within the
 country. Foreign travel and emigration are not
 restricted.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Kenya has a one-party system, and the government has
 substantial powers to restrict political activity, as
 set forth in 3a above. At the same time, political
 activity within this framework is open to virtually
 all Kenyans and is vigorous. Parliamentary elections
 in 1969 and 1974 featured many lively contests between
 multiple candidates and resulted in the defeat of a
 number of incumbents.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-Governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Kenyan Government has in the past barred entry
 into Kenya by certain journalists who have been
 critical of President Kenyatta and his family.
 However, we know of no instances of requests for
 information from the major human rights organizations
 that have been refused by the Kenyan Government.
 Requests for entry by outside groups to investigate
 human rights conditions would presumably be subject
 to close scrutiny, particularly requests for entry
 for the express purpose of investigating the deten-
 tion system and other aspects of the government's
 security powers.
