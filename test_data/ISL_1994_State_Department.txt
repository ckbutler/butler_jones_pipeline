 ICELAND
 Iceland is a constitutional republic and a multiparty parliamentary democracy. Its
 people participate in high percentages in regular, free, and fair elections which de-
 termine the distribution of power among political parties and leaders.
 Elected officials control the police force which scrupulously observes and enforces
 the laws that ensure protection of human rights.
 Iceland has a mixed, open economy, in which all of its citizens have the right to
 hold private property.
 There were no reports of human rights abuses during the year. The Parliament
 enacted into Icelandic law the European Charter of Human Rights.
 RESPET FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Rilling.-There were no reports of political or
 extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no known abductions or disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment are pro-
 hibited by law and do not occur. Prison conditions are good, but most prisons are
 full, and many are antiquated. The Government has begun implementing a con-
 struction program to alleviate these difficulties.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Due process is provided by law and ob-
 served in practice. The Constitution states that arrested persons must be brought
 before a judge without undue delay. The judge must rule within 24 hours whether
 the person is to be detained. Although the Constitution allows for bail, it is usually
 not imposed as a condition for release. A judge's ruling may be appealed imme-
 diately to a higher court.
 There is no specific limit on the maximum length of pretrial (investigative) deten-
 tion, but it usually ranges from a few days to a few weeks. Pretrial detentions were
 generally served in isolation prior to July 1992. A law that took effect then requires
 judges to rule specifically on whether a particular detainee should be held in isola-
 tion, and an affirmative decision must be justified on the grounds that it will help
 prevent tampering with a continuing investigation. All pretrial detention sentences
 may be appealed to the Supreme Court, which must return a ruling "as soon as pos-
 sible"; in practice, this generally is done in a few days. Preventive detention is not
 practiced.
 There were no allegations of arbitrary detention.
 There is no exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Defendants are presumed innocent. They are
 guaranteed the right of access to legal counsel of their own choosing, in time to pre-
 pare their defense. For defendants unable to pay attorney's fees, the State assumes
 the cost. Defendants have the right to be present at their trial, to confront wit-
 nesses, and to participate otherwise in the proceedings. No groups are barred from
 testifying, and all testimony is treated alike. Trials are public and are conducted
 fairly, with no official intimidation. Defendants have the right to appeal.
 The Ministry of Justice administers the lower court system, while the Supreme
 Court guards its independence and fairness. Juries are not used, but multijudge
 panels are common, especially in the appeals process. All judges, at all levels, serve
 for life.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Under
 the Constitution and in practice, there is deep respect for the autonomy and rights
 of individuals. A warrant from a court is required to enter a private house, except
 in cases of hot pursuit. There have been no known arbitrary intrusions by official
 entities, political organizations, or any other organized group into the private beliefs
 or personal liberties of individuals.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution forbids censorship and other
 restrictions on the freedom of the press or freedom of individual expression, and the
 Government fully respects these. Iceland has both state-owned and private tele-
 vision and radio, and both broadcast a wide spectrum of views. All newspapers are
 privately owned.
 Academic freedom of expression is vigorously exercised.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right to unarmed assembly except when the police have cause to believe a gath-
 
 
 846
 ering may cause rioting. The authorities virtually never reject or modify plans for
 public meetings. In law and practice, citizens have the right to join together for-
 mally or informally in associations, without governmental authorization.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Practitioners of all faiths worship freely, without govern-
 ment restriction.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Icelanders are free to travel at home and abroad, to emigrate, and to
 return at will. Iceland abides by provisions of the 1951 Geneva Convention Relating
 to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. The Government usually requires
 "spontaneous" asylum seekers to return to the country of first asylum pendig a
 Justice Ministry ruling on their application. It never compels refugees to return to
 a country in which they presumably would face persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Iceland is an open, fully functioning, parliamentary democracy in which voters
 freely choose the members of the Althing (Parliament) who, in turn, determine the
 composition of the Cabinet. Parliamentary elections are held every 4 years, or soon-
 er if the Althing dissolves itself or there is a no-confidence vote. Voting in elections
 and membership in political parties are open to all citizens 18 years of age or older.
 There are no legal or practical impediments to women's participation in govern-
 ment and politics. Two of the four top governmental positions-the President and
 the Speaker of the Althing-are occupied by women (both positions are largely cere-
 monial, however). There is an active and influential feminist political party, the
 Women's List, which won five seats in Parliament in 1991, with 8.3 percent of the
 vote. Nearly one-fourth of the members of Parliament are women.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Human rights associations operate with no government interference.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The culture of Iceland's ethnically homogeneous population is strongly egalitarian
 and opposed to discrimination based on any of these factors. Government legislation
 and practice generally reflect this attitude, but credible reports indicate that both
 the police and the court system are hostile or indifferent to rape victims (see below).
 Women.-There are no indications of a pattern of violence agist women, but re-
 iable data are lacking. Such violence reeived increasing pubi attention in 1994
 due largely to the efforts of the Women's List political movement, which continued
 to raise it in political debate. A public shelter offers protection to approximately 370
 women and 180 children per year, these 1994 figures are virtually the same as in
 1993, indicating a leveling off of an initial surge in demand for services of the shel-
 ter. There is also a rape trauma center sponsored and operated by women's organi-
 zations; some 400 women and children annually seek assistance there. Both facili-
 ties are funded by national and municipal governments and private contributions.
 The Reykjavik City Hospital emergency ward now has an all-female staff to care
 for rape victims.
 Studies indicate that only a small percentage of cases involving domestic violence
 to women or sexual abuse (rape, attempted rape, or harassment) are reported to the
 police. Women's organizations assert that both the state investigative police and the
 court system are hostile or indifferent to victims of domestic violence or sexual
 abuse; that female victims who lodge charges of such offenses are often subjected
 to humiliating police interrogation; and that judges are unduly lenient with sex of-
 fenders, e.g., the typical prison term for a convicted rapist is 1 or 2 years. Police
 spokesmen have indeed asserted publicly that investigation of domestic violence is
 a waste of time for the police, who should concentrate their efforts on "more serious"
 crime. On the other hand, the police have launched a program to train officers in
 correct interrogation procedures; and data published in December 1993 showed that
 over the period 1988-93, the number of prisoners serving sentences for sexual of-
 fenses rose from 12 to 28, while the average sentence for rape rose from 14 to 20
 months.
 Major economic and political institutions in Iceland remain male-dominated. Ice-
 land's legislation requiring equal pay for equal work is evidently not being ade-
 quately implemented. Studies have consistently revealed an average difference of 40
 percent in the earnings of men and women in comparable jobs; when allowance is
 made for the longer average working hours (and overtime) among men, there re-
 mains a 20-percent gap.

 Since 1991, complaints regarding the equal rights law have been referred to a spe-
 cial committee under the Equal Rights Affairs Office of the Ministry of Social Af-
 fairs. The committee has only advisory pwers, and its recommendations to any em-
 ployer do not have the force of law. n  a few complaints have been made to the
 committee. Women's groups speculate that many women are reluctant to come for-
 ward with complaints in Iceland's small, intimate communities and traditionally
 stoic culture. Also, Iceland's largely male-led labor unions have not actively sup-
 ported individual women who wish to exercise their right to take action on such
 matters.
 Children.-High respect for children's rights is evident in the law and in govern-
 ment policy. In 1994 the Government created the Office of the Children's Ombuds-
 man in the Prime Ministry, with a mandate to protect children's rights, interests,
 and welfare by, among other things, exerting influence on legislation, government
 decisions, and public attitudes. Some international custody cases involving Iceland-
 ers have been complicated by the fact that, although Iceland is a signatory to the
 Hague Convention on Child Abduction, it has not brought this into force. The For-
 eign Minister opined that Iceland's practices in this area lay it open to criticism for
 possible violations of human rights.He submitted a bill in the AIthing to bring the
 Convention into force.
 People With Disabilities.-Disabled individuals are not subject to discrimination
 in employment, education, or provision of other state services. The Government has
 legislated accessibility to public buildings for the disabled.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Workers in Iceland make extensive use of the right
 to establish organizations, draw up their own constitutions and rules, choose their
 own leaders and policies, and publicize their views. The resulting organizations are
 not controlled by the Government or any single political party. Unions take active
 part in Nordic, European, and international trade union bodies. With the exception
 of limited categories of workers in the public sector whose services are essential to
 public health or safety, unions have had and used the right to strike for many years.
 According to Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development figures, 76
 percent of all eligible workers belong to unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There are no impediments to
 union membership in law or in practice. Virtually all unions exercise their right to
 bargain collectively. The central labor and management organizations periodically
 negotiate collective baainig agreements that set nationwide standards and spe-
 cific terms for workers pay, workhours, and other conditions. The Government often
 plays a role in the negotiations, and sometimes undertakes commitments in order
 to bring the two sides together. Labor courts effectively adjudicate disputes over
 contracts and over the rights provided for in the 1938 Act on Trade Unions and In-
 dustrial Disputes, which prohibits antiunion discrimination.
 By law, employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to rein-
 state workers fired for union activities. In practice, the charges are difficult to
 prove. In a recent case the union was unable to prove in court its suspicion that
 an employee had been fired for union activities, rather than as part of a series of
 recession-related layoffs.
 In June 1993 the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the Icelandic Gov-
 ernment had violated the 11th article of the European Human Rights Charter, con-
 cerning the right of free association, by obliging taxi drivers to be members of a
 union. The Althing is to consider legislation to comply with this judgment.
 There are no export processing or other special economic zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited by law, and does not occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children-The law requires children to at-
 tend school until the age of 16, and prohibits employment of children under that
 age in factories, on ships, or in other places that are hazardous or require hard
 labor. This prohibition is observed in practice. Children aged 14 or 15 may be em-
 ployed part-time or during school vacations in light, nonhazardous work; their
 workhours must not exceed the ordinary workhours of adults in the same occupa-
 tion. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration enforces child labor regu-
 lations.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work-Although there is no minimum wage law,
 union membership is so extensive and effective as to ensure that labor contracts af-
 ford even the lowest-paid workers a sufficient income for a decent standard of living
 for themselves and their families.
 Workers are protected by laws that effectively ensure their health and safety as
 well as provide for unemployment insurance, paid vacations, pensions, and reason-
 
 
 848
 able working conditions and hours. The standard legal workweek is 40 hours.
 Worktime exceeding 8 hours in a workday must be compensated as overtime. Work-
 ers are entitled to 10 hours of rest within each 24-hour period, and to a day off
 every week. Under defined special circumstances the 10-hour rest can be reduced
 to 8, and the day off can be postponed by a week, in which case the worker has
 a right to 2 additional hours off in the following week.
 Health and safety standards are set by the Aithing and administered and en-
 forced by the Ministry of Social Affairs through its Occupational Safety and Health
 Administration.
