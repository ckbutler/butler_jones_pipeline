 CAMBODIA
 In 1993 Cambodia experienced a democratic and human rights revolution. Despite
 killings, threats, and intimidation by the Khmer Rouge, 90 percent of voters partici-
 pated in the free and fair elections in May-the first in decades-thus providing the
 opportunity for long-term democratic evolution. Political violence and intimidation
 by forces of the Phnom Penh regime marred the election campaign. However, in the
 latter half of 1993, the situation dramatically improved and there were no substan-
 tiated cases of political killings. The Khmer Rouge (KR) (also known as the Party
 of Democratic Kampuchea-PDK) insurgency continues to pose an armed threat to
 the new Government. Moreover, Cambodia lacks the institutions and adequate num-
 bers of trained personnel needed for a mature democracy.
 From April 1975 until January 1979 the PDK ruled Cambodia and compiled one
 of the worst records of human rights abuse in this century. Between one-seventh
 and one-eighth of the population died of exhaustion, disease, abuse, and execution.
 In 1979 the PDK were ejected from power by the invading Vietnamese army.
 Hanoi installed an authoritarian regime, made up largely of former PDK cadre,
 called the People's Republic of Kampuchea and later renamed the State of Cam-
 bodia--SOC. Vietnamese arms maintained the SOC in power against remnants of
 the PDK and the non-Communist resistance under Prince Sihanouk. In September
 1989, after 11 years of military occupation and stalemate, the Vietnamese withdrew
 the bulk of their forces.
 Under the October 1991 Paris Accords, the United Nations created the U.N. Tran-
 sitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) and dispatched a 22,000-strong civilian
 and military peacekeeping force to conduct free and fair elections for a constituent
 assembly. During this interim period, a Cambodian Supreme National Council
 (SNC) embodied Cambodian sovereignty. Over 4 million Cambodians voted in the
 May 1993 elections, although the PDK barred some people in the 10 to 15 percent
 of the country (holding 6 percent of the population) it controls from participating.
 Prince Ranaiddh's FUNCINPEC Party, the SOC's Cambodian People's Party (CPP),
 and Son Sann's Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party (BLDP) were the top vote recipi-
 ents, respectively. The parties represented in the 120-member Assembly formeda
 Provisional National Government of Cambodia (PNGC) on July 1. The Assembly
 roceeded to draft and approve a new Constitution which was promulgated Septem-
 er 24. It establishes a multiparty liberal democracy in the framework of a constitu-
 tional monarchy. FUNCINPEC and the CPP share power in the new Royal Cam-
 bodian Government. The Constitution provides for a wide range of internationally
 recognized human rights.
 In 1989 the State of Cambodia (SOC) began to institute reforms to change the
 small, predominantly agricultural economy from a centrally planned to a market-
 oriented system. Legislation in 1989 restored the right to own and inherit property,
 and agricultural production is now mostly private and family based. These reforms,
 together with growing foreign investment and international aid, spurred a surge of
 economic activity, especially in Phnom Penh. Nevertheless, Cambodia remains one
 of the world's poorest countries. Per capita gross domestic product is less than $200.
 In 1993 Cambodia made great strides in human rights. The fledgling independent
 media grew to include opposition radio and television stations as well as numerous
 Khmer and foreign-language publications. The membership of indigenous human
 rights groups swelled, and international organizations such as Amnesty Inter-
 national and Asia Watch were able to visit Cambodia. The remainder of the 370,000
 Cambodian refugees who had been living mostly in camps along the Thai-Cam-
 bodian border were voluntarily repatriated under the direction of the United Na-
 tions High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). In the latter half of 1993, for the
 first time in decades, there were no political prisoners being held in Cambodia, ex-
 cept possibly persons detained in Khmer Rouge areas. In 1991 and 1992 SOC au-
 thorities had released nearly 2,000 political prisoners. Without SOC agreement, im-
 plementation, and relinquishing of significant power in this and other areas, Cam-
 bodia's human rights progress in 1993, particularly the enormous increase in politi-
 cal openness, an ability to compete would not have occurred.
 Nevertheless, during the election campaign, SOC security forces engaged in exten-
 sive intimidation and political violence, mostly against the FUNCINPEC and BLDP
 parties. Between November 1992 and the May elections, UNTAC documented the
 politically motivated killings of 74 opposition party members. One hundred twenty-
 six opposition party members were injured during the same period due to political
 violence. Many of these acts were attributed to SOC police or soldiers. In some
 cases, the SOC authorities frustrated UNTAC's investigations of these incidents.
 
 
 598
 The SOC did not take effective action against any of the perpetrators of this vio-
 lence.
 The PDK prohibited the U.N. and international human rights monitors from en-
 tering its zones. Based on reports from PDK defectors, it is clear that the 6 percent
 of Cambodians living under PDK rule enjoy few basic human rights. Moreover, the
 PDK carried out a violent campaign to destabilize the SOC administration and to
 discourage Cambodians from voting. PDK violence included the detention of 43 U.N.
 personnel. Eighteen U.N. personnel died during the mission from hostile action.
 UNTAC attributed 11 of the killings to the PDK.
 Racial violence against ethnic Vietnamese remained an egregious human rights
 problem. Antipathy toward ethnic Vietnamese is common in Cambodian society and
 igured in the rhetoric of several political parties. In 1993 PDK armed forces carried
 out brutal massacres of ethnic Vietnamese civilians which claimed the lives of 70
 people. In addition, government armed forces have been guilty of looting the civilian
 population during campaigns against the PDK armed forces.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Political violence swelled in the pe-
 riod leading up to the U.N.-sponsored May elections and then dropped off dramati-
 cally. Violence by SOC authorities directed against opposition political party mem-
 bers began almost immediately with the arrival of opposition parties in Phnom Penh
 in late 1991. In 1992 members of the FUNCINPECand B DP parties were the
 main targets of this violence, although the Action for Democracy and Development
 Party and the Liberal Democratic Party also complained of attacks. There was an
 upsurge of violence between November 1992 and January 1993, apparently coinci-
 dent with the evident growing popularity and activity of opposition parties in the
 provinces. During this period UNTAC confirmed the death or injury of 96
 FUNCINPEC and BLDP members in politically motivated attacks, many of which
 were attributed to the SOC.
 Political violence crested again beginning in March with the official onset of the
 political campaign. Between March and the conclusion of the elections at the end
 of May, U   A confirmed that 42 FUNCINPEC and BLDP members were killed
 and 72 'ijured in political violence. UNTAC was able to confirm the responsibility
 of SOC officials or police for 12 of the killings.
 Following the elections, there was a short burst of political violence associated
 with the abortive secession movement led by Prince Norodom Chakrapong. In Prey
 Ven and Kompong Chain provinces, crowds incited by the secession leaders looted
 UNTAC buildings and threatened some UNTAC workers. The FUNCINPEC party
 alleged that several of its members were killed in the violence, a claim that has not
 been confirmed. SOC authorities took no effective action to apprehend or punish any
 of the perpetrators of this violence.
 Throughout 1993 the PDK continued an aggressive campaign of attacks on SOC
 officials at the villa e and commune level in an effort to destabilize the SOC regime.
 The PDK policy toot on greater momentum as the PDK sought to delegitimize the
 electoral process and terrorize Cambodians to dissuade them from voting. UNTAC
 confirmed 216 such killings and 342 injuries inflicted by the PDK during UNTAC's
 mission. (These figures include ethnic Vietnamese victims.) According to one
 unconfirmed report, the PDK were responsible for killing as many as 10 PDK mili-
 tary defectors.
 PDK violence also extended to UNTAC personnel. Eighteen UNTAC employees
 were killed and 67 injured, although responsibility for these actions could not al-
 ways be determined.
 b. Disappearance.-Opposition political parties, especially FUNCINPEC and the
 BLDP, and the CPP claimed that numerous party activists and local officials dis-
 appeared during the course of the election campaign. UNTAC investigated as many
 of these allegations as possible. UNTAC concluded that, in approximately 12 months
 from mid-1992 to mid-1993, SOC elements were responsible for the abduction or
 disappearance of 17 opposition activists. UNTAC also concluded that the PDK ab-
 ducted 188 Cambodians and ethnic Vietnamese during the same period. After the
 elections, abductions dropped off.
 In one case, SOC military officers abducted four FUNCINPEC activists from their
 homes the evening of January 31-February 1 in Sangke district, Battambang prov-
 ince. Based on eyewitness testimony, the four were believed to have been tMen to
 a SOC military base by seven SOC officers. SOC officials refused to produce the
 seven and then obstructed UNTAC's attempts to locate them.
 
 
 599
 In 1993 the PDK continued its policy of destabilizing the SOC administration by
 killing and abducting members of the SOC local and provincial administrations.
 Targets frequently included village heads or local police. Attacks on SOC villages
 often involved looting as well. Abductions attributed to the PDK also included kid-
 naping of villagers for ransom and abduction of ethnic Vietnamese who were later
 killed.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Conditions in Cambodian prisons prior to the arrival of UNTAC in late 1991 were
 deplorable, including shackling, solitary confinement, poor sanitation, inadequate
 food, and limited or no health care. Prisoners regularly died from neglect. In 1992
 consistent intervention by UNTAC and the International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC) improved conditions substantially. UNTAC induced SOC authorities
 to halt the practice of shackling in mid-1992, but they began to practice it subse-
 quently as punishment.
 ith the departure of UNTAC in late 1993, conditions in Cambodian prisons dete-
 riorated. The ICRC and an indigenous human rights organization, Licadho, took
 separate actions to improve water, food, and medical treatment. However, by year's
 end, there were again numerous cases of beri-beri, tuberculosis, and other illness
 resulting in some deaths.
 Torture was not common in Cambodian prisons in 1993. However, there were nu-
 merous reports of torture in Battambang Provincial Prison, including burnings and
 beatings of prisoners, prior to the elections. UNTAC investigations confirmed the al-
 legations. UNTAC issued a warrant for the arrest of Ten Seng, the chief of prison
 guards. In September UNTAC handed Ten Seng over to Cambodian authorities and,
 in November, a Cambodian court convicted him of aggravated assault and sentenced
 him to 1 year in jail.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Prior to 1993 the criminal justice system
 in Cambodia was essentially dysfunctional. Warrants for arrest were never em-
 ployed. Police and secret security forces attached to the then Ministry of National
 Security arrested people in an arbitrary fashion. Detainees were often held incom-
 municado. The formal charging of prisoners with crimes was the exception, not the
 rule.
 In September 1992, UNTAC issued a transitional criminal law that outlined basic
 procedures for arrest and prosecution. The Supreme National Council of Cambodia
 adopted the law and a slow process of translation and elaboration ensued. Unfortu-
 nately, during 1993 the Government never implemented the law, with the exception
 of the requirement for bail. Corrupt officials often kept the bail money for their own
 profit.
 UNTAC successfully instigated judicial review of numerous cases in which pris-
 oners were held without adequate evidence or charges, resulting in the release of
 370 prisoners.
 In 1993 in the non-Communist zones, military officers regularly detained individ-
 uals accused of crimes and meted out summary punishment on the spot. In June
 FUNCINPEC authorities completed the construction of a grossly inadequate prison
 in the FUNCINPEC-controlled zone. Under UNTAC direction, the Kampuchean Peo-
 pes National Liberation Armed Forces (KPNLAF) built a prison in Throar Puok.
 The PDK is thought to maintain security locations at which prisoners are held.
 However, little is known about these facilities.
 On January 8, UNTAC issued orders to permit a UNTAC special prosecutor to
 initiate arrests in cases of gross human rights abuses. SOC authorities sometimes
 frustrated UNTAC's efforts to apprehend SOC officials accused of human rights vio-
 lations. However, UNTAC successfully arrested four persons. Of the four arrested,
 one died of natural causes. The Ministry of Justice has accepted the other three for
 prosecution.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The 1993 Constitution of the Kingdom of Cam-
 bodia provides for due process and the independence of the judiciary, and it estab-
 lishes the principle of presumed innocence. However, Cambodia lacks the trained
 professionsls to implement these principles. The structure of the future judicial sys-
 tem is to be definedby subsequent law.
 In 1993, for most o  ambis, the existing judicial system remained that outlined
 in the 1989 SOC Constitution, which provides for provincial courts with judges and
 assessors named by state officials. In practice, the judiciary was directly dependent
 on political authorities and was an instrument of the Government. This system ap-
 plied to only about 10 percent of those arrested. For most trials, police files, some-
 times including confessions coerced from prisoners, were accepted as prima facie evi-
 dence of guilt.
 
 
 600
 There was no functioning judicial system in 1993 in the areas outside Communist
 control, where martial law was the rule. No legal system is known to exist in PDK
 zones.
 The Paris Accords mandated the release of all political prisoners and prisoners
 of war. In 1991 and early 1992, SOC authorities released nearly 2,000, half under
 ICRC supervision. In 1993 there were no political prisoners held by Cambodian au-
 thorities.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home or Correspondence.-There
 were numerous cases of arbitrary forced entry into homes and offices and seizure
 of possessions including documents by SOC security officials in 1993, particularly
 in connection with the election campaign. Opposition party offices were often tar-
 gets. While security forces carried out surveillance of some persons, there was evi-
 dence that the large security apparatus developed by the SOC with Vietnamese as-
 sistance over the past decade had begun to dissolve.
 The competing political parties used various means to increase party membership
 prior to the May elections. CPP party membership swelled to over 3 million, sub-
 stantially more than the CPP vote tally at the polls. SOC civil servants, students,
 and soldiers were regularly coerced into joining the CPP and campaigning for it.
 However, after the election, this coercion ceased.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Despite the Paris Accords prohibition, cease-fire violations continued in
 1993. Villagers and townspeople were frequently victims of indiscriminate shelling
 principally by SOC and PDK forces in scattered fighting in Kompong Thom, Siem
 Reap Preah Vihear, and Banteay Meanchey provinces. Forces of the PDK and also
 the SOC continued to lay unmarked minefields, adding to an already enormous
 problem.
 The PDK carried out several attacks in 1993 intended specifically to terrorize the
 general population. On May 5, for example, PDK soldiers attacked the train travel-
 ing from Battambang to Phnom Penh. Of the 500 people on the train, 20 were killed
 and 100 were wounded. The PDK soldiers and local villagers then looted the train.
 In another raid, PDK soldiers opened fire on a house in which people were watching
 a video film in Kompong Thom province, killing 20 and injuring 35 others. However,
 with the high level of banditry in Cambodia, it was not always possible to determine
 whether actions were those of an armed party to the conflict or simply local crimi-
 nals.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Before 1992 freedom of speech and press were
 severely restricted. However, the Paris Accords provided for this freedom for all  r-
 sons in Cambodia. The SNC codified this right on January 15, 1992. The juridical
 underpinnings of this fundamental freedom were further defined in the 1993 Con-
 stitution. That document states "Cambodian citizens shall enjoy freedom of expres-
 sion, press, publication and association." However, the Constitution limits free
 speech by requiring that speech not adversely affect public security and be carried
 out in accordance with law. The National Assembly has yet to implement legislation
 to clarify this problem.
 In practice, Cambodians enjoyed unprecedented flowering of free speech in 1993.
 The print media consisted of exactly one government controlled newspaper in 1991.
 In 1993 there were over 57 different newspapers, bulletins, and magazines produced
 by the political parties, indigenous human rights organizations, and independent
 publishers, including one French language and three English language newspapers.
 The import and sale of foreign publications is unrestricted.
 Cambodia has one government-run television station, one commercial television
 station operated by a Thai concern, a FUNCINPEC television station, and a French-
 language television station operated by the French Government. Until late Septem-
 ber, UNTAC operated an extremely popular radio station which provided independ-
 ent news and served as an outlet for all 20 political parties. Cambodians also had
 access to a FUNCINPEC radio station and PDK radio, both of which had limited
 broadcast ranges inside the country.
 Self-censorship remains a concern in Cambodia. With the withdrawal of UNTAC,
 independent Cambodian media became more guarded in their criticism of the Gov-
 ernment. In October a government spokesman warned the media that criticism of
 the King is contrary to Khmer traditions. While there are no penalties now envis-
 aged, the Constitution declares that the King is "inviolable," possibly laying the
 basis for future lese majeste laws. The King has disavowed the government criti-
 cism.
 There is no freedom of speech in areas under PDK control. According to PDK de-
 fectors, in some instances people in PDK areas were prohibited from listening to
 
 
 601
 UNTAC or other radio stations. Given the bloody history of the PDK, Cambodians
 living under PDK control frequently are afraid to discuss political matters publicly.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom of peaceful assembly
 was assured by the SNC as well as by the new Constitution. During the 1993 elec-
 tion campaign, there were thousands of campaign rallies mounted by the 20 reg-
 istered political parties in all rovinces of the country, despite the threat of Khmer
 Rouge activities in the cities. Luring the election, thousands of Cambodians partici-
 pated in a peace march across the country. Nevertheless, there were signs of resist-
 ance to peaceful assembly, mostly by SOC authorities, during the course of the polit-
 ical campaign. There were numerous instances in which local SOC officials de-
 manded the right to approve rallies themselves or stopped rallies that had not ob-
 tained advance approval by UNTAC.
 Nevertheless, as a sign of changing attitudes in October 400 to 500 students
 marched in Phnom Penh to protest government education policies. This was the first
 such demonstration since students were fired upon by police during protests in De-
 cember 1991. In October the march took place peacefully, with police clearing the
 path for the students. Top government officials publicly defended their right to
 peaceful assembly and, as a result, several other peaceful demonstrations took place
 in November and December.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Buddhism is the state religion. The Constitution provides
 for freedom. religion and forbids discrimination based on religion.
 Buddhism, Christianit6, and especially Islam were nearly wiped out under PDK
 rule from 1975 to 1979. Until 1989 Buddhism made only a slow return as the clergy
 were still regarded with some suspicion by the ruling CPP. However, in 1989 a Bud-
 dhist renaissance commenced with the assistance of the CPP's front organization.
 Islam has also regained a strong foothold among the Chain population, and mosques
 are being refurbished around the country. Christianity, ruled "legal" in April 1990,
 is practiced openly. In 1993 Christian churches began to open in some outlying
 Cambodian provinces.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Travel within government-contrulled parts of Cambodia is unrestricted.
 The presence of mines and bandits makes travel in some areas perilous, however.
 The PDK severely restricted travel within its zones, refused UNTAC access to some
 PDK areas, detained UNTAC personnel who ventured in, and, on occasion, fired on
 UNTAC personnel overflying PDK zones in helicopters. There were reliable reports
 that, in some cases, movement by Cambodians in the PDK zones even to neighbor-
 ing villages required permission from village heads.
 UNTAC thoroughly liberalized the SOC's visa and passport issuing procedures.
 Although corruption continues to be a problem in obtaining travel documents, travel
 outside Cambodia is not systematically restricted. Exile is expressly forbidden by
 the Constitution.
 In 1992 over 370,000 Cambodians resided in refugee camps in Thailand. As an
 integral component of the Paris Accords, all the refugees returned to Cambodia in
 security and dignity under the auspices of the UNHCR in time to participate in the
 May 1993 elections.
 Tens of thousands of ethnic Vietnamese fled Cambodia in early 1993 due to racial
 violence. Many returned overland after the elections. However, several thousand on
 boats were stopped by authorities on the Mekong River and were forbidden entry.
 Although the vast majority of these people were born in Cambodia, the Government
 insisted it would deal with the ethnic Vietnamese as an immigration issue. At year's
 end, the problem was still unresolved.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 In 1993, for the first time in decades, Cambodians had the right and the ability
 peacefully to change their government. The electoral process conducted by UNTAC
 culminated in the establishment of the new Royal Government of Cambodia in Sep-
 tember.
 UNTAC and the Cambodians faced many obstacles. The SOC used political vio-
 lence and intimidation to cow opposition political parties and to try to frighten the
 electorate into voting for the CPP. The PDK usedproaganda obstruction, terror,
 and military attacks to try to prevent the election. PDK soldiers f,-equently con-
 fiscated or destroyed Cambodians' voter cards and threatened voters that there
 would be consequences if they voted in the elections. These efforts largely failed.
 While UNTAC was unable to achieve "a neutral political environment," 20 parties
 competed, 96 percent of eligible voters registered, and, despite PDK threats and foul
 weather, between May 23 and 28, 90 percent of registered voters cast ballots. Nu-
 merous independent observers and the U.N. Security Council declared the elections
 
 
 free and fair. One clear indication of this was that an opposition party,
 FUNCINPEC, won 46 percent of the vote compared to only 38 percent for the CPP.
 On September 24, the Constitution, drafted and approved by the Assembly, was
 promulgted, establishing a Constitutional Monarchy with Norodom Sihanouk as
 King. The Constitution provides for a multiparty, liberal democratic system with
 separation of powers, an independent judiciary, and a monarch who reigns but does
 not rule. The document calls for new nationwide legislative elections every 5 years.
 The Government is now preparing plans to institute elections at the village and
 commune level.
 The new legitimate Government was formed through negotiation between the
 FUNCINPEC and CPP parties. This compromise, which grants the CPP half of the
 cabinet positions, was reached against the backdrop of an abortive June secession
 movement, led by CPP member Prince Norodom Chakrapong. Although the seces-
 sion movement quickly collapsed, it constituted an illegitimate pressure on the proc-
 ess of forming a new government.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Twenty-seven independent indigenous nongovernmental organizations (NGO's)
 carried out human rights activities in Cambodia in 1993. The four largest of these
 had combined membership of over 150,000. They engaged in diverse activities rang-
 ing from basic human rights monitoring to education to prison visits to public semi-
 nars on the new Constitution. By the end of 1993, the NGO's were able to bring
 complaints to a human rights committee of the National Assembly, and several is-
 sued periodic bulletins about their activities.
 The effectiveness of the nascent human rights NGO's was magnified by their abil-
 ity to work with and receive support from UNTAC and the successor U.N. Human
 Rights Center Field Office in Phnom Penh. UNTAC had a staff of 40 human rights
 monitors until September, present in all 21 provinces. In addition, 3,400 UNTAC
 civilian police assisted in human rights investigations. The military component of
 UNTAC used a strategic investigation team equipped with helicopters to investigate
 the most egregious human rights violations. Amnesty International, Asia Watch,
 and the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights also visited Cambodia in 1993.
 While human rights investigators moved freely in government-controlled areas, no
 human rights groups were permitted entry into PDK zones.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The new Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, color, sex, language,
 religious belief, or political views. However, with no effective means of implementing
 these guarantees, the most vulnerable elements of Cambodian society are often vic-
 tims of discrimination.
 Women.-The new Constitution contains strong language providing for equal
 rights for women, equal pay for equal work, and equal status in marriage. In prac-
 tice, women have equal property rights with men, have the same status in bringing
 divorce proceedings, and have equal access to education and some jobs. However,
 tradition still prohibited many women from reaching the highest positions in many
 areas. Independent women's associations flourished in 1993, and the leaders of two
 of the most prominent human rights NGO's are women.
 International aid workers confirm that violence against women, including rape as
 well as domestic violence, is common, although there are still no systematic studies
 to determine the extent of the problem. Authorities normally decline to become in-
 volved in such "private" disputes. Prostitution, prohibited by the new Constitution,
 is nevertheless common in Phnom Penh.
 Children.-Children are a vulnerable group in Cambodia. They are often victims
 of landmines and there is evidence of nascent child prostitution among street chil-
 dren in Phnom Penh. The new Constitutiori explicitly protects children s rights. En-
 suring the welfare of children is also a specific goal of the government's political pro.
 gram. However, the Government must rely on international aid to fund most social
 welfare programs targeted at children, and, therefore, resources devoted to the goal
 are modest.
 National/Racial /Ethnic Minorities.-Vietnamese and Chinese have long been the
 largest ethnic minorities in Cambodia. Ethnic Chinese are now well accepted. How-
 ever, fear and animosity toward the Vietnamese, who are seen as a threat to the
 Khmer nation and culture, remain among Cambodians. In 1993 the PDK sought to
 exploit these feelings through a calculated campaign of racial violence directed
 against ethnic Vietnamese civilians. The PDK, whose legitimacy suffered in the May
 
 
 603
 elections, sought to show that they were the true nationalists and to provoke opposi-
 tion to the SOC, which was installed in 1979 by a Vietnamese invasion.
 Amnesty International has documented 15 racially motivated attacks in 1993 re-
 sulting in 70 deaths and 60 wounded. Innocent women, children, and elderly per-
 sons were beaten or shot to death. A typical incident occurred March 10 in the float-
 ing village of Chong Khneas on the Tonle Sap lake in Siem Reap province when
 20 men entered the village at dusk on boats and opened fire with AK-47 assault
 rifles on viliagers in their houseboats and in a video parlor for 15 to 30 minutes.
 Eighteen people were killed and 15 were injured.
 The Cambodian authorities did not react energetically to these attacks. SOC po-
 lice just 300 meters from Chong Khneas village did not attempt to intervene. King
 Sihanouk publicly condemned the killings of ethnic Vietnamese. However, it was
 only on July 24, after four major attacks, that the prvisional government publicly
 condemned the attacks. Only one person was arrested in connection with all these
 attacks--and then by UNTAC. (The accused subsequently died of natural causes.)
 Constituent Assembly members debated whether rights provided for in the new
 Constitution extended to ethnic Vietnamese. The Assembly decided to defer the mat-
 ter for future legislation.
 People with Disabilities.-Cambodia has the highest percentage of handicapped
 persons in the world; one in 286 Cambodians is missing at least one limb. Programs
 administered by various NGO's have brought about dramatic improvements in the
 treatment and rehabilitation of amputees. Although the handicapped are often
 looked upon as a burden by poor families, rehabilitation programs have improved
 how they are perceived. Accessibility for the handicapped is not mandated either
 legislatively or otherwise.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Eighty percent of Cambodians are subsistence rice
 farmers. A large proportion of the urban population are engaged in low-level com-
 merce or are self-employed as craftspeople. A majority of salaried workers are em-
 ployed by the State, although there is a growing service sector and a small indus-
 trial sector. The new Constitution provides for the organization of trade unions "as
 stipulated by law." Until future implementing legislation is passed, the relevant law
 is the Labor Law passed by the SOC in August 1992.
 The 1992 law reflected consultations with the International LaLbir Organization
 and international labor law experts and is similar to labor laws in market economy
 countries. It states that workers have the right to form unions of their own choosing
 without previous authorization. The law does not require that unions join a single
 trade union structure and contains no provisions regarding whether a union may
 participate in political activity. However, there is a wide gap between the provisions
 of the labor law and the reality of labor conditions in Cambodia today. No other
 unions currently exist apart from those in the formerly SOC-controlled Kampuchean
 Federation of Trade Unions, an organization which was inactive in 1993. A new or-
 ganization of pedicab drivers and other transport workers holds the potential of de-
 veloping into an independent union.
 The new Constitution guarantees the right to strike, "in accordance with law." Im-
 plementing legislation is still lacking. During 1993 some workers from state enter-
 prises took action when their factories were sold and closed. They carried out infor-
 mal strikes which were promptly settled with government intervention, usually via
 cash payments.
 The Labor Law permits unions to join federations but does not address whether
 they may be affiliated with international bodies. The Kampuchean Federation of
 Trade Unions is a member of the formerly Soviet-controlled World Federation of
 Trade Unions.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Collective bargaining is pro-
 tected under the labor law, although any agreement reached between workers and
 employers is subject to approval by the Government. However, collective bargaining
 does not currently exist in practice. Civil servant wages are set by the Government.
 Wage rates in other sectors are set largely by the market. The Labor Law prohibits
 antiunion discrimination by employers. A number of offices in the new Government
 have conducted elections for workers' representatives. They participate in all deci-
 sions.
 No export processing zones exist.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Law prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, but there is inadequate inspection to enforce it. The Labor Law
 contains penal sanctions for offenders. There are no reports that domestic or foreign
 workers are being forced to remain in situations amounting to coerced labor. Prisons
 in SOC-controlled areas were inspected by UNTAC and international human rights
 
 
 greUps, and there were no reports of prison labor. There are widespread reports that
 hPDK compels people under its control to serve as porters for military and other
 su plies.
 .Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Law states that the
 minimum age for employment is 16, except for persons under age 16 working in an
 enterprise in which aV, workers are memers of a family and under the supervision
 of a father, mother, or guardian. Although penalties exist for violators of these pro-
 visions, the Government has not yet established an apparatus to enforce them. Out
 of economic necessity, persons under the age of 16 years engage in a variety of jobs.
 These include street trading, construction, and small-scale manufacturing.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Law does not provide for a nation-
 wide minimum wage. However, it does require that every laborer receive a mini-
 mum wage that assures a decent living standard. The wage can vary according to
 regions. Currently, market-determined wage rates at lower levels are not sufficient
 to provide a decent living for a worker and family.
 The Labor Law provides for a standard legalwork week of 48 hours and a 24-
 hour rest period. The law requires overtime payment at a rate set by the Govern-
 ment. These standards are not enforced and workers commonly work more than 48
 hours per week and 8 hours per day. The law states that the workplace should have
 health and safety standards necessary to ensure the workers' well-bing. However,
 the Government as yet to set specific standards. Penalties are specified in the law,
 but there are no provisions to protect workers who complain about unsafe or
 unhealthful conditions. Conditions in factories and small-scale industries are gen-
 erally poor. Ventilation and lighting are inadequate, sanitation facilities are poor,
 and noise levels are significantly above international standards.
