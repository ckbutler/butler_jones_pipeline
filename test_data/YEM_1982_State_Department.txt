 THE PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YEMEN*
 The People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY, or South
 Yemen) is a one-party state, dominated by a Marxist political
 party dedicated to restructuring the economic and social
 order. The ruling Yemeni Socialist Party derives from the
 National Liberation Front, which came to power at independence
 in 1967 following protracted civil conflict with competing
 nationalist/revolutionary groups. The current President, Ali
 Nasser Mohammad, came to office in mid-1979, upon the
 resignation of his predecessor, Abdul Al-Fatah Ismail. Ismail
 had gained office in 1978 after winning a power struggle within
 the ruling Party. Ismail's predecessor, Salim Rubay'i Ali, was
 executed.
 The Yemen Socialist Party hierarchy comprises the governing
 elite. Policy questions are decided by a small group of party
 and government officials. The Party/governmental leadership
 has often demonstrated extreme, bitter factionalism. Officials
 losing power struggles have been executed, placed under house
 arrest, or forced into political and social obscurity.
 South Yemeni society in recent years has experienced profound
 and traumatic changes. Much of the territory of the country
 outside the capital of Aden still existed in an extremely
 traditional state at independence. Since independence, Aden's
 leaders have sought to eliminate the traditional tribal forces
 and to subject tribal groups to Party and central government
 control. As a result, entire classes, such as traditional
 tribal leadership, religious elements, and the private business
 community have virtually disappeared from the society.
 Settlement of the nomadic bedouins has been a major government
 effort. The Government has also sought to limit the influence
 of the mercantile community in Aden. As a result of these
 efforts to restructure traditional society, large numbers of
 South Yemenis, perhaps 300,000 - 500,000 (15 percent-25 percent
 of the population), have left the country.
 South Yemen has been a supporter of terrorism. It has in the
 past given aslyum to aircraft hijackers and has allowed its
 territory to be used by several groups for the training of
 international terrorists. The National Democratic Front, a
 Marxist-led insurgent group, has been conducting a violent
 conflict with North Yemen government forces out of sanctuaries
 in South Yemen with the knowledge, support, and encouragement
 of the Aden Government. A number of Front members have enjoyed
 official status within the Yemeni Socialist Party. Since a
 meeting between the heads of-state of North and South Yemen in
 May 1982, a relatively stable truce has been effect, under
 which Yemen Arab Republic (North Yemen - YAR) security forces
 have reoccupied some areas from which the National Democratic
 Front has withdrawn, and an undetermined number of Front
 leaders and fighters have accepted a North Yemen amnesty. The
 South Yemen Government has withdrawn military support from the
 National Democratic Front.
 *The United States maintains no diplomatic mission in Aden.
 The People's Democratic Republic of Yemen severed diplomatic
 relations and expelled all United States personnel in 1969. In
 view of the closed nature of the regime and the lack of an
 American presence there, it is difficult to obtain information
 on the human rights situation.

 During the 1970's, a similar group, the Popular Front for
 the Liberation of Oman, conducted an insurgency in Oman from
 sanctuaries in South Yemen. The Omani and South Yemeni
 Governments negotiated an accord in late 1982 designed to
 stabilize their border area and to improve bilateral relations.
 South Yemen's Constitution purports to guarantee a wide range
 of human rights. In practice, South Yemen is a tightly
 controlled state where the rights of individuals are
 subordinated to the economic and political interests of the
 ruling party and state. Freedom House, in its report for 1982,
 classifies South Yemen as "Not Free.-
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 There is no evidence of killings by the Government. Possible
 cases of execution without trial or after secret trial are
 treated under 'disappearances.' There have been no reports of
 indiscriminate killing by dissident or bandit groups.
 Government forces have been effective in controlling
 historically-endemic tribal warfare.
 b. Disappearance
 In addition to trials and jailing of thousands of political
 opponents and the flight into exile of hundreds of thousands,
 many opponents of the regime have disappeared. The 1982
 Amnesty International report, covering 1981, states that
 organization's concern about prisoners of conscience and refers
 to hundreds of people who disappeared between 1967 and 1975.
 Freedom House in its 1982 report also noted hundreds of
 disappearances. In 1982 Muhammed Said Abdullah al-Shariabi
 (alias Muhsin), the South Yemen ambassador to Bulgaria and
 former security chief, was arrested upon arrival at Aden
 airport. Muhsin has not reappeared and was reportedly tried in
 secret and executed shortly after his arrest.
 c. Torture
 Although the Constitution prohibits torture, there have been
 reports, from Freedom House among others, that torture is
 practiced. These have been denied by the Government.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Prison conditions in South Yemen are reported to be poor, with
 inadequate sanitary facilities, monotonous and meager rations,
 and harsh treatment. In 1982, Amnesty International expressed
 concern over prison conditions in South Yemen, including
 serious deficiencies in hygiene, food, health care, and the
 overall treatment of prisoners.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Individuals are reportedly thoroughly investigated prior to
 arrest, and arrest practices follow legal requirements. No
 information is available regarding how arbitrary the definition
 of a crime might be, however. Amnesty International has
 reported the case's of officials of the pre-independence federal
 Government imprisoned without charge or trial since 1967, as
 well as of other political prisoners similarly detained since
 1970-1975. The last available estimate (1976) was that there
 
 
 1314
 
 might have been as many as 10,000 political prisoners in South
 Yemen at that time, but no current statistics are available.
 Freedom House in 1982 referred to thousands of political
 prisoners.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 No reliable information is available. Early in 1982, a group
 of alleged saboteurs were given a "show" trial, featuring their
 public. confessions, which was widely covered by Aden television
 and other. media., Other people, such as Abdullah al-Sharjabi,
 may have been tried secretly.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 The Constitution guarantees the sanctity of the home, except in
 connection with *actions affecting the security of the
 re.volution and in accordance with the law.* There were no
 reports in 1982 of violations ,f traditional mores which
 support the privacy and integrity of the home from forceful
 entry.
 2. Respect for Civil and-Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of-speech and Press
 Freedom of the press is guaranteed by law. However, the public
 media are state-owned and operated and under the supervision of
 .both Government and Party officials, particularly the
 Information Ministry. Foreign publications are known to
 circulate freely once unofficially introduced into the
 country. Those foreign newspapers and magazines normally sold
 within South Yemen are known to have been occasionally censored.
 South Yemeni law requires that anti-regime and anti-Party
 statements be reported, and a widespread informant system
 reportedly exists, placing a severe constraint on the exercise
 of free speech. According to reports, international mail and
 telephone communications and the communications of suspect
 individuals are monitored on occasion.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Apparently no unsanctioned public or professional associations
 operate openly, and reports indicate that except for
 traditional religious and tribal functions, non-sanctioned
 public gatherings and associations are not allowed. The
 Government has made a concerted effort to suppress traditional
 tribal identification. Government-sponsored labor unions are
 under close Party control.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution declares Islam to be the state religion,
 but guarantees freedom of religious expression. In practice,
 the Government has attempted to minimize the influence of
 religious leaders, and a large number of religious leaders were
 arrested during the late 1960's and early 1970's. According to
 recent reports, a group of young Islamic dissidents, arrested
 for alleged anti-governmental activities in 1982, were
 subsequently released without further punishment.
 
 
 1315
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation.
 The Government controls departures from Yemen. Exit permits
 are required and are not freely provided. South Yemeni
 citizens are free to travel within their province of residence
 without restriction, and without special documentation among
 the other provinces except for some restricted security areas.
 e. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Political power in South Yemen is concentrated within the
 highest levels of the Yemeni Socialist Party, a political party
 organized along Marxist cadre lines. Personal and factional
 allegiances play a major role in decision-making by the Party
 leadership. The losers in factional struggles for power have
 sometimes suffered exile or even execution. The Constitution
 guarantees the right to vote to males and females over the age
 of eighteen, and elections are regularly held. However, only
 Party-approved candidates may contest elections at any level,
 and no other parties or political action groups are permitted.
 3. Government Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 Amnesty International delegates were last permitted to visit a
 prison in 1975. South Yemen has not replied to repeated
 requests from Amnesty International for information about
 prisoners. In its 1982 report, Amnesty International stated
 that it continued to work for the release of prisoners of
 conscience in South Yemen.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 The People's Democratic Republic of Yemen has a population of
 2.0 million, with a per capita income estimated at $520 in
 1980. Almost one-fourth of the population lives in the area of
 Aden, about 150,000 are nomadic bedouin, and the rest are
 scattered in the rural areas. It is estimated that more than
 150,000 men work in the oil-producing states of the Gulf and
 Saudi Arabia, and their remittances constitute a crucial source
 of foreign exchange. Some 40 percent of the labor force is
 employed in agriculture, which produces 12.6 percent of GDP.
 Life expectancy at birth was 45 years in 1980, up from 36 years
 in 1960. Between 1970 and 1979, the rate of population growth
 was 2.3 percent, compared to 1.9 percent in the previous
 decade. The 1980 population growth rate was 2.9 percent.
 Education and health care are free and the Government has made
 a major effort to increase the literacy rate. Foreign visitors
 have been impressed by the number and appearance of school
 children visible on the streets of Aden. Current estimates
 place 72 percent of school-age children in primary school. The
 Government requires illiterate adults to attend literacy
 classes. The number of hospitals has increased dramatically
 since independence, and there are a number of social welfare
 
 
 1316
 centers. Equality of both sexes is guaranteed by law. Foreign
 visitors report seeing numerous women actively engaged among
 the labor force. Polygamy, child marriage and arranged
 marriage are prohibited.
 Poverty is widespread and there are frequent food shortages in
 South Yemen. Because of severe financial constraints, only a
 small percentage of the budget is devoted to domestic
 development; current accounts constitute the bulk of government
 spending. South Yemen has acquired large amounts of Soviet
 military equipment in recent years, but the terms of payment
 and the consequent impact on other sectors of the economy are
 unknown.
 In 1982, South Yemen suffered a major natural disaster in the
 form of widespread flooding. Substantial housing and economic
 infrastructure losses occurred, leaving as many as 60,000
 homeless. Roads, dams, levees, and entire villages were washed
 away. International experts have stated that even with
 adequate financial assistance, at least five years will be
 required for recovery.
 Even prior to the flooding, South Yemen suffered an extreme
 housing shortage. Housing is in particularly short supply in
 Aden, and waiting lists are long. It is almost impossible for
 single persons to obtain housing. Living space is rationed
 according to the size of the family unit. Foreign visitors
 have remarked on the existance of "shanty towns" on the
 outskirts of the city. Housing applications are initiated
 through the basic level organization of the Yemeni Socialist
 Party. All furnishings must be rented through the state.
 Basic food items which are in short supply, such as rice,
 sugar, and cooking oil, are rationed. Recent estimates
 indicate that the caloric intake declined from 91 percent of
 normal nutritional requirements in 1970 to 81 percent in 1978.
 Reports indicate that there is little private business. The
 Government has recently moved to attract South Yemeni nationals
 living abroad to return by expanding private business
 opportunities. Foreign visitors have reported that much of the
 local retail trade is carried out by small, regulated private
 businesses, although some reports suggest that the latter
 conduct only a small percentage of this trade.
