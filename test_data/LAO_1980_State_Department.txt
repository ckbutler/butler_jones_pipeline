 LAOS
 Economic and historical, as well as political, factors
 give rise to the current human rights situation in the Lao
 People's Democratic Republic (LPDR). The population of Laos
 is about three million (approximately 50 percent Lao, 20
 percent tribal Thai, 15 percent Phoutheung (Kha), and 15
 percent Hmong (Meo), Yao and others, thinly and unevenly
 distributed over more than 91,000 square miles of generally
 rugged terrain. Governmental institutions in Laos remain
 weak. Literacy is estimated at 12-20 percent (adult literacy
 may run 40-60 percent in some areas.)
 Laos is an extremely poor and backward country. Situated
 on the frontier of the communist and non-communist worlds
 (and lying between the major regional rivals: Thailand, the
 People's Republic of China, and Vietnam), Laos has been
 fought over continuously, and is subject to serious internal
 factionalism. Regional and domestic political tension, and
 low-level guerrilla activity continue in Laos; these factors
 contribute to a siege mentality on the part of the narrowly-
 based LPDR government, and to an atmosphere of suspicion
 which plays an active and negative role in the human rights
 picture.
 The Lao People's Democratic Republic is a socialist country,
 with government powers concentrated in the hands of the Lao
 People's Revolutionary Party. The current government of the
 Lao People's Democratic Republic came to power in Vientiane
 in December 1975. The new government suspended the old
 constitution and has not yet replaced it with another.
 Upon taking over, it arrested significant numbers of the old
 regime for "reeducation." Although many other officials of
 the Royal Government remained at their posts through the
 transition, and continue to do so, this policy frightened
 numerous individuals and families of the small "middle
 class" group, which also included Chinese and Vietnamese
 urban traders and artisans. Since 1975, there has been an
 exodus of probably 300,000 persons (or about 10 percent of
 the population). The departure of a significant number of
 the skilled/middle class has held back economic progress.
 Annual per capita income is probably less than one hundred
 dollars.
 Given the government's preoccupation with political and
 military security, the extremely small number of trained
 people available to it, and the government's mistrust of
 many of the educated persons who have remained in the country,
 it is not surprising that the government's inefficient
 administration efforts have made little economic headway.
 The nation's hilly geography, pronounced ethnic cleavages,
 generally infertile soils, monsoon climate, and the absence
 in the population as a whole of a strong-felt need for
 modernization all make progress difficult.
 During the past three years, there has been limited
 improvement in some aspects of human rights in Laos, though
 very serious shortcomings persist in key areas.

 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 There have been no reports of torture for the past two years.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Refugees have described conditions in "reeducation" camps
 (for political prisoners) as primitive, with limited medical
 facilities and poor food, often resulting in malnutrition
 and disease. The inmates reportedly grow much of their own
 food. These sources state that the prisoners reportedly
 receive the same salary ($1.50 per month) as a private in
 the Lao army. Families generally are able to exchange
 letters with detainees; in some cases, wives are even allowed
 to join husbands at the camps for extended periods. Lao
 government officials have publicly denied reports of mis-
 treatment of persons in the reeducation camps, but inmates
 clearly suffer from deprivation of freedom and family, are
 isolated from society and perform hard labor.
 Laos also has normal prisons and prison work camps where
 those convicted of crimes are held together with some per-
 sons accused of undefined political offenses. There have
 been a number of reports of capital punishment, the most
 recent being a publicly announced death sentence for robbery
 in August of 1980. Official policy calls for execution of
 the leaders df resistance groups. Lao authorities in the
 past have announced the execution of a few "reactionaries"
 charged with sabotage activities.
 c. Disappearances
 There were no reports in 1980 of unexplained disappearances.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The government continues to maintain a multilayered system of
 reeducation, rehabilitation and labor camps throughout much
 of the country. These camps exhibit differing degrees of
 isolation and coercion, but precise numerical information is
 lacking. The number of camps remaining open or the popula-
 tion of these camps is not known. Amnesty International
 Report 1980 expresses the fear that thousands of former
 civil servants and professional people have been detained
 without charge since 1975, and that arrests on political
 grounds are continuing. The report expresses fears about
 the conditions in det, .tion camps, isolation of prisoners
 from their families, and the irregular and restricted receipt
 of correspondence and parcels. Estimates of the number of
 people in camps range from under 10,000 to 15,000.
 Not long after the establishment of the Republic, several
 thousand Lao citizens as well as a few foreign residents
 were arrested for their association with the previous
 government or the United States. They were sent, without
 public hearing or trial, to remote camps for "reeducation."
 The "reeducation" camps in Phong Saly were closed in early
 1979, and most of the camp inmates released, reducing the
 number of those in captivity to some extent. In November
 and December, 1979, at least two more camps were closed
 
 
 651
 down. Some people who have been released from the camps
 have been required to settle in remote parts of the country.
 There may be a system of moving people through progressively
 "milder" camps. There is also said to be one camp close to
 the Vietnamese border, which is used for very high ranking
 members of the former regime and for persons who are
 resistant to "reeducation." On the occasion of the release
 of a small number of prisoners in March of 1980, the govern-
 ment encouraged the belief that camps would be closed fairly
 soon and reeducation ended. In November 1980, the govern-
 ment is reported to have released from 200 to 300 people
 from reeducation camps prior to the fifth anniversary of the
 Republic. Those accused of hostility to the regime or of
 "socially undesirable" habits (prostitution, drug abuse,
 idleness, and "wrong thought") are sent to rehabilitation
 centers without trial, and can be held there for indefinite
 periods. Most of those persons have been allowed to return
 after several years of hard labor,'political indoctrination,
 and admission of guilt. Under the government's concept of
 justice, and in the absence of a constitution or a codified
 body of law, those undergoing reeducation or rehabilitation
 are not necessarily charged with specific crimes.
 The Lao government attempts to portray these camps as learn-
 ing and indoctrination centers. In order to be released one
 must have "reformed" and recanted past mistakes. Persons
 are still being arrested for "social evils" and sent to
 "rehabilitation camps" for periods from a few months to
 several years. A wave of such arrests took place in the fall
 of 1980, probably in preparation for the regime's fifth
 anniversary celebration; possibly several hundred people
 were detained. These arrests were apparently of a random
 nature, since they swept up many men and women who have no
 political ties. Many were released after a few days.
 The Lao have promulgated interim rules and regulations for
 the arrest and trial of those accused of specific crimes,
 including armed resistance to the government. These regula-
 tions were disseminated to local authorities in October 1978,
 primarily to correct the haphazard way in which lower-level
 authorities were handling their criminal and judicial duties.
 Amnesty International expressed in its 1980 report the fear
 that thousands of former civil servants and professional
 people have been detained without charge since 1975 and
 that arrests on political grounds are continuing. The
 report expresses fears about the conditions in detention
 camps, isolation of prisoners from their families, and the
 irregular and restricted receipts of correspondence and
 parcels.
 e. Denial of Pair Public Trial
 Those confined in "seminars" for reeducation or rehabilita-
 tion are not technically considered to have committed any
 crime; consequently, they have no recourse to trial. Their
 period of "reeducation" is determined by government
 authorities based on their progress in becoming "new socialist
 men."
 The government had admitted that in its early days a number
 of individuals accused of specific crimes had been wrongfully
 confined or even executed without trial. It was in an
 initial attempt to correct this situation that the rudimentary
 system of rules for criminal investigation and trial was
 distributed in October 1978. Even if regulations were
 
 
 652
 followed, however, they would provide no real opportunity
 for the accused to defend himself. Rather the government
 has issued instructions on how to investigate, prosecute,
 and punish wrongdoers. There is some provision for appeal,
 with the key exception that important political cases tried
 by people's courts are without appeal. Death sentences must
 be cleared by the ministerial council. Lao regulations call
 for judgment to be given in public. This is in effect
 public announcement of sentence rather than public trial.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Under government regulations, search of private homes
 requires written orders from the prosecution department,
 Ministry of Justice or from the concerned provincial
 prosecution service. The search is supposed to be conducted
 in front of the accused or other witnesses and a written
 inventory made of confiscated goods. Except in urgent
 cases, house searches are required to be conducted during
 the day. In practice, these regulations appear to be violated.
 Even in cases in which they are followed, they provide
 little protection for the individual, since search and
 seizure are authorized by the peacekeeping authorities
 themselves rather than an independent authority.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 About 85 percent of the population of Laos is engaged in
 subsistence agriculture. The country's economic problems
 are complicated by inadequate internal transportation and
 isolation from the sea. The avowed aim of the government
 is to improve the economic self-sufficiency of the country
 and the condition of the people by a socialist transformation
 of the economy, including collectivization of agriculture.
 The government has announced an ambitious program for
 economic development with emphasis on agriculture and forestry.
 In early 1978, instances of attempted coercion of some
 farmers to join agricultural cooperatives were reported,
 causing for the first time.some lowland Lao farmers to
 leave the country. According to the government, this
 coercion was the result of lack of understanding by both
 cadre and farmers, and was not a LPDR government policy.
 The formation of new cooperatives has been halted, and many
 old cooperatives are crumbling and reverting to private
 agriculture. The 1980 rice harvest is expected to be one of
 the best in several years. The government has nationalized
 most industries and at times has tried to impose strict
 controls on urban private enterprise, although some private
 trade is allowed to continue. In December 1979, a currency
 substitution followed by a devaluation brought the official
 exchange rate into line with the unofficial rate. The
 official procurement prices of commodities also were raised
 toward free market prices.
 After a period of relative price stability in 1978 and 1979,
 inflation, at least for imported goods, resumed in 1980 with
 the closing of the Thai. border. Although the border is now
 partially open, price levels remain high in part due to
 government efforts to restrict private trade with Thailand.
 The government recently revoked the import licenses of
 hundreds of merchants, thus concentrating all means to
 import legally in state hands. The government is in the
 process of opening state stores adjacent to the free mer-
 chants; the avowed policy is to squeeze them out by
 
 
 653
 underselling and offering other attractions, at least in
 the short term. The government is attempting to establish
 a national rural health system, but shortages of trained
 personnel, medicines, facilities, and equipment, and the
 pre-scientific health outlook of many in the population have
 continued to frustrate this effort. These gaps also hamper
 the use of medicine and hospital supplies and other public
 health assistance received in foreign aid.
 The Lao authorities are continuing with a campaign to
 eliminate illiteracy.  (Outside agencies have estimated
 that more than 80 percent of the population is unable to
 read and write.) It is difficult to assess the success of
 this campaign. According to the government, there were
 660,000 primary and secondary students in 1979-80, and
 1,920 university students.
 In practice, there are no impediments to women's participa-
 tion in the economy.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The Lao press is entirely government-controlled and is con-
 sidered an instrument for disseminating government positions.
 Although written or spoken opposition to the government is
 not considered a legitimate activity, people continue to
 speak freely in private, to the point of discussing their
 plans for departure with foreign visitors. Some persons who
 have criticized the government have been jailed.
 Traditionally, Laos has considered itself a Buddhist nation,
 with only a sprinkling of other religions represented. The
 government has taken over some Buddhist and Christian places
 of worship for use as seminar halls or warehouses, but the
 practice of Buddhism and Christianity has been allowed to
 continue. The government has been attempting to use
 the Buddhist clergy as teachers and to explain and endorse
 government policies.
 Donations to support monks are tax exempt. Monks are the
 only remaining social group still entitled to special
 honorific terms of address. Continuing a pattern resumed in
 1979, the traditional Lao New Year was celebrated in April
 1980 with customary zest and wide popular participation.
 Assembly to petition the government for redress of grievances
 is severely restricted.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Before December 1979, Lao citizens were required to seek per-
 mission from the authorities for most internal travel of any
 distance. A series of economically motivated reforms ended
 this practice, however. Foreign travel is permitted for
 officials, and students in government-approved programs.
 Border-crossing permits are available for those with
 business in Thailand. Although the Lao government has said
 that those wishing to emigrate will be allowed to do so, as
 a practical matter legal emigration is rarely authorized and
 reportedly involves substantial payments when it is. In
 fact, tens of thousands have fled Laos clandestinely; since
 
 
 654
 1975, 250,000 Lao have been registered as refugees in
 Thailand, and it is likely a significant further number have
 gone to Thailand without registration. Some of those fleeing
 are fired upon and some killed by Thai or Lao/Vietnamese
 border patrols as they attempt to cross the river. Many Lao
 caught seeking to leave illegally have been imprisoned,
 although in some cases they have only been sent for short
 indoctrination seminars and then released. The Lao have
 agreed with the Thai government that each side will take
 back, on a case by case basis, those of its citizens who
 have illegally crossed into the other country and wish to
 return home. There have been reports of returnees who have
 been treated well by the Lao authorities. In September of
 1980, the Lao government cooperated with the United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees in the repatriation of
 65 peasant villagers to south Laos from camps in Thailand.
 Another 50 returned in October and 70 in November.
 c. Freedom to Participate in;the Political Process
 The new authorities held local elections in the autumn of
 1975. Voters in villages and districts were allowed a
 choice from a list of candidates who had been pre-selected
 by the state/party organization. Provincial and nation-
 level representatives reportedly were chosen by those
 locally-elected officials, although the latter process was
 not public. There have been no national elections held
 nor even discussed since the government was established in
 December 1975.
 The government is attempting to overcome traditional low-
 land Lao attitudes and to integrate minority groups into
 the nation; coercion has been used to this end. Lao women
 are treated equitably and are encouraged to take part in
 economic and state-controlled political activity.
 There is no evidence that the government is seeking to
 destroy any particularly ethnic group, per se, such as the
 Hmong (Meo). The government is equally repressive toward
 all who fought against its takeover, and especially toward
 those who continue to resist its authority by force of
 arms. The war with the Hmong resistance has been brutal.
 The main difference between the Hmong and other resistance
 groups is that the Hmong have strong traditions, and some
 have attempted to defend specific tribal areas. There is a
 traditional ethnic antipathy between the Lao and the Hmong.
 Because the Hmong were heavily armed, Vietnamese and Lao
 military operations have been used to dislodge them from
 their strongholds. One Hmong source states that military
 operations against the Hmong have been reduced since March
 1979, and that the government is trying to win over the
 Hmong by other means.
 Refugees reported that large numbers of women and children
 were killed in bombing raids and that captured Hmong soldiers
 were dealt with harshly, and in some cases killed. There
 have been numerous refugee accounts of attacks using lethal
 chemical agents against the Hmong, though there have been no
 such reports since May, 1980. This charge-has been denied
 by the Lao government.
 There is an ongoing military campaign to suppress
 resistance from lowland Lao groups, mainly in Southern Laos
 and around Vientiane. Many of the insurgents are former
 Royal Army troops. Both sides are reported to use brutal
 
 
 655
 tactics, with the anti-government insurgents engaging in
 assassination and ambush.
 Deterioration in Sino-Lao relations has resulted in increas-
 ing Lao government suspicion of and surveillance of local
 Chinese. So far, however, there has been no policy of
 expulsion or persecution, per se. The Chinese school is
 open, Chinese associations are in operation, and Chinese
 merchants are still in business, although a majority of them
 have left the country, largely for economic reasons. De-
 partures by members of this group continue.
 The government would like to resettle some ethnic minorities
 who inhabit mountainous areas into the lowlands under
 tighter government control, where they can engage in settled
 agricultural production. Some tribal peoples have been
 forcibly relocated.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The government allows little independent travel by persons
 capable of investigating human rights violations. Without
 specific permission, foreigners cannot travel outside
 Vientiane.
 Visits to Laos by foreign journalists were infrequent in the
 first part of 1980. There were signs in October that more
 visas are being issued, but that reporters are accorded
 little access to responsible officials.
 Within Vientiane, foreign diplomatic and other observers are
 able to talk relatively freely to a cross section of the city
 population and tribal groups who visit the city to trade.
 There have been several official visitors to model rehabili-
 tation centers, but no travel by outsiders has been authorized
 to the more remote reeducation camps.
 A number of United Nations agencies are present in Laos, but
 they have not been mandated to observe or report on human
 rights conditions. There have been no groups visiting Laos
 specifically to investigate human rights conditions in the
 country. Laos responded to the 1979 Human Rights Report
 with a diplomatic note conveying their comments point by
 point on that report. Lao officials have been willing to
 discuss human rights issues with U.S. officials.
 Amnesty International noted in its 1980 report that it had
 written to the Lao Prime Minister on March 27, 1980, concern-
 ing detainees, and on April 30 regarding reports that some
 "re-education" camps had been closed. There is no published
 information concerning any Lao government responses to their
 inquiries.
