 MADAGASCAR
 Madagascar's five year old revolutionary government holds
 as its fundamental objectives the full achievement of
 economic independence and the enhancement of justice for
 all. Madagascar deliberately has diversified its earlier
 close and almost exclusive ties with the West, and has
 asserted increased government control over the national
 economy. The establishment of close relations with
 socialist countries and radical third-world states and
 the nationalization of large foreign-owned holdings have
 been further corollaries of these policies. In its
 foreign relations, although it espouses an omni-
 directional and non-aligned policy, the Government of the
 Democratic Republic of Madagascar (GDRM) most often takes
 a militant "anti-imperialist" (read west) stance.
 Madagascar is a one-party socialist state. Internally,
 the government is attempting to decentralize adminis-
 trative functions, although power remains closely held by
 the president. Economically, Madagascar's socialist
 policies are designed to expand production and social
 services and to reduce income disparities.
 The break with the past after the socialist revolution
 of 1975 has alienated certain elements of the population,
 particularly the beneficiaries of the old, post-
 independence order which ruled in Madagascar from 1968
 through the early 1970's. The government often blames
 acts of "sabotage" and other difficulties on supporters
 of the old regime (although not by name), but it has not
 otherwise acted against them. A few military officers
 accused of attempting a coup d'etat since the 1975
 revolution are imprisoned, and some of their supporters
 in France.claim they are being held for political
 reasons. The government maintains that the officers
 have been charged with crimes, and are imprisoned as
 criminals. Political activity is restricted to specified
 organizations which supported the establishment of the
 new regime in 1975, and the government exercises tight
 control over the information media. Ethnic frictions,
 poor law enforcement practices, and political decentral-
 ization, have resulted in occasional breakdowns in law
 and order in which lives and property have been lost.
 General references to human rights are found throughout
 the Malagasy constitution, in particular in Articles 13,
 14 and 49. The latter contains the Malagasy presidential
 oath, in which the President swears that he will defend
 human rights in Madagascar.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a.   Torture
 Torture is forbidden by law. Violent acts in general,
 which could include torture, are addressed in Articles
 309, 310, 311 and 316 of the penal code. Article 341 is
 more specific on torture. While there have been occa-
 sional reports of physical abuse of prisoners, torture is
 not practiced in Madagascar.
 
 
 152
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Prisons are crowded and conditions are primitive.
 While differential treatment is not officially accorded
 to various classes of prisoners, those with resources
 often are able to buy a significantly better penal
 environment. Mistreatment of prisoners is forbidden by
 the penal code and does not appear to be a significant
 problem. There have been occasional reports of physical
 abuse of prisoners, but this is not the norm.
 o. Disappearances
 Abductions, secret arrests, and clandestine detentions,
 by official or quasi-official sources are not known to
 occur in Madagascar.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Madagascar's penal code is patterned after the French code,
 and the concept of habeas corpus does not exist. In
 ordinary criminal cases, the defendant may be held for no
 more than three days before being formally charged.
 Individuals suspected of activity against the state can
 be detained legally under Article 136 of the penal code
 (and held incummunicado) for fifteen days of investiga-
 tion. This period may be extended if the government
 deems it necessary. Occasional long' delays in the
 administration of justice are encountered, primarily due
 to an overworked and inefficient judicial system, but in
 some cases, the delays are obviously politically in-
 spired. There are 8 or 10 foreigners imprisoned in
 Madagascar for alleged subversive activities of one kind
 or another and whose arrest and imprisonment seem quite
 arbitrary to all but the government.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The constitution provides that all courts must be open to
 the public except in cases involving national defense
 matters or in trials of minors. Defendants are charged
 formally and clearly, and have a right to counsel when
 informed of being charged (Art. 22T of the penal code).
 Trials in Madagascar are generally fair. Departures from
 impartiality usually have involved light sentences for
 government officials, slowness in getting cases to
 trial, and occasional lengthy detention of the accused.
 At least three Malagasy military officers and several
 foreigners have been in prisons without trial for several
 years because of suspected activities against the state.
 There are civilian, military, and special economic courts
 in Madagascar. Civilians can be tried before military
 courts for crimes involving the external security of the
 State. There is a court of appeals for civilian cases,
 and final appeal from all three courts may be made to the
 supreme court.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 Under Articles 210-212 of the penal code, process servers
 may enter a private dwelling only during daylight hours.
 
 
 153
 Police may enter at any time if in possession of written
 orders from the chief of police or a high magistrate.
 Other violations of the home such as bugging, demolition,
 or sealing doors and windows are unknown in Madagascar.
 2.   Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 The charter of the socialist revolution, which is the
 government's basic policy document, and the constitution
 set lofty goals for the betterment of l fe of the
 Malagasy people through the creation of a socialist
 society. While the government's commitment to economic
 rights is clear, actual performance in bettering the lot
 of the Malagasy people is limited by the low level of
 economic development, and the small resources available
 to the government. Men and women are guaranteed equal
 rights under Malagasy law, and in practice, women's
 status equals men's in many areas. Traditional society
 is in many ways matriarchical, and women play a leading
 role in several aspects of Malagasy life. Women may and
 do own property, have equal access to educational oppor-
 tunities, and can compete in most professions. Often,
 however, pay scales discriminate against women. Women
 hold many high positions in government, and, for example,
 almost one-third of Malagasy magistrates are women. It
 should be noted, however, that all of this has little
 effect on the lives of most Malagasy, 85 percent of whom
 exist by subsistence farming where women do a large share
 of the work. Malagasy development policy, which empha-
 sizes increasing production, expanding social services,
 and reducing income disparities, in theory gives emphasis
 to previously underprivileged groups and areas. Still,
 it is the urban centers and those relatively better off
 that seem to benefit from policies relating to the
 fulfillment of vital needs. Madagascar is heavily
 dependent on external development assistance, but some
 development efforts are hampered by poor administration
 and corruption. The government takeover of the economy--
 it now controls some 75 percent of economic activity--has
 discouraged private investment and initiative. Lack of
 food, in urban areas as well as the countryside, is often
 a problem because domestic production falls short in
 critical areas. Consequently precious quantities of
 foreign exchange are needed for food imports. The
 inadequate inland transportation network also means that
 food is not always effectively distributed. Madagascar
 has a gross domestic product per capita of $275; it
 has a population growth of 2.5 -2.8 percent; life expect-
 ancy is 46 years; infant mortality is 102 per 1000 live
 births and literacy is 45 percent. Real economic growth
 has generally been slow, although last year a 10 percent
 rate was achieved, mainly through over-investment which
 has now produced a 14 percent rate of inflation and a
 crisis in foreign exchange availability. Perhaps the
 greatest achievements in the area of vital needs since
 the revolution in 1975 have occurred in the area of
 education, with the government claiming to have doubled
 and in some cases tripled the numbers of primary and
 secondary schools, and the numbers of students attending
 them. Everyone in Madagascar is entitled to basic
 economic rights, but relatively few enjoy much more than
 a marginal standard of living.

 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The Malagasy people, nearly half of whom are Christian,
 take their religion and spiritual lives very seriously,,
 and freedom of worship by all groups is fully respected
 by the government. Freedom of speech, press and assembly
 are guaranteed in Article 28 of the constitution.
 However, anyone arguing openly against the government's
 policies, or advocating what the government calls "tribal-
 ism", risks contravening Article 16 of the constitution,
 which authorizes the suspension of the rights and liber-
 ties of individuals "impeding the advent of the socialist
 state."   Freedom of assembly and freedom of the press
 are limited. Permits needed to hold meetings can be
 withheld under Article 16. Meetings to criticize the
 government are rare; although students and labor groups
 occasionally have demonstrated their displeasure with
 specific government measures affecting their interests.
 For the most part labor unions are affiliated with
 approved political organizations (parties), and as such
 can participate in workplace and political activities.
 Those unions not affiliated with parent political groups
 cannot conduct political activities, but are allowed to
 participate in collective bargaining. One such indep-
 endent union was instrumental in leading a civil servant
 walkout and slowdown in August of 1979, which the govern-
 ment ended by the temporary detention of some union
 leaders, harassment of "unauthorized" gatherings and
 meetings, and the firing of some workers combined with
 warnings of more to come if the others did not return to
 work. There is prepublication censorship of the press,
 causing any written criticism of the government or of
 its socialist and radical country friends to be subtle
 and indirect. Books and works of art are not censored,
 although western materials are generally not available.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within-the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Travel is not restricted within the country, and in
 principle passports are obtainable by all. The government
 must authorize specifically, by journey, all travel abroad,
 but both business and tourism trips seem to be on the rise.
 Government limitations on the amount of foreign currency
 which may be taken out of the country (Malagasy currency
 is not convertible abroad) serves as a significant brake
 on international travel. Theoretically, all Malagasy
 have the right to emigrate, but tradition and lack of
 resources make the numbers desiring or able to leave very
 low. Repatriation is also a right of all Malagasy.
 Madagascar has no refugees and the question of granting
 asylum has so far been moot; reasons for this are
 basically geographical, and the matter of policy has not
 been addressed.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The government prohibits political activity by any political
 organizations except those which supported the establishment
 
 
 155
 of the present regime in a referendum in 1975. These
 organizations are specified by ordinance and their
 activities must be exercised within the National Front
 for the Defense of the Revolution. Women are particu-
 larly active in Malagasy politics. Each of the political
 "parties" has its women's auxiliary.  President Ratsiraka's
 wife is active in her husband's party, participating
 in political events on the president's behalf, and
 organizing women to become more active in political
 affairs. Women hold many high positions in government,
 although their influence seems to be less than their
 level of participation would indicate.
 The Front submitted a single list of candidates for the
 National Assembly elections of June 31, 1977, the last
 national elections to be held. Another general election
 is scheduled in 1982. The government claims a high level
 of political participation by its citizenry, but in fact
 the large majority of the population is politically
 apathetic, except perhaps when they are organized for
 elections. Only Malagasy citizens may participate in the
 political process.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no resident human rights groups here, nor have
 there been visits. The government permitted an investi-
 gation by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) of the
 1976 massacre of Comorian residents of the city of
 Majunga by a hostile Malagasy ethnic group. The investi-
 gators had freedom of movement and access to all persons
 concerned. Their report, said to be highly critical of
 the Malagasy security forces's performance, has not been
 disseminated by the OAU.
