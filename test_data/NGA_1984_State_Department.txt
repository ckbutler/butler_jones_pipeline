 NIGERIA
 In 1984 Nigeria was governed by a group of senior military
 officers, led by Major General Huhammadu Buhari, who seized
 power on December 31, 1983, from an elected civilian
 government. The officers cited economic mismanagement,
 corruption, and abuse of office by the civilian government as
 the rationale for the almost bloodless coup.
 The military Government suspended portions of the 1979
 Constitution, most significantly those guaranteeing such
 features of democratic process as free elections and the
 operation of political parties, as well as some provisions
 guaranteeing fundamental individual rights. The Government
 promulgated decrees which eroded the protections against such
 actions as arbitrary arrest and search without warrant. The
 Government also promulgated a decree which inhibits press
 freedom. Under the provisions of certain decrees, civilians
 have been tried by military tribunals.
 The highest authority of the Government is the Supreme
 Military Council, 16 of whose 19 members are military
 officers. A federal cabinet, which includes military and
 civilian ministers in almost equal numbers, presides over the
 executive departments. At the state level, military governors
 are assisted by executive councils comprised of military and
 police officers and some civilian commissioners. At the
 federal and state levels, legislation is promulgated by decree
 and edict. All decrees and edicts of the military Government
 are exempted from challenge in any court of law. The
 judiciary remains intact, but its authority has been limited
 by the establishment of special military tribunals to try
 crimes defined by provisions of certain decrees. The
 Government has the resources of the security apparatus--the
 Nigerian Security Organization, the police force, and the
 military services--to maintain and enforce its rule.
 Nigeria has a mixed economy. The Government plays a major
 role in important sectors and guides the-economy, but there is
 a strong market orientation and broad scope for private
 investment. Private property rights are generally respected.
 There are indigenization laws which reserve some business
 areas for Nigerians and require foreign firms to maintain
 specified levels of Nigerian participation.
 Differences of ethnicity and religion among Nigeria's large
 and exceptionally diverse population have affected the pattern
 of discrimination. In spite of government efforts to
 eliminate sex-based discrimination, women are sub3ect to a
 number of discriminatory legal provisions, suffer unequal
 treatment in employment, and are considered socially
 inferior. At the same time, women play a key role in local
 economic affairs, exert influence through women's councils,
 and have an impact on society in education, culture, and youth
 affairs.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There is no evidence of killings for political motives. No
 former office holder or politician ousted by the military
 
 
 244
 NIGERIA
 Government and tried by military tribunals has received the
 death penalty. However, a number of people were killed in
 February's religious disturbances in Yola when the army used
 artillery against areas occupied by rioters.  Estimates of
 casualties vary from 500 to 1800. Nigeria is currently free
 of local terrorist or insurgent groups which use murder as a
 form of political action.
 b. Disappearance
 There are no known instances of politically motivated or
 government instigated disappearances in Nigeria during 1984.
 The Government has been suspected of complicity in the
 attempted kidnapping of a former Nigerian official in London
 in July but has denied involvement. The trial in London of a
 Nigerian and three Israelis arrested in the kidnapping attempt
 was pending at the end of 1984.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 A portion of the Constitution still in effect outlaws torture
 and the mistreatment of prisoners. Nigerian law provides that
 such excesses may be dealt with in criminal or civil
 proceedings. No reports of torture have come to light. There
 are reports of crowded and austere prison conditions and
 mistreatment, including police brutality. Under the terms of
 one of its decrees, the Government has extended the death
 penalty to a number of crimes including arson, tampering with
 oil pipelines or electric or telephone cables, illegal import
 or export of mineral ore, dealing in drugs, illegally dealing
 in petroleum products, counterfeiting, and armed robbery even
 when no death or injury occurs. Special tribunals have
 imposed the death sentence on individuals convicted for drug-
 and petroleum-related offenses. At year's end, these
 sentences were awaiting final confirmation by the Supreme
 Military Council. Another punishment which many consider
 excessive is 21-year imprisonment for cheating on
 examinations, tampering with mail, and forgery of checks. The
 Government has justified these punishments as necessary to
 restore order and discipline in the society. More than I00
 persons have been publicly executed by firing squad for armed
 robbery.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The State Security (Detention of Persons) Decree issued by the
 Government allows the Chief of Staff, Supreme Headquarters, to
 detain persons suspected of acts prejudicial to state security
 or harmful to the economic well-being of the country. The
 Chief of Staff is required to review the case of each person
 detained under this decree every three months, to determine
 whether the detention should be terminated or extended. There
 is no evidence that this requirement is being met. No legal
 proceedings may be brought against any official for acting in
 pursuance of this decree. The Government also suspended some
 constitutional protections against arbitrary arrest and
 detention, including the right of habeas corpus, the
 requirement that the detained be informed in writing of the
 grounds for arrest or detention within 24 hours, and the
 requirement for compensation and an apology for unlawful
 arrest or detention. In one case, an American citizen was
 held for approximately three months before consular access was
 granted and for approximately nine months before charges were
 filed.
 
 
 245
 NIGERIA
 As many as 5,000 politicians and office holders in the ousted
 government--at the federal, state, and local levels--were
 ordered to surrender to the police in January for
 interrogation regarding alleged corruption and abuse of
 office. Most did so, but a few fled the country. No one was
 exiled. Most of those who reported to the authorities were
 admonished not to travel outside their home states. Others
 were held under house arrest, and about 500 were imprisoned.
 In October, 250 of these detainees were released after
 investigations failed to incriminate them. Among the many
 persons still detained are the former President, Vice
 President, and Foreign Minister, against whom no charges have
 been brought. Some detainees' bank accounts were frozen,
 passports confiscated, houses searched, and documents and
 currency seized. Arrests and detentions were covered
 extensively by the press. The detainees were originally
 permitted visits by family members, but after two or three
 weeks were held incommunicado.
 The military Government does not use forced labor as a means
 of political coercion or as a sanction against free expression
 of political opinions.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Special military tribunals have been set up to try persons
 suspected of corrupt practices or otherwise contributing to
 the country's economic adversity. Tribunals on corruption are
 chaired by military officers, with a justice of a federal or
 state high court as legal adviser. Tribunals established to
 try other crimes, such as currency violations, accusations
 against public officials, arson, import and export of certain
 goods, destruction of public property, and use or possession
 of drugs, are chaired by justices of the federal or state high
 courts, but include military and police officers. The
 investigating police officer may not serve on the tribunal.
 All tribunal verdicts are subject to review by the Supreme
 Military Council, which may confirm, overturn, or reduce the
 penalties. No appeal or other court challenge to the Supreme
 Military Council's final decision is allowed.
 Trials before special military tribunals have commenced, and
 some convictions have been handed down. Former office holders
 convicted on charges of corruption include several state
 governors, one federal minister, and the Director of the
 Nigerian Youth Service Corps. Most received 21-year
 sentences, but some sentences were subsequently reduced.
 The Nigerian Bar Association has urged its members to boycott
 corruption trials because of the presence on the tribunals of
 members without legal training, the requirement that the
 corruption trials be held in camera, and the absence of a
 right of appeal. However, some lawyers have ignored the Bar
 Association's position and represented the accused. Generally
 accepted procedural norms appear to be followed by the
 tribunals. The Government has justified the secrecy of the
 trials as being in the best interest of the accused because of
 the likelihood that the press would distort the proceedings.
 It has privately justified the creation of special military
 tribunals on the grounds that judicial independence was
 compromised under the civilian government and the judiciary
 implicated in election rigging.
 
 
 246
 NIGERIA
 Persons charged with crimes not covered by the decrees are
 tried in civilian courts, which were left intact by the
 Government's constitution modification decree. The
 Constitution guarantees a fair public trial in the civilian
 courts within three months from the date of arrest, though
 individuals have been held without charge for longer periods.
 The Constitution also guarantees notification of charges and
 access to legal counsel. These trials are public and adhere
 to constitutionally guaranteed individual rights. The
 Government has assured the judiciary of independence from the
 executive branch. In capital cases, the Government provides
 counsel for indigent defendants. In other cases, indigents
 must rely for counsel on the Nigerian Legal Aid Society, which
 has limited resources.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Nigerian society is generally free of arbitrary interference
 by the state in the private lives of citizens. The
 Constitution modification decree issued by the Government left
 in force the guaranteed rights to privacy in homes,
 correspondence, and oral electronic communication.
 General surveillance of the population by the state is not
 practiced in Nigeria. There is no compulsory membership in
 political organizations, and there is no political enforcement
 of social, cultural, or religious codes. There has been no
 forced resettlement of population. Forced entry into homes is
 not generally permitted without the authorization of the
 judiciary. However, the Government's decree dissolving
 political parties authorizes any member of the police force or
 military to enter any building if there is reason to believe
 that a political meeting is taking place. The police and
 members of the Nigerian Security Organization have
 occasionally entered homes and offices without warrant when
 seeking evidence of corruption.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 While the constitution modification decree left intact the
 provisions of the 1979 Constitution guaranteeing freedom of
 expression and the press, the Federal Military Government did
 issue a decree in March which has tended to inhibit full
 expression of opinion. The decree makes it an offense for any
 person to "publish in any form, whether written or otherwise"
 a statement, rumor, message, or report which is false or which
 "is calculated to bring the Federal Military Government or the
 government of a state or a public officer to ridicule or
 disrepute." Three journalists, all from privately owned
 newspapers, have been convicted under the provisions of this
 decree. Two of them received one-year prison sentences for
 writing an article on ambassadorial appointments which the
 Government said was false. The third was imprisoned and later
 released for publishing a letter to the editor which a state
 governor said embarrassed him. A prominent educator and
 social critic has been held without charge since March. The
 press decree has restricted investigative reporting and
 diminished reportorial initiative. Moreover, high government
 officials have publicly attacked the press, promising to
 "descend heavily" on those who publish material injurious to
 the nation. Some media representatives have been called in by
 
 
 247
 NIGERIA
 the Nigerian Security Organization and advised against certain
 practices. Government officials, however, have asserted that
 the Government does not intend to gag the press. In fact,
 different viewpoints on issues are still aired, including
 criticism of government actions and policies, particularly in
 privately owned newspapers.
 There is no direct government censorship of the media, but the
 federal and state governments exercise some control over
 semi-official media through appointments of board directors
 and top executives.
 The print media include privately owned and state-owned
 publications. The Federal Government owns 100 percent of one
 large daily newspaper and 60 percent of another. Most state
 governments own a daily newspaper responsive to the military
 governor. There are several privately owned newspapers, with
 wide circulation. There are no restrictions on ownership of
 other forms of print media. The Constitution reserves the
 right to own and operate radio and television stations to the
 state and federal governments. There is no book censorship by
 the Government, but book publishers are subject to the same
 laws that govern the print media, including the decree on
 publishing material that subjects public officials to
 embarrassment.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Government has banned political parties and authorized the
 head of state to dissolve any other group which has objectives
 similar to a political party.
 The Constitution's guarantees of freedom of peaceful assembly
 and association for non-political purposes are generally
 respected for most of the thousands of private organizations
 and associations, whether legally registered and incorporated
 or not. The Government has, however, specifically banned the
 National Association of Nigerian Students, and, in August,
 broke up a meeting of Association members, arresting ten.
 Nigeria has 42 industrial unions affiliated with a single
 national labor center, the Nigeria Labor Congress, plus
 independent professional unions and senior staff
 associations. Membership of the Congress's affiliated unions
 has declined, in the face of deep employment cutbacks in the
 public and private sectors, from an estimated three million to
 perhaps one or two million. The Nigerian Labor Congress and
 its affiliated unions are independent of the federal, state,
 and local governments and have democratically elected leaders.
 Additional industrial unions may be formed by applying to the
 Federal Government's registrar of trade unions for
 certification. Since the merger by law in 1978 of the
 country's previous national labor centers, any new union must
 become a member of the Nigeria Labor Congress and must
 therefore conform with the requirements of both the Federal
 Government and the Nigeria Labor Congress to avoid conflicts
 of jurisdiction with existing unions. Supplementary
 organizations are sometimes tolerated but are not recognized
 as trade unions. Since 1978, the Nigeria Labor Congress has
 been obliged to confine its formal international affiliations
 to the United Nations' International Labor Organization and
 the Organization of African Trade Union Unity. Many
 individual Nigerian unions, however, retain informal ties with
 
 40-387 0 - 85 - 17
 
 
 248
 NIGERIA
 either the Prague-based World Federation of Trade Unions or
 the Brussels-based International Confederation of Free Trade
 Unions. Industrial trade unions have the right to strike as
 long as they conform to laws governing strike notifications
 and the mediation/arbitration activities of the Government.
 The Government's commitment to honor unions' right to bargain
 collectively has come into question with an official Ministry
 of Labor suggestion to the Nigeria Labor Congress that its
 unions suspend collective bargaining negotiations for one year
 'to minimize the effects of the current economic position on
 industrial relations.' Nigeria has ratified ILO Conventions
 87 (Freedom of Association and Right to Organize) and 98
 (Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining).
 Nigerian trade and professional groups are guaranteed the
 right of association by the 1979 Constitution. They may
 gather peacefully at any time and may conduct their activities
 on a national basis and with international bodies as they
 please. They are required to register with the Ministry of
 Commerce and Industries.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Constitutional provisions of freedom of religion, religious
 practice, and religious education are generally observed
 throughout the country. Places of worship are established
 freely. No restrictions are placed on numbers of clergy
 trained. Links with coreligionists in other countries are
 maintained. Religious travel, including the Hajj, is
 permitted and officially supported. Missionaries and foreign
 clergy are permitted to enter Nigeria but are not encouraged.
 Nigeria's population is approximately one-half Muslim and more
 than one-third Christian, with the remainder having primary
 attachment to traditional beliefs. Interreligious marriages
 occur frequently. Polarization between Christianity and Islam
 most often occurs where a 'religious difference' is associated
 with geographic or ethnic differences. Islam and Christianity
 compete for converts and influence throughout much of the
 country, especially in the belt of states between the
 predominantly Muslim north and the predominantly Christian
 south. There were no significant incidents between the two
 communities in 1984. Despite the religious dominance of Islam
 and Christianity, non-Muslim/non-Christian minority
 communities generally live throughout the country under
 peaceful conditions.
 In 1982, the Government banned the Muslim Maitatsine sect
 after charging that the movement violated Nigeria's criminal
 laws. In February 1984, the Government used police and the
 army to quell a disturbance by the Maitatsine sect in Yola.
 The governments of the northern states have sought to restrict
 or license self-styled Muslim teachers or itinerant preachers
 who were believed to be propagating heterodox Islamic
 doctrines or practices. This is the only publicized case of
 the proscribing of a religious sect in Nigeria, but there are
 constitutional prohibitions against "secret societies,* some
 of which have had traditional religious overtones.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Constitution entitles Nigerian citizens 'to move freely
 throughout Nigeria and to reside in any part thereof.* The
 
 
 249
 NIGERIA
 same provision states that 'no citizen of Nigeria shall be
 expelled from Nigeria or refused entry thereto or exit
 therefrom.* In general, these provisions have been observed.
 However, in 1984, several former office holders and
 politicians were restricted to their home states during
 investigations into their assets and activities. Some of the
 persons detained and subsequently released are still not
 permitted to leave Nigeria and must report twice a month to
 the Nigerian Security Organization and once a month to an
 assets investigation panel. Police checks on streets and
 highways hinder but do not block travel. The Government has
 succeeded in reducing the frequency of bribes being demanded
 by policemen at internal check points.
 The ease of foreign travel has been affected by stringent
 Government restrictions on the amount of Nigerian currency
 that may be converted for use outside the country and by the
 Government's policy of issuing new passports only to students
 or to persons going abroad for official business or emergency
 medical treatment. However, Nigerians continue to travel in
 large numbers, and many thousands are studying abroad. Exit
 visas are not required to leave the country.
 No known penalties have been levied on Nigerians who have
 emigrated, settled abroad, or acquired another nationality.
 However, naturalization in another country is automatically
 expatriating under the provisions of the Constitution.
 Nigerian law and practice permit temporary refuge and asylum
 in Nigeria for political refugees from other countries.
 Nigeria has granted temporary settlement to some and
 assimilated others. Nigeria supports and cooperates with the
 work of the local office of the United Nations High
 Commissioner for Refugees. However, it has, at times,
 periodically deported illegal immigrants to their countries of
 origin.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Nigeria is ruled by a military group which seized power on
 December 31, 1983, and established the Federal Military
 Government. The Government suspended constitutional
 provisions concerning elected government and banned all
 political parties.   Leaders of the Government have said they
 consider military rule temporary, but believe it is too early
 to consider returning to civilian rule. The leaders of the
 Government, who are primarily officers of the military and
 police forces, are not limited to one ethnic, religious, or
 geographic group. There are no women in the federal ruling
 bodies. There are, however, women commissioners--heads of
 executive departments--in some state governments. The civil
 service, in which women are a minority, remains in existence.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Although the military rulers have abolished democratic
 government, Nigeria continues to be a relatively open
 society. Nonetheless, it has conducted many of its trials
 before military tribunals in camera. Amnesty International
 reported in July that it had repeatedly requested a visa for
 an observer of the tribunals, but had received no response
 
 
 250
 NIGERIA
 from the Nigerian Government. Amnesty International also
 reported it had appealed to the Nigerian authorities for the
 immediate and unconditional release of individuals it had
 identified as "prisoners of conscience.'
 Within Nigerian society, a Human Rights Committee of the
 Nigerian Bar Association specifically concerns itself with
 monitoring the domestic situation. The Nigerian Bar
 Association has spoken out against the composition of some of
 the Government's military tribunals and has recommended that
 lawyers boycott them. The Government has not taken any action
 against the Association for this stand. As a measure of the
 Government's tolerance of such criticism, it accepted an
 invitation to address a Nigerian Bar Association conference to
 explain and defend its actions. Freedom House rates Nigeria
 .not free.'
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 During the past year, Nigerians have had to adjust to reduced
 petroleum revenues, steep inflation, and a decline in economic
 activity. The most visible economic hardship in Nigeria is
 found in the urban slums; Nigeria is experiencing the classic
 developing country syndrome of rural-urban migration.
 Particularly affected has been the capital, Lagos, where the
 inadequate facilities for water, electricity, housing, and
 other services have been overwhelmed. Poor urban dwellers
 face high unemployment, squalid living conditions, rising
 costs, and serious crime. Although detailed statistics are
 not available on unemployment, thousands of workers in the
 public and private sectors have been laid off and many schools
 have closed. Some unemployed are beginning to return to their
 villages to resume farming.
 The World Bank estimated Nigeria's population in 1984 to be 88
 million. An estimate of 100 million is widely accepted in
 Nigeria. According to World Bank figures for 1984, Nigeria's
 rate of population growth is 3.4 percent, life expectancy at
 birth is 50.5 years, and infant mortality is 131.7 per 1,000
 live births (a figure considered low by many rural medical
 workers and some international organizations). According to
 the World Bank, the primary school enrollment ratio in 1979
 was 87.3 percent, more than double the figure of a decade
 earlier. Adult literacy was estimated by the World Bank in
 1980 at 34 percent. There is virtually no starvation in
 Nigeria. Although a poor 1983 harvest affected food supplies
 into 1984 and economic difficulties created periodic shortages
 of imported foodstuffs, the people generally appear to have
 been adequately fed. According to the World Bank, the average
 Nigerian in 1977 received 97.8 percent of the daily
 nutritional requirements. Nevertheless, as in most developing
 countries where statistics are uncertain, the possibility of
 malnutrition cannot be dismissed. The World Bank in 1982
 estimated per capita Gross National Product (GNP) in current
 dollars at $863. This figure has probably declined in the
 last two years. The per capita GNP figure can also be
 misleading, as oil exports account for most of the country's
 revenue, and a large part of the rural population is only
 marginally involved in Nigeria's cash economy.
 The Federal Military Government has explicitly repudiated the
 former government's educational policies, stating that an
 excessive portion of Nigeria's resources had been devoted to
 education at the expense of other development goals. The
 
 
 251
 NIGERIA
 policy of rapid expansion of educational facilities has been
 reversed. The 21 federal universities have been reduced to
 16, and all private universities have been closed. Plans for
 additional state universities have been dropped. The number
 of polytechnical colleges has been reduced, and numerous
 secondary and primary schools have been closed or merged. The
 commitment to universal free education has been modified, with
 almost all states imposing some fees on secondary students.
 Federal subsidies for room and board have been abolished,
 resulting in cost increases of 300 to 500 percent for all
 students.
 The status of women in Nigeria involves a complex of economic,
 legal, and social factors. Women are regarded as inferior to
 men in virtually all fields. Discrimination in employment is
 common. Benefits and services-- travel allowances for
 dependents, medical benefits and housing allowances, for
 example--are sometimes denied to women employees. There is no
 legal recourse to this discrimination because the principle of
 equal treatment is not enshrined in Nigerian law.
 Nevertheless, women are neither powerless nor without
 representation in government, business, the media, and
 education. Women have economic power and exert influence
 either through women's councils or through their family
 connections. Women in southern Nigeria are the principal
 managers of the market economy in the villages. Women have
 their greatest impact on society in education, culture, and
 youth affairs. Women faculty members are present in many
 university departments, and women fill many mid-level
 positions in federal and state ministries of education. There
 has been a dramatic increase in the number of women with
 university degrees and in the number who have become
 professionals, including teachers, lawyers, doctors, judges,
 senior civil servants, media figures, and business
 executives. There had not, however, been a commensurate
 increase in their presentation in the political field before
 the advent of military rule.
 Women are subject to a number of discriminatory legal
 provisions which vary from state to state. Although a woman
 keeps and controls her own wealth after marriage, her husband
 is still head of the household. Husbands can, for example,
 prevent their wives from obtaining employment or passports in
 many states. A woman may be arrested for leaving her
 husband. Fathers have superior legal authority over
 children. For example, a woman cannot take her child out of
 the country without the father's consent, but a father does
 not require the consent of the mother. In many states, a
 widow is prohibited from inheriting her husband's property,
 which in the absence of children usually reverts to the
 husband's family. Property acquired jointly may be taken from
 the wife and passed to their children or the husband's
 family. Husbands are not legally responsible for wives' debts.
