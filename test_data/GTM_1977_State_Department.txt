 GUATEMALA
 The high level of personal and political violence
 which afflicted Guatemala from 1966 to mid-1974 haa
 been reduced markedly during the "Laugerud administration
 (1974-78). The latter. is the first in recent Guatemalan
 history to have gone more than three-fourths of its
 term without imposition of a state. of siege.
 Kidnapping and assassination of government officials
 by leftist terrorists continue, however, as do politi-
 cally motivated murders, by rightist and leftist groups.
 Despite general restraint on the part of the Government
 in its response, violations--of human rights sometimes
 still occur, particularly in the rural guerrilla
 areas.
 Political violence traditionally increases during
 presidential electoral periods, and this trend was
 noted to some extent in 'the litter months of 1977
 (elections are scheduled for March 1978). President
 Laugerud has called 'in the leaders of the political
 parties to exhort them to discourage partisan
 violence-during the campaign. His efforts may have
 helped to liit such violence.
 The Government of Guatemala is now in the process"
 of ratifying the Inter-American Convention on Human
 Rights and has supported creation of the office
 of UN High Commissioner. for Human Rights..
 1. Respect for the Integrity of thd Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture of alleged subversives has occurred with
 frequency in Guatemalan history. During 1966-72,
 torture, summary executions, and death-squad activities
 were characteristic of bloody clashes between security
 forces and leftist guerrillas.
 After the substantial defeat of the insurgent movement
 in the early 1970's, and particularly since the Laugerud
 administration has taken office, such incidents have
 decreased and there have been few recent allegations of
 torture'.  The Amnesty International Remort 1977 acknowl-
 edged a "considerable drop in urban areas in the political
 violence of the death squads - torture, killings and simple
 
 (165)
 
 
 166
 'disappearances' after abduction by governmental or
 para-governmental armed groups - since January 1977."
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 Such treatment and punishment are legally prohibited.
 But abuses occur, particularly during interrogations
 of those suspected of subversive activity or actual
 terrorism. The Amnesty International Report. of 1977
 asserts that 'the poor rural population continues" to
 suffer abuse both from official and semi-official armed
 groups." Reports of such abuses have declined in recent
 years. Acts of political and personal violence
 attributed to both private parties and local officials
 still occur in rural areas and often provoke little
 response from the central government.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Arrest and short-term detention , allegedly withoutidue
 process, occurred during '1977:-in connection with-persons
 suspected of subversive, activities, but to a. lesser extent
 than in most prior years. There were no reported cases
 of lengthy detention without indictment or trial in 1977.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Most of those accused of subversion have been released
 after short periods-of detention and interrogation. Those
 brought to trial, like persons accused of non-political
 crimes, generally receive fair. public trials. However,
 in guerrilla areas, there continue to be reports of
 disappearances.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Invasions of the home have occurred particularly in rural
 areas in the course of anti-terrorist sweeps by security
 forces.
 2. Govermental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of
 Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and
 Education
 Significant gains in living standards and middle class
 
 
 167
 expansion have been made over the last 20 years, parti-
 cularly among urban industrial and service workers. But
 severe social and economic inequalities still exist.
 Tax collections as a percentage of the GNP are
 the second lowest in the Hemisphere. Proximity
 to Guatemala City or to seats of local government largely
 determines availability of the most important social
 services.
 The Government is attempting- to increase investments in
 rural areas, which are predominantly very poor,
 and has solicited loans from international donors
 for expansion of rural health services, primary
 and secondary education facilities, agricultural
 credit, and support of cooperatives. The Government's
 handling of problems created by the 1976 earthquake
 has-been--a-major success. With the assistance of
 the US and other donor countries, the Guatemalan -
 Government has worked effectively to restore shelter
 and basic social- services-to the hardest-hit highland
 areas.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion, and
 Assembly
 There is freedom of speech, press, and religion.
 Newspapers criticize government officials and policies.
 Large political demonstrations and parades are
 regulated by the Ministry of Interior, but this is
 not known to have interfered with freedom of assembly.
 Labor unions are free under law to organize, but there-
 are few strong, independent unions.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is no practice of restricting international or
 national travel, or emigration, except that travel to
 and from some rural guerrilla areas has at times
 been restricted.

 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 For the past two decades Guatemalan politics have been
 dominated by the military within a constitutional
 framework providing for regular elections and civilian
 control below the top level. Some opposition parties
 are permitted to function. The 1974 election pro-
 cess was tainted by accusations of fraud. The incumbent
 president has publicly promised a fair election
 in March 1978. Candidates for Congress and president'
 may only be presented by duly inscribed political
 parties (of which there are four at present), and
 inscription of political parties has traditionally
 been an arduous and protracted process. The electoral
 registry is headed by a government appointee.
 Despite a long waiting list, no new parties have been
 inscribed in recent years. The Communist Party is
 illegal.
 4. Government Attitude.and Record Regarding.InternationaL-_
 and Non-Governmental Investigatiol of Alleged
 Violations of Human Rights
 No reports have been received of any requests made
 to the Government of Guatemala for human rights in-
 vestigations by external groups. The American
 Convention on Human Rights has gone to the Guatemalan
 Congress for ratification. The Guatemalan Government
 has -supported the creation of a post of UN High
 Commissioner for Human Rights.
