 EQUATORIAL GUINEA
 Equatorial Guinea is nominally a multiparty constitutional republic, but in reality
 power is exercised by President Teodoro Obiang Nguema through the small
 Mongomo clan of the majority Fang ethnic group, which has ruled since the coun-
 try's independence in 1968. President Obiang, who has ruled since seizing power in
 a military coup d'etat in 1979, was elected to a 7-year term in February 1996 in
 elections that were marred by extensive fraud and intimidation. The President's
 Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea (PDGE) controls the judiciary and the legis-
 lature, the latter also through fraudulent elections. The judiciary is not independ-
 ent.
 President Obiang exercises control over the police and security forces through the
 Minister of the Interior, who serves as president of the National Electoral Board as
 well. The security forces committed numerous, serious human rights abuses.
 The majority of the population of approximately 470,000 live by subsistence agri-
 culture, supplemented by hunting and fishing. Barter is a major aspect of the econ-
 omy, and the small monetary sector is based on exports of petroleum, cocoa, and
 timber. Most foreign economic assistance has-been suspended due to the lack of eco-
 nomic reform and the Government's repeated violations of human rights. Substan-
 tial oil deposits were discovered in 1995, and exploitation began in 1996. However,
 the investment and 'other use of oil revenues remains a closed process, despite re-
 peated calls from financial institutions and citizens for financial openness. The
 country's economic potential continues to be undermined by poor fiscal management
 and a lack of transparency in public finance. A 1997 national economic conference
 held in Bata allowed public debate on the use of oil revenues for the first-time. How-
 ever, since the conference, there has been little evidence that the country's oil
 wealth is being used for the public good.
 The Government's human rights record remained poor. Serious and systematic
 human rights abuses continued and the security forces committed many serious
 abuses. Citizens continued not to have the right to change their government. There
 were reports of extrajudicial killings, both of prisoners in detention and 6f individ-
 uals in rural areas; some security force members reportedly were tried for these ac-
 tions. Other principal abuses by the security forces included: Torture; physical abuse
 of prisoners; beating and mutilation of detainees; arbitrary arrest and detention; ex-
 tortion from prisoners; searches without warrants, looting of private homes and the
 raping of female residents; and confiscation of property without due process. Secu-
 rity force abuses committed following armed attacks on army and police installa-
 tions on the island of Bioko on January 21 by members of a group seeking political
 autonomy for that island were particularly egregious. Officials claimed to have
 taken action against security force members suspected of human rights abuses.
 However,- senior members of the Government allegedly involved in the systematic
 torture of detainees have not been prosecuted. Prison conditions remained life
 threatening. Prisoners often were subjected to torture in order to extract confes-
 sions. The judicial system continued not to ensure due process and remained subject
 to executive influence. The Government severely restricted freedom of speech and
 of the press. It continued to restrict the right of assembly, and did not always re-
 spect the right of association. The Government continued to limit freedom of religion
 and freedom of movement. The Government engaged in the illegal capture and in-
 voluntary repatriation of its citizens living abroad. Discrimination and violence
 against women and foreigners remained serious problems. Discrimination against
 minorities, particularly the Bubi ethnic group on the island of Bioko, worsened in
 the wake of the January 21 revolt by Bioko separatists in which between six and
 nine persons, including some governiment officials, were killed. Security forces re-
 portedly broke into Bubi houses following the coup attempt, raped Bubi women, and
 looted Bubi homes. In some instances, security forces threw the belongings of Bubis
 into the streets and encouraged passersby to help themselves to the property. The
 Government continued to restrict labor rights; no labor unions exist, and strikes are
 prohibited by law. Abuse of workers' rights was particularly serious in the oil indus-
 try.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were reports of extrajudicial
 killings. Five persons allegedly involved in the January 21 revolt died while in de-
 tention. According to one detainee, the prisoners were beaten to death by security
 forces under the direction ofArmengol Ondo Nguema, the head of presidential secu-
 rity (see Section 1.e.). There were reports of an unknown number of summary execu-
 tions near the Bioko village of Belebu Belacha following the January 21 revolt In-
 habitants of the island said that security forces buried the dead in the jungle prior
 to the arrival in March of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights
 for Equatorial Guinea. Foreign journalists who attempted to confirm the violence
 were prevented rom visiting the affected areas by the Government and ultimately
 were expelled from the country (see Section 2.a.). One of the acknowledged leaders
 of the January 21 incident, Martin Puye, died in prison in July. The Government
 claimed that Puye died of hepatitis. However, credible reports before his death indi-
 cated that he had been beaten badly while in detention. en Puye's attorney, Jose
 Olo, criticized Puye's death, he was sentenced to 5 months in jail and a substantial
 fine for slandering members of the Government. Security forces allegedly beat and
 killed a demonstrator (see Section 1.c.).
 The Government did not prosecute those responsible for extrajudicial killings in
 prior years.
 b. Disappearance.-Accrding to a prisoner who had been arrested and tortured
 by government security forces, at least 10 individuals disappeared during police
 raids following the January 21 incident. However, this number remains unconfirmed
 and may include some persons who fled the island.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Fundamental Law (constitution) mandates respect for the liberty and dignity
 of persons, but does not specifically prohibit torture or cruel or inhuman punish-
 ment, and security forces tortured, beat, abused and mutilated prisoners. The level
 of these abuses is serious and, in the wake of the January 21 revolt, increased over
 the previous year, with the methods of torture becoming increasingly gruesome. Se-
 curity forces cut and mutilated the ears of dozens of prisoners arrested following the
 revolt while they were in detention. When they appeared before a summary military
 court, one member of the Government explained that the unsightly mutilations were
 the result of birth defects. A credible source claimed that prisoners arrested for al-
 leged involvement in the January 21 incident were subject to particular abuse. Po-
 lice reportedly urinated on prisoners, kicked them in the ribs, sliced their ears with
 knives, and smeared oil over their naked bodies in order to attract stinging ants.
 The President and senior government officials acknowledged that the security forces
 had committed excesses, but attributed them to what were allegedly rogue elements.
 However, according to credible reports, this torture was approved at the highest lev-
 els of the Government and was directed by the chief of presidential security,
 Armengol Ondo Ngema, who is also President Obiang's brother. Ondo Ngema al-
 legedly taunted prisoners by describing the suffering that they were about to en-
 dure.
 Following the January 21 attacks, the Prime Minister organized a march through
 Malabo to demonstrate Bubi support for the Government. During the demonstra-
 tion, security forces reportedly beat many marchers and allegedly killed one.
 Police routinely stp members of the opposition at roadblocks and subject them
 to searches and extortion (see Section 2.d.). Local authorities also singled out for-
 eigners from neighboring countries for harassment, intimidation, and extortion. In
 late January, when a rumor spread that Nigerian citizens had taken part in the
 January 21 revolt, security forces targeted Nigerians living in Malabo (see Section
 5). Soldiers and police robbed merchants from Nigeria of their wares and forced
 many to pay sizable fines at gunpoint. Those who hesitated reportedly were beaten.
 Several security officials reportedly were detained for abuses committed against
 Bubis during reprisals for the January 21 revolt, but subsequently were released.
 Following the January 21 revolt, vigilantes from the dominant Fang ethnic group
 raped women who were members of ethnic minorities on Bioko in the womens
 homes (see Section 1.f.). The Government initially did little to prevent such abuses.
 Prison conditions are primitive and life threatening. Rations are inadequate, and
 sanitary conditions practically nonexistent. Prisoners arrested following the January
 21 revolt reported being fed bread and water only once every 2 days. Authorities
 prohibited family and friends of prisoners from bringing them food from outside, as
 is the custom. Some 60 prisoners allegedly were crowded into a single cell without
 toilet facilities. Once every 3 or 4 days the prisoners were ordered outside in order
 to clean the cell. Female prisoners are housed separately from men. Women arrested
 
 
 following the January 21 incident allegedly were stripped and beaten by prison
 guards. They then reportedly were thrown to the ground in full view of male pris-
 oners and made to swim and crawl through mud. Guards reportedly ordered female
 prisoners to spread their legs and -then beat their naked inner thighs with sticks.
 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) reportedly -has made rec-
 ommendations about prison conditions to the Government, which the Government
 declined to releasepublicly. Prison conditions reportedly improved somewhat during
 the year;- cement floors reportedly replaced dirt floors and clean water reportedly
 was made available to prisoners in at least some prison facilities. -However, the
 ICRC reportedly did not have unrestricted access to prisons and detention centers.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-There are nominal legal procedural safe-
 guards regarding detention, the requirement for search warrants, and other proce-
 dural safeguards of citizens' rights; however, these safeguards are ignored system-
 atically by security forces.
 Police routinely hold prisoners in incommunicado detention. Foreigners from
 neighboring countries sometimes -are targeted for arbitrary mistreatment and ran-
 dom arrest. These include visitors from Nigeria, Ghana, Togo, and Benin. Members
 of the security forces often resorted to these crimes in order to extort money prior
 to national holidays.
 Three Spanish doctors who sought to establish a temporary medical assistance
 mission in a yural area were arrested upon entering the country on August 28 and
 deported a few days later.
 Political detentions seldom lasted more than a few months.-At year's end, there
 were no known long-term political detainees; there, were also none, the previous
 year. Following the January 21 revolt, some 500 ethnic Bubis reportedly were ar-
 rested and interrogated. However,, reliable information on the number and identities
 of detainees was not readily available.
 During the year, the Government arrested political activists and detained them
 without charge for periods of several months, during which officials at times interro-
 gated, beat, and tortured them. In April security forces reportedly arrested 64 mem-
 bers of the three largest opposition parties in Rio Muni, the mainland part of the
 country (also see Section 1.f.). Of those arrested, 30 were members of the Conver-
 gence for Social Democracy Party (CPDS), 19 of the Popular Union (UP), and 15 of
 the banned Party of Progress (PP). In October security forces arrested several dozen
 activists of the CPDS, according to the party's secretary general. The Government
 uses the psychological effects of arrest, along with the fear of future beating, to in-
 timidate opposition party members. In April security forces reportedly arrested op-
 position party members for listening to Spanish government radio broadcasts (see
 Section 2.a.). None of the opposition party activists arrested in April and October
 was believed still to be in detention at year's end. Security forces also arrested a
 priest and broke up a religious revival (see Section 2.c.).
 In April Equatoguinean security forces involuntarily repatriated from Nigeria
 threepersons suspected of involvement in the January 21 revolt, and detained them
 without trial for 3 months (see Section 2.d.).
 At various times during the year, government security forces detained four em-
 ployees of a foreign oil company for periods ranging from a few days to several
 months. The grounds for their detentions included importation of explosives for use
 in offshore oil operations, attempted use of the oil company's radio frequency by in-
 surgents in January, and the oil company's sponsorship of the visit of the Spanish
 doctors whom the Government arrested and deported.
 The Government does not force its citizens into exile, but some persons-who were
 able to travel abroad have sought political asylum.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is not independent; judges serve at
 the pleasure of the President and are appointed, transferred, and dismissed for po-
 litical reasons. Corruption is widespread.
 The court system is composed of lower provincial courts, two appeals courts, and
 a Supreme Court. The President appoints members of the Supreme Court, who re-
 port to him. There are also traditional courts in the countryside, in which tribal el-
 ders adjudicate civil claims and minor criminal matters.
 The Fundamental Law and laws passed by the Chamber of Deputies provide for
 legal representation and the right to appeal. In practice authorities often do not re-
 spect these provisions. Civil cases rarely come to public trial. Cases involving na-
 tional security are tried by a nilitary tribunal.
 The Government held a number of political prisoners. Between May 25 and 29,
 the Government conducted a public trial before a military tribunal in a Malabo the-
 ater. The tribunal tried 116 persons allegedly involved in the January 21 attacks
 on Bioko island. The Government charged the defendants with terrorism, undermin-
 ing state security, and illegal possession of weapons. Many defendents claimed that
 
 
 the Government had obtained confessions from them by torture. However, the Presi-
 dent of the military tribunal refused to allow defense lawyers to raise the question
 of torture, although a number of defendants bore unmistakable marks of recent
 physical abuse. Observers at the trials reported seeing defendants with fractured
 bones in their feet or hands; some defendants were missing parts of their ears,
 which appeared to have been cut off recently. Although observers noted that some
 of those detained may have been guilty of the offenses with which they were
 charged, the conduct of the trials drew universal criticism. The judges were mem-
 bers of the dominant Fang tribe, while nearly all the defendants were Bubis. The
 qualifications of the judges were questionable, since none was known to have legal
 training. The military tribunal was never seen in deliberation, and a number of de-
 fendants on trial for their lives were not allowed to testify. However, the defendants
 were represented by independent attorneys who criticized the Government publicly
 for the torture of their clients, and demanded restitution for the victims of the Gov-
 ernment's excesses. The tribunal found 63 persons guilty on at least one charge, but
 acquitted 53 of all charges. It sentenced 15 convicted defendants to death, and sen-
 tenced the 48 others to terms ranging from 6 to 26 years in prison. The 15 con-
 demned to death were the only defendants absent from the court when the sen-
 tences were announced. There were reports that their graves already had been dug,
 and a firing squad assembled, on a beach near the prison where they were held at
 that time. However, they were not executed, and President Obiang later commuted
 their sentences to life imprisonment, following pleas for clemency from foreign gov-
 ernments and non-governmental organizations (NGO's).
 In July two members of the ruling Mongomo clan and of the banned Democratic
 Republican Forces (FDR) Party, former Education 'Minister Felipe Ondo and former
 Planning Minister Guillermo Nguema, were convicted of libeling the State and sen-
 tenced to 30 months' imprisonment. In November 1997 security forces had repatri-
 ated them forcibly from Gabon with the consent and complicity of the Gabonese
 Government (see Section 2.d.). The basis of the libel charge was a letter that the
 two had circulated after being repatriated from Gabon, in which they stated that
 they expected to be arrested soon. Shortly thereafter, in March, the security forces
 arrested them. They were charged with libeling the State, for which each was tried,
 convicted and sentenced to 30 months' imprisonment and fines equivalent to
 $45,000.
 At year's end there were three known political prisoners: Felipe Ondo, Guillermo
 Nguema, and Jose Olo (see Section L.a.).
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Government infringes on these rights. The Government does not enforce the law re-
 quiring judicial warrants for searches. Security forces regularly search homes and
 arrest occupants, and generally do so without warrants.
 Following the January 21 revolt, soldiers in Malabo forcibly entered Bubi homes,
 threw the belongings of the residents into the streets, and invited the populace to
 help themselves to these goods. Soldiers reportedly also looted Bubi-owned stalls in
 the marketplace and forcibly prevented Bubi farmers from leaving town to work
 their fields. The Government initially did little to prevent gangs of Fang vigilantes
 who roamed the streets at night from breaking into Bubi homes. Credible reports
 indicated that Fang vigilantes routinely looted homes and raped female residents.
 On at least one occasion the Government attempted to force opposition members
 to join the ruling party, the PDGE. In April approximately 64 members of the oppo-
 sition reportedly were arrested in Rio Muni, after refusing the join the PDGE (see
 Section 1.d.). The arrests appeared to be a coordinated government campaign spread
 over a wide area and designed to intimidate the opposition and to dissuade voters
 from registering as members of opposition parties.
 For lawyers, government employees, and some others, PDGE party membership
 is necessary for employment and promotion. Even in the private sector, many citi-
 zens claim that party membership is necessary in order to be hired. The party ban-
 ner is displayed prominently with the national flag in government offices, and many
 officials wear PDGE lapel pins.
 The abuses associated with the Malabo urban renewal program in 1997 reportedly
 did not continue during the year.
 There reportedly is surveillance of members of the opposition parties and foreign
 diplomats.
 Credible sources state that citizens living in rural areas are hesitant to associate
 with, or even be seen with foreigners, due to the fear of repercussions from govern-
 ment authorities.
 
 
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and 'Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, but the Government severely restricts these- rights in practice.
 Journalists practice self-censorship.
 During the year, three persons were sentenced to prison as a result of the Govern-
 ment's intolerance of free speech. Former Education Minister Felipe Ondo and
 former Planning Minister Guillermo Nguema were convicted of libeling the State
 and sentenced to 30 months' imprisonment for circulating a letter predicting their
 imminent arrest (see Sections I.e. and 2.d.). Attorney Jose Olo was jailed for de-
 nouncing the death of his client in prison after severe beatings (see Section l.a.).
 The Government allows mild criticism of infrastructure, public institutions, and
 government mismanagement and has permitted some increased criticism of minor
 administrative decisions. However, the Government permits no criticism of the
 President or the security forces. All journalists must be registered with the Ministry
 of Information. According to press sources, there are five or six independent report-
 ers registered with the Ministry of Information. Between 30 and 40 reporters em-
 ployed by the official party or government- publications also are registered. Visiting
 foreign reporters must be accompanied by guides from the Ministry of Information.
 In May the Government expelled eight Spanish journalists whom it previously
 had invited to attend the public trials of defendants accused of instigating the Janu-
 ary 21 violence. Prior to the trial, the Government allegedly had told the journalists
 that they were not to menti ththe President in their reports on the proceedings, and
 that they were not to report on anything except the trials. According to the Govern-
 ment, the journalists were expelled when they failed to abide by this agreement.
 The Government also accused the journalists of lying about the extent of torture
 that security forces had inflicted on the prisoners. Some had reported the visible
 mutilation of the defendants ears. However, credible sources claimed that the jour-
 nalists were expelled when several showed an interest in visiting the sites of the
 violence and interviewing Bubi villagers who allegedly had suffered at the hands of
 security-forces.
 Only one newspaper is published regularly: La Gaceta, a Malabo-based publica-
 tion with connections to the government, is published monthly. Human interest sto-
 ries dominate its domestic news coverage.
 The current press law, enacted in 1992, reportedly is based on Spain's 1967 Fran-
 co-era press law, and authorizes government censorhip of all publications. The Min-
 istry of Information sometimes requires publishers to submit copy for approval prior
 to publication. All local publications exercise self-censorship, and are subject to prior
 restraint. Few foreign publications are available for sale, and security forces report-
 edly peruse the contents of publications from Spain and confiscate literature critical
 of the Government.
 Radio is the most important medium of mass communication. The Government
 continued effectively to monopolize domestic radio broacasting. The Government
 owns and operates Radio Malabo. During the year the Government reportedly per-
 mitted the establishment of the country's first private domestic radio station, an FM
 station called Radio Asonga; however, that station reportedly is owned by Forestry
 Minister Theodoro Obiang Nguema Mbazogo, the son of the President. The Govern-
 ment has not granted other applications to operate private radio stations, including
 one application from an evangelical group that has been pending for 2 years.
 All domestic television stations are government-controlled and broadcast only a
 few hours per day. Foreign cable television is available, and offers Cable News Net-
 work, French news, movies, and cartoons, but few citizens can afford access to it.
 The Government generally withholds access to domestic broadcasting from pro-
 democracy opposition parties, and rarely refers to what it calls the "radical" opposi-
 tion in anything but negative terms when broadcasting the news.
 Radio Exterior, the international short-wave radio service of the Government of
 Spain, which ruled Bioko and Rio Muni until 1968, often broadcasts news about the
 country and interviews with opposition politicians. Its editorials, like those of the
 private Spanish media, are often highly critical of the Government. In 1997 the Gov-
 ernment accused Radio Exterior of "inciting armed rebellion" in the country and
 warned that the Government "cannot accept responsibility for anything that might
 happen to the radio station following these incitements." In April security forces re-
 portedly arrested several opposition CPDS party members in the mainland town of
 Micomeseng for listening to Radio Exterior. In July the Government asked the Gov-
 ernment of Spain to halt Radio Exterior broadcasts "that may provoke troubles."
 There are no known domestic Internet service providers, although Internet access
 is reportedly available through service providers in other countries at a high cost.
 
 
 There are no institutions of higher learning, although the Government has con-
 structed several buildings, and has sent contingents of professors overseas for train-
 i 91 Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Fundamental Law pro-
 vides for the right of assembly; however, the Government restricts this right in prac-
 tice. Government authorization must be obtained for meetings of more than 10 per-
 sons in private homes for discussions that the regime considers political. Although
 the Government formally has abolished permit requirements for party meetings
 within party buildings, in practice opposition parties must inform authorities in
 order to hold gatherings of any kind, regardless of location.
 Gatherings in public places, even small gatherings, generally are observed by se-
 curity forces. The Government requires notification for public events, and routinely
 denies permission to meet, effectively restricting the right of assembly. Security
 forces broke up a religious revival in January (see Section 2.c.).
 The Fundamental Law provides for the right of association; however, the Govern-
 ment does not always respect this right in practice. Police routinely and systemati-
 cally harass and jail members of opposition parties. Opposition party members com-
 plained of disruption of meetings and roadblocks at which they are forced to pay
 soldiers the equivalent of $30 in order to proceed.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Fundamental Law provides for freedom of religion,
 but the Government limited this right in practice. There is no state religion, and
 the Government does not discriminate against any faith. However, a religious orga-
 nization must be recognized formally by the Ministry of Justice and Religion before
 its religious activities are allowed. The Government continued to restrict the free-
 dom of expression of the clergy, particularly regarding open criticism of the regime.
 The Government restricted the activities of the Catholic Church, of which most
 citizens are at least nominally members. In February security forces arrested Father
 Eduardo Losoha Belope, who is a Bubi, a priest, and the president of the Malabo
 chapter of the Catholic NGO, Caritas, in connection with the January 21 revolt. In
 July the Archbishop of Malabo, Laureano Ekua Obama, stated publicly that the
 Government now requires Catholic priests to obtain government permission before
 celebrating mass, and commented that the Government does this because the
 Church repeatedly has denounced human rights violations, social injustice, and cor-
 ruption in the country. The Archbishop also stated that government harassment
 made it very difficult to be a Catholic priest in the country.
 The Government relaxed some restrictions on religious activities by foreign mis-
 sionaries in 1996. Missionaries in Bat and Malabo reported little government inter-
 ference in their work. However, in January security forces broke up a religious re-
 vival in Bats, the largest town on the mainiand, by a popular European evangelist,
 and expelled him from the country. According to several sources, the governor of
 Bat and the poice chief expelled the evangelist and his group the following day
 in order to take possession of the evangelist's vehicles, sound system, and- other
 equipment. Diplomatic intervention by a number of foreign governments all&ed the
 evangelist to depart with his vehicles.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-In principle, freedom of movement and travel throughout the country
 are provided for by law; however, the Government limits these rights in practice.
 Local police routinely demand bribes from occupants of cars, taxis, and other vehi-
 cles traveling outside the capital. Opposition activists complain of harassment at
 roadblocks. Police routinely stop members of the opposition at roadblocks, subject
 them to searches, and extort money from them. Members of the Bubi ethnic group
 on the island of Bioko are unable to move about freely, according to credible sources.
 Roadblocks throughout the island prevent Bubis from traveling between villages.
 All citizens are required to have permission to travel abroad, although members
 of opposition parties regularly are denied this permission and sometimes are inter-
 rogated or detained upon their return.
 Government officials attempt to control the movements of opposition party mem-
 bers by requiring exit visas or confiscating passports. Those who depart Malabo
 without an exit visa must travel by canoe across 40 miles of open ocean to reach
 mainland Africa, then face possible immigration charges upon their return. How-
 ever, several prominent members of opposition parties were able to travel abroad
 without hindrance.
 During recent years, an average one or two foreigners a year, from Mauritania,
 Nigeria or the Congo, have requested refugee or asylum status in the country. The
 Government provides first asylum and generally grants asylum requests, although
 security forces reportedly have harassed asylum seekers, few of whom have re-
 mained long in the country. There were no reports of the forced return of any for-
 eigners to a country where they feared persecution.
 
 
 In late 1997, during a visit by President Obiang to Gabon, Gabonese authorities
 arrested two Equatoguinean citizens, former Education Minister Felipe Ondo and
 former  Planning  Minister   Guillermo  Nguema, and    surrendered   them  to
 Equatoguinean security forces who involuntarily repatriated them. Both were reg-
 istered with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) as refugees. After
 returning them to Malabo, the Government charged them with libeling the State,
 for which they were convicted, fined, and imprisoned (see Section I.e.).
 The Government also attempted to neutralize opposition groups outside its bor-
 ders by kidnaping its citizens living in other countries.
 In April three Bubi students studying in Calabar, Nigeria were abducted by the
 Equatoguinean consul general and flown back to Malabo surreptitiously aboard an
 Equatoguinean government-chartered aircraft. This action was approved by Presi-
 dent Obiang. Security forces detained them for several months on suspicion of plan-
 ning violence against the State, then released them but made no effort to transport
 them back to Calabar or make restitution in any other way.
 The Government also reportedly attempted to repatriate surreptitiously an undis-
 closed number of citizens living in Benin.
 During the year Cameroonian newspapers revealed that since September 1997,
 Cameroonian security forces had detained--ostensibly for their own protection-12
 former officers of the Equatoguinean armed forces now in opposition to the Govern-
 ment, including former Armed Forces Commander Alfonso Mba Nsogo and UP party
 official Fabian Asumu Ondo, who were registered as refugees with the UNHCR and
 had resided in Cameroon for 4 years as political asylees. In November 1997,
 Cameroonian authorities at Douala airport arrested six Equatoguinean presidential
 security officers, including Intelligence Section Director Donato Abogo, a cousin of
 President Obiang, who were trying to enter Cameroon. Media reports have sug-
 gested that the presidential security officers had traveled to Cameroon to kidnap
 and repatriate some of the 12 military officer asylees there, whose detention was
 not yet known publicly at that time. At year's end, all 12 officers remained detained
 on a military base in Cameroon, although they enjoyed considerable freedom of
 movement.
 The Government repeatedly demanded that the Spanish Government repatriate
 Severo Moto, the former leader of the now-banned PP party, who led an attempt
 to overthrow the Government by armed force in 1997, and to whom the Government
 of Spain had granted asylum.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 nent
 The Constitution nominally provides citizens with the right to change their gov-
 ernment peacefully, but in fact there have been no free, fair, and transparent presi-
 dential elections since independence in 1968. The President exercises complete
 power as Head of State, commander of the armed forces, and leader of the govern-
 ment party, the PDGE. Leadership positions within the Government are, in general,
 restricted to the President's Mongomo clan of the Fang ethnic group and its closest
 supporters. While there is an elected Chamber of Deputies, it is not representative
 and is dominated by the Government; 68 of its 80 members belong to the PDGE.
 The Minister of the Interior also acts as president of the National Electoral Board.
 The February 1996 presidential election, in which President Obiang claimed a re-
 election victory with 98 percent of the vote, was considered openly fraudulent by
 international observers. Some opposition politicians who campaigned were beaten
 and jailed. Voting was done in the open and without secrecy, with opposition parties
 allegedly being barred from access to polling areas. There were credible reports of
 widespread arrests and violence against opposition party members before the elec-
 tions, as well as of beatings, roadblocks, stuffed ballot boxes, and the presence of
 security forces. Most opposition parties, claiming that it was futile to run amidst
 such blatant corruption, boycotted the election, and boycotted similarly flawed legis-
 lative elections in 1993 and municipal elections in 1995.
 In 1997 the Government and 13 political parties promulgated a revised national
 pact following 3 months of debate. The pact called for the creation of a multiparty
 electoral commission and an observance commission to monitor compliance with the
 agreement. The pact also stipulated an end to various political and electoral abuses
 and the extension of voting rights already nominally provided for in the Constitu-
 tion. However, the Government has not abided by most of the pact's provisions. Op-
 position activists report that the Government has made virtually no effort to imple-
 ment the pact. The Government's refusal to issue exit visas to opposition figures vio-
 lates the pact's principle of freedom of travel. The continued arrests of CPDS, PP,
 and FDR activists further undermined the Government's claims that it abides by
 
 
 137
 the pact, as did its continued restrictions on freedom of movement and the contin-
 ued lack of access to government media by the opposition.
 In February the Government enacted a new electoral law that mandates the re-
 placement of open voting by secret ballots in future elections, but prohibits coali-
 tions between political parties. This prohibition weakens the opposition by prevent-
 ing the formation of any opposition umbrella groups.
 Although the electoral law required the Government to set a date for legislative
 elections before the terms of the Chamber of Deputies expired in November, the
 Government did not set a date for such elections until December 30, when it an-
 nounced that they would be held on March 7, 1999. Although in June President
 Obiang called on citizens to "register massively" to vote, in October the Government
 reportedly removed 65,000 voters (15 percent of the country's total population) from
 the electoral register. The Secretary General of the opposition CPDS party, Placido
 Miko, publicly accused the Government of removing from the electoral register per-
 sons whom it considered unlikely to vote for ruling party candidates. The electoral
 registration was completed in December, with the approval of most but not all oppo-
 sition parties. However, the resulting voter lists were not published with the Decem-
 ber 30 decree calling the elections, as prescribed by the electoral law.
 Citizens have limited ability to choose their local governments. The State is highly
 centralized. There are subnational government entities at the regional, provincial,
 district, and municipal levels. The President appoints all officials at all but the mu-
 nicipal level, where there are elected mayors. However, municipal governments have
 little power to tax or to hire and fire their own personnel; they must rely on the
 central Government for the preponderance of their revenues, and on central govern-
 ment civil servants for their administrative staff. During the year the central gov-
 ernment reportedly gave an annual budget eqivalent to $5,000 to the municipal gov-
 ernment of Malabo, whose mayor was a member of an opposition party.
 Although there are no legal restrictions on the participation of women in politics,
 women remain seriously underrepresented in government positions. There are 6
 women in the 42-member Cabinet, and 5 in the 80-member legislature. There were
 only 2 women in the Cabinet in 1997.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no effective local human rights nongovernmental organizations. Am-
 nesty International has no permanent presence in the country. The Government
 does not recognize its reports or acknowledge their credibility.
 In August a Catholic priest, a nun, and a lay worker based in Anisoc, Rio Muni,
 all citizens of other countries, were expelled from the country after having been
 granted funds by a Western government to promote democracy and human rights
 through a series of workshops. Theproject had been approved by the Government
 and signed by Minister of Justice andReligion Ruben Maye. The expulsion appeared
 to be an attempt by the Government delegate of Anisoc to gain control of project
 funds and neutralize the projectfs impact on local villages. During the expulsion, in
 which the Minister of Justice and Religion played a leading part, the Catholic lay
 worker was separated forcibly from his Equatoguinean wife and child, and told by
 local authorities that he would never see them again. After a diplomatic appeal to
 President Obiang by the lay worker's national government, the family was reunited
 outside Equatorial Guinea.
 The U.N. Special Rapporteur on Human Rights for Equatorial Guinea visited in
 March and December and ostensibly received the Governmenfs cooperation. How-
 ever, Bioko residents alleged that, shortly before the Special Rapporteur arrived in
 March, the Government hastily buried in shallow graves in the jungle persons
 whom security forces had summarily executed after the January revolt on Bioko (see
 Section l.a.).
 The Government established a parliamentary commission on human rights ap-
 eroximately 6 years ago. However, this entity rarely has been heard from and has
 tte credibility or influence.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 While the Constitution condemns all forms of discrimination, both governmental
 and societal discrimination continue. These are reflected- in traditional constraints
 on women's education and in restricted opportunities for professional and occupa-
 tional achievement by ethnic minorities. The Government deliberately limits poten-
 tial opportunities for ethnic minorities, and intensified its repression of the Bubi mi-
 nority on Bioko during the year.
 
 
 Women.-Societal violence against women, particularly wife beating, is common.
 Public beating of wives is forbidden by government decree, but violence in the home
 generally is tolerated. The Government does not prosecute perpetrators of domestic
 violence.
 Although the Constitution provides for equal rights, women largely are confined
 by custom to traditional roles, particularly in agriculture. Polygyny, which is wide-
 spread among the Fang, contributes to women's secondary status, as does limited
 educational opportunity. On average women receive only one-fifth as much schooling
 as men.
 There is no discrimination against women with regard to inheritance and family
 laws, but there is discrimination in traditional practice. For an estimated 90 percent
 of women, including virtually all ethnic groups except the Bubi, tradition dictates
 that if a marriage is dissolved, the wife must return the dowry given her family by
 the bridegroom at the time of marriage, while the husband automatically receives
 custody of all children born after the marriage. The mother maintains custody of
 all children born prior to marriage.
 Similarly, in the Fang, Ndowe, and Bisio cultures, primogeniture is practiced, and
 as women become members of their husband's family upon marriage, they usually
 are not accorded inheritance rights. According to the law, women have the right to
 buy and sell property and goods, but in practice the male-dominated society permits
 few women access to sufficient funds to engage in more than petty trading or to pur-
 chase real property beyond a garden plot or modest home.
 Children.-There are no legislated provisions for the welfare of children. The Gov-
 ernment devotes little attention to children's rights or their welfare, and has no set
 policy in this area. Education is compulsory up to the age of 18, but the Government
 does not enforce the law.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no constitutional or legal provision for the
 physically disabled with respect to discrimination in employment or education.
 There is no legislation mandating accessibility for the disabled to buildings or gov-
 ernment services.
 NationallRaciallEthnic Minorities.-There is no legal discrimination against eth-
 nic or racial minorities, and the Government does not limit their participation overt-
 ly; however, the monopolization of political power by the President's Mongomo clan
 of the Fang ethnic group persists. In practice some members of minorities face offi-
 cial discrimination because they are not members of the Fang ethnic group, or be-
 long to a subclan other than the President's. Minorities do not face discrimination
 in inheritance, marriage, or family laws.
 Differences between the majority Fang ethnic group and the Bubi ethnic minority
 are a major source of political tension and often have erupted into violence. Bubis
 led the January 21 separatist revolt on Bioko, after which the Fang-dominated Gov-
 ernment and security forces intensified their longstanding institutionalized repres-
 sion of the Bubis and allowed Fang vigilante groups to abuse Bubi citizens with im-
 punity (see Sections 1.a., 1.c., i.e. and 1.f.). Before independence the Bubis were a
 majority of the population of the island of Bioko (then Fernando Po), which was both
 administratively distinct from and more economically developed than the larger and
 more populous mainland (then Rio Muni), where the Fang were a majority. The two
 Spanish colonies were united 9 years before independence, after which many Fang
 migrated to Bioko, where Malabo, the capital, is located. The Fang dominated the
 united independent state; during the first decade after independence misrule by
 Obiang's uncle, Macias Nguema, reduced the country's population by about one-
 third and devastated Bioko's economy.
 Differences among clans of the Fang ethnic group, in particular resentment of the
 political dominance of the Mongomo clan, are also sources of significant political ten-
 sions and occasional violence.
 Several thousand citizens of Nigeria, Ghana, and Francophone Africa continue to
 reside in the country. Most are small traders and business people. There are numer-
 ous reports of their harassment by the police (see Section I.d.).
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Although the Constitution provides for the right to
 organize unions, the Government has not passed enabling legislation. In the small
 wage economy, no labor union exists, although there are a few. cooperatives with
 limited power. The law prohibits strikes. The Labor Code contains provisions to up-
 hold worker rights, but the Government generally does not enforce em.
 It generally is acknowledged that membership in the PDGE is a prerequisite for
 hiring and promotion, both in the public and private sectors (see Section l.f.). Mem-
 bership in a rival political organization is considered grounds for dismissal from any
 
 
 rOSition, public or private. Opposition poiticians often claim to have been dismissed
 am their jobs after joining alternate political groups.
 Hiring by the oil industry, one of the country's major employers, is controlled
 largely by the Government through its agency, APEGESA. Independent sources con-
 firm that APEGESA, in screening applicants for positions, excludes those whom it
 considers unfriendly or indifferent to the PDGE. APEGESA reportedly keeps nearly
 two-thirds of employees' wages. Oil workers earning $47 (26,000 CFA Francs) per
 day reportedly receive only $16 (9,000 CFA Francs); the remainder is kept by
 APEGESA, which allegedly is managed by the Minister of Mines and Energy. In
 1997 when several employees signed a petition complaining of this treatment they
 were fired.
 The Government did not allow unions to affiliate internationally.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-There is no legislation regard-
 ing these rights or prohibiting antiunion discrimination. There is no evidence of col-
 lective bargaining by any group. Wages are set by the Government and employers
 with little or no participation by the workers. Employers must pay the minimum
 wages set by the Government, and most companies pay more than the government-
 established minimum.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law forbids forced or bonded
 labor (including that performed by children) and slavery, and there were no reports
 of these practices. Convicted felons do, within the law, perform extensive labor in
 the public sector outside prison without compensation.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The legal
 minimum age for employment of children is 18 years; but the Ministry of Labor does
 not enforce this law. The Government also does not enforce the law that stipulates
 mandatory education up to the age of 18. Underage youth perform both family farm
 work and street vending. The Labor Code prohibits forced or bonded labor by chil-
 dren, and there were no reports that it exists (see Section 6.c.).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum monthly wage is approximately
 $44 (27,000 CFA Francs). The minimum wage does not provide a decent standard
 of living for a worker and family. The law prescribes a standard 35-hour workweek
 and a 48-hour rest period which are observed in practice in the formal economy.
 The Labor Code provides for comprehensive protection for workers from occupa-
 tional hazards; however, the Government does not enforce this in practice. Employ-
 ees who protest unhealthy or dangerous working conditions risk losing their jobs.
