 LIECHTENSTEIN
 The Principality of Liechtenstein is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary
 democracy. The reigning Prince is the Head of State- all legislation enacted by the
 popularly elected Parliament (Landtag) must have his concurrence. The Landtag
 nominates and the Prince appoints the members of the Government and of the func-
 tionally independent judiciary. The Constitution authorizes the Prince to alter crimi-
 nal sentences or paon offenders; if the offender is a member of the Government,

 sentenced for violating an official duty, the Prince can take such action only if the
 Landstag so requests.
 The Interior Ministry effectively oversees the regular and auxiliary police forces.
 There is no standing military force.
 Despite its small size and limited natural resources, Liechtenstein has developed
 during recent decades from an agrarian society into a prosperous, highly industri-
 alized, free-enterprise economy with a vital service sector. It participates in a cus-
 toms union with Switzerland, and uses the Swiss franc as its national currency. The
 citizens enjoy a very high standard of living. Unemployment was only 1.5 percent
 in 1994.
 The Constitution provides for basic human rights, and the Government respects
 these. However, domestic violence against women is a serious societal problem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Kiling.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture and cruel punishment, and there were no reports of use
 of such methods.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law provides for freedom from arbi-
 trary arrest and detention, and the authorities honor these provisions. Within 24
 hours of arrest, the police must bring the suspect before an examining magistrate,
 who must either state formal charges or order release. The law grants suspects the
 right to legal counsel of their own choosing, at no cost if the suspect is indigent.
 Release on personal recognizance or bail is granted unless the examining magistrate
 has reason to believe the person is a danger to society or will not appear for trial.
 There is no provision for exile, and it does not occur.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is independent of the executive and
 legislative branches. It has three tiers: lower court, high court, and Supreme Court.
 In addition, an Administrative Court hears appeals against government decisions.
 Also, a State Court protects the rights accorded by the Constitution, decides on con-
 flicts of jurisdiction between the law courts and the administrative authorities, and
 acts as a disciplinary court for members of the Government.
 The Constitution provides for public trials and judicial appeal, and the authorities
 respect these provisions.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for personal liberty, and for inviolability of the home, of postal
 correspondence, and of telephone conversations. No violations have been reported.
 Police need a judicial warrant to search private property.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-An independent press, effective judiciary, and
 democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and press. There
 are two newspapers, each representing the interests of one of the two major political
 parties. The only broadcasting facility is a State-owned television station, but resi-
 dents freely receive radio and television broadcasts from abroad.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association, and the the authorities do not interfere with
 these. They require permits for public meetings and demonstrations, but routinely
 grant them.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Government does not hamper the teaching or prac-
 tice of any faith. The finances of the Roman Catholic Church are integrated directly
 into the budgets of the national and local governments. Taxpayers may opt not to
 contribute to the Church, but this decision precludes membership in the Church.
 Roman Catholic or Protestant religious education is compulsory in all schools, but
 the authorities routinely grant exemptions for children whose parents so request.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens have unrestricted freedom to travel in or outside the country,
 to emigrate, and to return. The country's lack of an airport or international train
 station precludes it from being a country of first asylum. There is no asylum law;
 Parliament decides case-by-case on the few, sporadic applications. In late 1994 it
 granted preliminary work permits, valid through 1996, for a group of 18 Tibetans
 who arrived in October 1993. The Government returns rejected applicants to the
 
 
 Swiss or Austrian ently point, after authorities there provide assurances that appli-
 cants will not be forced to return to countries that may persecute them.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The monarchy is hereditary in the male line. The 25-member unicameral legisla-
 ture is elected every 4 years. Suffrage is universal for adults over age 20, and ballot-
 ing is secret. A two-party coalition has formed the Government since 1938. Other
 parties operate freely; one currently has a seat in Parliament. The Government reg-
 ularly puts initiatives and referendums to popular vote.
 Since women gained the right to vote in 1984, a growing number of women have
 been active in politics. Two women are members of Parliament, and two-one of
 them the Foreign Minister-are among the five members of the Cabinet. Women are
 serving on the executive committees in the major parties.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The sole human rights organization based in Liechtenstein, Justitia Et Pax, is an
 informal group of about ten persons who monitor prison conditions and assist for-
 eign workers with immigration matters.
 There have been no requests from any source for investigation of human rights
 violations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The law prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, language, or social status,
 and the authorities respect these provisions.
 Women.-Societal discrimination still limits opportunitie for women in fields tra-
 ditionally dominated by men, and the law still provides no means to redress dis-
 crimination. However, a 1992 constitutional amendment provided for equality for
 women under the law, and requires the Parliament to revise, by the end of 1995,
 all laws relevant to this provision. Accordingly, Parliamentary committees have
 been working on revision of the statutes concerning citizenship, education, employ-
 ment conditions, taxation, and other matters.
 Domestic violence against women is a serious problem. Over 670 women were
 given shelter in 1994 due to violence or threats from a spouse or male partner. The
 law prohibits wife beating, and the Government prosecutes abusers.
 Children.-There is no pattern of societal abuse against children. The Govern-
 ment supports programs to protect the rights of children, and matches contributions
 made to the four nongovernmental organizations monitoring children's rights.
 People With Disabilities.-Although the law does not expressly prohibit discrimi-
 nation against people with disabilities, complaints of such discrimination may be
 pursued in the courts.
 The Government has not required that buildings or government services be made
 accessible for people with disabilities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Labor-management relations are conducted accord-
 ing to the Swiss Code of Obligations. All workers, including foreigners, are free to
 associate, join the unions of their choice, and select their own union representatives.
 The sole trade union represents 13 percent of the work force, but it looks after the
 interests of nonmembers as well. It is a member of the World Confederation of
 Labor, but is represented there by a Swiss union.
 Workers have the right to strike except in certain essential services. No strikes
 are known to have taken place in the last 26 years. The law does not provide spe-
 cific protection for strikers. Employers may dismiss employees for refusal to work;
 such dismissals may be contested.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides for the right
 of workers to organize and bargain collectively. However, collective bargaining
 agreements are generally adapted from ones negotiated by Swiss employers and
 unions.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The law prohibits forced or com-
 pulsory labor, and there were no reports of violations.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The law generally prohibits em-
 ployment of children under age 16; however, regulatory exceptions may be made,
 under certain circumstances, for some employment of youths older than 13 and for
 those leaving school after age 14.
 
 
 878
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no national minimum wage, but even
 the lowest actual wages afford a decent living for workers and their families. The
 law sets the maximum workweek at 45 hours for white-collar workers and employ-
 ees of industrial firms, and 50 hours for all other workers. The actual workweek
 is usually 40 to 43 hours. Employers must guarantee workers 1Y2 rest days each
 week, usually Saturday afternoon and Sunday. Workers over age 19 receive at least
 4 weeks of vacation; younger ones, at least 5 weeks.
 The law sets occupational health and safety standards, and the Department for
 Worker Safety effectively enforces these provisions.
