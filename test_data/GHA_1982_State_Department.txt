 GHANA
 Since December 31, 1981, when a military coup removed a
 popularly-elected government functioning under a constitution,
 Ghana has been ruled by a small Provisional National Defense
 Council (PNDC). A split in this ruling council apparently
 led to an unsuccessful coup attempt on November 23, 1982.
 These events have yet to lead to changes in government
 policy. The rulers purport to hold power in trust for the
 Ghanaian people while striving to establish "participatory
 democracy" through a network of defense committees in
 communities, workplaces, and units of the armed forces.
 The professional and middle classes are generally not
 included within the definition of "the people" and in most
 cases are not eligible to participate in the defense committees.
 Although the rulers of Ghana have not defined their ideology,
 their actions support a mixed economy, a strengthening of
 the welfare state, and a Marxist view of history and society.
 The regime maintains that economic questions take priority
 over individual, civil and political rights. The defense
 committees and certain radical movements exert influence
 within and pressure on the Government to transform society
 and deal harshly with "anti-revolutionaries".
 There were 183 "unresolved murders" in 1982, according
 to Ghana's Association of Recognized Professional Bodies,
 some reports of disappearance or torture, and frequent
 reports of mistreatment. A continuing investigation by an
 independent Special Investigations Board into the murders in
 June of three high court judges has implicated two men who
 were then members of the ruling council. Under a new "protec-
 tive custody" law, persons may be detained indefinitely
 without charge. An accused person may still be accorded due
 process in the regular courts, but falls short of it in the
 newly established public tribunals. Freedom of speech and
 the press has been limited by the intimidating atmosphere
 and government ownership or control of the media. Freedom
 of association continues, but the Government permitted a
 violent takeover of the Trades Union Congress and attacks
 on lawyers and other professionals. Freedom of religion
 continues. Freedom of movement is increasingly controlled
 by the curfew and the closure of the land borders. Participa-
 tion in the political process has been virtually eliminated
 for the present by the dissolution of parliament and
 proscription of political parties.
 The Government is generally unable or unwilling to protect
 its opponents against human rights violations by its supporters,
 but it has not totally ignored the expression of human
 rights concerns by indigenous and foreign organizations.
 Consequently human rights violations are less serious than
 they might otherwise be. Free institutions and respect for
 individual rights are strongly rooted in Ghana, and have not
 been completely eliminated by the current "revolution."
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person,
 Including Freedom from:
 a. Killing
 The Association of Recognized Professional Bodies published
 a list in July 1982 of 183 persons killed whose murders remain
 unsolved. Among these were three high court judges and a
 retired army major who was a personnel director at a
 
 
 state-owned corporation, abducted from their homes June 30
 just before curfew and found dead the next day in a military
 training area. The circumstances of these murders suggested
 the involvement of soldiers or other officials of the
 Government. The PNDC has condemned these killings and in
 response to domestic and international calls for an impartial
 investigation, established an impartial and distinguished
 Special Investigation Board to probe the killings. On
 December 20 the Attorney-General said the Board's interim
 report identified one former member of the ruling council as
 directly involved in the murders and implicated another
 former member. Both were on the ruling council at the time
 of the killings. The investigation is continuing. The
 Government does not dispute that there have been killings in
 thp name of the revolution. It is not clear whether the
 Government has the will or ability to prevent or punish such
 murders when committed by its supporters against its opponents.
 b. Disappearance
 There are occasional reports of disappearances, which
 generally prove to be killings, arrests, or departures
 from Ghana.
 c. Torture
 There are a few reports of torture or maltreatment by the
 authorities in connection with arrests or interrogations. No
 one has been punished for torture of another individual.
 d. Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There are frequent reports of beatings in the course of
 arrest or interrogation in military guardrooms and jails
 throughout the country, especially at the guardroom at
 Gondar Barracks, where the offices of the Chief of the
 Defense Staff and the headquarters of the Navy and Air Force
 are located. Border guards frequently beat persons caught
 smuggling. Prison conditions are austere.
 For the past several months of the year, political prisoners
 have been treated more harshly than ordinary criminals; they
 have not, for example, been permitted family visits.
 e. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 When the PNDC took power all former ministers and deputy
 ministers, all members of parliament, including opposition
 party members, and activists of the former ruling People's
 National Party were directed to turn themselves in to the
 police. In January the PNDC decreed a "protective custody"
 law empowering it to detain people for their own safety or
 the security of the state, and 492 people were named as
 having been detained. Most of these were soon released.
 After sporadic releases over several months including the
 release of 22 persons on December 31, 1982, it is estimated
 that about 26 persons remain in custody, although no current
 list is available. These include the former president and
 vice-president and about nine former ministers. There are
 also some members of the previous regime's military intelli-
 gence who have been in custody during most of 1982. After
 the coup attempt of November 23 about 22 persons were arrested.
 
 
 126
 The Government has stated that it will soon release detainees
 if there is no case against them, or else try them before
 the public tribunal. Habeas corpus, which is available to
 ordinary criminal defendents, is not available to any of
 these detainees, nor is there any legal limit to the length
 of time a person may be held without charge following
 arrest. About 30 people convicted of various economic
 crimes in 1979 by the special tribunal of the Armed Forces
 Revolutionary Council in "trials" generally lacking in due
 process, remain in prison. A few military officers who
 unsuccessfully opposed the June 4, 1979 coup also remain in
 prison.
 f. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 A defendant in the regular court system is not abused. He or
 she has the right to effective counsel, and is usually
 charged within a short period of time. Defendants whose
 English (the official language of the courts) is inadequate
 are entitled to an interpreter. There are credible allega-
 tions that some lower court judges take bribes, and therefore
 wealthy defendants have a better chance than poor ones.
 Both judges and lawyers are independent from the Government,
 although there is an atmosphere of intimidation, and occasional
 physical interference with the courts by soldiers or
 "people's defense committees". In July the PNDC created a
 public tribunal to try various economic and security offenses,
 some of which were not considered to be offenseswhen
 committed. The members of the tribunal are inexperienced and
 "revolutiortary", and neither of the two lawyers has the five
 years standing as a lawyer required by the law itself for at
 least one member of the tribunal. The accused is permitted
 the counsel of his choice, but the Ghana Bar Association has
 refused participation in the tribunal because of the lack of
 due process. The tribunal is guided by the rules of "natural
 justice", but not the rules of evidence, which it regards as
 mere technicalities. Its sentences have been lengthy and
 its fines heavy. Initially there was no appeal from these
 verdicts, but the PNDC amended the law to empower itself
 to review sentences, and has in fact reduced some.
 In July the PNDC also established a special military
 tribunal to discipline soldiers for harassing and mistreating
 civilians. The trials are to be summary with no appeal.
 Civilians may be tried if they are involved with soldiers in
 these crimes. No trials have yet been reported.
 g. Invasion of the Home
 Normally an official would require a warrant to enter a
 private residence, but there are frequent newspaper reports
 that members of defense committees or police and soldiers
 have broken into private homes in search of "hoarded goods".
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and the press were restricted considerably
 in 1982. The atmosphere of intimidation fostered by the
 Government and its radical supporters discourages most
 people from expressing opposition to the "revolution". On
 
 
 127
 the other hand,'some important political issues are discussed
 seriously and openly as long as they are couched in terms
 acceptable to the regime. Some criticism of the Government
 is permitted, particularly of civil servants who are alleged
 to be corrupt or obstructing the revolution, or of soldiers
 who are molesting civilians. Some PNDC secretaries (cabinet
 level posts) have been criticized for incompetence or lack
 of commitment to the revolution. Criticism of the PNDC
 Chairman is not permitted.
 The Government owns the radio and television facilities, the
 Ghana News Agency, the two daily newspapers, the "Times" and
 the "Graphic", and two weeklies. Under the Third Republic
 there was an independent press commission to act as a buffer
 between the Government and the media, which was required to
 present alternative views. There were also independent
 weekly newspapers which presented a variety of views. The
 PNDC has removed these constraints on its influence over
 the publicly owned media. In a January 2 press conference,
 PNDC Chairman Rawlings ordered the media to back the Mrevo-
 lution". A mob inspired by the PNDC beseiged the offices of
 the' "Graphic" to complain about the editor's lukewarm
 support of the "revolution". Shortly thereafter the editors
 were placed on indefinite leave and a new, "revolutionary"
 editor appointed. The radical editor of the "Times" was
 confirmed in office, while a new "revolutionary" managing
 director was appointed for the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation.
 Since then the insufficiently "revolutionary" journalists
 working for the government media have been fired, placed on
 indefinite leave, or restricted. Although the PNDC claims
 publicly that the government-owned press is free, in fact
 the PNDC provides regular guidance to the media. The private
 press has been under heavy pressure from the Government. The
 publisher of "Unipress," who had feuded with Rawlings, fled
 the country to avoid arrest and the PNDC passed a law to
 confiscate his publishing company. The publisher of "Punch"
 newspaper also fled the country to avoid arrest. The
 "Echo", which had been both the most-widely circulated
 weekly and'the most outspoken in its criticism of the PNDC
 and the radicals, was ransacked on July 30, 1982. The
 publishers sacked the editor, and the Echo began to publish
 editorials supplied by the Ministry of Information, which
 also cleared its articles. The former editor fled the
 country. The editor of "The Believer", a weekly supportive
 of the "revolution" but not its excesses, was beaten and his
 offices ransacked on July 30. He fled Ghana. The atmosphere
 of intimidation imposes self-censorship on the remaining
 private media. Foreign exchange constraints and the Govern-
 ment's control over import licenses enable the Government to
 decide which newspaper will receive newsprint and spare
 parts to continue publication. In October the PNDC
 required publishers to obtain a license to publish, further
 strengthening the Government's control. Many prominent
 Ghanaians assume that their mail, particularly international
 mail, is subject to examination.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Police permits are generally required and granted for public
 meetings. The PNDC and radical individuals and groups
 pressured the secretary-general of the Trade Union Congress
 to resign in February 1982, and then took over the hall of
 
 
 trade unions on April 29, expelled the freely elected
 leadership of the union and its 17 national unions, and
 established interim management committees for these bodies.
 Not only did the PNDC fail to protect the union against
 this action; armed soldiers in civilian clothing were in the
 mob, and the PNDC soon thereafter recognized the new
 leadership. At the International Labor Organization meeting
 in June 1982 the PNDC promised to restore free elections
 to trade unions. Elections have not yet been held. The
 Government has also established workers defense committees
 at workplaces parallel with and in a supervisory position
 over local trade unions. Citing harsh economic circumstances,
 the PNDC has limited collective bargaining by refusing to
 permit the implementation of collective agreements, and has
 discouraged strikes. The industrial and services sectors of
 the economy, including the civil service, are unionized.
 The Association of Recognized Professional Bodies, including
 11 professional groups, is permitted to organize and to
 meet, but is bitterly criticized by the regime and radicals.
 On July 21 the association complained of a "systematic
 campaign of hate setting the so-called rich against the
 so-called poor. Professionals are described as parasites
 and hunted like animals". On July 30, two days after
 professionals conducted a peaceful demonstration against
 the murders of the judges, a radical mob invaded the Freemason's
 lodge where professionals were said to plot their "crimes"
 against the people.
 Unions and professional bodies are permitted to maintain
 relations with recognized international bodies in these
 fields.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state or otherwise-favored religion. The open
 practice of religion is permitted and there are no restrictions
 on religious ceremonies or teaching. Church leaders have
 sharply criticized the Government's record, particularly in
 human rights, and have in turn been attacked in the government-
 owned press. However, freedom to practice one's religion
 remains unimpeded. There is no single dominant religion,
 only various Christian, Muslim, and indigenous sects. None
 is persecuted, nor given special advantage.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Domestic movement is inhibited by police checkpoints
 outside major towns, and since the December 31, 1981 coup by
 a nationwide curfew. Ghana is a member of the Economic
 Community of West African States, and its citizens can
 nominally travel to neighboring states without a passport.
 Since September 21, Ghana's land borders have been closed,
 effectively preventing most Ghanaians from foreign travel.
 Persons released from preventive custody must obtain police
 approval before traveling. Generally, however, there is no
 ban to emigration or to repatriation.
 e. Freedom To Participate In the Political Process
 The small group who directed the December 31, 1981 coup rule
 
 
 129
 Ghana in the name of the PNDC. The previously existing
 political parties were proscribed, and no new ones have been
 allowed. The People's Defense Committees are sometimes
 described by the regime as the basis for a new "participatory"
 democracy. Their elections are restricted to the lower
 classes, held in public, and their leaders approved by the
 Government. Radical movements such as the June 4 Movement,
 the New Democratic Movement, and the People's Revolutionary
 League, have allies in the Government and exert some influence
 on it.
 There is one woman among the seven PNDC members, and one
 among the 23 PNDC secretaries (equivalent to ministers),
 as well as similar token levels of female participation
 elsewhere in the Government. There is no problem with
 exclusion of any ethnic minority from Government. However,
 many Ghanaians believe that the present Government is
 dominated by the Ewe tribe, which forms about 13 percent of
 the population.
 3. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Non-
 governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of
 Human Rights
 Ghana participates in the work of the UN Human Rights
 Commission. When the radicals took over the Trade Union
 Congress on April 29, 1982, the Organization of African
 Trade Union Unity and the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions expressed concern. Ghana did not react.
 Subsequently, to head off complaints by the International
 Labor Organization it agreed to restore trade union democracy.
 This has not been done. After the killings of the judges,
 the Ghana Bar Association, the professional association, and
 the churches called for an independent inquiry. So did the
 Lagos-based African Bar Association, which sent a delegation
 to Accra and met with Chairman Rawlings. The PNDC agreed
 to an inquiry. However, radical groups soon attacked the
 motives of these organizations, and organized demonstrations
 against the professionals. Similarly, after the bar association
 rejected participation in the public tribunals on human
 rights the Government did not reply directly, but the
 government-owned media, radical groups, and defense committees
 bitterly attacked the association and ransacked the offices
 of five lawyers in a regional capital, an action criticized
 by the PNDC Chairman as "undemocratic". In late November
 and early December 1982 the Christian Council of Ghana-and
 the Catholic Bishops Conference of Ghana issued statements
 criticizing the human rights violations of the Government,
 and were in turn sharply criticized in the government-owned
 press. On December 13 the National Secretariat of the
 National Union of Ghana Students issued a statement criticizing
 human rights abuses, and calling for the end of press
 censorship. These institutions and professional groups,
 drawing on a Ghanaian tradition of respect for human
 rights, have had some success in inhibiting violations
 of human rights.
 4. Economic, Social, and Cultural Situation
 Ghana is a developing country of about 12,531,000 citizens
 (1981 estimate). The population is growing at 3.3 percent
 (1980). Life expectancy at birth is 50, and infant mortality
 
 
 130
 is 102.8 per 1000 live births. The gross national product per
 capita, estimated in 1980 at $421, has been steadily declin-
 ing for a decade.
 Ghana has a mixed economy which the Government attempts to
 tightly regulate. Most agriculture, including production in
 the key cocoa sector, is owned by small farmers, but the
 Government maintains a monopoly over cocoa purchasing. There
 is also a substantial private trading sector. The Government
 owns many enterprises in the manufacturing and mining
 sectors.
 Ghana's economic situation may be briefly summarized
 as follows. It is well endowed with natural resources
 (gold, timber, manganese, bauxite, cocoa, arable land,
 hydro-electric power and small petroleum production) and has
 a generally well-educated population. However, successive
 governments made little effort to reform the economy. Large
 budget deficits induced inflation in excess of 100 percent,
 and made the cedi one of the most overvalued currencies in
 the world. Inflation and overvaluation raised production
 costs, at official exchange rates, above world prices,
 leading to a steady decline in export and foreign exchange
 earnings. The consequent reduction in imports cut industrial
 activity to 10-15 percent of capacity, increased unemployment
 and emigration and reduced the availability of essential
 goods to hardship levels.
 In 1970, adult literacy was 30.2 percent, and in 1978
 primary school enrollment was 71 percent. In 1975, 35
 percent had access to safe water, and in 1977 the ratio of
 calorie supply to nutritional requirements was 86 percent.
 There are still traditions which limit women's access to the
 benefits of Government, although women control much of the
 important distribution sector. There is no racial or
 religious discrimination in meeting the population's economic
 and social needs. The right to own property alone or with
 others is generally protected but under the PNDC's rule,
 goods and property have been subject to seizure or confiscation
 without due process of law.
