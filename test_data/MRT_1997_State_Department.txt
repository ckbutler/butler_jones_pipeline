 MAURITANIA
 Mauritania is an Islamic republic. The 1991 Constitution provides for a civilian
 government composed of a dominant executive branch, a Senate and National As-
 sembly, and an independent judiciary. President Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya
 has governed since 1984, first as head of a military junta, and since the 1992
 multiparty election as head of a civilian government. On December 12, Taya was
 reelected President, receiving over 90 percent of the vote, running against four other
 candidates. The election was widely regarded as fraudulent and was boycotted by
 the Opposition Front (a five p arty coalition). Most opposition parties boycotted ear-
 lier parliamentary elections, but participated in Senate elections in 1994 and 1996;
 they gained only one seat. In the country's first multi party legislative elections held
 in October 1996, 1 opposition and 6 independent candidates were elected to the 79-
 member National Assembly. The outcome of these elections was marred by fraud
 on all sides and pervasive government intervention, representing a backward step
 in the country's efforts to establish a pluralist democracy. The judiciary is subject
 to significant pressure from the executive through its ability to influence judges.
 The Government maintains order with regular armed forces, the National Guard,
 the Gendarmerie (a specialized corps of paramilitary police), and the police. The
 Ministry of Defense directs the armed forces and Gendarmerie; the Ministry of Inte-
 rior directs the National Guard and police. The armed forces are responsible for na-
 tional defense. The National Guard performs police functions throughout the coun-
 try in areas in which city police are not present. The Gendarmerie is a paramilitary
 groures     nsible for maintenance of civil order in and outside metropolitan areas.
 curity forces are under the full control of the Government and responsible to it.
 SmNe members of the security forces committed human rights abuses.

 Mauritania, with a population of 2.4 million, has a generally market-oriented
 economy based on subsistence farming, herding, and a small commercial sector. Fish
 and iron ore are the country's main export-earners. Drought, desertification, insect
 infestation, rapid urbanization, extensive unemployment, pervasive poverty, and a
 burdensome foreign debt handicap the economy. Severe drought in 1996-1997 fueled
 urbanization, further straining government finances. Annual per capita national in-
 come has declined in recent years and is estimated at $503 (1996 figure). Mauri-
 tania receives foreign assistance from bilateral and multilateral sources. A small
 elite controls much of the country's wealth and commerce.
 The Government's human rights record remained poor, and problems remain in
 certain areas. Democratic institutions remain rudimentary and the Government cir-
 cumscribes citizens' ability to change their government. Police at times used exces-
 sive force, beat or otherwise abused detainees, and used arbitrary arrest, incommu-
 nicado prearraignment detention, and illegal searches. The Government failed to
 bring to justice officials who commit abuses. Prison conditions are harsh and
 unhealthy. Pretrial detention is often very lengthy. Although the Government insti-
 tuted judicial programs and training, the executive continued to exercise significant
 pressure on the judiciary, and in practice the right to a fair trial was restricted. The
 Government suspended for lack of professionalism four judges who refused to recog-
 nize the rights of former slaves. The Government broadened the scope for opposition
 activity and improved access to government-owned media during the election cam-
 paign, but it continued to seize and suspend some publications, and limit freedom
 of religion. Societal discrimination against women continued, and female genital
 mutilation remained a serious problem despite government efforts to halt the prac-
 tice. Ethnic tensions are gradually easing, but the Halpulaar, Soninke, and Wolof
 ethnic groups are underrepresented in political life and some feel excluded from ef-
 fective political representation.
 The Government continued efforts to resolve a serious abuse from the 1989-91 pe-
 riod, in which approximately 70,000 Mauritanians were expelled or fled, by facilitat-
 ing cooperation between the Mauritanian Red Crescent Association and the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), to assist returnees from the ref-
 ugee camps in Senegal. The Government estimates that 30,000-35,000 have re-
 turned; the UNHCR documented 25,970 total returnees to four provinces along the
 Senegal River, but believes that the total number of returnees is significantly high-
 er. The Government failed to address fully another major abuse from the 1989-1991
 period, when 503 members of the military, mainly from the Halpulaar ethnic group,
 were killed, tortured, and maimed. The Government in earlier years gave pensions
 to the documented widows of those killed, but not to undocumented individuals
 claiming to be additional wives. In 1996 the Government extended that benefit to
 some of those who survived the purge. Further action on alleged wives, absent docu-
 mentation, appears unlikely. A 1993 amnesty law precludes legal pursuit of those
 responsible for the killings, and the Government does not acknowledge responsibil-
 ity or wrongdoing nor has it provided honorable discharge papers to survivors or
 other compensation to families of those killed.
 A system of officially sanctioned slavery in which government and society join to
 force individuals to serve masters does not exist; however, slavery in the form of
 unofficial voluntary or forced and involuntary servitude persists. Many persons con-
 tinue to live in conditions of unofficial paid or unpaid servitude and many persons
 still consider themselves to be slaves.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings.
 On April 11, gendarmes shot a man crossing the Senegal River from Senegal to
 Mauritania at Bababe, in the company of two others. He died after being trans-
 ferred to the military hospital in Nouakchott. The Government maintained that he
 was a thief and smuggler. A human rights group reported that the man knew the
 gendarmes and was shot because he had refused to pay them a bribe (see Section
 l.c.).
 On November 17, the Coast Guard fired on Senegalese fishermen in Mauritanian
 waters, killing 1 person and wounding as many as 10. The Coast Guard called on
 the men to stop but they did not. The individual died while trying to flee.
 Extrajudicial killings from past years remained unresolved, principally the 1990-
 91 deaths while in military custody of 503 largely Halpulaar and Soninke military
 personnel and civilians detained in the investigation of an alleged coup attempt. In
 1993, the Government began to provide pension benefits to some of the widows and
 
 
 213
 families of those killed, and in 1996 the Government recognized the prior govern-
 ment service of some of the civilian survivors and began to pay them pensions. The
 military has not released the results of its 1991 internal investigation, and in 1993
 Parliament passed an amnesty bill to preclude legal pursuit of those responsible.
 The Government has not acknowledged responsibility or wrongdoing nor has it pro-
 vided honorable discharge papers to survivors to facilitate alternative employment
 and their reintegration into society.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture and other forms of cruel or inhuman punishment, but the
 police continue on occasion to beat criminal suspects while in custody. There were
 credible reports that police tortured some of those arrested in June 1996 for drug
 trafficking durg pretrial detention, however, there are no reports of such abuse
 during the year   ethods of torture included beatings and around the clock ques-
 tioning. Authorities have not tried or punished persons suspected of committing
 such abuses. Police in some instances used force to break up peaceful demonstra-
 tions or disperse crowds. Military forces along the Senegal River used excessive
 force against individuals suspected of smuggling. Authorities have not tried or pun-
 ished persons suspected of committing such abuses. The Government's failure to
 bring to justice officials who commit abuses and fail to observe legal procedures has
 contributed to the widespread belief that security officials are a force apart from
 government authority and not subject to legal restraints. The armed forces produced
 in May and distributed to troops a guide on proper conduct for soldiers, under the
 auspices of the Mauritanian Red Crescent.
 Prison conditions are harsh and do not meet minimum international standards.
 There is severe overcrowding, poor sanitation, and inadequate medical treatment.
 The independent press and human rights activists periodically report the deaths of
 prison inmates; authorities cite natural causes, although witnesses claimed to have
 evidence of mistreatment. Prisoners from European countries receive privileged
 treatment but those from other African countries are often treated worse than
 Mauritanians. The central prison in Nouakchott, built for a prison population of 300
 men, now houses more than 650 prisoners. Observers report better conditions at the
 women's prison and children's detention center in Nouakchott. The Government is
 enlarging the central prison in Nouakchott, constructing individual and group cells,
 lodging for prison wardens, an infirmary, a sports recreation area, and sanitary fa-
 cilities. A new prison in Akjoujt is nearing completion.
 The Government permits prison visits by diplomats and human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution stipulates that authori-
 ties cannot arrest, detain, prosecute, or punish anyone except as provided for under
 the law; however, at times police arbitrarily arrested and detained citizens. The ac-
 tual application of the constitutional safeguards continued to vary widely from case
 to case.
 The law requires that courts review the legality of a person's detention within 48
 hours of arrest. The police may extend the period for another 48 hours, and a pros-
 ecutor or court may detain persons for up to 30 days in national security cases. Only
 after the prosecutor submits charges does a suspect have the right to contact an at-
 torney.
 Human rights activists report that police are showing greater respect for legally
 mandated procedures. Pretrial detention after arraignment is extensive. According
 to an appeal written by prisoners in the Nouakchott prison, only 130 of the inmates
 have received a sentence, and 450 have not received a trial, but observers believe
 that the actual number to be lower.
 Some indicted prisoners are released before trial without explanation; familial,
 tribal, or political connections may explain some of these cases. There is a provision
 for granting bail, but it is rarely used.
 From January 21-30, police arrested nine individuals suspected of illegal ties to
 Libya, one of them the leader of the opposition political party, Action pour le
 Changement. They were arrested under a 1991 decree stating that political parties
 may not cooperate with foreign parties in a way incompatible with the law. Initially
 held under incommunicado prearraignment detention, three were released 8 days
 after their arrest; another was released later. Five stood trial in February and re-
 ceived sentences ranging from a 3-week suspended sentence to 6 months in jail. An
 appeals court overturned four of the five convictions in April. The fifth person
 served out his 6-month sentence.
 In May security forces detained and approximately 60 university students for
 their involvement in student protests at the University of Nouakchott. Eleven of
 these students were then sent to their villages and held under house arrest there.
 All were released at the end of the school term in June without being able to take
 
 
 their final examinations. Security forces reportedly repeatedly arrested and later re-
 leased a few other students.
 In April the Government detained under house arrest 15 teachers' union officials;
 all were released by July (see Section 6.b.).
 Occasional reports of arbitrary arrests and intimidation committed by security
 forces continued, particularly among returned refugees in communities along the
 Senegal River, but the extent of abuses declined, as the Government, in conjunction
 with the UNHCR and Mauritanian Red Crescent society, resettled many returnees
 (see Section 2.d.). Local authorities often detained local residents involved in land
 disputes, or in disputes between farmers and nomads along the river.
 The Government does not employ forced exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Although the Constitution provides for the inde-
 pendence of the judiciary, in practice the executive branch exercises significant pres-
 sure on the judiciary through its ability to appoint and influence judges. In addition
 the judicial system's fairness is limited by poorly educated and poorly trained judges
 who are susceptible to social, financial, tribal, and personal pressures.
 There is a single system of courts, having introduced a modernized legal system
 that conforms with the principles of Shari a. The judicial system includes lower,
 middle, and upper level courts, each with specific jurisdictions. Departmental, re-
 gional, and labor tribunals are the principal instances at the lower level. The 53 de-
 partmental tribunals, composed of a president and magistrates with traditional Is-
 lamic legal training, hear civil cases involving sums less than $72 (10,000 UM) and
 family issues (e.g., domestic, divorce, and inheritance cases). Thirteen regional tribu-
 nals accept appeals in commercial and civil matters from the departmental tribu-
 nals and hear misdemeanors. Three labor tribunals, composd of a president and
 two assessors (one who represents labor and one who represents employers), serve
 as final arbiters for labor disputes. At the middle level, three courts of appeal, each
 with two chambers (a civil and commercial chamber, and a mixed chamer) hear
 appeals from the regional courts and have original jurisdiction for felonies. Nomi-
 nally independent, the Supreme Court is headed by a magistrate appointed to a 5-
 year term by the President. The Supreme Court reviews decisions and rulings made
 by-the courts of appeal to determine their compliance with the law and procedure.
 Constitutional review is the purview of a six-member Constitutional Council, com-
 posed of three members named by the President, two by the National Assembly
 President, and one by the Senate President. Annual review of judicial decisions is
 undertaken by the Supreme Council of the Magistrature, over which the President
 presides; the president and senior vice president of the Supreme Court, the Minister
 of Justice, three magistrates, and representatives from the Senate and National As-
 sembly are members of this Council. The annual review is intended to determine
 whether courts applied the law correctly and followed proper procedures.
 The Constitution provides for due process and the presumption of innocence until
 proven guilty by an established tribunal. All defendants, regardless of the court or
 their ability to pay, have the legal right to representation by counsel during the pro-
 ceedings, which are open to the public. If defendants lack the ability to pay for coun-
 sel, the court appoints an attorney, from a list prepared by the National Order of
 Lawyers, who provides defense free of charge. The law provides that defendants
 may confront witnesses, present evidence, and appeal their sentences, and these
 rights are generally observed in practice.
 Because Shari'a provides the legal principles upon which the law and legal proce-
 dure are based, courts do not in all cases treat women as equals of men, or exam-
 ple, the testimony of two women is necessary to equal that of one man. In addition
 in awarding an indemnity to the family of a woman who has been killed, the courts
 grant only half the amount they would award for a man's death. There are no fe-
 male magistrates. However, for commercial and other modern issues not specifically
 addressed by Shari'a, the law and courts treat women and men equally.
 With international assistance, the Government continued a program to improve
 judicial performance and independence, consisting of organizing all laws and stat-
 utes into a single reference text and trainin officials throughout the justice system.
 Three training programs began to improve the skills of magistrates. In February the
 Government held its first workshopon judicial reform. Two hundred judicial officials
 have also embarked on training. Thirty new judges, all university law graduates,
 began a 2-year training program at the National School of Administration. Within
 President Taya's currant term, the investment, administration, commercial, civil,
 and arbitragalbanking codes are to be updated and made cohesive. Popular dis-
 satisfaction with the judicial system and the belief that security officials can commit
 abuses with impunity persisted.
 Early in 1997, the Government formally suspended four magistrates for lack of
 professionalism, because in custody cases involving the children of slaves, they had
 
 
 awarded custody to the fathers, who were also the former masters in disregard of
 the law. The decision dated from December 28, 1996, but was published in the Jour-
 nal Officiel on March 30.
 A Mauritanian arrested in January as part of the sweep of pro-Libyan activists
 was sentenced in February to a 6-month prison term for activity opposed to Mauri-
 tania's relations with Israel.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The law
 requires judicial warrants in order to execute home searches, but the authorities
 often ignore this requirement.
 Government surveillance of dissidents and the political opposition is believed to
 continue, although the extent to which the Government used informants is un-
 known.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, but the Government continues to restrict these rights through
 prepublication press censorship by the Interior Ministry. NGO's and the privately
 owned press openly criticized the Government and its leaders. Antigovernment
 tracts, newsletters, and petitions circulated widely in Nouakchott and other towns.
 All newspapers and political parties must register with the Ministry of the Inte-
 rior. Although the Government did not refuse to register any journal, it suspended
 from April 26 to May 25 the right to publish of the independent weekly, Mauritanie
 Nouvelles, seized its September 25 to October 5 editions, and again suspended it in
 October for 3 months. On June 23, La Verite and its Arabic version, Al-Bushra, both
 known to be close to the Government, were shut down permanently and their assets
 seized. Fourteen instances of censorship involving 8 newspapers also took place,
 compared with 18 in 1996.
 At least 42 independent, privately owned newspapers, including 3 new French
 language and 14 new Arabic language publications, appeared or reappeared during
 the year, many on an irregular basis. These journals are weeklies, published in Ara-
 bic or French, and reach limited audiences. Mauritanie Nouvelles introduced an Ar-
 abic version in July. Readership of the independent press increased, in particular
 during the electoral period. Independent journals reported openly and critically on
 the opposition and government alike, and published party declarations and tracts
 without government censure or restraint. The President's Ramadan speech in Janu-
 ary launched a widespread, open debate on slavery. Several hundred newspaper ar-
 ticles on the subject subsequently appeared without censure; one was ceilsored by
 the Government.
 The Ministry of the Interior reviews all newspaper copy prior to publication. The
 Press Law provides that the Minister of the Interior can stop publication of material
 discrediting Islam or threatening national security. Although the Ministry did not
 excise material from journals or otherwise censor individual articles, the authorities
 seized 17 individual issues of various journals; by comparison, in 1996, 23 individual
 issues were seized. The Government provided no specific reason for the seizures. A
 new regulation in August mandated that newspapers and journals also must be
 cleared through the Ministry of Justice prior to publication, with two copies for the
 public prosecutor's office and five for other Ministry of Justice officials. The Ministry
 authorizes sales and distribution within 2 to 3 days.
 The electronic media (radio and television) and two daily newspapers, Horizons
 and Chaab, are government-owned and operated. Radio is the most important me-
 dium in reaching the public, and the official media strongly support government
 policies. During the presidential election campaign, the Government gave all five
 candidates equal access to its two newspapers and to the electronic media; for the
 first time, citizens heard or read criticisms of both the Government and the Presi-
 dent in these media and not just in the independent newspapers. Opposition parties'
 access to government radio broadcast facilities at other times is limited, but Radio
 France International brondcasts interviews with government opponents on FM. Citi-
 zens can watch television broadcasts on stations from France, the United States,
 and other Arab countries without special antennae. The Government denied private
 aPcatins to establish radio stations.
 ces o university is government funded and operated. Academic freedom isgen-
 erally respected, and there were no cases in which the Government prevented re-
 search or publication, or censored lectures.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.L-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly, and the Government generally respects this right, although
 there were occasions when it restricted public gatherings. The law requires that all
 
 
 recognized political parties and NGO's apply to the local prefect for permission for
 large meetings or assemblies. Permission is generally freely granted.
 The National Guard and police used force and tear gas to disperse crowds and
 to maintain order during the high school student protests that took place in early
 March in Nouakchott and in the interior, sparked by discontent over fuel price hikes
 that raised the cost of transportation. Police reportedly used violence on the Univer-
 sity of Nouakchott campus during the university student strike in May. On May 4,
 50 students came to the US. Embassy to present their case. One student was in-
 jured when police dispersed them.
 The two recognized labor confederations and two teachers unions held Labor Day
 rallies. The unregistered Free Confederation of Mauritanian Workers (CLTM) was
 given permission to march with one of the two confederations but declined and in-
 stead became involved in a scuffle with police (see Section 6.a.). The opposition held
 public marches and demonstrations without incident.
 The Constitution provides for freedom of association, however, the Government
 circumscribes the efforts of some groups by denying them official recognition. The
 number of political parties, labor unions, and NGO's continued to increase. Some 21
 political parties and a wide array of NGO's, many of them highly critical of the Gov-
 ernment, met openly, issued public statements, and chose their own leadership. New
 regulations issued by the Government in 1996 to facilitate the establishment of
 NGO's engaged in economic and social development, environmental protection, and
 humanitarian assistance were published on February 28. These streamlined proce-
 dures facilitated the recognition of several existing NGO's and led to the establish-
 ment and recognition of a large number of new NGO's. The Government has not
 yet granted some NGO's official standing but allowed them to operate. Registration
 of some NGO's is pending the determination of modalities related to the new law.
 Among these is the Mauritanian Association for Human Rights. the Government
 claims that it appeals to specific ethnic groups, namely the Afro-'Mauritanian com-
 munity, and is a potentially divisive force. The Government also has not recognized
 two antislavery NGO's, the independent SOS-Esclaves and the progovernment Na-
 tional Committee for the Eradication of the Vestiges of Slavery in Mauritania. How-
 ever, the Government allows these associations to function, issue reports and state-
 ments, and, in the case of SOS-Eslaves, assist individuals in their dealings with
 the Government to resolve problems.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The 1991 Constitution established Mauritania as an Is-
 lamic republic and decrees that Islam is the religion of its people and the State. All
 but a small number of citizens are Sunni Muslims and are prohibited by their reli-
 gion from converting to another religion. The Government prohibits proselytizing by
 non-Muslims. Christian churches have been established in Nouakchott, Atar,
 Zouerate, Nouadhibou, and Rosso. The expatriate community of Christians and the
 few citizens who are considered Christians from birth practice their religion openly
 and freely in these churches. Muslims freely attend Christian weddings and funer-
 als when invited and on occasion have performed the formal witness role at Catholic
 weddings. The possession of Bibles and other Christian religious materials in pri-
 vate homes is not illegal, but the Government views any attempts by Christians to
 convert Muslims as undermining Mauritanian society. The authorities carried out
 immediate investigations and provided enhanced protection to a Christian NGO that
 received two written death threats in July and August but no arrests were made.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of movement and residence with-
 in all parts of the territory, and provides for the freedom to enter and leave. Histori-
 cally there were few restrictions on travel in Mauritania's nomadic society. With ur-
 banization and automobile travel, the Government set up regular road checkpoints
 where the Gendarmerie checks papers of travelers. The Government imposed no
 nighttime curfews.
 The Government cooperates with the UNHCR and other humanitarian organiza-
 tions in assisting refugees. The Government provided first asylum to refugees from
 many countries. There were no reports of refugees being forced to return to a coun-
 try where they feared persecution. The UNHCR completed its repatriation program
 of Malian refugees from Mauritania in early June and closed its last camp for Ma-
 lian refugees in eastern Mauritania on June 30. The Government is willing to per-
 mit the estimated 2,000 Malians, who did not choose earlier repatriation, to stay
 in Mauritania.
 Of the approximately 70,000 Afro-Mauritanians who were expelled by Mauritania
 or fled to enegal and Mali during the 1989-91 crisis, and of those born abroad
 since then, the Government estimates that 30,000 to 35,000 have returned, 7,000
 during the year. The UNHCR has documented 24,970 persons who had returned to
 villages in four provinces along the Senegal River by November 17. The UNHCR
 
 
 lacks access to many returnee sites and keeps no statistics on the number of persons
 returning to urban areas. Nomads are also difficult to document. Many entire vil-
 lages as well as almost all Peulh (nomadic herders of the Halpulaar ethnic group)
 have returned. Based on a 1995 census in Senegal, the UNHCR estimates that
 60,000 to 65,000 Mauritanians remain in Senegal, including 15,000 children born
 there since 1989, and from 10,000 to 15,000 Mauritanian lalpulaars remain in
 Mali. Of these, an unknown number have permanently integrated into the local pop-
 ulations of their asylum countries. The Government has stated since 1993 that any
 Mauritanian outside the country may return. However, the Government, the coun-
 tries of asylum, and the UNHCR have signed no tripartite repatriation agreement.
 Under the UNHCR-funded, 2-year "special plan for rapid insertion" (PSIR) begun
 in mid-1996 to assist returnees, the Mauritanian Red Crescent, the UNHCR, and
 NGO's have undertaken over 113 small agriculture, water, health, education, and
 construction projects in 77 villages to assist returnees. Cooperation by local authori-
 ties in addressing restitution and citizenship matters varies greatly, depending on
 individual officials and the returnee's region.
 Repatriation efforts have achieved greater results in the Trarza and Brakna re-
 gions than in Gorgol and Guidimaka to the east. Many returnees received their
 original homes, some property, and a portion of their land. Restoration of identity
 papers in a timely manner has varied, and some of those repatriated who returned
 in 1995 have not yet received identification cards. In some regions, persons lacking
 identity cards could not travel freely.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government, but
 the Government circumscribes it in practice. The 1992 multiparty election of a civil-
 ian president ended 14 years of military rule, but both the opposition and inter-
 national observers concluded that the elections were fraudulent. Although civilians
 fill all ministerial-level positions, some members of the former Military Council, in
 addition to President Taya, remained in positions of power within the executive
 branch, the National Assembly, the armed forces, and government-owned enter-
 prises. The armed forces continued to provide strong support to the regime. The
 Government denied elements of the opposition the opportunity to receive full access
 to government media and to compete on an equal footing.
 The country's first multiparty legislative elections were held in October 1996.
 Only 1 opposition and 6 independent candidates were elected to the 79-member Na-
 tional Assembly. The outcome of the elections was marred by fraud on all sides and
 pervasive government intervention to support candidates from the ruling PRDS
 party. After the Government announced that presidential elections would take place
 on December 12, the anniversary of the 1984 coup, a coalition of five opposition par-
 ties announced on June 26 that it intended to boycott the election unless certain
 demands were met. These requirements included enhanced media access, an opposi-
 tion role in election preparation, creation of an independent electoral commission,
 enlarging the commission charged with electoral list revision, and provision of offi-
 cial copies of the voting report from each polling station to representatives of each
 candidate. The Government granted the opposition full access to its media but did
 not meet the other demands. Five individuals, including a 1992 presidential and an
 Afro-Mauritanian for the first time, ran for president. The Government sent teams
 to cover each candidate's campaign, and all received equal treatment in the official
 electronic and print media as well as the usual treatment in the independent press.
 President Taya won an overwhelming victory, although his opponents fared much
 better in the cities than in the rural areas. The official turnout of 75 percent and
 winning percentage of 90 percent were inflated, since many individuals voted more
 than once.
 Women have the right to vote, and formed the majority of voters in the presi-
 dential election. Many are active in election campaigns. There are increasing num-
 bers of women in senior government positions, including one cabinet member, two
 secretaries-general, two senior presidential advisors (including a Halpulaar), and
 four senior advisors to ministers. Women are well represented in the Secretariat of
 Women's Affairs, including a number of Halpulaar women. There are three female
 members of the National Assembly (including one Haratine and one Soninke from
 the Forgeron caste), but no female senators. lHalpulaars, Soninkes, and Wolofs are
 underrepresented in senior government positions. Of the Government's 19 ministe-
 rial posts, 2 incumbents are Haratine, 2 Halpulaar, and 1 Soninke; the remainder
 are of either White Moor or of mixed White Moor/Haratine ethnicity (see Section
 5). The full 23-member Cabinet, including secretaries of state has 2 Haratines, 2
 
 
 218
 Halpulaars and 1 Soninke. The Afro-Mauritanian and Haratine population provides
 13 Nationa Assembly deputies and 10 senators.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are an increasing number of human rights organizations; they operate
 without government restriction. The oldest is theMaritanian League for Human
 Rights, an independent but government-recognized body. In February it published
 a report that scrutinized the legacy of slavery and listed legislation pertaining to
 it. A second and still unrecognized organization, the Mauritanian Human Rights As-
 sociation (AMDH), while not -affiliated with the opposition, has many opposition
 members. It has been more critical of the Government than the League, particularly
 on the unresolved abuses of the 1989-91 period.
 Other organizations, including 10 unregistered associations, also address human
 rights issues. The pan-African organization Gerddes-Africa, or International Study
 and Research Group on Democracy and Economic and Social Development in Africa,
 established a branch in Mauritania in 1994. Two other groups, SOS-Esclaves and
 the National Committee for the Struggle Against the Vestiges of Slavery in Mauri-
 tania, focus their efforts on overcoming the country's vestiges of slavery (see Section
 6.c.). SOS-Esclaves was particularly active in drawing public attention to this issue,
 issuing in March a report detailing its activities and a petition appealin to national
 and international audiences to support measures to eradicate slavery. OS-Esclaves
 also intervened effectively with government authorities to push resolution of some
 of the cases, in particular child custody cases, brought to the organization by former
 slaves.
 The Committee of Solidarity with the Victims of Repression in Mauritania is con-
 cerned with the plight of the 1989 expellees. The Consultative Group for the Return
 of the Refugees was founded to promote the return of the remaining Mauritanian
 xefugees in Senegal. The Collective of Workers Victims of the 1989 Events seeks re-
 dress for government employees ,who lost their'jobs in the events of 1989. The Com-
 mittee of the Widows and the Collective of Survivors focus on the sufferings of the
 victims of the 1990-91 military purge and their families. The Collective of Survivors
 of Political Detention and, Torture (CRADPOCIT) was established in 1996 to seek
 redress for abuses committed during the 1986-87 period. These, and other groups
 of individuals with common concerns, function openly and actively, but their efforts
 are somewhat circumscribed because they are not officially recognized (see Section
 2.b.). Ten organizations created an umbrella organization, the Reseau Nationale des
 Droits de L'Homme in April to coordinate on human rights issues. Both registered
 and unregistered NGO's attended sessions of the African Commission of Human and
 People's Rights, which met in Nouakchott in June, but initially the Government de-
 nied access to unregistered groups.
 Representatives from a variety of European, African, American, and Arab human
 rights organizations visited Mauritania. Antislavery International, the African
 American Institute, the American Jewish Committee , the International Committee
 of the Red Cross, and the International Labor Organization (ILO) were among these
 visitors. In March Africare signed an agreement with the Government to establish
 an office in Nouakchott. These groups were allowed free access, and there were no
 reports of harassment or reprisal against Mauritanian interlocutors during or fol-
 lowing the visits.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equality before the law for all citizens, regardless
 of race, national origin, sex, or social status, and prohibits racially or ethnically
 based propaganda. In practice the Government often favors individuals on the basis
 of ethnic an tribal affiliation, social status, and political ties. Societal discrimina-
 tion against women, strongly rooted in traditional society, is endemic, although the
 situation is improving.
 Women.-Human rights monitors and female lawyers report that physical mis-
 treatment of women by their husbands is rare. The police and judiciary occasionally
 intervene in domestic abuse cases, but women in traditional society rarely seek legal
 redress, relying instead upon family and ethnic group members to resolve domestic
 disputes. The incidence of reported rape is low. It occurs, but newspaper accounts
 of attacks are rare.
 Women have legal rights to property and child custody, and, among the more
 modem and urbanized population, these rights are recognized. By local tradition, a
 woman's first marriage, but not subsequent marriages, requires parental consent.
 In accordance with Shari'a, marriage and divorce do not require the woman's con-
 
 
 sent polygyny is allowed, and a woman does not have the right to refuse her hus-
 band's wish to marry additional wives. In practice polygyny is very rare among
 Moors but common among Afro-Mauritanians. Arranged marriages are also increas-
 ingly rare, particularly among the Moor population. Women frequently initiate the
 termination of a marriage, which most often is done by husband or wife by repudi-
 ation rather than divorce. It is also common in Moor society for a woman to obtain,
 at the time of marriage, a contractual agreement that stipulates that her husband
 must agree to end their marriage if he chooses an additional wife. The rate of di-
 vorce among Moors is estimated to be 37 percent and the remarriage rate after di-
 vorce 72.5 percent.
 Women still face some legal discrimination. For example, the testimony of two
 women is necessary to equal that of one man, and the value placed on women's lives
 in court-awarded indemnities is only half the amount awarded for a man's death
 (see Section i.e.). Women do not face legal discrimination, however, in other areas
 not specifically addressed by Shari'a. The Secretariat for Women's Affairs works
 with many NGO's and cooperatives to improve the status of women. A booklet pub-
 lished late in 1996 advises women of their rights.
 There are no legal restrictions on the education of girls and women. Girls com-
 prised 45 percent of all school enrollments in 1996-1997. Some 75 percent of school
 age girls attended elementary school in 1996, up from 44.8 percent in 1990 (com-
 paredwith 85.9 percent for boys, up from 58.3 percent). At the secondary level, fe-
 male students constituted 36 percent of those enrolled. Despite the increases, enroll-
 ment in eastern Mauritania, the Brakna, and along the Senegal River remained at
 a lower level. The Government introduced a special program in 1995-96 to boost fe-
 male enrollment at the elementary level. Women made up 14.9 percent of the uni-
 versity's 1996-97 enrollment, compared with 9 percent in 1990. Women also con-
 stituted 26.5 percent of students enrolled in technical schools, compared with 2 per-
 cent in 1990.
 The Government seeks to open new empoyment opportunities for women in areas
 that are traditionally filled by men, such as health care, communications, police,
 and customs services.
 The law provides that men and women receive equal pay for equal work. While
 not universally applied in practice, the two largest employers, the civil service and
 state mining company, respect this law. In the modern wage sector, women also re-
 ceive generous family benefits, including 3 months of maternity-leave.
 ChiUdren.-The Government does not require attendance at school and a lack of
 financial resources limits available educational opportunities. However, almost all
 children, regardless of sex or ethnic group, attend Koranic school from the ages of
 5 to 7 and gain at least rudimentary skills in reading and writing Arabic in addition
 to memorizing Koranic verses.
 The law makes special provisions for the protection of children's welfare, and the
 Government has programs to care for abandoned children. These programs are,
 however, hampered by inadequate funding. The Government relies on foreign donors
 in such areas as child immunization. Moreover, it does not enforce existing child
 labor laws, and children perform a significant amount of labor in support of family
 activities. There are isolated but credible press reports of parents agreeing, in ex-
 change for money, to send their young children to work in foreign countries. The
 most common cases are of boys between the ages of 8 and 10 years who are sent
 to work as "camel jockeys" or herders in the United Arab Emirates or Qatar.-In Oc-
 tober the Government discovered that 11 children between the ages of 3 and 5 years
 had boarded a plane to Bamako for this purpose and alerted the Government of
 Mali. The children were returned from Bamako. The parents, who had voluntarily
 sent the children, were queried but no arrests were made (see Section 6.d.).
 Traditional forms of mistreatment of females continue, mostly in isolated rural
 communities, but these practices appear to be on the decline. Such mistreatment
 consists of forced feeding of adolescent girls (gavage) and female genital mutilation
 (FGM), which is widely condemned by international health experts as damaging to
 both physical and psychological health. FGM is performed most often on young girls,
 often on the seventh day after birth and almost always before the age of 6 months,
 and it is practiced among all ethnic groups except the Wolof. A March 1996 report
 by the United Nations Population Fnd cited Mauritania as a country in which 25
 ercent of the women undergo FGM, which was confirmed by a study in September
 bJeune Afrique Economique. Among Halpulaar women, over 95 percent undergo
 FGM. The practie prevals among Soninke women as well. A brad foreign-funded
 study is currently underway to obtain more precise details. Local experts agree that
 the least severe Lorm of excision is practiced, and not infibulation, the most severe
 form of FGM. The practice of FGM has decreased in the modern urban sector.
 
 
 It is the clear public policy of the Government, through the Secretariat of Wom-
 en's Affairs, that FGM should be stopped, and the Government bars hospitals from
 performing it. However, the Government does not attempt to interfere with the
 practice. The Secretariat of Women's Affairs established a committee in June to
 combat gavage and FGM. Public health workers and NGO's educate women to the
 dangers of FGM and to the fact that FGM is not a requirement of Islam. A 1996
 officially produced Guide to the Rights of Women in Mauritania (with religious en-
 dorsement) stresses that Islam does not require FGM and that if medical experts
 warn against it for medical reasons, it should not be done.
 People With Disabilities.-The law does not specifically provide for people with
 disabilities, and the Government does not mandate preference in employment or
 education or public accessibility for disabled persons. It does, however, provide some
 rehabilitation and other assistance for the disabled.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Ethnic minorities and low-caste individuals
 among all ethnic groups confront societal discrimination. Ethnic and cultural ten-
 sion and discrimination arise from the geographic and cultural line between tradi-
 tionally nomadic Arabic-speaking (Hassaniya) Moor herders and Afro-Mauritanian
 (Peuhi)herders of the Hapulaar group, and sedentary cultivators of the Halpulaar
 (Toucouleur), Soninke, and Wolof ethnic groups in the south. Although culturally ho-
 mogeneous, the Moors are divided among numerous ethno-linguistic clan groups and
 are racially distinguished as White Moors and Black Moors. The majority of what
 are known as Black Moors are Haratine, literally "one who has been freed," al-
 though some Black Moor families were never enslaved. The Halpulaar (the largest
 Afro-Mauritanian group), the Wolof, and the Soninke ethnic groups are concentrated
 in the south. "White Moors, large numbers of whom are dark-skinned after cen-
 turies of intermarriage with members of Sub-Saharan African groups, dominate po-
 sitions in government, business, and the clergy. The Halpulaar, Soninke, and Wolof
 ethnic groups are underrepresented in the military and security sectors.
 Etbnic tensions surfaced   dramatically in the mass expulsions of Afro-
 Maritanians in 1989-90 and the purge of Afro-Mauritanians from the military in
 1991. Few regained their positions.
 The Constitution designates Arabic along with Pulaar, Soninke, and Wolof as
 Mauritania's national languages. Successive governments-both civil and military-
 have pursued various polic es of "Arabization" in the schools and in the workplace.
 Non-Arabic-speaking ethnic groups have protested this policy, as have Arabic-speak-
 ing groups that want their children to obtain a bilingual Arabic-French education.
 The Government provides bilingual Arabic-French programs where the community
 demand is sufficient. Elementary school classes are also available in the other na-
 tional languages in several localities.
 Some hostility and bitterness from the explosive ethnic violence of the 1989-91
 events persist between ethnic groups, although political coalitions among the groups
 are increasingly important.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for freedom of association
 and the right of citizens to join any political or labor organization. All workers ex-
 cept members of the military and police are free to associate in and establish unions
 at the local and national levels.
 Prior to the 1993 amendment of the Labor Code, which repealed provisions re-
 stricting trade union pluralism, the government-controlled labor central, the Union
 of Mauritanian Workers (UTM), was the only labor confederation allowed by law.
 Since 1993 six new labor confederations have been recognized and four unofficial or
 unrecognized unions formed. The UTM, which many workers still view as closely
 allied with the Government and the Parti Republicain Democratique et Sociale
 (PRDS), has lost ground to these organizations. The General Confederation of
 Mauritanian Workers (CGTM), recognized in 1994 and with 23 member unions, is
 not affiliated with any political party, although most of its members favor the oppo-
 sition; it continued to gain considerably in strength during the year, in part because
 of the UTM's internal discord. The Government, which previously subsidized only
 the UTM, now provides funds also to the CGTM, proportional to its membership.
 Both confederations supplied representatives to the country's four labor tribunals,
 and the CGTM was included in most government deliberative or consultative bodies
 in which the UTM alone has participated in the past. A third labor confederation,
 the Free Confederation of Mauritanian Workers (CLTM), which was formed in 1995
 and leans politically toward the opposition party, Action pour le Changement, has
 not been recognized by the Government but is nevertheless allowed to function. The
 CLTM complained in May of discrimination in the workplace and by the Govern-
 ment in trade union activity. Several independent trade unions, in particular three
 
 
 for teachers at the elementary, secondary, and university levels, were also active.
 Seminars to educate the tripartite partners on responsible trade unionism and
 democratic labor relations were held under foreign embassy and other sponsorship.
 The bulk of the labor force is in the informal sector, with most workers engaged
 in subsistence agriculture and animal husbanfdy, only 25 percent are employed in
 the wage sector. However, nearly 90 percent of te in ustrial and commercial work-
 ers are organized. The law provides workers with the right to strike, and there were
 several strikes and partial work stoppages. Most strikes were settled quickly due
 to limited worker and union resources. Authorities arrested secondary teachers who
 threatened a strike in April and later cut their salaries. The law provides for tri-
 partite arbitration committees composed of union, business, and government rep-
 resentatives. Once all parties agree to arbitration, the committee may impose bind-
 ing arbitration that automatically terminates any strike.
 International trade union activity increased. The Government included both
 CGTM and UTM representatives in its delegation to the ILO in June, and the ILO
 conducted an extensive series of training workshops in which both confederations
 participated as they did in 1996. The CGTM and UTM have applied for membership
 in the ICFTU, but at year's end the applications are still pending. The UTM partici-
 pated in regional labor organizations, and the CGTM has an application pending to
 join the Organization of African Trade Union Unity (OATUU).
 The Government petitioned the United States for reconsideration of Generalized
 System of Preferences (GSP) trade privileges in June. The United States revoked
 GSP benefits in July 1993 for failure to respect freedom of association or to take
 steps to eliminate forced labor, including vestiges of slavery (see Section 6.c.).
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The law provides that unions
 may freely organize workers without government or employer interference. General
 or sectoral agreements on wages, working conditions, and social and medical bene-
 fits are negotiated in tripartite discussions and formalized by government decree.
 Wages and other benefits can also be negotiated bilaterally between employer and
 union and the results of such negotiations are filed with the Directorate of Labor.
 The Secondary School Teachers Union (SIPES) threatened to strike in April to
 protest the Government's unwillingness to grant wage concessions and implement
 Islamast dress and other practices in the schools. The Government threatened to dis-
 miss teachers who struck, briefly occupied SIPES headquarters, and detained under
 house arrest some 15 SIPES leaders. The Government linked SIPES to incitement
 of student demonstrations in March over increased transportation costs arising from
 fuel price rises. Some members of SIPES struck on May 7 for 2 hours without inci-
 dent. All SIPES detainees had been released by July. en the National Order of
 Lawyers threatened to strike in July, concessions were made and the strike was
 averted.
 Laws provide workers with protection against antiunion discrimination and em-
 ployees or employers may bring labor disputes to three-person labor tribunals ad-
 ministered jointly by the Ministries of Justice and Labor with the participation of
 union and employer representatives.
 There ae no exprt processing zones.
 c. Prohibitsn of Forced or Compuisoiy Labor.-The Government prohibits forced
 and bonded labor, including by children, but does not enforce this prohibition effec-
 tively in specific cases (also see Section 5).
 Mauritanians continue to suffer the effects of generations of the practice of slav-
 ery and of slave caste distinctions in both Moor and Afro-Mauritanian communities.
 Slavery was officially abolished three times in Mauritania, most recently by the
 post-independence government in 1980.
 A system of officially sanctioned slavery in which government and society join to
 force individuals to serve masters does not exist; however, slavery in the form of
 unofficial voluntary or forced and involuntary servitude persists. Many persons con-
 tinue to live in conditions of unofficial paid or unpaid servitude and many persons
 still consider themselves to be slaves.
 NGO positions on the existence of slavery are not uniform. For example, SOS-
 Esclaves in an April report characterizes slavery as a persistent social reality,
 whose occurrence among disadvantaged classes is far from negligible. The OAU's Af-
 rican Commissioni Human and People's Rights report issued in April disputed the
 conclusions of SOS-Esclaves. While not dismissing the possibility of isolated cases
 of slavery in the remote countryside, the Commission concluded that the persistence
 of vestiges of slavery was the more convincing explanation of social relations. Anti-
 Slavery International believes th there is insufficient evidence one way or the
 other to conclude whether    r  o     y exists, and that an in depth, long term
 study was required to determine whether the practice continues. M
 
 
 Adult males cannot be obliged by law to remain with their masters nor can they
 be returned if they leave. Adult females with children, however, may have greater
 difficulties and may be compelled by pressures other than physical force to remain
 in a condition of servitude. For example, in some cases, former masters refuse to
 allow children to accompany their mothers; in other cases, the greater economic re-
 sponsibility of a family may be the principal impediment to seeking a new life. Chil-
 dren's legal status is more tenuous than that of adults.
 There were no reported cases of sales or "transfers" of individuals--often chil-
 dren-from one employer or master to another. There were occasional confirmed
 cases of "transfers" in 1996, but reports of sales are rare, cannot be confirmed, and
 are confined to past years. In several highly publicized cases, children were returned
 from former masters claiming to be their fat ers to their mothers. The longstanding
 case of Aichana Mint Abeid Boilil came to a close in January when her last child
 was returned to her. In an inheritance case in Boutilimit, a young woman given to
 the son of her former master, was returned to her family in Nouakchott.
 Many citizens, whether Moor or Afro-Mauritanian, continue to call themselves
 "slave" even though they are legally free to live and work where they choose. This
 is exacerbated by the Governments weak record of enforcing the ban on slavery.
 Many individuals still live with masters or former masters. Poverty, persistent
 drought, and a weak economy provide few economic alternatives for many and leave
 some former slaves open to possible exploitation by former masters. Significant
 numbers, especially in the cities, work for former masters for a pittance or in ex-
 change for room and board, clothing, and medical benefits. Some also receive gifts
 on important family occasions such as births, marriages, and deaths. Invisible but
 crippling psychological bonds make it difficult for many individuals, who have gen-
 erations of forebearers who were slaves, to think of themselves as free from former
 masters. Because of religious instruction in the past, some individuals continue to
 link themselves to former masters and fear religious sanction if that bond is broken
 by anyone else.
 "Slave" as a caste designation is common to all ethnic groups--Sub-Saharan Afro-
 Mauritanian groups as well as Moor. The legacy of these caste distinctions continues
 to affect the status and opportunities available to various groups of Mauritanians.
 In some groups, for example, individuals of a higher caste who seek to marry some-
 one of a lower caste may be barred by the community, and in Soninke communities
 members of the slave caste cannot be buried in the same cemetery as other castes.
 President Taya used his January 9 speech on the eve of Ramadan to publicly ad-
 dress the issue of slavery and its legacy in Mauritania for the first time. The speech
 aroused widespread public debate over the slavery question in newspapers and
 among NGO's. Over 200 articles on the subject appeared. Only one newspaper, Al-
 Akhbar on January 28, was censored for an article related to the debate.
 The Government focuses on education, literacy, and agrarian reform as the main
 means to eradicate the vestiges of slavery. Its record in cases in which an individ-
 ual's civil rights are affectedbecause of status as a former slave, however, is weak.
 When complaints were filed with the Government to remedy cases involving deten-
 tion of individuals against their will, the Government intervened in accordance with
 the law, although sometimes only after considerable prodding and passage of time.
 A mother appealed a February 1996 ruling by a magistrate in Brakna givin~g cus-
 tody of her two children to a former master who claimed to be their father. e was
 later determined actually to be their father and received custody. Determination of
 such cases is problematic in a country where there is polygyny, "secret" marriages,
 no written records, and divorce by repudiation. The courts are prepared to pursue
 the concept of genetic testing to determine paternity, but no such cases have yet
 been brought.
 Three NGO's, SOS-Esclaves, the National Committee for the Strmggle Against the
 Vestiges of Slavery in Mauritania, and the Initiative for the Support of the Activi-
 ties of the President, had as their focus issues related to the history of slavery in
 Mauritania. Of these, SOS-Esclaves was particularly active in bringing to public at-
 tention cases in which it found the rights of former slaves to have been abridged,
 and in assisting former slaves in their difficulties with former masters. Other
 human ihts and civic action NGO's also follow this issue closely. The independent
 Arss, wich includes journals that are published by Haratines and Afro-
 Mauritanians who emphasize issues of importance to these ethnic groups, is also
 quick to report any incident that comes to its attention in which the rights of former
 alaves have not been respected.
 Inheritance disputes between Haratines and the descendants of their former mas-
 ters arose several times and were adjudicated in court. Most such disputes are de-
 cided in accordance with the law, and rule that the descendants of the former slaves
 
 
 223
 should inherit their property. There has been no further action on the 1994 land
 case that was still under review in 1996.
 In a 1995 case, the Supreme Council of the Magistrature removed a magistrate
 from the bench because he ruled, contrary to the law, that a former master, rather
 than the former slave's descendants, should inherit the possessions of a former
 slave. On December 28, 1996, the Supreme Council of the Magistrature removed the
 magistrate in Kankossa from the bench because he refused to accept the provisions
 of the 1980 law abolishing slavery. The Government censured for a human rights-
 related cause at least one of the other three judges removed at the same time. The
 removal of these magistrates emphasize to other judges that the provisions of the
 1980 law apply.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The
 Labor Code states explicitly that children must not be employed before the age of
 14 unless the Minister of Labor grants an exception due to local circumstances. The
 Government prohibits forced and bonded labor by children but does not enforce this
 prohibition effectively in certain specific cases (see Sections 5 and 6.c.). The Govern-
 ment has a functional labor inspectorate empowered to refer cases directly to the
 appropriate judicial authorities. The Government lacks sufficient resources to en-
 force existing child labor laws (see Section 5).
 Education is not compulsory, and for financial and other reasons, 15 percent of
 school-age children do not regularly attend government schools. Labor law specifies
 that no child under the age of 13 years may be employed in the agricultural sector
 without the permission of the Minister of Labor, nor under the age of 14 years in
 the nonagricultural sector. The law provides that employed children between the
 ages of 14 and 16 should receive 70 percent of the minimum wage, and those be-
 tween the ages of 17 and 18 should receive 90 percent of the minimum wage.
 Young children in the countryside commonly pursue herding, cultivation, fishing,
 and other significant labor in support of their families' activities. In keeping with
 longstanding tradition, many children serve apprenticeships in small industries and
 in the informal sector. There is no child labor in the modern industrial sector.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The minimum wage for adults is approxi-
 mately $53.55 (8,300 ouguiya) per month) and has not been raised since 1992. It
 is difficult for the average family to meet its minimum needs and maintain a decent
 standard of living at this salary. The standard, legal, nonagricultural workweek
 may not exceed either 40 hours or 6 days without overtime compensation, which is
 paid at rates that are graduated according to the number of supplemental hours
 worked. Domestic workers and certain other categories work 56 hours. The Labor
 Directorate of the Ministry of Labor is responsible for enforcement of the labor laws,
 but in practice inadequate funding limits the effectiveness of the Directorate's en-
 forcement.
 The Ministry of Labor is also responsible for enforcing safety standards but does
 so inconsistently, due to inadequate funding. In principle workers can remove them-
 selves from hazardous conditions without risking loss of employment; in practice,
 they cannot.
