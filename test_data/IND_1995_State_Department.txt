 INDIA
 India is a longstanding parliamentary democracy with a free press, a civilian-con-
 trolled military, an independent judiciary, and active political parties and civic asso-
 ciations. Competitive elections produce regular changes of leadership at the na-
 tional, state, and municipal levels.
 Although the 25 state governments have primary responsibility for maintaining
 law and order, the central Government provides guidance and support through use
 of national, paramilitary forces. The Union Ministry for Home Affairs controls the
 nationwide police service, most of the paramilitary forces, and the internal intel-
 ligence bureaus. Paramilitary forces are deployed throughout India and have com-
 mitted significant human rights abuses, particularly in Jammu and Kashmir.
 India has a mixed economy. The private sector is predominant in agriculture,
 most nonfinancial services, consumer goods manufacturing, and some heavy indus-
 try. The Government continued economic liberalization and structural reforms
 begun in 1991. India's economic problems are compounded by rapid population
 growth of 2 percent per year with a current total well above 900 million. Income
 distribution remained very unequal. Forty percent of the urban population and half
 the rural population live below the poverty level.
 There continue to be significant human rights abuses, despite extensive constitu-
 tional and statutory safeguards. Many of these abuses are generated by intense so-
 cial tensions, violent secessionist movements and the authorities' attempts to re-
 press them, and deficient police methods and training. These problems are acute in
 Kashmir, where the judicial system has been disrupted both by terrorist threats, in-
 cluding the assassination of judges and witnesses, and by judicial tolerance of the
 Government's heavy handed antimilitant tactics.
 Serious human rights abuses include: extrajudicial executions and other political
 killings, torture, and excessive use of force by security forces and separatist mili-
 tants, as well as kidnaping and extortion by militants, in Kashmir and Northeast
 India; torture, rape, and deaths of suspects in olice custody throughout India; arbi-
 trary arrest and incommunicado detention in Kashmir and the Northeast; continued
 detention throughout the country of thousands arrested under special security legis-
 lation; long trial delays; widespread intercaste and communal violence; legal and so-
 cietal discrimination as well as extensive violence, both societal and by police and
 other agents of government, against women; discrimination and violence against in-
 digenous people; and widespread exploitation of indentured, bonded, and child labor.
 ]uring 1995 India made significant proK~ss in resolving human rights problems.
 The Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA), special security
 legislation under which thousands of persons had been held for prolonged periods
 without charges, was allowed to lapse. The International Committee of the Red
 Cross (ICRC) and the Government reached an agreement to permit prison visits in
 Kashmir. The ICRC made its first visits to prisoners in October. In Punjab, the in-
 surgent violence of past years has largely disappeared, and there is visible progess
 in correcting patterns of abuse by police. The assassination of the Punjab Chief in-
 ister at the end of August, an isolated exception to restored civil peace in the state,
 resulted in neither a widespread crackdown nor a breakdown of order. The National
 Human Rights Commission continues to play a useful role in addressing patterns
 of abuse, as well as specific abuses, and is consolidating an attitudinal shift toward
 acknowledgment of human rights problems as it seeks to create a "human rights
 culture" through educational programs.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Political killings by both government
 forces and insurgents continued at a high rate in the state of Jammu and Kashmir
 and the seven northeastern states, where separatist insurgencies continued.
 Extrajudicial killings of suspected militants by security forces in Kashmir contin-
 ued at a high level, but some credible observers believed that they had declined
 somewhat compared with previous years. Still, human rights gups consider credi-
 ble reports that dozens of such killings occur every month. Typically, those killed
 were detained by security forces, and their bodies, bearing multiple bullet wounds
 and often marks of torture were returned to relatives or were otherwise discovered
 the same day or a few days later. Well-documented evidence to corroborate individ-
 ual cases or quantify trends is lacking. Nevertheless, press reports and anecdotal
 evidence leave no doubt that the pattern exists. Security forces claim that these
 killings, when they are acknowledged, occur in armed encounters with militants.
 
 
 1311
 Terrorist attacks accounted for hundreds of deaths. As in the past, Kashmiri mili-
 tant groups carried out politically motivated killings on a wide scale, targeting
 progoverument politicians, government officials, alleged police informers, civilians,
 members of rival factions, and non-political community leaders who dared call for
 an end to violence in the state.
 The total number of deaths in Kashmir remained very close to 1994's toll. Reliable
 press reports indicate that 1050 civilians, 202 security force personnel and 1308
 militants died in insurgency-related violence in Kashmir.
 In Punjab, the assassination of Chief Minister Beant Singh at the end of August
 was the year's first instance of terrorist violence, although acts of violence attrib-
 uted to Sikh militants occurred in other Indian states during 1995, particularly in
 Jammu. Killings of Sikh militants by police in armed encounters appear to be vir-
 tually at an en . During the first 8 months of the year, only two  rsons were killed
 in police encounters. Attention was focused on past abuses in Wunjab by press re-
 ports that hundreds of bodies, many allegedly those of persons who died in
 unacknowledged police custody, were cremated as "unclaimed" during 1991-1993 or
 discovered at the ttom of recently drained canals.
 Numerous alleged criminals continue to be killed in encounters with police. Police
 personnel were wounded in a number of these encounters, however, and such inci-
 dents do not appear to reflect a pattern of extrajudicial execution.
 While extrajudicial killings continued in areas buffeted by separatist insurgencies,
 the press andi judicir continued to give attention to deaths in police custody and
 faked encounter killings elsewhere in india. Such deaths probably numbered 100 to
 200 in 1995. In April, the Supreme Court ordered prosecution of five Punjab police-
 men accused of the murder of a couple in Calcutta 2 years earlier. Charges were
 brought against police in Uttar Pradesh in the case of a youth who died after being
 beaten in custody. In Delhi, 6 policemen were suspended and one arrested on
 charges related to the death in custody of Rajesh Montoo Suresh.
 Killings by Maoist Revolutionary Naxalites continued in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar,
 Orissa, and West Bengal. Naxalites held "people's courts" in which village headmen
 and others were condemned to death and summarily executed as "class enemies"
 and "caste oppressors." For example, in August 1995, a Congress Party district lead-
 er in Bihar was beheaded by Naxaites. The Andhua Pradesh government claimed
 that Naxalites killed 103 persons during 1994. Some politicians, human rights
 groups, and the press claimed that faked encounter killings and excessive violence
 by police againt Naxalites continued, but individual cases in 1995 have not been
 documented._ In Andhra Pradesh, police violence against Naxalites was expected to
 abate after the state government in May called an end to an anti-Naxalite campaign
 by police in a unilateral gestur  e ae encouraging reconciliation. Naxalites be-
 longing to the Peoples War Group in Andhra Pradesh were reportedly responsible
 for the assassination in December of National Parliament member Magunta
 Subarami Reddy.
 Extensive, complex patterns of violence continued in the seven states of north-
 eastern India. Numerous killings can be attributed to conflicts in each of the follow-
 ing categories: between indigenous people, usually Buddhist or animist, and immi-
 grant groups, usually Muslim or Hindu; between tribes of indigenous people; be-
 tween security forces and militants of one or more of at least 18 insurgent groups;
 and among factions of insurgent groups.
 Ripunjay Acharjya and em Candra Sharma were arrested in Nayakpura,
 Assam in February. Their bodies were later found with bullet wounds. Both were
 alleged to have ties to the militant separatist organization United Liberation Front
 of Assam. In March Nationalist Social Council of Nagaland militants assassinated
 the Deputy Commissioner of the Kohima District in Nagaland. In Tripura tribal
 militants attempting to force non-tribals off tribal lands reportedly killed 11 civil-
 ians and 14 paramilitary personnel in July and August, and abduc  some 500 ci-
 vilians during August. More than 100 security force personnel were among the vic-
 tmns of the violence in the Northeast, including 22 of the 26 persons killed in the
 February 25 bombing of a train in eastern Agsam.
 There were several killings related to state assembly election campaigns early in
 the year. In Bihar at least 10 people, including two policemen, died in election-relat-
 ed violence. This violence appeared to reflect rivalries between individual candidates
 or between caste groups in individual villages, not a coordinated effort by any group
 to affect the election outcome through intimidation.
 b. Disappearance.-Accrding to credible reports from national human rights
 groups, unacknowledged, incommunicado detention of suspected militants continued
 in Kashmir although the practice diminished as compared with previous years. The
 Government acknowledges that, as of April, it held 3,023 persons in connection with
 the insurgency in five detention centers in Jammu and Kashmir. Of these, 1,331
 
 
 1312
 were held under the Public Safety Act and 1,692 under the Terrorist and Disruptive
 Activities Act. Several thousand others are held in short-term confinement in transit
 and interrogation centers. Human rights groups maintain that as many as 3,000
 more are held in long-term incommunicado detention.
 The Government maintains that screening committees run by the state govern-
 ment provide information about detainees to their families. However, other sources
 indicate that families are able to confirm the detention of their relatives only by
 bribing prison guards. A program of prison visits by the International Committee
 of the-ed Cross (ICRC), under an agreement with the Indian Government signed
 in June is designed in part to help assure communications between detainees and
 their families. The ICRC prison visits began in October.
 In Punjab, the pattern of disappearances prevalent a few years ago appears to be
 much diminished. Although there is no reason to believe that missing or faulty ar-
 rest records are less a problem in Punjab than in the rest of India, there were only
 a few reports of disappearances or unacknowledged arrests associated with sus-
 pected militant activity. In early September, Jaswant Singh Khalra, Secretary Gen-
 eral of the Akali Dal Party's human rights cell, was allegedly taken from his home
 by uniformed police. The state police asserted to human rights groups and in re-
 sponse to a Supreme Court order that they were not holding Khalra. Another Su-
 preme Court order required a report on the abduction by September 29. After the
 state government failed to respond adequately to previous orders, the Supreme
 Court in November ordeed the Central Bureau of Investigation to take over the in-
 vestigation. By years end, the investigation had yielded no results. In another case,
 the brother of SurinderSingh Fauji was held for a week by police in incommunicado
 detention, apparently in an effort to persuade Fauji not to testify on extrajudicial
 executions he witnessed in 1993.
 There are credible reports that police throughout India often do not file required
 arrest reports. As a result, there are hundreds of unsolved disappearances in which
 relatives claim an individual was taken into police custody and never heard from
 again. Police usually deny these claims, countering that there are no records of ar-
 rest.
 Militants in Kashmir and the Northeast have increasingly resorted to kidnapings
 to sow terror, seek the release of detained comrades, and extort funds. According
 to the Government, Kashmiri militants kidnaped 548 persons in 1995, of which 207
 were killed by their captors. In July, two Americans, two Britons, a German and
 a Norwegian were kidnaped by separatist militants in Kashmir. One American es-
 caped, the Norwegian was beheaded, and the others were still held at year's end.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The law prohibits torture, and confessions extracted by force are generally inadmis-
 sible in court. Nevertheless, there is credible evidence that torture is common
 throughout India and that the authorities often use torture during interrogations.
 In other instances, they torture detainees to extort money and sometimes as sum-
 mary punishment. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has called on
 the Government to sign the 1984 International Convention Against Torture.
 Human rights groups continue to report that police and paramilitary forces use
 torture during interrogations in Kashmir and the Northeast. Past practices have in-
 cluded beating, rape, burning with cigarettes and hot rods, suspension by the feet,
 crushing of limbs by heavy rollers, and electric shocks. Because many alleged tor-
 ture victims die in custody, and others are afraid to speak out, there are few first-
 hand accounts, although the marks of torture have often been found on the bodies
 of deceased detainees. The prevalence of torture by police in detention facilities
 throughout India is borne out by the number of cases of deaths in police custody
 (see Section L.a.). The rape of persons in custody is part of the broader pattern of
 custodial abuse.
 Although custodial abuse is deeply rooted in police practices, increased press re-
 porting and parliamentary questions offer evidence of growing public awareness of
 the problem. The NHRC has identified torture and deaths in detention as one of
 its priority concerns. It has directed district magistrates to report all custodial
 deaths within 24 hours and stated that failure to do so will be interpreted as an
 attempted coverup. Magistrates appear to be complying with this directive.
 At the end of the 1994-95 fiscal year, inquiries by the NHRC were pending in
 107 cases of death in custody. Prstion of police has been initiated in two cases
 and was recommended by the NHRC in a third case. In Bihar, an investigation by
 the NHRC's Investigative Branch into custodial deaths mentioned in a report by
 Amnesty International resulted in prosecution in 14 out of the 15 cases cited in the
 re  At
 Were are three classes of prison facilities. Prisoners are not classified by the na-
 ture of their crimes, but by their standing in society. Class "C" prisoners are those
 
 
 1313
 who cannot prove they are college graduates or income taxpayers. Their cells are
 overcrowded, often have dirt floors, no furnishings, and poor sanitary conditions.
 The food is of poor quality and the medical care inadequate. The use of handcuffs
 and fetters is common. Class "B" prisoners-college graduates and taxpayers-are
 held under markedly better conditions. Class "A" prisoners are prominent persons,
 as designated by the Government, and are accorded private rooms, visits, and ade-
 quate food, which may be supplemented by their families. Class "A" prisoners are
 usually held in government guest houses.
 Overcrowding in Indian jails is severe. Prisons often house more than three times
 their design capacity. According to a statement in Parliament in 1994 by Minister
 of State for Home Affairs, New Delhi's Tihar Jail considered one of the best-ran in
 India, housed in March 8,577 prisoners--in facilities designed to hold 2,487. Accord-
 ing to the Minister, 7,505 detainees awaited the completion of their trials, while 672
 others have been on trial for 3 years or longer.
 With the exception of an agreement with the ICRC for visits to detention facilities
 in Kashmir, the Government does not allow NGO's to monitor prison conditions.
 Nevertheless, prison conditions are a subject of press reports and have received at-
 tention from human rights groups. Press accounts of prison conditions include re-
 ports of sexual abuse of prisoners, the use of prisoners by prison officials as domes-
 tic servants, the sale of food and milk for prisoners on the black market, the sale
 of female prisoners to brothels, and the marketing and export of prison-made goods.
 Women constitute 2 to 6 percent of the total prison population, according to the
 1987 Justice Krishna Ryer Report. Although Parliament passed the Children's Act
 of 1960 to safeguard young prisoners against abuse and exploitation, and the Juve-
 nile Justice Act of 1986 provides that boys under 16 years and girls under 18 years
 are not to be held in prison, most states have not implemented these acts. The Su-
 preme Court has criticized the state governments for not providing reformatories
 and separate detention facilities for children.
 In July the death by illness of businessman Rajan Pillai while he was detained
 awaiting an extradition hearing caused a public outcry. A court had ruled against
 releasing Pillai for medical treatment. A commission of inquiry has been appointed
 to investigate his death.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exil.--Over the past decade, the Government
 implemented a variety of special security laws intended to help law enforcement au-
 thorities fight separatist insurgency. There were credible reports of widespread arbi-
 trary arrest and detention under these laws. One of these laws that had been sub-
 ject to the most extensive abuse, the Terrorism and Disruptive Practices (Preven-
 tion) Act, lapsed in May and, at year's end, had not been reinstated or replaced.
 As of June 30, 6,060 persons arrested under the Act were held in a number of
 states. Although TADA detainees continued to be released, many were still held at
 year's end.
 The Constitution requires that detainees have the right to be informed of the
 grounds for arrest, have the right to be represented by counsel, and, unless the per-
 son is held under a preventive detention law, the right to appear before a mag-
 istrate within 24 hours of arrest. At this initial appearance, the accused must either
 be remanded for further investigation or released The Supreme Court has upheld
 these provisions. An accused person must be informed of his right to bail at the time
 of arrest and may, unless he is held on a non-bailable offense, apply for bail at any
 time. The police must file a charge sheet within 60 to 90 days of arrest; if they fail
 to do so, court approval of a bail application becomes mandatory.
 The Constitution permits preventive detention laws in the event of threats to pub-
 lic order and national security. These laws provide for limits on the length of deten-
 tion and for judicial review. Several laws of this type remain in effect.
 The National Security Act (NSA) of 1980 permits detention of persons considered
 security risks; police anywhere in India (except Kashmir) may detan suspects under
 NSA provisions. Under these provisions the authorities may detain a suspect with-
 out charge or trial as long as 1 year on loosely defined security grounds. The state
 government must confirm the detention order, which is reviewed by an advisory
 bard of three high court judges within 7 weeks or arrest. NSA detainees are per-
 mitted visits by family members and lawyers and must be informed of the grounds
 for detention within 5 days (10 to 15 days in exceptional circumstances). Nation-
 wide, more than two-thirds of the 16,000 people detained under NSA since 1980
 have been released by order of state governments or advisory boards. At year's end,
 514 persons throughout India continue to be detained under NSA.
 The Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act (PSA) of 1978 covers corresponding
 procedures for that state. Over half of the detainees in Jammu and Kashmir are
 held under the PSA.
 
 
 1314
 The court system is overloaded. The result has been the detention of persons
 awaiting trial for periods longer than they would receive if convicted. Prisoners may
 be held months or even years before obtaining a trial date. According to a reply to
 a parliamentary question in July 1994, more than 111,000 criminal cases were
 pending in the Allahabad High Court, the most serious case backlog in the country,
 of which nearly 29,000 cases had been pending for 5 to 8 years.
 The Government does not practice exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria.-India has an independent judiciary with strong
 constitutional safeguards. Under a Supreme Court ruling, the Chief Justice, in con-
 sultation with his colleagues, has a decisive voice in selecting judicial candidates.
 The President appoints the judges, and they serve up to age 62 in the State High
 Courts and age 65 in the Supreme Court.
 Courts of frst resort exist at the subdistrict and district levels. More serious cases
 and appeals are heard in state-level High Courts and by the national-level Supreme
 Court, which also rules on constitutional questions. Subdistrict and district judicial
 magistrates are appointed by state governments. High Court judges are a ppointed
 on the recommendation of the federal Law Ministry, with the advice of the Supreme
 Court, the High Court Chief Justice, and the Chief Minister of the state, usually
 from among district judgs or lawyers practicing before the same courts. Supreme
 Court judges are similary apointed from among High Court judges. The Chief Jus-
 tice is selected on the basis of seniority.
 When legal procedures function normally, they generally assure a fair trial, but
 the process can be drawn out and inaccessible to the poor. Defendants have the
 right to choose counsel from a bar that is fully independent of the Government.
 There are effective channels for appeal at most levels of the judicial system.
 The Criminal Procedure Code provides for an open trial in most cases, but it al-
 lows exceptions in proceedings involving official secrets, trials in which statements
 prejudicial to the safety of the State might be made, or under provisions of special
 security legislation. Sentences must be announced in public.
 Muslim personal status law governs many noncriminal matters involving Mus-
 lims-including family law, inheritance, and divorce. The Government does not
 interfere in the personal laws of the minority communities, with the result that laws
 that discriminate against women are upheld.
 In Kashmir the judicial system barely functions due to threats by militants
 against judges, witnesses, and their family members and because of judicial toler-
 ance of the Government's heavy handed anti-militant actions. Courts there are not
 willing to hear cases involving terrorist crimes or fail to act expeditiously on habeas
 corpus cases. As a result, there have been no convictions of alleged terrorists in
 Kashmir since prior to 1994, even though some militants have been in detention for
 years.
 No persons are known to have been incarcerated soley on the basis of their politi-
 cal views or activities.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Home, or Correspondence.-The police must
 obtain warrants for searches and seizures. In a criminal investigation, the police
 may conduct searches without warrants to avoid undue delay but they must justify
 the searches in writing to the nearest magistrate with jurisdiction over the offense.
 The authorities in Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, and Assam have special powers
 to search and arrest without a warrant.
 The Indian Telegraph Act authorizes the surveillance of communications, includ-
 ing monitoring telephone conversation and intercepting personal mail-in case of
 public emergency or -in the interest of the public safety or tranquility." These pow-
 ers have been used by every state government.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-Both government forces and militants continue to commit serious violations
 of humanitarian law in the disputed state of Jammu and Kashmir. It is believed
 that between 350,000 and 400,000 Indian army, paramilitary forces, and police are
 deployed in Jammu and Kashmir. The Muslim majority population in the Kashmir
 Valley is caught between the repressive tactics of the security forces and acts of ter-
 rorist violence committed by the militants. Under the Jammu and Kashmir Dis-
 turbed Areas Act, and the Armed Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act,
 both passed in July 1990, security forces personnel have extraordinary powers, in-
 cluding authority to shoot suspected lawbreakers and those disturbing the peace,
 and to destroy structures suspected of harboring militants or arms.
 Although civilian deaths caused by the security forces in Kashmir continued at
 high levels and precise data are lacking, credible reports from Kashmir suggest that
 they diminished somewhat for the second consecutive year. Increased attention to
 human rights by security force personnel and publicized disciplinary action against
 offenders appear to be having some effect in moderating use of force by the govern-
 
 
 1315
 ment, according to reports from Kashmiris. In response to parliamentary questions
 in April, the Government stated that, between January 1990 and March 1995, 167
 security force personnel including 15 army officers had been punished for offenses
 against civilians in Kashmir, including rape, murder, theft, and use of excessive
 force, although few officers are known to have recieved prison sentences.
 Kashmiri militant groups were also guilty of serious human rights abuses. Mili-
 tants launched a series of attacks on traditional political figures in an effort to scut-
 tle progress towards a political process. In addition to political killings and
 kidnapings (see Sections i.a. and 1b) militants engaged in extortion and carried
 out acts of random terror that left hundreds of Kashmiris dead. In July and August,
 to cite only a few examples, three terrorist bombs in Jammu and Srinagar killed
 dozens of persons. Terrorist acts by Kashmiri militant groups have also t en place
 outside Jammu and Kashmir. Many of the terrorists are not Indian citizens.
 Kashmiris continued to be caught in the crossfire between militants and security
 forces. At least 5 civilians were killed in fierce fighting at the Charar-e-Sharif shrine
 in May. During a battle between militant and security forces, a fire destroyed over
 1,000 homes and the 500-year-old Sufi shrine in the town. The militants and the
 Government have traded charges over who is to blame for the fire.
 In the Northeast excesses resulting in civilian deaths were committed by both se-
 curity forces and militants. Near Kohimna in Nagagland paramilitary Rashtriya Ri-
 fles reportedly panicked after an attack on their convoy and fired mortars and as-
 sault rifles into nearby settlements. Six civilians and 2 policemen were reported
 killed and over 20 injured in the incident (see Section L.a.) Section 2 Respect for
 Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution protects these freedoms, and
 with some limitations they are exercised in practice. A vigorous press reflects a wide
 variety of public, social, and economic beliefs. Newspapers and magazines regularly
 publish investigative reports and allegations of government wrongdoing, and the
 press as a whole champions human rights and criticizes perceived government
 apses. The Press Council of India is a statutory body of journalists, publishers, aca-
 demics, and politicians with a chairman appointed by the Government. Designed to
 be a self-regulating mechanism for the press, it investigates complaints of irrespon-
 sible journalism and sets a code of conduct for publishers. This code includes not
 publishing articles or details that might incite caste or communal violence. The
 council publicly criticizes newspapers or journalists it believes to have broken the
 code of conduct, but its findings, while noted by the press community, carry no legal
 weight.
 National television and radio, which are government monopolies, are frequently
 accused of manipulating the news to the benefit of the Government. However, inter-
 national satellite television is widely distributed in middle class neighborhoods via
 cable and is gradually eroding the Government's monopoly on television.
 Under the Official Secrets Act (OSA), the Government may restrict publication of
 sensitive stories but the Government sometimes interprets this broadly to suppress
 criticism of its policies. The 1971 Newspapers Incitements to Offenses Act remains
 in effect in Jammu and Kashmir. Under the Act, a district magistrate may prohibit
 the press from carrying material resulting in "incitement to murder" or "any act of
 violence." As punishment, the Act stipulates that the authorities may seize news-
 papers and printing presses. Despite these restrictions, newspapers in Srinagar reg-
 ulary carry militant press releases attacking the Government and report in detail
 on alleged human rights abuses. The authorities allowed foreign journalists to travel
 freely in Kashmir, where they regularly spoke with militant leaders, and filed re-
 ports on government abuse.
 Kashmiri groups threatened journalists and editors and even imposed temporary
 bans on some publications. In July the Urdu-language press in Srinagar went on
 strike for more than a week to protest conflicting threats from rival militant factions
 and the related kidnaping of three journalists. In September a photographer was
 killed and two other employees injured when the British Broadcasting Corporation
 (BBC) office in Srinagar was bombed. A reporter for Zee Television and Outlook
 magazine was shot in December outside Partan after being dragged out of a taxi
 in which he was riding.
 In Tamil Nadu, the state government in a number of cases abused police powers
 in reaction to press criticism. For example, the editor of a leading daily was arrested
 for publishing expunged portions of assembly proceedings. The state High Court, in
 rejecting the case against the editor, criticized the state government for "frequent
 or indiscriminat use of power."
 A government censorship board reviews films before licensing them for distribu-
 tion. The board deletes material deemed offensive to public morals or communal
 sentiment. Producers of video news magazines must also submit their products to
 
 
 1316
 a government censorship board which occasionally censors stories that portray the
 Government in an unfavorable light. The board's ruling may be appealed and over-
 turned.
 Citizens enjoy complete academic freedom and students and faculty espouse a
 wide range of views. In addition to 10 national universities and about 160 state uni-
 versities, states are empowered to accredit locally run private institutions.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution protects the
 right of peaceful assembly and the right to form associations, and these rights are
 generally respected in practice.
 Authorities sometimes require permits and notification prior to holding parades
 or demonstrations, but local governments ordinarily respect the right to protest
 peacefully. At times of civil tension, authorities may ban public assemblies or im-
 pose curfew under section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The authorities in
 Punjab frequently imposed such restrictions in previous years but limited their use
 since 1994; opposition Akali parties were pernitted to hold public rallies and con-
 duct membership drives.
 In Tamil Nadu, police often withhold permission for demonstrations by opposition
 grups and this practice was criticized by the National Human Rights Commission
 during its visit to the state early in the year. The state government also resorts to
 preventive detention on a massive scale as a means of restricting opposition dem-
 onstrations. For example, 30,000 people were reportedly detainedthe day before a
 general strike called for May4.
 The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act prohibits the establishment of organiza-
 tions that promote communal hatred. The Government used this Act to prohibit two
 organizations, one Hindu and one Muslim, after Hindus destroyed a mosque in
 Ayodhya in December 1992. The ban on the Hindu organization was lifted following
 a judicial decision in June, however, and the authorities have not rigorously en-
 forced the ban. Srinagar and other parts of Jammu and Kashmir were under spo-
 radic curfew during much of the year.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-India is a secular state in which all faiths generally enjoy
 freedom of worship. Government policy does not favor any religious group. There is
 no national law to bar proselytizing by Indian Christians. Foreign missionaries can
 generally renew their visas but since the mid-1960's the Government has refused
 to admit new resident foreign missionaries. Those who arrive now do so as tourists
 and stay for short periods. As of January 1993, there were 1,923 registered foreign
 Christian missionaries in India. As in the past, state officials refused to issue per-
 mits for foreign Christian missionaries to enter some northeastern states. Tensions
 between Hin us and Muslims continue to pose a challenge to the secular foundation
 of the state (see Section 5).
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Citizens enjoy freedom of movement within the country except in cer-
 tain border areas where, for security reasons, special permits are required. Under
 the Passports Act of 1967, the Government may deny a passport to any applicant
 who "may or is likely to engage outside India in activities prejudicial to the sov-
 ereignty and integrity of India. The Government uses this provision to prohibit the
 foreign travel of some government critics especially those advocating Sikh independ-
 ence.
 Citizens may emigrate without restriction. Millions of people of Indian origin live
 abroad.
 Although India is not a signatory to the U.N. Convention and Protocol on Refu-
 gees, the Government follows its general principles and has, on the whole, main-
 tained an excellent record of receiving and caring for refugees. The Government rec-
 ognizes certain groups including Chakmas from Bangladesh and Tamils from Sri
 Lanka as refugees by providing assistance in refugee camps or in resettlement
 areas, as in the case of Tibetans. The Government neither deorts Aghans, Bur-
 mese, and other nationalities nor recognizes them as refugees. instead these people
 receive renewable residence permits and are recogied as refugees by the United
 Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHC    or are ignored.
 No further Chakma refugees were repatriated during 1995 pursuant to a 1993
 agreement with the Government of Bangladesh. Human rights groups had claimed
 that these repatriations had in some cases been involuntary. The Government has
 rejected offers by the UNHCR to monitor Chakma repatriations. Human rights or-
 ganizations continue to claim that the Government has reduced rations and cash as-
 sistance to refugee camps holding Chakmas to encourage them to repatriate.
 According to the UNHCR, 56,829 Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka were living in
 India at the end of August, in 113 camps in the state of Tamil Nadu. Approximately
 30,000 more are living with friends and relatives, and 1,311 suspected of militant
 activities are detained in special camps. The state government, using central gov-
 
 
 1317
 ernment resources, provides shelter and subsidized food for those in the camps. En-
 forcement of a Tamil Nadu government ban on nongovernmental organization
 (NGO) assistance to the camps has been relaxed and NGO's have visited the camps.
 Voluntary repatriation of Tamil refugees under LTNHCR supervision continued with
 7 sailings in January and February, on which 3,576 Tamil refugees were repatri-
 ated.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens exercise this right freely. India has a democratic, parliamentary system
 of government with representatives elected in multiparty elections under universal
 adult suffrage. A parliament sits for 5 years unless dissolved earlier for new elec-
 tions, except under constitutionally defined emergency situations. State govern-
 ments are elected at regular intervals except in states under President's Rule. On
 the advice of the Prime Minister, the President may proclaim a state of emergency
 in any state in the event of war, external aggression, or armed rebellion. Similarly,
 President's Rule may be declared in the event of a collapse of a state's constitutional
 machinery. The Supreme Court in May upheld the Government's authority to sus-
 pend fundamental rights during an emergency.
 A Government proposal to hold elections in Jammu and Kashmir in December
 came to nothing when the National Election Commission declared that conditions
 in the state were not suitable for holding elections. President's Rule therefore con-
 tinued in Jammu and Kashmir throughout the year and was extended in December
 for an additional 6 months. Presidents Rule was also declared in Uttar Pradesh in
 October after a coalition state government collapsed for the second time in 5
 months. President's Rule in Manipur ended in December 1994, when a new elected
 government took office.
 There are no legal impediments to the participation by women in the political
 process. A large proportion of women participate in voting throughout the country,
 and numerous women represent all major parties in the national and state legisla-
 tures.
 The Constitution reserves seats in Parliament and state legislatures for "sched-
 uled tribes" and "scheduled castes" in proportion to their population (see Section 5).
 Indigenous people participate actively in national and local politics, but their impact
 depends on their numerical strength. In the northeastern states, indigenous people
 are a large proportion of the population and consequently exercise a dominant politi-
 cal influence in the political process. In Maharashtra and Gujarat, on the other
 hand, tribal peoples are a small minority and have been unsuccessful in blocking
 projects they oppose.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Independent human rights organizations operate throughout India investigating
 abuses and publishing their findings which are often the basis for reports by inter-
 national human rights groups. However, the police have targeted human rights
 monitors for arrest and harassment.
 The Government appointed a National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) in Oc-
 tober 1993 with powers to investigate and recommend policy changes, punishment,
 and compensation in cases of police abuse. In addition, the RC is directed to con-
 tribute to the establishment, growth, and functioning of nongovernmental human
 rights organizations. The Government apoints the members and finances the oper-
 ations of-the NHRC. Although the        is prohibited by statute from directly in-
 vestigating allegations of abuse involving army and paramilitary forces, the Com-
 mission has made effective use of indirect inquiries to address abuses by the armed
 forces. During the 1994-95 Indian fiscal year, the NHIRC received 6,835 complaints
 of human rights abuses, as well as 152 cases of custodial death or rape. At the end
 of the fiscal year, 2,483 cases had been dismissed, 1,563 disposed of "with direc-
 tions," 276 concluded, and 1,384 remained pending.  "
 In a February 20 letter addressed to every Member of Parliament, Commission
 Chairman Justice Ranganath Misra strongly urged that the Terrorism and Disrup-
 tive Practices Act (TADA) be allowed to lapse when it expired in May. This letter
 contributed substantially to the decision to let TADA lapse and to subsequent de-
 bate in which Parliament failed to approve successor legislation.
 Acting on its legislated mandate to encourage nongovernmental human rights or-
 ganizations, the Commission organized andfor participated in several joint programs
 with NGO's and associated human rights NGO's with its investigation of individual
 complaints. The Commission has also worked to build a "culture of human rights"
 by actively encouraging the introduction of human rights syllabuses into univer-
 
 
 1318
 sities and public schools. State human rights commissions were established in West
 Bengal and Himachal Pradesh.
 In February United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Jose Ayla
 Lasso came to India and visited the state of Jammu and Kashmir. In June the Gov-
 ernment reached agreement with the International Committee of the Red Cross on
 a program of ICRCGprison visits in Kashmir. Implementation of the ICRC Kashmir
 prison program began in October. By year's end, an initial round of visits to deten-
 tion centers in the Srinagar area had been completed and preparations were under-
 way for visits to detention centers elsewhere in the state and in other states. ICRC
 representatives also continued training of police and border security force personnel
 in international humanitarian law.
 The Government granted requests for visits to India by some international human
 rights organizations but refused others. The Executive Director of Human Rights
 Watch/Asia received permission to visit New Delhi to meet with the National
 Human Rights Commission in May, but other officials of the same organization were
 refused visas earlier in the year. In February the Chairman of the National Human
 Rights Commission called on the Government to permit Amnesty International to
 assess the human rights situation in Kashmir. The Government has not acted on
 this advice.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The traditional caste system as well as differences of ethnicity, religion, and lan-
 g age deeply divide Indian society. Despite laws designed to prevent discrimination,
 ere are other laws as well as social and cultural practices that have a profound
 discriminatory impact.
 Women.-India has an elaborate system of laws to protect the rights of women,
 including the Equal Remuneration Act, the Prevention of Immoral Traffic Act, and
 the Sati (widow burning) Prevention Act and the Dowry Prohibition Act. However,
 the Government often is unable to enforce these laws, especially in rural areas
 where traditions are deeply rooted. Female bondage and forced prostitution are
 widespread in parts of Indian society. According to a government study, borne out
 bypress reporting, violence against women-including molestation, rape, kidnaping,
 andwife murder ("dowry deaths"--has increased over the past decade. Higher fe-
 male mortality at all age levels, including female infanticide and foeticide, accounts
 for a decline in the ratio of females to males to 927 per 1,000 in 1991, from 955
 per 1,000 in 1981 and 972 per 1,000 at the turn of the century.
 Domestic violence in the context of dowry disputes is a serious problem. In the
 typical dowry dispute, a groom's family will harass a woman they believe has not
 provided sufficient dowry. This harassment sometimes ends in the woman's death,
 which family members often try to portray as a suicide or kitchen accident. Al-
 though most "dowry deaths" involve lower and middle-class families the phenome-
 non crosses both caste and religious lines.
 Government figures show a total of 4,277 dowry deaths in 1994, a decrease of
 more than 20 percent from 1993. Under a 1986 amendment to the Penal Code, the
 court must presume the husband or the wife's in-laws are responsible for every un-
 natural death of a woman in the first 7 years of marriage-provided that harass-
 ment is proven.
 In such cases, police procedures require that an officer of deputy superintendent
 rank or above conduct the investigation and that a team of two or more doctors per-
 form the postmortem procedures.
 Nonetheless, convictions in dowry death cases are rare. For example, 357 dowry
 death cases placed before the courts in Delhi from 1992 to 1994 resulted in 6 acquit-
 tals and no convictions; the remaining cases were pending at year's end. Lawyers
 note that judges and prosecutors, usually men, are uninterested in cases of domestic
 violence and susceptible to bribes.
 The personal status laws of the religious communities discriminate against
 women. Under the Indian Divorce Act of 1869, a Christian woman may demand di-
 vorce only in th cae of spousal abuse and certain categories of adultery while for
 a man adultery alone is sufficient. Under Islamic law, a Muslim husband may di-
 vorce his wife spontaneously and unilaterally; there is no such prvision for women.
 Islamic law also allows a man to have up to four wives but prohibits polyandry.
 The Hindu Succession Act provides equal inheritance rights for Hindu women, hut
 married daughters are seldom given a sDare in parental property. Islamic law recog-
 nizes a woman's right of inheritance but specifies that a daughter's share should
 be only one half a son's. Under tribal land systems, notably in Biar, tribal women
 do not have the right to own land. Other laws relating to the ownership of assets
 and land accord women little control over land use, retention, or sale.

 In November a state court acquitted five upper-caste men accused of gang-raping
 lower-caste woman social activist Bhanwari Devi, allegedly in retaliation for her ef-
 forts to ban the traditional practice of child marriage in Rajasthan. Widespread
 press commentary condemned what are seen as spurious grounds for acquittal, as
 well as gender and casteprejudice implicit in the decision.
 There are thousands of grassrots organizations working for social justice and eco-
 nomic advancement of women, in addition to the National Commission for Women.
 The Government usually supports these efforts, despite strong resistance from tradi-
 tionally privileged groups.
 Children.-The Government has made commitments to improve the welfare of
 children. A national authority for the elimination of child labor was formed to co-
 ordinate education, rural development, women and child development, health and
 labor programs with the goal of progressively withdrawing children from the work-
 place and placing them in schools by 2000.
 There are an estimated 500,000 street children nationwide. Child prostitution in
 the cities is rampant, and there is a growing pattern of traffic in child prostitutes
 from Nepal. According to one estimate 5,000 to 7,000 children, mostly age 10 to 18,
 are victims of this traffic.
 The Child Marriage Restraint (Amendment) Act of 1976 prohibits child marriage,
 a traditional practice in northern India. The Act raises the age of marriage for girls
 to 18 years from 15 years, but the Government does not enforce it effectively. Ac-
 cording to one report, 50 percent of the girls in Bihar, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh
 and Madhya Pradesh are married at or before age 16.
 Amniocentesis and sonogram tests are widely misused for sex determination, re-
 sulting in a disproportionate number of abortions of female fetuses. A law passed
 in September 1994, prohibits the use of these tests for sex determination. Human
 rights groups estimate that at least 10,000 cases of female infanticide occur yearly,
 primarily in poor rural areas. Female infanticide and foeticide are factors in the de-
 cline in the ratio of females to males. In addition, parents often give priority in
 health care and nutrition to male infants. Women's rights cups point out that the
 burden of providing girls with an adequate dow  is one factor that makes daugh-
 ters less desirable. Although abetting or taking dowry is theoretically illegal under
 the Dowry Prohibition Act of 1961, it is still widely practiced.
 People With Disabilities.-The Government's Mimstry of Welfare has principal re-
 sponsibility for programs for the disabled, and it delivers comprehensive rehabilita-
 tion services to India's rural population through 16 district centers. A national reha-
 bilitation plan commits the Government to putting a rehabilitation center in each
 of India's more than 400 districts, but services are still concentrated in urban areas.
 The Government reserves 3 percent of positions in official offices and state-owned
 enterprises for people with visual, hearing, or orthopedic disabilities. The Govern-
 ment provides special railway fares, education allowances, scholarships, customs ex-
 emptions, and rehabilitation training to assist people with disabilities. There is no
 legislation or otherwise mandated provision of accessibility for the disabled.
 Indigenous People.-The Innerline Regulations enacted by the British in 1873 still
 provide the basis for safeguarding tribal rights in most of the border states of north-
 eastern India. These regulations prohibit any person, including Indians from other
 states, from going beyond an inner boundary without a valid permit. No rubber,
 wax, ivory, or other forest products may be removed from the protected areas with-
 out prior authorization. No outsiders are allowed to own land in the tribal areas
 without approval from tribal authorities.
 Despite constitutional safeguards, the rights of indigenous groups in eastern India
 are often ignored. There has been encroachment on tribal land in almost all the
 states of eastern India, including by illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and busi-
 nesses which have removed forest and mineral products without authorization.
 Moreover, persons from other backgrounds often usurp places reserved for members
 of tribes and lower castes in national education institutions.
 Such violations have given rise to numerous tribal movements demanding protec-
 tion of land and property rights. The Jharkhand Movement in Bihar and Orissa,
 and the Bodo Movement in Assam, reflect deep economic and social grievances
 among indigenous people. In the Jharkhand area, tribal people complain that they
 have been relegated to unskilled mining jobs, have lost their forests to industrial
 construction, and have been displaced by development projects. The Government
 has considered the creation of an independent Jharkand state, but the affected state
 governments oppose the idea.
 However, there is some local autonomy in the northeast. In Meghalaya tribal
 chiefs still wield influence in certain villages. The Nagaland Government controls
 the rights to certain mineral resources, and autonomous district councils in Tripura,
 
 
 1320
 Assam, and Meghalaya control matters such as education, rural development, and
 forestry in cooperation with the state governors.
 Religious Minorities.-Controversy between Hindus and Muslims continues with
 regard to three sites where mosques were built centuries ago on sites where temples
 are believed to have previously stood. The potential for renewed Hindu-Muslim vio-
 lence remains high.
 The Religious Institutions (Prevention of Misuse) Act makes it an offense to use
 any religious site for political purposes or to use temples for harboring persons ac-
 cused or convicted of crime. While specifically designed to deal with Sikh places of
 worship in the Punjab, the law applies to all religious sites.
 At the outset of the Kashmir insurgency in 1990, fear of political violence drove
 most Hindus in the Kashmir Valley (the Pandits) to seek refuge in camps in Jammu
 or with relatives in New Delhi or elsewhere. The Pandit community criticizes the
 Government for bleak conditions in the camps and fears that a negotiated solution
 giving greater autonomy to the Musim majority might threaten its own survival in
 Kshmir as a culturally and historically distinctive group.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-The Constitution gives the President author-
 ity to specifyr historically disadvantaged castes and tribes which are entitled to af-
 firmnative action in employment and other benefits. These so-called "scheduled
 tribes and castes benefit from special development funds, government hiring quotas,
 and special training programs. A national commission investigates specific com-
 plaints about deprivation of the rights of scheduled castes and tribes and submits
 an annual report.
 The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act of 1989
 specifies new offenses against disadvantaged people and provides stiffer penalties
 for offenders. However, this law has had only a modest effect in curbing abuse. Gov-
 ernment statistics indicate that 10,005 cases of abuse were committed against mem-
 bers of scheduled castes and tribes from January through May, as compared with
 38,912 in all of 1994. The national commission is charged with giving special atten-
 tion to the problems of these minorities.
 The practice of untouchability was in theory outlawed by the Constitution and the
 1955 Civil Rights Act, but it remains an important aspect of life in India. Intercaste
 violence claims hundreds of lives each year.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Associaton.-The Constitution provides for the right of associa-
 tion: workers may establish and join unions of their own choosing without prior au-
 thorization. There are five major recognized national trade union federations, each
 of which is associated with, but not necessarily controlled by, a political party.
 Trade unions often exercise the right to strike, but public sector unions are re-
 quired to give at least 16 days' notice prior to striking. Some states have laws re-
 quiring workers in certain nonpublic sector industries to give prior strike notice.
 The Essential Services Maintenance Act allows the Government to ban strikes
 and requires conciliation or arbitration in specified essential industries. Legal mech-
 anisms exist for challenging the assertion that a given dispute falls within the scope
 of this Act. The Industrial Disputes Act prohibits retribution by employers against
 employees involved in legal strike actions. This prohibition is observed in practice.
 Abuses against nationally organized unions or unionized workers are generally
 not a problem. However unaffiliated unions of low caste or tribal workers are not
 always able to secure for themselves the protections and rights guaranteed by law.
 Unions are free to affiliate with international trade union organizations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right to bargain collec-
 tively has existed for decades. The Trade Union Act prohibits discrimination against
 union members and organizers, and employers may be penalized if they discrimi-
 nate against employees engaged in union activities.
 Collective bargaining is the normal means of setting wages and settling disputes
 in the organized industrial sector. Trade unions vigorously defend worker interests
 in this process. Although a system of specialized labor courts adjudicates labor dis-
 putes, there are long delays and a backlog of unresolved cases. When the parties
 are unable to agree on equitable wages, the Government may set up boards of
 union, management, and government representatives to determine them. In prac-
 tice, legal protections of workers' rights are effective only for the 28 million workers
 in the organized industrial sector, out of a total work force of 376 million. Outside
 the modern industrial sector, laws are difficult to enforce. Union membership is rare
 in this ~"informal" sector and collective bargaining does not exist.
 There are seven export processing zones (EPZs). Entry into the EFZ's is ordi-
 narily limited to the employees. Such entry restrictions apply to union organizers.
 
 
 1321
 While workers in EPZ's have the right to organize and bargain collectively, trade
 union activity is rare. Women constitute the bulk of the work force in the EPZ's.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 labor, and legislation passed in 1976 specifically bans the practice of"bonded labor."
 A Supreme Court decision defined "forced labor" as work at less than the minimum
 wage, which is usually set by the state governments. Under this definition, which
 differs from that of the International Labor Organization (ILO), "forced labor" is
 widespread, especially in rural areas.
 "Bonded labor," the result of a private contractual relationship whereby a worker
 incurs or inherits debts to a contractor and then must work off the debt plus inter-
 est, is illegal but widespread. The Government estimates that between enactment
 of the Bonded Labor (Regulation and Abolition) Act in 1979 and March 31, 1993,
 approximately 251,424 bonded workers had been released from their obligations.
 Other sources maintain that those released are only one-tenth of the total number
 of bonded laborers. State governments are responsible for enforcing the Act. Offend-
 ers may be sentenced to up to 3 years in prison but prosecutions are rare.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Constitution prohibits em-
 ployment of children under 14 years of age in factories, mines, or other hazardous
 employment. It also encourages the state governments to provide free and compul-
 sory education for all children up to the age of 14. A law passed in 1986 banned
 the employment of children under age 14 in hazardous occupations, such as glass
 makinF, fireworks, match factories, and carpet weaving and regulated their employ-
 ment mn others. The Factories Act and the Child Labor Registration Act limit the
 hours of workers below the age of 15 to 4.5 hours per day.
 The Government estimates that there were 17.5 minion child workers in 1985.
 The ILO estimates the number at 44 million, while NGO's claim that the figure is
 55 million. The enforcement of child labor laws is the responsibility of the state gov-
 ernments. Enforcement is not effective, especially in the informal sector where most
 of the children are employed. The continuing prevalence of child labor may be at-
 tributed to social acceptance of the practice and the failure of the state governments
 to make primary school education compulsory.
 The Government has drawn up a comprehensive plan to eliminate child labor
 from hazardous industries by the year 2000. Approximately 260 million dollars has
 been allocated for this program, which includes enhanced enforcement of anti-child
 labor laws, income supplements for families, and subsidized school lunches in areas
 where child labor is concentrated, and a public awareness campaign. The Commis-
 sion on Labor Standards and International Trade published a report on child labor
 that offers a frank assessment of the problem and needed remedies. The National
 Human Rights Commission has made child labor part of its agenda, investigating
 child labor practices in Tamil Nadu and in the Firozabad glass industry and inter-
 vening in individual cases. The Ministers of External Affairs and Commerce have
 made explicit calls to India's private sector to help eliminate child labor, stating that
 India should not be exporting goods made using child labor.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Minimum wages vary according to the state
 and sector of industry. Such wages are considered adequate only for a minimal
 standard of living. Most unionized workers receive much more than the minimum
 wage, including mandated bonuses and other benefits. The state governments set
 a separate minimum wage for agricultural workers but do not enforce it well.
 The Factories Act establishes an 8-hour workday, a 48-hour workweek, and var-
 ious standards for working conditions. These standards are generally enforced and
 accepted in the modern industrial sector, but tend not to be observed in older and
 less economically robust industries. State governments are responsible for enforce-
 ment of the Factories Act. However, the large number of industries covered by a
 small cadre of factory inspectors and their limited training and susceptibility to
 bribery make for lax enforcement.
 Although occupational safety and health measures vary widely, in general neither
 state nor centralgovernment resources for inspection and enforcement of standards
 are adequate. Safety conditions tend to be better in the EPZ's.
