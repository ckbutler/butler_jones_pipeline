 YUGOSLAVIA
 The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is a multiethnic,
 federal state comprising six republics (one of which has two
 autonomous provinces); the Constitution terms the League of
 Communists of Yugoslavia (LCY) the "leading organized
 political and ideological force."
 The ideology and practice of Yugoslav "workers'
 self-management" socialism differ substantially from the
 traditional centralized Soviet model. In the highly
 decentralized system set up by the late President Tito, the
 locus of power resides with republic and provincial government
 and party authorities. This system was intended to preserve
 stability among Yugoslavia's contentious ethnic groups, but it
 has dIso impeded effective leadership at the national level.
 State security and uniformed police are under the jurisdiction
 of Federal and Republic Secretaries for Internal Affairs. The
 armed forces are under Federal jurisdiction, although a
 controversial amendment to the constitution of the Republic of
 Slovenia is intended to restrict their use in that Republic.
 In the economic system, workers' self-management is intended
 to allow workers to run their own enterprises through a system
 of elected workers* councils. In practice, however, political
 officials have traditionally exercised considerable, and often
 decisive, influence over the management of enterprises in
 areas under their jurisdiction. The Yugoslav Government is
 embarking on a major program of economic reform, intended to
 open the Yugoslav economy to market forces by reducing
 government regulation, reforming the banking system, expanding
 competition by making enterprises more independent, and
 encouraging private enterprise and foreign investment.
 Obstacles to reform include political and bureaucratic
 resistance and economic difficulties, such as an inflation
 rate which may reach 2,500 percent by year's end. Nearly 85
 percent of agricultural land in Yugoslavia is privately owned,
 and there is a growing number of private enterprises in
 services and small-scale manufacturing, particularly in the
 Republics of Croatia, Slovenia, and Macedonia.
 Political pr.essure to observe human rights continued in 1989,
 coming both from within Yugoslavia and from external sources.
 Freedom of speech and freedom of expression in the media and
 the publishing industry increased, "alternative" political
 associations were founded in several areas, and the first
 direct elections were held in four republics, using the secret
 ballot and multiple candidacies (all from the LCY) to choose
 representatives to the collective Federal Presidency. The
 Republic of Slovenia continued to lead the way toward
 democratic practices.
 In some other regions of the country with different historical
 and cultural traditions, political and civil liberties,
 including freedom of speech, press, and assembly, and the
 right to'a fair trial continue to be restricted to varying
 degrees. There were numerous arrests on charges of "hostile
 propaganda" and similar offenses, particularly in Kosovo and
 in Macedonia, where ethnic Albanians accused of "nationalism
 and separatism" were the primary victims. According to
 government reports released in 1989, of 436 persons officially
 acknowledged to have been sentenced for political offenses in
 Yugoslavia, 336 were in Kosovo. March demonstrations by
 ethnic Albanians protesting the Serbian effort to assert
 
 
 1305
 YUGOSLAVIA
 greater control over the Province of Kosovo led to at least 25
 deaths, including those of two police officers.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no reported instances of such killings in
 Yugoslavia.
 b. Disappearance
 No instances of prolonged or permanent disappearance were
 reported.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 The Yugoslav Constitution and the law forbid torture, and
 there were no reports of its practice. However, there were
 numerous credible reports that people were sometimes beaten,
 mistreated, or threatened during detention in Yugoslavia. The
 Yugoslav press reported that many Albanians subjected to
 "isolation" after March demonstrations in Kosovo (see Section
 l.d.) were subjected to beating, deprivation of food and heat,
 and other forms of mistreatment. In October guards were
 indicted for beating Albanian prisoners in two Serbian
 prisons. At year's end, the trial was continuing.
 There are also credible reports that use of psychiatry is
 abused in Yugoslavia. In 1989 the "Anatoliy Koryagin
 Committee" was formed to document and protest psychiatric
 abuse. The Koryagin Committee claims to have recorded at
 least 60 such cases. The Yugoslav Forum for Human Rights, a
 quasi-official body, in an appeal to the Yugoslav President,
 included psychiatric abuse as one of the serious human rights
 problems in the country. Legal experts believe that
 government regulations designed to safeguard against
 involuntary admission to mental hospitals are sometimes
 ignored.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Yugoslav criminal law and procedures are influenced by the
 Napoleonic and Soviet law codes. They include many provisions
 inconsistent with generally accepted civil and human rights.
 Yugoslav law provides for pretrial detention for up to 3
 months, with a possible 3-month extension, which is often
 implemented. Access to prisoners in pretrial detention by
 family or legal counsel is sometimes restricted, ostensibly to
 prevent interference with investigations. Fikret Abdic,
 defendant in the highly publicized "Agrokomerc" financial
 scandal, was held in jail for over 2 years during his trial
 and pretrial investigation.
 In March, as part of government measures to counter
 demonstrations by Albanians protesting Serbian efforts to
 expand Serbian influence in Kosovo Province (see Section
 2.b.), Yugoslav authorities subjected 237 Albanians from
 Kosovo to a legal procedure known as "isolation" which had not
 previously been used in Yugoslavia in this fashion. These
 people were rounded up and held for up to 3 months, in most
 
 
 1306
 YUCQSIAVIA
 cases denied access to attorneys or to families. The majority
 were not held in Kosovo but in prisons in Serbia, where they
 were subjected to beatings, cold, inadequate food, and harsh
 interrogations. Isolated prisoners were reportedly detained
 under suspicion of belonging to illegal organizations, contact
 with "hostile" emigre groups, illegal arms trafficking, and
 organizing strikes and demonstrations. Of the 237 persons
 isolated, 41 were eventually charged with criminal offenses
 and 18 with misdemeanors. Yugoslav human rights activists
 consider the way the authorities employed isolation in Kosovo
 to be inconsistent with Yugoslav criminal procedures, which
 apparently allow such isolation through house arrest but not
 through imprisonment. The use of "isolation" in Kosovo was
 widely criticized in the Yugoslav press and even by the
 President of Yugoslavia, and by July the authorities said that
 no one was being held any longer in this condition.
 In February Yugoslav authorities arrested Azem Vlasi, a former
 leader of the League of Communists of Kosovo, on suspicion of
 "counterrevolutionary activity." The trial of Vlasi and 14
 others began in November and was still under way at year's
 end. Based on the charges brought forward by the prosecutor,
 however, Yugoslav human rights advocates have argued that the
 charges against Vlasi amount to holding him criminally liable
 for policies he carried out, while a leader in Kosovo, which
 ran counter to those of Serbia.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Each republic and province has its own criminal code and court
 system. Decisions by the highest republican and provincial
 courts, their supreme courts, may be appealed to the Federal
 Supreme Court, which seeks to ensure the uniform application
 of law. The Constitutional Court may rule on the
 constitutionality of laws and regulations. Offenses by those
 in the armed forces or offenses by civilians deemed to affect
 national security are tried in the military court system.
 Defendants have the right to be present at their trials and to
 have an attorney, at public expense if needed. The majority
 of trials, including those on political charges, are conducted
 in accordance with Yugoslav legal norms, without overt
 interference by outside authorities. In some cases, however,
 Yugoslav courts may be influenced by political authorities.
 During debate in 1988 over a proposed constitutional amendment
 to remove the "moral-political" suitability test imposed for
 the election of judges of regular courts, considerable
 criticism emerged of political interference and other
 conditions (low pay, short terms of office, election by the
 local communities ) which combine to make judges susceptible
 to outside influence.
 In many political cases, the outcome is often predetermined by
 the political authorities. Moreover, the Yugoslav legal
 system contains numerous inequities toward the defendant,
 regardless of whether the trial is criminal or political.
 Long periods of pretrial detention are allowed. The defense
 is sometimes restricted in the time allowed to prepare its
 case. While the prosecution can call as witnesses whomever it
 wants, the defendant has the right only to request the court
 to call witnesses, and the court has complete discretion
 whether or not to honor the request. The Supreme Court is
 considered to be more free of political interference than
 
 
 1307
 XUOLAIA
 local or republic-level courts, according to some legal
 observers.
 Although ordinary criminal trials are almost always open to
 the public, some political trials are not. In September
 observers from the International Helsinki Federation who
 sought to visit an "open" trial in Kosovo were told that
 foreigners could not attend.
 The Federal Criminal Code defines a number of "political"
 criminal acts ranging from armed rebellion, terrorism, and
 espionage, to broad, imprecise categories such as hostile
 propaganda, "arousing national, racial, and religious hatred,
 dissension, or intolerance," and "damaging the reputation of
 Yugoslavia." In addition, the republic and provincial
 criminal codes cover a variety of misdemeanors considered
 political crimes, including "spreading false rumors and
 defaming the peoples and nationalities of Yugoslavia."
 Authorities frequently bring charges against those who make
 derogatory or inflammatory ethnic statements or other
 statements considered politically unacceptable. There is wide
 variation in local practice.
 Yugoslav law permits the arrest and imprisonment of Yugoslav
 citizens for acts considered criminal offenses under Yugoslav
 law, even when they are committed abroad and are not crimes in
 the country in which they take place. Such cases are often
 based on the expression of views "hostile" to the Yugoslav
 Government or association with perceived anti-Yugoslav emigre
 groups. In February the Committee for Defense of Thought and
 Expression, a Belgrade-based human rights group, revealed that
 author Mihajlo Mihajlov's citizenship had been revoked by the
 Secretariat of Internal Affairs of the Republic of
 Bosnia-Hercegovina because of critical statements he had made
 in the United States about the Yugoslav Government. Yugoslav
 law permits the revocation of citizenship if the defendant had
 another citizenship (in this case, U.S. citizenship) and if he
 "through work abroad causes damage to the international and
 other interests of Yugoslavia...."
 The precise number of political prisoners in Yugoslavia is
 difficult to determine. In 1989 Amnesty International
 estimated that at least 200 political prisoners were being
 held in 1988. Yugoslav authorities sometimes release
 statistics on "political" prisoners, but these are often
 incomplete or misleading. Moreover, Yugoslav statistics on
 political prisoners generally appear to refer to persons
 sentenced for criminal offenses and do not include the larger
 number of people who receive misdemeanor sentences of 30 to 60
 days for verbal crimes under republic or provincial laws.
 After an amnesty in November in which 45 political prisoners
 were released, Yugoslav government figures indicated that 232
 persons were still being held in Yugoslavia for political
 crimes. Government statistics for 1988, released in June
 1989, revealed that, of 517 political charges filed
 nationwide, 43 percent of the defendants were ethnic Albanians
 from Kosovo, many accused of engaging in "separatist"
 activities. Albanians were tried in other republics as well
 as in Kosovo.
 In the first half of 1989, charges for political crimes were
 filed against 174 people in Croatia, resulting in 36
 convictions, according to the Yugoslav press. As of September
 19, 1989, in Kosovo, which has the largest number of political
 
 
 1308
 YUGOSLAVIA
 prisoners in the country, 1,180 people had been indicted for
 misdemeanors, and 56 for more serious criminal acts in
 connection with the March demonstrations. Yugoslav
 authorities state that such repressive measures are intended
 to repel a threat to political stability which they believe is
 posed by Albanian "nationalism and separatism."
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Arbitrary interference in private life occurs most often in
 connection with government efforts to munitor opposition or
 dissident activity. Although the judicial system includes
 restrictions on arbitrary searches, these safeguards are
 sometimes ignored. Authorities eavesdrop on conversations,
 read private mail, and tap telephones in some cases. Yugoslav
 citizens are generally free to receive and read foreign
 publications; however, the publications of certain Yugoslav
 emigfe groups, particularly those advocating the dissolution
 of the Yugoslav Federation or the redrawing of its internal
 political boundaries, are considered hostile in themselves,
 and their importation, possession, or sale is illegal.
 Possession or circulation of pamphlets advocating republic
 status for Kosovo in itself is considered a criminal offense.
 In April-, for example, Ismail Sherifi was sentenced to
 2 months' imprisonment for possessing photographs of symbols
 representing "Greater Albania," and many other Albanians have
 been similarly sentenced (see Section 2.a);
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian
 Law in Internal Conflicts
 The continuing Serbian campaign to assert greater political
 control over the predominantly ethnic Albanian Province of
 Kosovo (an area-within the Republic of Serbia that Serbs
 consider the historic cradle of their nation) led to
 demonstrations'by Albanians in February and March. The
 Federal Government sent thousands of troops and police,
 introduced a curfew, and banned public meetings. After
 amendments to the Serbian Constitution were rammed through the
 Kosovo Provicial Assembly in March, youthful demonstrators
 began throwing stones at police, who responded with tear gas.
 On March 27, the demonstrations turned violent, resulting in
 the official toll of 25 deaths, including those of 2 police
 officers. According to official accounts,-security forces did
 not begin firing until after one police officer had been
 killed by gunfire. Unofficial sources assert that the
 security forces used excessive force in dispersing the
 demonstrators, including by beating them, indiscriminately
 firing at them (sometimes from helicopters), and using
 ammunition designed to increase deaths and injuries.
 Unofficial and unsubstantiated reports assert that the number
 of demonstrators killed exceeded the officially admitted
 total. Government sources say 58,000 Albanians participated
 in the March demonstrations; they identified 1,665 of them and
 brought misdemeaor charges against 1,180 and criminal charges
 against 56. "Ddring demonstrations on November 2 and 3, at
 least three people were killed while protesting the trial of
 Azem Vlasi (see Section l.d.), and 138 people were later
 convicted of misdemeanors in connection with the
 demonstrations.

 YUGOSLAVIA
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Although the Yugoslav Constitution and law affirm the freedom
 of speech and press, and there is a trend towards greater
 respect for these freedoms, both law and practice impose
 significant restrictions.
 Arrests and convictions for what are called "verbal crimes"
 (most often charges involving "nationalism" or "hostile
 propaganda") continued in Kosovo Province and in Macedonia and
 also occurred in other parts of Yugoslavia. The charge is
 often used in combination with other charges such as "forming
 illegal hostile organizations." For example, in April Fikirye
 Musa was sentenced to 1 1/2 years' imprisonment in Pristina,
 Kosovo, for her unpublished writings, including pro-Albanian
 poetry, found in her possession. Ten others, all under the
 age of 22, were codefendants in the trial. Thtee defendants
 stated in court that they were exercising their fceedom to
 express nonhostile and noncounterrevolutionary opinions.
 Nedzat Malichi and Hairedin Hiseni were sentenced to 5 years
 each, the heaviest sentences passed at the trial.
 In March Muzafer Ljuti was sentenced to 60 days' imprisonment
 for shouting slogans in a restaurant and in a public square in
 Macedonia. In April Violtsa Dushi, a bank director's
 secretary, was sentenced to 60 days' imprisonment for taking
 part in a demonstration in Urosevac, Serbia, where she shouted
 hostile slogans. Some months earlier, she allegedly had made
 a pro-Albanian speech to pupils at the local youth sports
 center.
 Outbursts of nationalism from other ethnic groups also led to
 political trials. In July some 30 people were arrested and 6
 convicted on misdemeanor charges of disrupting an official
 commemoration in Knin, Croatia, of the 600th anniversary of
 the Battle of Kosovo. One of these, Jovan Opacic, after
 serving his misdemeanor sentence, was indicted for the same
 actions under more serious criminal charges of "committing a
 criminal act against the Socialist self-management system and
 security of Yugoslavia" and "against the reputation of
 Yugoslavia." At his trial in September, the most severe
 charges against Opacic were dropped, and he was sentenced to
 90 days' imprisonment on lesser charges.
 All media are state owned, but the degree of official
 oversight varies from republic to republic. Government
 oversight of the media is carried out through publications
 boards, which include ranking party officials. There are
 important informal channels for official supervision of the
 press, including editorial staffs' use of self-censorship.
 Eighty-one percent of Yugoslav journalists in a recent poll
 said they were members of the League of Communists. If a
 story or press criticism displeases senior officials,
 journalists and editors may be reprimanded, removed,
 transferred, or encounter difficulty in future employment.
 In May local authorities in Bar, Montenegro, .:losed down Radio
 Bar because of its sympathetic coverage -)f a dockworkers'
 strike. Local authorities recommended that journalists
 covering the strike be disciplined, hut .epublic authorities
 intervened on the strikers' behalf, aod the station resumed
 broadcasting. Foreign broadcast media are easily received in
 Yugoslavia.
 
 
 1310
 YUGOSLAVIA
 Despite periodic bans on specific publications, the media have
 increased latitude to discuss and comment freely on a wide
 range of political and social topics. They directly criticize
 government and LCY officials at'all levels, although,
 reflecting the political infighting among the republics, they
 prefer to target officials outside their own republics.
 Direct criticism of Tito is still rare and controversial.
 Albanians in Kosovo may well be jailed for calling for their
 Province to be given republic status within Yugoslavia, while
 in other parts of the country journalists or public figures
 may openly advocate this step. The first nonofficial
 newspaper since World War II began publication in 1989 in
 Slovenia.
 Public prosecutors have the power to ban temporarily the
 publication and sale of books or periodicals if they think
 that the content is, for example, "false" or could "disturb"
 the public. However, a judge must review the temporary ban,
 and editors have the right to contest the prosecutor's
 decision at the hearing. In February Ratko Dimitrovic was
 sentenced to 3 months in jail for an article he had written in
 Politika, a Belgrade daily, in 1988. An issue of the magazine
 Nasi Dani was banned in April because it was found to be
 insulting to Bosnian officials. In 1989 at least nine
 magazine issues were banned, seven of them student
 publications. In three cases, the ban was later lifted by
 court order on appeal. Banning publications is usually done
 at the local or republic level. The criteria for such action
 varies from region to region; and criticism of the Federal
 Government was the most frequent reason cited for banning
 publications.
 Indirect constraints can sometimes also be applied to
 publications. The Serbian youth magazine Non had its printing
 contract with the Politika publishing house canceled in
 November because of Non's criticism of Politika's stands in
 support of the Serbian leadership. Non was able to find
 another printer, however. In December Politika canceled the
 printing contracts of two other magazines, citing "technical
 reasons."
 In book publishing, the authorities generally provide only
 loose oversight. The Yugoslav publishing industry puts out a
 wide range of U.S. and Western European books, including the
 works of Soviet and Eastern European dissidents. "The Satanic
 Verses" was published in both Macedonian and Serbo-Croatian in
 1989, despite objections from Yugoslav Muslim groups.
 Academic freedom was severely damaged in the Province of
 Kosovo when at least 30 instructors were expelled from'the
 University of Pristina, and large numbers of teachers at all
 educational levels were disciplined or fired under suspicion
 of influencing students toward Albanian separatist views. At
 least 1,500 party members have been expelled in Kosovo for
 allegedly espousing separatist views, and Kosovo party
 officials have stated that those expelled should also be fired
 from "leading positions," including those in the managerial
 level of business enterprises.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The Yugoslav Constitution guarantees freedom of assembly, but
 this right traditionally has been severely circumscribed in
 practice. Public political demonstrations generally have been
 permitted only in support of official policies and by
 
 
 1311
 YUGOSLAVIA
 officially recognized organizations. All public gatherings
 must be registered by the authorities, who will often seek to
 ban those that run counter to official policies. In 1988 and
 1989, however, thousands of discontented workers or farmers
 marched in peaceful but unauthorized protest demonstrations to
 Belgrade or republic capitals. The authorities generally met
 with the protesters and did not try to disperse them by force.
 In 1989 there were a number of large demonstrations in Serbia,
 Kosovo, Montenegro, and elsewhere. Demonstrations by Serbs
 were tolerated or even encouraged if they coincided with the
 Serbian leadership's objectives. Albanian demonstrators in
 Yugoslavia, even if peaceful, faced possible use of force by
 police and dismissal from their jobs. Albanian demonstrations
 in Kosovo were banned and eventually dispersed by force.
 Demonstrations in Mon]-enegro in January led to the overthrow
 of the Republic government. After a peaceful demonstration by
 several thousand Serbs on July 9 in the Croatian town of Knin,
 6 persons were sentenced to 30 to 60 days' imprisonment on
 misdemeanor charges.
 In Macedonia, Liman Jashari was sentenced to 10 years, and
 four others were sentenced to terms of from 6 to 8 years for
 organizing the August 1988 demonstration in Kumanovo of ethnic
 Albanians. In the Macedonian town of Bitolj, 10 ethnic
 Albanians were tried for "hostile propaganda," "association
 with the aim of carrying out hostile activities," and
 "counterrevolutionary acts." Eight ethnic Albanians in
 Macedonia were sentenced in 1989 to prison terms of from 5 to
 11 years for participating in a demonstration on language
 rights.
 In Kosovo, Yugoslav authorities reacted strongly to
 demonstrations and strikes in February and March (see Section
 l.f.). Slovenian authorities banned a May 8 demonstration
 organized by nonofficial groups supporting the "Ljubljana 4,"
 a group of journalists and one soldier convicted in 1988 on
 charges of revealing military secrets. The demonstration took
 place, however, when the official youth organization agreed to
 sponsor the event. Slovenian authorities banned a
 demonstration of Serbs and Montenegrins planned for December 1
 in Ljubljana.
 Freedom of association is guaranteed under the Yugoslav
 Constitution, and, although the scope of political association
 is limited by the monopoly of power of the LCY, many new
 nonofficial organizations have formed in the past year. To
 obtain legal status, organizations must register with the
 Government, but many do not, and the law is laxly enforced.
 In February the Association for a Yugoslav Democratic
 Initiative met for the first time in Zagreb, By the end of
 the year, the organization had chapters in many cities in
 Yugoslavia, including Belgrade, Sarajevo, and Titograd. A
 number of nonofficial organizations were founded in Croatia in
 1989. In December the Croatian League of Communists agreed
 with a proposal by these groups for early republic elections
 in which all political groups could compete. Other new
 organizations include human rights groups and environmental
 groups in Montenegro and Serbia. In Slovenia, many alternative
 political associations formed in 1988 and 1989 will be
 competing for seats in the republic elections in the spring of
 1990. Human rights organizations, for example the Yugoslav
 branch of the International Helsinki Federation, have
 unhampered contact with their international affiliates.
 
 
 1312
 YUGOSLAVIA
 Association for the purpose of hostile activities is a crime
 under Yugoslav criminal law, and this law has been used to
 prosecute ethnic Albanians who advocate republic status for
 Kosovo. In February 11 Albanians were convicted in Pristina,
 Kosovo, on this charge, receiving sentences of from 4 months
 to 8 years. In April, 10 ethnic Albanians were convicted in
 Prizren, Kosovo, on this charge, receiving sentences of from 1
 to 5 years. Most of the accused belonged to an association
 called "Marxist-Leninists of Kosovo."  A group of ethnic
 Albanian soldiers was convicted in January under this article
 for organizing a hostile association in their garrison in Nis
 in April 1988.
 For a discussion of freedom of association as it applies to
 labor unions, see Section 6.,a.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Yugoslav Constitution provides for freedom of religious
 practice but proscribes "abuse" of religion and religious
 activities for political purposes. Yugoslav authorities
 officially encourage atheism. Religious believers in
 Yugoslavia are not generally subject to overt persecution, but
 open practice of one's faith is normally a disqualification
 for high positions in government, business, the media, and
 academia. In practice, however, religious freedoms vary from
 republic to republic, depending in part on the political and
 historical role of the various religions. The largest faiths
 in Yugoslavia are Serbian Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and
 Islamic. Since World War II- the Jewish community has
 numbered fewer than 10,000, but it is active and well
 organized. There is a small Protestant community which
 includes denominations such as Pentecostals, Baptists, and
 Jehovah's Witnesses.
 In Serbia, the Serbian Orthodox Church has enjoyed unusually
 good relations with republic authorities ever the past 2
 years. The Serbian media in-general have provided an
 unusually comprehensive and sympathetic view of religion.
 Belgrade television covered Christmas celebrations in
 Belgrade, Zagreb, and Ljubljana in 1988 and the dedication of
 the new Cathedral of St. Sava in Belgrade in June 1989.
 In Slovenia, where most believers are Catholic, the
 authorities also have displayed a tolerant attitude toward
 religion. In 1989 December 25 became an official holiday in
 Slovenia. The authorities in Croatia, however, have a more
 reserved position toward the Catholic Church, in part stemming
 from a tradition of conflict between the Catholic Church and
 the Communist authorities that goes back to World War II.
 All Saints' Day (November 1) became an official holiday in
 Croatia in 19B9.
 Yugoslav authorities maintain restrictions on the public
 activities of religious communities, including limits on
 religious education, on publishing activity, and on the
 construction of new churches and other facilities. In recent
 years, the application of these rules has been more relaxed in
 keeping with a somewhat more tolerant approach by the
 authorities toward all nonofficial activity. As yet, however,
 there have been no changes in the rules themselves. Religious
 communities in Yugoslavia have vigorous publishing programs,
 although they do not have their own printing facilities. The
 construction of new places of worship requires the consent of
 local government authorities, who sometimes construct
 
 
 1313
 YUGQSLAVIA
 bureaucratic obstacles. The Serbian Orthodox Church in Split,
 Croatia, a predominantly Catholic area, is having difficulty
 in getting permission to complete its Church, and the Islamic
 communities in Belgrade and Split have had applications
 pending to build new mosques for many years. Authorities in
 Macedonia have been reluctant to issue permits for the
 construction of new mosques. In the Banat region of Vojvodina
 Province, authorities reportedly denied permission to begin
 the construction of churches in 1989. In Zagreb (Croatia),
 the Jewish community has received official permission to
 construct a new synagogue, which will be combined with a
 Jewish cultural center. Several new'mosques were completed in
 Bosnia in 1989, but up to 500 requests for building permits
 for religious edifices remain unfulfilled in this republic,
 where Muslims account for about 40 percent of the population.
 Primary education outside the state system is not permitted in
 Yugoslavia. There are some opportunities for religious
 education at the secondary and university level for all major
 faiths. The Catholic Church, for example, maintains 8
 secondary schools (about 100 pupils each), 2 theological
 faculties, and 5 seminaries in Croatia and Slovenia. The
 Serbian Orthodox Church has four high schools and two
 theological faculties, one of which just opened in 1989. The
 Yugoslav Islamic Association runs three high schools in the
 Muslim areas of the country and one Islamic theological
 faculty in Sarajevo. The degrees offered by these
 institutions are not officially recognized by the Yugoslav
 authorities. Yugoslav religious communities, both Christian
 and Muslim, also make vigorous efforts to provide religious
 instruction outside of school for children and young people.
 Religious believers are subject to restrictions while doing
 obligatory military service.  Active duty military personnel
 may not attend religious services or have religious materials
 in their possession. In April the Federal Presidency amended
 the law on military service to permit conscientious objectors
 to serve in the military without bearing arms for a period of
 24 months, twice as long as the standard conscription period.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within the country is provided for by the
 Constitution and generally permitted in practice. No exit
 permits are required to visit the more than 135 countries with
 which Yugoslavia has diplomatic or consular relations.
 Passports are routinely available to most Yugoslavs, and
 roughly half of Yugoslavia's population has passports for
 foreign travel. Approximately 700,000 Yugoslavs are employed
 as 'guest workers" in Western Europe.
 The Yugoslav authorities have sometimes denied passports to
 well-known dissidents, but recently prominent critics, such as
 Milovan Djilas and Dobroslav Paraga, have received passports
 and traveled abroad. In Croatia, human rights activists
 demonstrated in front of the Croatian Parliament in early 1989
 to seek reinstatement of passports for the approximately 50
 Croats who have had their passports confiscated or denied on
 political grounds.
 In 1989, however, the authorities began to deny passports to
 Albanians and Gypsies, in large part because so many of them
 were seeking asylum in the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG).
 In 1988, 20,800 Yugoslavs sought asylum in the FRG. According
 
 
 1314
 YUGOSLAVIA
 to press reports, FRG authorities threatened to require visas
 for all Yugoslavs entering the FRG, which would have created a
 hardship for the approximately 600,000 Yugoslavs already
 living there. The Yugoslav GoVernment responded by denying
 passports to several thousand people, mostly in Kosovo and
 Macedonia.
 The law on the entry of foreigners into Yugoslavia notes the
 right of permanent asylum and provides for government
 assistance to persons granted that right. Yugoslavia extends
 temporary asylum to refugees who, with the assistance of the
 Belgrade office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees (UNHCR), seek permanent resettlement in third
 countries. According to UNHCR figures, in the first 11 months
 of 1989, a total of 4,401 new cases were registered with UNHCR
 in Yugoslavia, and 4,171 cases were resolved by permanent
 settlement outside Yugoslavia. As of November 30, 1989, there
 were 1,081 people residing in Yugoslavia who had been accepted
 by the UNHCR refugee program but whose permanent settlement
 had yet to be arranged. Of those interviewed by UNHCR during
 this period, one-third were denied refugee status and returned
 by Yugoslav authorities to their country of origin.
 Romania is the source of most refugees in Yugoslavia. The
 Yugoslav Government says it screens out what it considers
 "undesirables:" criminals, mentally ill people, and
 unaccompanied minors are sent back to Romania without the
 opportunity to be interviewed by the UNHCR. The number of
 Romanians seeking asylum who are returned to Romania without
 being interviewed by the UNHCR is a matter of some dispute.
 In October, about 30 Romanians (out of several hundred
 asylum-seekers held in a Yugoslav detention facility) were
 involuntarily returned to Romania following their
 participation in a hunger strike protesting the action of the
 Yugoslav authorities to force them to depart the country ,
 without being interviewed by the UNHCR. After the toppling of
 the Ceasescu regime, some of the Romanian asylum-seekers'in
 Yugoslavia voluntarily returned to Romania.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Yugoslav citizens do not have the right to change the basic
 system of government. The 2-million-member League of
 Communists of Yugoslavia (LCY) formally maintains a monopoly
 on political power. The party's authority at the Federal
 level, however, is greatly dispersed and diluted because of
 the decentralization of decisionmaking power to the parties in
 the six republics and two provinces. With few exceptions, no
 major initatives, including constitutional amendments, may be
 adopted by the Federal Government without the unanimous
 consent of the republics and provinces. Autonomous political
 "associations" proliferated in 1988 and 1989, reflecting a
 growing demand at the grassroots level.
 The collective State Presidency (Chief of State) is
 responsible for overall policy direction. The Federal
 Executive Council (Cabinet), headed by the Prime Minister, is
 responsible for running the governmental machinery and
 proposing specific legislation. The terms of government
 officials are from 1 to 5 years, with a possible extension for
 one additional term.
 The Federal Assembly, responsible for enacting legislation,
 operates sometimes by majority vote and sometimes by consensus
 
 
 1315 .
 XUGOSLAVIA
 among delegations representing the country's eight Federal
 units. Although over 99 percent of the assembly delegates are
 members of the LCY, the Assembly has been active and
 contentious in recent years and has several times rejected or
 drastically altered proposals endorsed by the Presidency and
 Cabinet. Its debates generally are fully reported in the
 media. As a result of 1988 constitutional amendments, in the
 spring of 1990 one house of the bicameral Federal Assembly
 will for the first time be chosen by direct election using
 secret ballots and multiple candidacies.
 In 1989, for the first time, members of the Federal Presidency
 from Slovenia, Montenegro, Bosnia-Hercegovina, and Macedonia
 were elected in their republics in competitive elections by
 secret ballot. All the candidates were members of the LCY,
 and government organs controlled the list of candidates.
 There are about 20 "alternative movements" in Yugoslavia, some
 of which are registered as official organizations and some of
 which are not. Some of the "alternatives" operate under the
 umbrella of the Socialist Alliance of Working People, a
 party-approved mass organization. Others openly advocate
 competition with the LCY and, in Slovenia, have indicated
 their intention to put forth lists of candidates in the 1990
 spring elections. Independent groups in Croatia may do so as
 well. The national daily Borba printed the platforms of 16
 alternative groups in June. Among the groups founded in 1989
 were the Croatian Social-Liberal Alliance, the Alliance of
 Workers, the Social Democratic Union of Slovenia, and the
 Association for a Yugoslav Democratic Initiative. An old
 established organization, the Serbian Writers Association,
 issued a public statement in May calling for an independent
 judiciary, a free press, and the introduction of a multiparty
 system in Yugoslavia.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 In the past, the Government criticized Western charges of
 human rights violations within Yugoslavia as interference in
 Yugoslav internal affairs and as efforts to bring pressure on
 Yugoslavia to alter its social, economic, or political
 system. In recent years, the Government has been somewhat
 more willing to acknowledge human rights as a legitimate topic
 for other governments. It is still reserved about discussing
 specific instances of human rights violations, particularly
 alleged violations in Kosovo. A fact-finding mission from the
 European Parliament in June was denied a meeting with
 political prisoners and was harshly criticized in the press.
 A September delegation from the International Helsinki
 Federation met unofficially with ethnic Albanians and Serbs
 but was denied any meetings with government officials. The
 group returned in October for meetings with government
 officials, including the President, the first time an official
 of that rank had met with human rights activists. Yugoslavia
 .is a member of the U.N. Human Rights Commission.
 Of the domestic human rights groups, the largest is the Forum
 for Human Rights, established by the Socialist Alliance to
 monitor domestic human rights trends and foster understanding
 of Yugoslavia's international commitments to human rights.
 The Forum has presented findings and suggestions for changes
 in the legal code to the Federal.Presidency and the Federal
 
 
 1316
 YUGOSLAVIA
 Ministry of Justice, including elimination of "verbal crimes"
 and the practice of isolating prisoners.
 Helsinki Watch has a branch in-Yugoslavia, and several
 independent human rights groups have sprung up among the
 "alternative movements." In April, 30 human rights
 organizations from all over Yugoslavia met for the first time
 in Sarajevo, Bosnia. They founded a joint committee, the
 Sarajevo Trial Working Group, which on December 11 published a
 letter in the national daily Borba criticizing human rights
 abuses in a 1983 trial of Muslim fundamentalists.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution provides for the equality of citizens
 regardless of sex, and the Government is officially opposed to
 racial discrimination. Despite government efforts, however,
 some social prejudice continues to exist, particularly with
 regard to ethnic Albanians and Gypsies, who constitute 8 and
 0.7 percent respectively of Yugoslavia's population. On the
 other hand, the Serbian minority in the Autonomous Province of
 Kosovo has complained sharply of physical mistreatment and
 discriminatory practices on the part of the Albanian majority
 (over 90 percent of Kosovo's population).
 Ethnic Albanians are concerned about anti-Albanian sentiment
 in the country as a whole. There is legitimate suspicion that
 certain-government policies on family subsidies are
 specifically aimed at ethnic Albanians, who have the highest
 birthrate in Europe. Macedonia already limits "social
 welfare" payments to the first three children in a family;
 Serbia is considering plans to follow suit. Macedonian
 authorities have manipulated building code regulations
 governing the height of walls to justify the bulldozing of
 walls that traditionally surround Albanian homes in the
 Republic.
 In an effort to reverse the emigration of Serbs and
 Montenegrins from Kosovo, Serbia restricts all sales of real
 property in Kosovo by Serbs and Montenegrins to Albanians.
 Prospective sales must be submitted to a review board which
 determines whether or not the sale was "coerced" by the
 Albanian purchaser. In practice, this amounts to a ban on
 purchase of Serbian and Montenegrin property in Kosovo by
 Albanians. Some try to avoid the restriction by engaging in
 "secret sales," which is a criminal offense. In September two
 ethnic Albanians were sentenced to 60-day jail terms for
 secretly buying Serbian property in Vucitrn. It appears that
 only Albanian buyers are prosecuted for such transactions, not
 Serbian sellers.
 Similarly, jobs and housing are reserved for ethnic Serbs who
 wish to move back to Kosovo. Some Albanians were fired simply
 to make room for returning Serbs. In one instance, the nephew
 of the former Kosovo party chief Azem Vlasi was fired because
 "his presence was an irritant to the Serbs in the workplace,"
 according to the Yugoslav press.
 There is legal equality of the sexes under Yugoslav law.
 Maternity leave for employed women is routinely granted for
 periods between 9 and 12 months. Working mothers are given
 day-care allowances based on their salaries and the number of
 children to be cared for. Also, a working mother may take
 sick leave when her child is ill (up until 2 years after its
 
 
 1317
 YUGOSLAVIA
 birth), and the father may do so when the mother is ill.
 Statistics on the prevalence of violence against women are not
 readily available, but spouse abuse is not uncommon in the
 lesser developed parts of Yugoslavia. Legal penalties for
 spousal abuse are the same as those for assault of any person;
 however, the abused spouse must make out a complaint, and this
 is seldom done. Data collected by feminist hotlines in
 Zagreb, Belgrade, and Ljubljana over the past 2 years recorded
 6,000 women who reported wife abuse. The same source reported
 that women's lives were endangered in one case out of five.
 The official Yugoslav Women's Organization has begun a legal
 initiative to exact harsher legal penalties for wife abuse and
 rape and to make the Slovene Republic law against rape within
 marriage also a Federal law. Federal marriage laws allow the
 woman to keep her maiden name, to continue working if she
 wishes, and to have "equal input in the decision as to where
 the couple will live." There are feminist groups in the
 larger cities of Slovenia, Croatia, and Serbia (including
 Vojvodina) campaigning for improvements in women's rights.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Since 1950 Yugoslavia has had a unique industrial relations
 system in which most enterprises are neither privately owned
 nor owned by the state, but are defined as socially owned.
 Neither the Yugoslav Constitution nor the law prohibit the
 formation of unions outside the structure of the sole labor
 central known as the Council of Trade Unions of Yugoslavia
 (CTUY). However, the CTUY is accorded various rights and
 responsibilities under legislation, and the Constitution also
 provides that unions shall pursue the objective of building
 and defending a self-managing Socialist society.
 Trade unions are organized geographically by republic and
 province and by craft at all levels. Workers are not required
 to join the official unions, but virtually all workers (93
 percent) in the socially owned sector of the economy do. The
 trade unions are formally independent of the Government and
 the LCY but unquestionably are influenced by political
 leaders. The degree of political influence appears to vary
 considerably by region and level. Trade union independence in
 general appears to be growing, as reflected in the increasing
 frequency of strikes and strike threats organized by the
 unions. (A majority of strikes in 1989 were organized by union
 bodies.)
 Federal law makes no provision for the free formation of
 independent trade unions, although there is no specific ban
 either. At the republic level, an amendment to the
 constitution of Slovenia adopted in September provides for
 free trade union association. In Croatia, the Republic
 Presidency and official union organization have both publicly
 backed the free formation of independent unions. Moreover,
 workers in that Republic established their own railroad union
 in November, and Yugoslavia's commercial pilots formed an
 independent union in December. The issue has not become
 relevant for small private firms to date, and the rights of
 the trade unions to organize in the private sector are
 guaranteed by the new law on labor relations.
 Yugoslav workers have had a constitutionally guaranteed right
 to strike since November 1988, although strikes have been
 
 
 1318
 
 commonplace for years. A law on strikes is currently under
 debate in the Federal Assembly. The right to strike includes,
 and is exercised by, workers in socially owned firms and the
 Government. Preliminary figures indicate some 1,900 strikes
 occurred during 1989, involving 470,000 workers.
 Strikes are resolved through negotiations between the workers'
 strike committee and a combination of management, the workers'
 council, and (at times) politicians. The position of the
 trade union generally depends on the activism of the union
 local. In Slovenia, Croatia, and Macedonia, official union
 policy enjoins locals to support or sponsor strikes favored by
 a majority of workers.
 Alth6ugh not a participating member of the World Confederation
 of Labor since 1950, the CTUY has good cooperation with that
 organization, as well as with the European Trade Union
 Confederation. The CTUY, although not a member of the
 Communist-controlled World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU),
 has also begun cooperation with the WFTU at the craft union
 level.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Western-style collective bargaining has not existed in
 Yugoslavia. The new law on labor relations introduces the
 concept of "collective agreements" to be negotiated between
 the unions and Chambers of Economy (semiofficial Chambers of
 Commerce), but the system remained untested in 1989. Workers
 at present continue to protect their interests through the
 self-management system.
 All large firms in Yugoslavia are socially rather than
 privately owned. All the employees at any one enterprise
 belong to the same trade union, which also includes the
 managers. Under Yugoslav law, workers elect their council (a
 body separate from the trade unions) which has a voice in
 selecting management and must approve by majority vote major
 (and sometimes minor) business decisions, including wage
 levels, by the enterprise. Enterprise managers are
 increasingly bound by law to more Western-style standards of
 business discipline. Yugoslavia has no economic incentive
 zones, nor are there any special industries where labor
 standards differed from those elsewhere in the country.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is prohibited by the Yugoslav Constitution and is
 generally not practiced. However, many Yugoslavs were
 surprised to learn during the State's enforcement of "special
 measures" (i.e., a state of emergency) in troubled Kosovo
 Province that the Government may impose a "work obligation" on
 workers in industries of "broader social significance." The
 "work obligation" was also invoked during the September strike
 of railroad workers in Croatia, despite the fact that no state
 of emergency was in place at the time. Violation of the "work
 obligation" may be punished by criminal and administrative
 penalties.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The minimum age for employment of children is 16 years. Of
 those unemployed in Yugoslavia, 78 percent are under the age
 of 30, and in practice, young people often must wait years for
 their first job.

 YUGOSLAVIA
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Yugoslavia has an official 42-hour workweek, with generous
 vacation time and sick leave benefits. The republics set
 minimum wage levels, which vary widely in keeping with varied
 levels of economic development and prices. The August minimum
 monthly wage in more developed Slovenia, for example, was
 roughly the equivalent of $170, while in poorer Montenegro it
 was roughly $35. Wage levels were raised frequently during
 the reporting period. The trade unions point out that minimum
 wages lag behind inflation, leaving workers who earn only the
 minimum at or below "the poverty line."
 Yugoslavia has extensive federal and republic laws and
 regulations on worker safety. Occasional press reports and
 informal observations of many Yugoslav workplaces suggest that
 enforcement of work safety rules is lax.
