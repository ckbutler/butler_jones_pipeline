 UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN
 IRELAND*
 The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK) is a constitu-
 tional monarchy with a democratic, parliamentary government elected in periodic,
 multiparty elections. Human and civil rights are recognized by statute and by
 strongly-held traditions, but there is no written constitution. The legal system treats
 human rights as assumed unless limited by statute.
 Throughout the United Kingdom, civilian police forces are responsive to, and con-
 trolled by, elected officials. In Northern Ireland, because of terrorist violence, army
 units reinforce the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC).
 The United Kingdom has a highly developed industrial economy. The Government
 provides comprehensive social welfare services.
 Terrorist bombings and killings by the illegal Provisional Irish Republican Army
 (Provisional IRA) and other "Republican" (Catholic) and "Loyalist" (Protestant) ter-
 rorist groups in Northern Ireland and Great Britain continued to constitute the
 greatest violations of public order. However, on August 31 the Provisional IRA an-
 nounced a "complete cessation of military operations," and the main Loyalist groups
 announced a similar cease-fire on October 13. Notwithstanding this, the Provisional

 report.

 IRA continued to engage in vigilante "punishment" attacks on alleged "antisocial
 elements," and to exile 'informers" by force; and one of its local units carried out
 an armed robbery in which a participant killed a postal worker. The Government
 has reacted cautiously to the cease-firue.
 'The troubles" in Northern Ireland during the past 25 years alone have taken a
 heavy toll: over 3,167 people killed, including 296 plice and 647 military personnel,
 and over 38,558 injured (1,955 in vigilante punis ent shootings)." Over 9,983 ex-
 plosions have caused extensive property damage as well as deaths. In Great Britain,
 more than 100 people have died in Provisional IRA attacks during the 25 years. In
 1994, as in 1993, no deaths related to the troubles were caused by the security
 forces, despite persistent and sometimes lethal (see Section L.a.) attacks on them
 by terrorists. Nonetheless, allegations of past use of excessive force by the security
 forces continued to be a matter of contention.
 In Northern Ireland, there has been widespread criticism of laws and procedures
 governing detention that deny the right to immediate counsel and that encroach on
 the right to silence. Also much criticized have been the use of uncorroborated confes-
 sions and the placement of teenagers in detention facilities filled mainly with
 adults. There continued to be allegations that security forces physically and psycho-
 logleally abused detainees in holding centers.
 Emergency antiterrorist measures enacted during the past 20 years restrict free-
 dom of movement for 69 suspected terrorists and supporters. Also, primarily due to
 fear of terrorist violence, many Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern
 Ireland have become segregated, and workers are sometimes reluctant to commute
 across sectarian borders.
 Parliament passed a Criminal Justice Act in November that, among other things,
 extends to Great Britain the encroachments on the right to silence that have been
 in effect in Northern Ireland since a 1988 law. This legislation, which has drawn
 much public criticism, enables courts to draw a negative inference from a suspect's
 refusal to answer questions under some circumstances.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings by the Government, although a human rights group questioned the police
 shooting of an armed robber. In Northern Ireland, 59 persons were killed by terror-
 ists (37 by Loyalists, 22 by Republicans); 6 were British security personnel, killed
 by the Provisional IRA.
 The Committee on the Administration of Justice (CA), an independent Northern
 Ireland organization, has continued to claim there have been some 340 killings by
 the security forces under disputed circumstances since the current phase of"the
 troubles" began in 1968, with criminal prosecutions in only 32 cases, and 4 convic-
 tions by the end of 1994.
 During 1994 the Belfast coroner abandoned three inquests into 1982 killings by
 security forces-of three Provisional IRA terrorists, two members of the terrorist
 Irish National Lberation Army (INLA), and one youth, under what critics charged
 was a shoot-t-kill policy-after the Government refused on national security
 grounds to release the findings of plice investigations.
 In the case of three Prvisional IRA terrorists killed in Gibraltar by UK security
 forces in 1988, the European Commission on Human Right decided the Govern-
 ment did not use unnecessary force, but referred the case to the higher-level Euro-
 pean Court of Human Rights, whose decision is stillpending.
 The trial of a police ofie  for klig 19-year-old Kei McGovern concluded with
 a verdict that the officer had not intended to kill the student.
 The court trying a soldier in the Royal Irish Regiment, Alan O'Leary, for the 1992
 illng of a teenager acquitted hiNI of a murder charge but found him guilty of man-
 slaughter, and sentenced him to 4 years in prison.
 There were no significant developments m the case of the 1986 killing of Patrick
 Finucane, counsel to many Provisional IRA suspects. The case remains open.
 The RUC investigates all killings committed ianNorthern Ireland by its officers
 as well as by the Amy. The Independent commission for Police Complaints (ICPC),
 established by the Goveent, supervises police investigations. Authorized to re-
 view all complaints, it automatically supervises cases involving death or serious in-
 jury. It accepts information provided bh a complainant and y any other sources,
 as well as that discovered by the police. The IPC can advise (but cannot require)
 the Chief Constable to take disciplinary action against police officers.
 The European Convention on Human Rights stipulates that lethal force should be
 used only when "absolutely necessary," while British law calls for it to be zreason-
 
 
 1026
 able under the circumstances." Human rights groups have criticized the British
 standard as deficient, but British courts have ruled that lethal force may be applied
 only if there is imminent and unavoidable danger to life. Courts generally assume
 that a police officer who aims and fires a weapon intended to cause serious bodily
 harm; the issue then is whether there was justification for such intent. If not, the
 only applicable charge is murder, requiring a life sentence; the courts have been un-
 willing to impose such a heavy penalty in borderline cases. The alternative charge
 of manslaughter is applicable in eath cases only if there is no intent to cause bodily
 harm; there have been few convictions on this basis.
 Human rights organizations have called for the establishment of an independent
 public inqury to investigate allegations of police threats to defense lawyers in
 Northern Ireland and of alleged collusion between the security forces and the Loyal-
 ists. Amnesty International in February released a report on political killings in
 Northern Ireland which included no new information but concluded the Government
 had not "taken adequate steps to halt collusion." The Government admitted that,
 while its policy explicitly forbids collusion, on occasion some soldiers break the rules.
 The authorities charged two British soldiers with passing information on Republican
 activists to Loyalist paramilitaries; the cases are pending.
 For the third year in a row, Loyalists killed more people than did the Provisional
 IRA, although the latter launched a greater number of potentially lethal attacks.
 Loyalists tended to be indiscriminate in shooting suspected Republicans and other
 Catholics, while the Provisional IRA tended to target security forces, known Loyal-
 ists, and, in widespread bombings, commercial or security installations. The Provi-
 sional IRA also abducted, tortured, and murdered a Catholic mother of three whom
 it suspected of cooperating with the police.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances attributed to govern-
 ment forces. Terrorists in Northern Ireland continued to abduct suspected inform-
 ers, and to hold families hostage during their operations.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 British laws forbid torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. Con-
 fessions thus obtained are not admissible in court, and judges can exclude even vol-
 untary confessions. Nonetheless, Helsinki Watch asserted that in the United King-
 dom, "evidentiary rules in nonjury courts permit the admission into evidence of un-
 reliable confessions, some of which may have been secured by abusive treatment in
 detention."
 There continued to be allegations that police have physically and psychologically
 abused detainees, including teenagers. A new code of practices took effect on Janu-
 ary 1, 1994 further standardizing police interrogation procedures and strengthening
 the oversight requirements. Detainees who claim physical mistreatment have the
 right to an immediate medical examination. Such a claim must be examined by a
 trial judge.
 The   all   urphy Seven," a group of teenagers arrested in connection with an at-
 tack on the RUC, alleged police used physical and mental coercion to elicit their con-
 fessions. Charges against four of the seven were dropped in July after the court de-
 cided there were significant questions regarding their state of mind during interro-
 gation; but the court firmly concluded there had been no police abuse. The remain-
 ing three were released on bail in October, and their cases are pending.
 An appellate court found the prosecution had failed to prove beyond a reasonable
 doubt tat the police had not intimidated Paul Hill into confessing to the 1974 mur-
 der of a former soldier, the court overturned Hill's conviction.
 The ICPC (see Section L.a.) reported that in 1993 it received 1,209 complaints of
 official abuse, that its investigations led to the substantiation of 25, the disciplining
 of 88 police officers, and the lodging of criminal charges against 6 more. In 1993
 the Northern Ireland Secretary named an Independent Assessor of Military Com-
 plaints to deal with procedures regarding complaints of abuses by the Army; he has
 no independent investigative powers. His first report, in May 1994, noted that, of
 210 formal complaints in 1993, 16 were substantiated, but in only one case was a
 soldier severely disciplined.
 The U.N. Committee Against Torture as well as many human rights groups have
 raised concerns about ill-treatment of detainees in Northern Ireland, and rec-
 ommended that interrogations in police custody be videotaped. The Government has
 resisted doing so, on the grounds that taping could compromise operations and jeop-
 ardize informants. Instead, in December 1992 the Government appointed a senior
 barrister as Independent Commissioner for Holding Centers in Northern Ireland,
 with authority to make irregular, unannounced visits to any holding center, observe
 interrogations on television monitors, and interview detainees. His first report, in
 January 1994, found some substandard conditions but no significant human rights
 violations. A Helsinki Watch report, issued later, noted allegations by detainees
 
 
 1027
 under age 18 that they were subjected to physical and mental abuse while in hold-
 ing centers, and were pressured to become informers.
 There are accusations that security forces in Northern Ireland frequently harass
 citizens, particularly young people, in areas where support for terrorists is consid-
 ered strong. The Government strongly denies that such behavior is widespread or
 officially tolerated. Security forces have also been accused of more serious abuses.
 The CAJ (see Section L.a.) reported that the claimed harassment included threats
 to kill, kidnap, or maliciously prosecute. Most complaints come from Republican
 neighborhoods, but after police crackdowns on Loyalist terrorism, reports of house
 searches and street harassment in some Protestant areas increased. Officials assert
 that soldiers and police found guilty of harassment are punished severely, but the
 officials have provided no data or details.
 Both Loyalist and Republican terrorists in Northern Ireland have frequently car-
 ried out "punishment" attacks, typically involving shooting the victim through one
 or beth knees at short range. In April the Provisional IRA carried out 16 punish-
 ment shootings during a 2 hour period in Belfast. Since the August 31 cessation,
 both sides seem to have shifted to punishment by beatings with iron pipes and base-
 ball bats.
 Prison facilities in the UK vary depending upon location. Remand facilities tend
 to be antiquated, overcrowded, unsanitary, and/or deficient in exercise areas. Most
 permanent facilities are good, but an official investigator found some with over-
 crowding, other substandard conditions, or lax disciplne. Facilities in the regular
 prisons in Northern Ireland have "imprved notably in recent years, and are now ex-
 cellent, but conditions st the three holding centers are substandard.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Ezile.-British authorities can and often do
 make arrests or detentions without judicial warrants--especialy in Northern Ire-
 land, under laws applicable oniy there (see below)--when they believe they have
 reasonable cause to suspect wrongdoing.
 Outside Northern rand, suspects arrested without warrants must be released
 within 36 hours unless brought before a magistrate's court. The magistrate may au-
 thorize extension of detention by an additional 60 hours or in cases of crimes of
 violence, for periods of up to 3 years pending trial. Persons charged with
 "nonserious" offenses can request release on bail; bail is almost automatically grant-
 ed in cases not involving violence (unless the suspect previously committed a crime
 while on bail) but otherwise is often denied.
 Under the latest Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act (EPA), passed in
 1991, members of the armed forces on duty in that province can arrest without a
 warrant any person they have reason to suspect of any offense or intent to commit
 any offense. Such suspects may be held for up to 4 hours, and then must be trans-
 ferred to police custody or released.
 Anywhere in the U     the most recent Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provi-
 sions) Act (PTA), passed in 1989, allows the police to arrest without a warrant per-
 sons they have reason to suspect of being involved in terrorism. The authorities may
 detain such persons (even those under 18) for up to 48 hours without legal represen-
 tation or judicial review. Suspects may be interrogated during this time, and confes-
 sions obtained may be used in subsequent court proceedings. Detainees under the
 1989 PTA in England or Wales are granted the right to have lawyers present during
 interrogation, but this is not the case in Northern Ireland. Judicial review may be
 delayed'up to a further 5 days on the authority of the Home Secretary or, in North-
 ern Ireland, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Less than 25 percent of
 the detainees under the PTA are subsequently charged with any criminal offense.
 The Government does not practice exile (see Section 2.d. regarding exclusion or-
 ders), but the terrorist organizations do. Provisional IRA and Loyalist paramilitaries
 in past years have fored numerous people to leave Northern Ireland, by threaten-
 ing death or injury if they remain. An organization that assists threatened persons,
 Famnilies Against Intimidation and Terror, dealt with 35 cases in 1993 (latest data),
 including seven entire families.
 e. Denial of Fair Public TriaL.-The law provides for fair trial, but in practice
 there have been some serious xeptions. In the late 1980's, after 10 years of public
 pressure, the Home Secretary_ directed the courts to reonsider several cases. Appel-
 late courts did so and concluded that: lower courts often relied too heavily on
 uncorroborated confessions and on presumed integrity of the police; appellate judges
 tended to accept lower-court rulings without checing for rocedural flaws and new
 evidence, and occasionally displayed open hostility to the defense; courts sometimes
 accepted tainted forensic evidence; and prosecutors sometimes withheld exculpatory
 evidence from the defense.
 In response, the Government in 1991 established a Royal Commission to review
 all aspects of the criminal justice system in England and Wales. The Commission's
 
 
 1028
 
 report, issued in 1993, included 352 recommendations. In 1994 the Government an-
 nounced its intent to establish in the following year an independent review body for
 appeals of suspected miscarriages of justice.
 In November the Parliament enacted a Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill.
 Under it, judges may instruct juries that they can draw an inference of guilt from
 a defendant's refusal to answer questions during interrogation or trial, though no
 conviction may be based solely on such an inference. H-uman rights groups have
 sharply criticized this provision. A similar one has been in effect in Northern Ire-
 land since 1988.
 An indigent defendant has the right to free counsel of his or her choice. All crimi-
 nal proceedings must be held in public except those in uvenile court or involving
 public decency or security. In a trial under the Official Secrets Act, the judge may
 order the court closed, but the sentencing must be public. Convictions can be ap-
 pealed to successively higher courts.
 In Northern Ireland, special "emergency" restrictions affect due _process. Under
 the 1973 EPA, the Government suspended the right to trial by jury there for certain
 terrorist-related offenses, because terrorists often intimidated the judiciary, jurors,
 and lawyers. Such offenses are tried instead by a "Diplock Court," a judge presiding
 without a jury. If the decision is to convict, the judge must justify it in a document
 that becomes part of the court record, and an appellate court may overturn it on
 substantive as well as legal grounds. The Diplock Courts have been widely criti-
 cized. The EPA also permits the use of uncorroborated confessions, but they cannot
 be the sole basis for conviction anywhere in the UK. The 1988 Criminal Evidence
 Order allows judges to draw adverse inference when a suspect refuses to answer
 questions.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-War-
 rants are normally required for a police search of private premises. However under
 the EPA, on-duty members of the armed forces or policemen in Northern Ireland
 may enter any premises if they believe they have "reasonable grounds of suspicion"
 that the entry is necessary to preserve peace and order.
 In Catholic communities in Northern Ireland, where distrust of the Government
 has deep historical roots, many believe that the conduct of some members of the se-
 curity forces in carrying out security checks constitutes unwarranted harassment
 and intimidation. Such allegations also occur in Protestant neighborhoods, albeit
 less frequently. The Government intensively trains security personnel in proper pro-
 cedures, but acknowledges that violations of the rules occasionally occur.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Strongly held common-law tradition, an inde-
 pendent press, and a democratic political system combine to secure freedom of
 speech and press. Viewpoints critical of the Government are well represented. The
 print media are dominated by a handful of national daily newspapers, all privately
 owned and independent (though often generally aligned with a political party).
 About half the electronic media are ran by the British Broadcasting Corporation
 (BBC) which is funded by the Government but enjoys complete editorial independ-
 ence. Tfhe remainder are run by corporations under renewable government license.
 In September the Government removed Sinn Fein from its list of proscribed ter-
 rorist organizations and their supporters, whose voices may not be broadcast in the
 electronic media. The broadcasting ban remains in place.
 Human rights organizations continued to criticize the Official Secrets Act of 1990,
 which prohibits disclosure of a broad range of foreign policy and national security
 information. They assert that, in the absence of freedom-of-information legislation,
 the Act shields government activities from public scrutiny, including improper or il-
 legal activities if any. Alleged offenses under the Act may be tried in secret and
 the Government need not disclose its justification for holding a secret trial.  ow-
 ever, the Act is seldom invoked and has not prevented the disclosure of numerous
 internal government documents and alleged wrongdoings. Attempts by the Govern-
 ment in the 1980's to prosecute officials who leaked documents generally failed.
 b. Freedom of Peacefzd Assembly and Association.-The Public Order Act of 1986
 gives police broad powers to restrict or ban public demonstrations, marches, and
 gatherings when they deem that violence or vandalism is likely to result. The police
 rarely ban demonstrations; in recent years they have invoked the Act primarily to
 prevent "New Age travelers" from gathering on private property or at ancient monu-
 ments such as       enge.
 The PTA and EPA include sections prohibiting membership in, or support of, spec-
 ified organizations involved in terrorism.
 c. Freedom of Reigon.---Government poicy and practie ensure freedom of reli-
 gion. In Northern Ireland, the Constitution Act of 1973 prohibits public authorities
 
 
 1029
 from discriminating on the basis of religious or political belief (see Section 5 regard-
 "ag the Fair Employment Act). Ministers of the two official churches--the (Anglican)
 Church of England and the (Presbyterian) Church of Scotland--are ineligible to sit
 in the House of Commons, but the most senior ones hold seats in the House of
 Lords.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patiation---Citizens enoy freedom of movement within the country and in foreign
 travel, emigratio, and repatriation. However the Home Secretary may exclude
 from Great Britain anyone believed linked with terrorism in Northern Ireland, ex-
 cept anyone born in Great Britain or resident there for 3 years; and the Secretary
 of State for Northern Ireland can likewise exclude persons not native to or resident
 in that province. Currently 69 persons are subject to exclusion orders. Several Mem-
 bers of Parliament, human rights groups, and the media have objected to exclusion
 orders. The Secretary of State need not reveal the grounds for exclusion, and the
 evidence is not tested in any court. There is no right of appeal to the courts, but
 appeal may be made informally to an independent adrior.
 The Government makes generous provision for political refugees, but faced with
 an exponential rise in asylum applications in recent years, it passed legislation in
 1993 to speed processing of unsubstantiated requests. Human rights groups have
 claimed the legislation undermines Britain's commitment to provide haven for legiti-
 mate refugees.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have this right, and freely exercise it. The Government is formed on the
 basis of a majority of seats in the House of Commons, which are contested in elec-
 tions held at intervals not longer than 5 years. Participation in the political process
 is open to all persons and parties. All citizens 18 years of age and older may vote.
 Northern Ireland has ciy and district councils, as in the rest of the UK, but with
 somewhat fewer powers. England and Wales also have county councils, while North-
 ern Ireland does not. (Scotland's structure is different still.) From 1922 to 1972,
 Northern Ireland had a devolved provincial Parliament at Stormont, which was sus-
 pended because its domination by the unionist majority was seen as contributing
 to the troubles. Attempts have been made since then to restore devolved govern-
 ment.
 Women and minorities face no legal constraints on voting or holding office. The
 Head of State is a woman. The Head of Government from 1979 to 1990 was a
 woman. Two women are members of the present Cabinet. Both the Labour Party
 and the Liberal Democrat Party have instituted a policy of reserving a substantial
 number of candidacies for women, with the goal of equalizing the number of their
 male and female members of Parliament (M.P.'s). Several members of minority eth-
 mc groups serve in Parliament. British dependent territories-other than Hong
 Kong-have small populations, under 60,000, and all are ruled by appointed gov-
 ernors or administrators assisted by executive councils (usually appointed) andleg-
 islative assemblies or councils (partly elected).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The many nongovernmental human rights organizations operate with no govern-
 ment interference. In 1973 the Government established a Standing Advisory Com-
 mission on Human Rights to monitor human rights in Northern Ireland; but the
 Government has declined to adopt many of its recommendations.
 A number of international nongovernmental human rights organizations, includ-
 ing Amnesty International, are based in the United KIngdm. The Government co-
 operates fully with international inquiries into alleged violations of human rights.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 British laws prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, nationality, or na-
 tional or ethnic origin, and outlaws incitement to racial hatred- except that racial
 discrimination is not specifically outlawed in Northern Ireland. he Government re-
 spects all the anti-discrimination laws. In 1991 the Prime Minister announced that
 sexual orientation would not longer be a bar to receiving a security clearance, but
 the Ministry of Defense has continued to dismiss male and female homosexual mem-
 bers of the armed services on grounds of "incompatibility with the military services";
 some 75 have been administratively discharged every year on the basis of informa-
 tion obtained in routine investigations by the Special Investigations Bureau.
 Women.-The law provides for equal opportunity as between the sexes. An Equal
 Opportunities Commission (EOC) supports persons who bring discrimination cases
 
 
 1030
 before industrial tribunals and courts, and it produces guidelines on good practice
 for employers. Employed women throughout the UK earned approximately 25 per-
 cent less than their male counterparts in comparable positions.
 Although the UK has no writtn law specifically prohibiting sexual harassment,
 the comon law recogizes ita a valid claim for unfair dismissal. In August a
 court convicted an employer of sexual harassment and two counts of sexual assault,
 sentenced him to 18 months in prison, and awarded the victim a record $53,720
 (34 000 pounds).
 le 1975 Sex Discrimination Act as amended in 1986 prohibits indirect as well
 as direct discrimination in employment, training, education, housing, and provision
 of goods and services. Industrial tribunals in 1994 ruled that the Ministry of De-
 fense had acted improperly in having required pregnant soldiers, prior to a 1990
 change in regulations, to quit or be discharged. The tribunals awarded the plaintiffs
 substantial damages, the highest exceeding $460,000 (300,000 pounds); a court later
 ruled that some ofthe awars had been excessive.
 Women have equal rights regarding property and divorce. Statistical and other
 evidence indicates that most victims of violence ae women. The law provides for
 injunctive relief, personal protection orders, and exclusion orders. The Government
 provides shelters, counseling, and other assistance for victims of battery or rape,
 and it offers free legal aid to battered women who are economically rel ant upon
 their abuser. It actively prosecutes perpetrators of domestic violence, and the law
 provides for their imprisonment. The courts have held that nonconsensual marital
 sex can constitute a criminal offense. In 1994 London municipal authorities
 launched a "zero tolerance campaign" to raise public awareness of the extent of do-
 mestic violence, promote legislative change, and provide adequate support to bat-
 tered women and their childrxen.
 Children.-Wbile there ame no reliable data on child abuse, indications are that
 it is a problem in the United Kingdom.
 Various laws covering England and Wales stipulate that children have the right
 to apply for court orders, to give or withhold consent for medical treatment (for
 those capable of making an informed decision), to make complaints to the relevant
 local authority to have their ethnic, linguistic, and religious back und considered
 in decisions affecting them, to have reasonable contact with their family (usually ap-
 plied in a circumstance where there has been abuse), and in general to be consulted
 regarding their desires.
 National/Racial/Ethnc Minorities.raThe Secretary of State for Northern Ireland
 has undertaken to investigate possibilties for legislation that specifically outlaws
 racial discrimination in that prvince; such a law would fill the soe gap in the Unit-
 ed Kingdoms legislated prohiitions of discrimination based on race, color, national-
 ity or national or ethnic origin. The Secretary also has undertaken to determine
 what more the Provincial Government should do to promote equal treatment of eth-
 nic groups.
 A government-appointed but independent Commission for Racial Euality (CRE)
 provides guidelines on good practice, supports persons taking court action under the
 sace Relations Act of 1976, and may initiate its own court action. Autr investigat-
 ing a complaint, the  cRE may issue a notice requiring that the discrimination be
 stopped. The ORE monitors the response to such a notice for 5 years. In June the
 ORE launched a campaign, Uniting Britain for a Just Society," to change attitudes
 throughout the Kingdom so as to make racial discrimination socially unacceptable.
 Although the law prohibits discrimination based on race, persons of African or
 South Asian origin face substantial unofficial discrimination. An inquiry conducted
 by the Council or Legal Education, a nongovernmental organization, found that ra-
 cial discrimination by baristers was a key factor in the high failure rate among
 black students attempting to qualify for the bar; the report recommended a series
 of reforms. Several studies showed that ethnic minorities were less likely to obtain
 jobs and mortgages and more likely to live in overcrowded housing than were
 whites. Members of Asian or African minorities were also the targets of racial in-
 sita and occasional "skinhead violence.
 Police recorded over 9,000 racial incidents in England and Wales alone in 1993
 (latest data), and a government report in Mardi estimated that, nationwide, the
 total including unreported incidents was some 130,000 in 1993 which was double
 the 1989 figure. The great majority involved verbal abuse, but tfier here also inci-
 dents of violence by skinheads.
 In London's East End in early 1994, a series of nine apparently racially motivated
 beatings of Asians by white males was followed by two kilngs, by Asians, of white
 youths-a 13-year-old in February and a 12-year-old in August. In the first beating
 incident, police succeeded in promptly identifying and arresting 5 of the 20 to 30
 perpetrators.
 
 
 1031
 Religious Minorltie-Although discrimination in employment on the grounds of
 religious belief has been unlawful since 1976, it has continued to occur in Northern
 Ireland, including at times by local governments. While active recruitment of Catho-
 lics to the Civil Service has produced rough proportionality in overall numbers, in
 1992 the Northern Ireland Civil Service acknowledged that Catholics remained sig-
 nificantly underrepresented in the senior grades, and in November 1993 it declared
 its intention to overcome this imbalance.
 For a variety of historical and social reasons, the Protestant community controls
 much of the local economy in Northern Ireland, and anti-Catholic discrimination
 persists in the private sector there. Despite government efforts, the unemployment
 rate there for Catholic men in 1994 remained 2  times that for Protestant men.
 Government efforts to increase recruitment of Catholics into the police force and re-
 lated security fields in the province have been hampered by Provisional IRA assas-
 sinations and death threats, as well as widespread antipathy there to the security
 forces.
 The 1989 Fair Emiployment (Northern Ireland) Act as amended aims to end even
 unintentional or indiect discrimination in the workplace. A Fair Employment Tri-
 bunal adjudicates complaints. All public-sector employers, and allprivate firms with
 over 10 workers, must report annually to the Fair Employment Commission on the
 religious composition of their work force, and must review their employment prac-
 tices at least once every 3 years. Noncompliers face criminal penalties and loss of
 government contracts. Victims of employment discrimination may sue for damages.
 While critics of the Act have asserted that its targets and timetables are too impre-
 cise most leaders of the Catholic community have praised it as a positive step. Still,
 Catholics hope to strengthen it in 1995, when it is to be reviewed by the Standing
 Advisory Committee on Human R'ghts.
 People With Disabilities.-The N  does not have one overarching law which ad-
 dresses the rights of disabled people; instead, various pieces of legislation provide
 for government assistance in education, mobility, home care, and access to build-
 ings.
 Access to buildings is improving but inadequate. Many buildings are so old that
 they do not have elevators. Since 1985, government regulations have required that
 all new buildings meet the access requirements of all persons with impaired mobil-
 ity. In June 1992 the Government effected similar regulations for sensory-impaired
 persons.
 Government regulations mandate that by 2000 all taxis be accessible to wheel-

 A Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill, with provisions similar to those in the laws
 against discrimination based on race or sex, was defeated in Parliament due to con-
 cerns that its cost to businesses would be prohibitive.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right ofAssociation.-Workers have the right to form and join unions, and
 the Government fully respects this. Unions participate freely in international orga-
 nizations.
 Unions are free of government control. Like employers' associations, they must
 have their accounts certified by the Government. Senior union officers must be elect-
 ed by secret ballot. The law mandates secret ballots before a strike call; prohibits
 unions from disciplining members who reject a legal strike call; and allows members
 to lodge complaints against their union with a government-appointed commissioner.
 There is no specific statutory "right to strike" in the UK. Voluntary cessation of
 work may be considered a breach of contract. A system of legal immunities from
 prosecution for unions engaged in lawful industrial action was narrowed by acts of
 Parliament in the 1980's. These acts exclude secondary strikes and actions judged
 to have political motives; unions encouraging such strikes are subject to fines and
 seizure of their assets. he legislation also restricts the ability of unions to act
 against subsidiaries of prime employers with whom they are in dispute when the
 subsidiaries are not party to the dispute and are the employers of record.
 In September 1993 the Council of Europe (COE) determined that British labor
 law violated the European Social Charter by permitting an employer to dismiss all
 employees who take part in a strike and then, after 3 months, to rehire them selec-
 tively. The COE requested the British Government to notify the COE of the meas-
 ures to be taken to remedy this defect, but the Government has not done so, as it
 has opted out of the Charter.
 Legislation in 1978 and 1990 made it illegal to deny employment on the ground
 the applicant is not a union member. The Trade Union Reform and Employment
 Rights Act of 1993 abolished the Wage Councils; set new procedural requirements
 for union strikes, dues collection, and membership rules; and made it possible for

 private citizens, when deprived of goods or services due to strike action, to seek
 damages and to obtain assistance for this from the Government. An amendment re-
 verses a court ruling that had banned employers from offering workers financial in-
 ducements to give up trade union representation. The Trade Unions Congress (TUC)
 in 1993 lodged complaints with the International Labor Organization (ILO) on var-
 ious provisions of the 1993 Act (see b., next); by year's end the ILO had not com-
 pleted consideration of these complaints.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Although there is no legal ob-
 ligation for employers to bargain with workers' representatives, and labor-manage-
 ment contracts are not enforceable in the courts, collective bargaining is longstand-
 ing and widespread, covering about 40 percent of the work force.
 The 1993 Act cited above abolished the Mediation Service's mandate to promote
 collective bargaining-, this was the subject of another TUC complaint to the ILO.
 Workers who believe themselves victims of antiunion discrimination may seek re-
 dress through industrial tribunals. Remedies available include payment of indem-
 nities and reinstatement.
 Contrary to ILO Convention 98, on the right to organize and bargain collectively,
 it is lawful for employers or others to circulate blacklists of union members seeking
 employment. In May 1993 the ILO concluded that the British Government is obliged
 to protect union members from such discrimination, but the Government has not re-
 sponded to this.
 Export processing zones do not exist.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is pro-
 hibited and is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.--&hool attendance until the age
 of 16 is compulsory. Children under age 16 are not permitted to work in an indus-
 trial enterprise except as part of an educational course.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-There is no legislated minimum wage. The
 Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act of 1993 abolished the wage council
 system, which prior to September 1993 had established minimum hourly wages and
 overtime rates for adult workers in 26 low-wage industries. The United Kingdom
 has no legislation limiting daily or weekly working hours.
 The Health and Safety at Work Act of 1974 requires that the health and safety
 of employees not be placed at risk. A Health and Safety Commission effectively en-
 forces regulations on these matters, and may initiate criminal proceedings. Workers'
 representatives actively monitor the enforcement.
