 SAINT LUCIA
 Saint Lucia is a multi party, parliamentary democracy and a member of the Com-
 monwealth of Nations. Except or a hiatus between 1979 and 1982, Prime Minister
 John Compton has led the Government since 1964. His United Workers Party
 (UWP) deated the main opposition Saint Lucia Labour Part in 1987 and again
 in 1992, and holds 11 seats in the 17-member House of Assembly.
 The Royal Saint Lucia Police is the only security force and includes a small unit
 called the Special Services Unit (which has some paramilitary training) and a Coast
 Guard unit. Although the police have traditionally demonstrated a high degree of
 
 
 500
 respect for human rights, some people arrested for crimes or in jail alleged physical
 abuse by police and prison officials.
 The economy is based on tourism and on the export of bananas, which represent
 the principal sources of foreign exchange earnings. Saint Lucia is diversifying its
 economy into other ts of agriculture, light manufacturing, and construction. Un-
 employment, estimated at 25 percent, remains a source of potential instability.
 The authorities generally respected human rights. Government criticism of the
 media, violence against women, and a lack of effective government children's rights
 programs continued to be a problem.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 In October 1993, paramilitary policemen killed two farmers during a scuffle to
 clear a road blockade farmers had erected to protest low banana prices. Although
 the Government began an inquest into police actions in the matter in mid-Decem-
 ber, at year's end it had not issued a report.
 In August 1992, a prison official in Castries shot dead an inmate serving a 20-
 year sentence for rape, and then apparently committed suicide. An official commis-
 sion of inquest in early 1994 determined that the officer acted alone, and that the
 killing was not politically motivated.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution specifically prohibits torture, and there were no reports of such
 abuse. However, there was an increasing trend of convictions based on confessions
 in recent years, which may reflect an effort by police to force confessions rather than
 use investigative approaches. As in past years, there were occasional credible allega-
 tions of physical abuse of prisoners by law enforcement officials prior to and during
 incarceration. The Government has not taken any specific action in response to
 these allegations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Government adheres to the constitu-
 tional provisions prohibiting arbitrary arrest or imprisonment and requiring a court
 hearing within 72 hours after detention. However, the authorities frequently held
 prisoners for years "on remand" after charging them (there is no constitutional re-
 quirement for a speedy trial). There were no reports of arbitrary arrest or forced
 exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-There are two levels of courts in St. Lucia: courts
 of summary jurisdiction (magistrate's courts) and the High Court. Both levels have
 civil and criminal authority. The lower courts accept civil claims up to about $1,900
 (EC$5 000) in value, and criminal cases generally classified as  tty." The upper
 court has unlimited authority in both civil and criminal cases. All cases judge  at
 the magistrate's or High Court levels can be appealed to the OECS (Organization
 of East Caribbean States) Court of Appeal. From there, cases may be appealed to
 the Privy Council, in London, as the final court of appeal.
 The Constitution requires public trials before an independent and impartial court
 and, in cases involving capital punishment, provision of legal counsel for those who
 cannot afford a defense attorney. In criminal cases not involving capital punish-
 ment, defendants must obtain their own legal counsel. Defendants are entitled to
 select their own legal counsel, are presumed innocent until proven guilty in court,
 and have the right of appeal. The authorities observe both constitutional and statu-
 tory requirements for fair public trials.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-There
 were no reports of arbitrary intrusion by the Government into the private lives of
 individual citizens. Authorities consistently observed constitutional prohibitions
 against arbitrary search, seizure, and entry.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Government generally respects
 constitutional provisions for free speech and press, it occasionally demonstrated
 open hostility toward both the print media andradio. At the annual UWP conven-
 tion in July, the Prime Minister charged that beth print and electronic media were
 "biased and negative to the point of vi iousness anddestructive." In September the
 Prime Minister announced that he was taking government-owned and operated
 Radio Saint Lucia off the air. He said the station, which had been censored in 1993
 over a controversial call-in talk show, was running at a financial loss, and that Gov-
 ernment would allow it to resume broadcasting If an appointed panel could deter-

 mine that the station could operate profitably. In general, the press does not appear
 to practice self-censorshi.
 Three privately owned newspapers and two privately owned radio stations cover
 a wide spectrum of political opinion and are often highly critical of the Government.
 The one local television station is also privately owned and covers a wide range of
 views. In addition, the public can subscribe to cable television service, which pro-
 vides broadcasts from a variety of sources.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of association and assembly. The law requires permits for public meetings
 and demonstrations if they are to be held in public places, such as on streets or side-
 walks or in parks. The police routinely grant such permits; the rare refusal gen-
 erally stems from the failure of organizers to request the permit in a timely manner,
 normally 48 hours before the event.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. All religions are free to maintain places
 of worship, establish religious schools, and engage in the full range of activities nor-
 mally associated with religious organizations.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens have the right to change their government. Saint Lucia's parliamentary
 system provides for genuine choices among parties, policies, and officials. Although
 there are two main parties several other political organizations also articipate in
 free elections, which are held at least every 5 years, by secret ballot. The opposition
 Saint Lucia Labour Party plays a significant role in the country's political  e and
 holds 6 of the 17 seats in the legislative House of Assembly.
 There are no impediments to participation by women or minorities in Govern-
 ment. Both the Attorney General and the deputy leader of the Senate are women.
 However, women and minorities are not represented in numbers paralleling their
 proportion of the population.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While there are no local human rights groups in Saint Lucia, there are no govern-
 mental restrictions which would prevent their formation. International human
 rights groups, including Amnesty International and the Caribbean Human Rights
 Network (the latter based in Barbados), made no reports or requests for investiga-
 tions on Saint Lucia during the year.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 Government policy is nondiscriminatory in the areas of housing, jobs, education,
 and opportunity for advancement. There are no legal restrictions on the role of
 women or minorities.
 Women.-There is increased awareness of the seriousness of violence against
 women. The Government does not prosecute crimes of violence against women un-
 less the victim herself presses charges. If the victim chooses for any reason not to
 press charges, the Government cannot bring a case. Charges must be brought under
 the ordinary civil code. The police force conducts some training for police officers re-
 sponsible for investigating rape and other crimes against women. Police and courts
 enforce laws to protect women against abuse, although police are hesitant to inter-
 vene in domestic disputes, and many victims are reluctant to report cases of domes-
 tic violence and rape or to press charges.
 The Saint Lucia Crisis Center monitors cases of abuse (physical and emotional)
 and helps its clients deal with such problems as incest, nonpayment of child sup-
 port, alcohol and drug abuse, homelessness, custody, and visitation rights. The
 group has publicized the plight of battered women and has protested the rare
 deaths of women who were victims of domestic violence. The Crisis Center is also
 working to establish a shelter for battered women and homeless girls. Some second-
 ary schools address the problem of sexual harassment and battering in their cur-
 riculum topics.
 The Minister for Women's Affairs is responsible for protecting women's rights in
 domestic violence cases and preventing discrimination against women, including
 equal treatment in employment. The Minister has recently completed a report on
 the status of women, which should be published in early 1995.
 
 
 502
 Children.-Despite the 1992 Children's Rights Act, which details a strong commit-
 ment to children's rights, the Government has not fulfilled that commitment with
 effective programs. Domestic violence and incest continued to be the problems most
 affecting the welfare of children in Saint Lucia. The Government keeps no figures
 on the incidence of child abuse.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no specific legislation protecting the rights of
 the disabled, nor mandating provision of access to buildings or government services
 for them. There is no rehabilitation facility in Saint Lucia, although the Health Min-
 istry operates a community-based rehabilitation program in residents' homes.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution specifies the right of workers to
 form or belong to trade unions under the broader rubric of the right of association.
 Most public sector employees are unionized; about 22 percent of the total work force
 is unionized. Unions are independent of government, and are free to choose their
 own representatives in often vigorously contested elections. All unions are free to
 publicize their views and to choose policies to advance their members' best interests.
 There is no restriction on forming a national labor federation, and several of the
 major unions formed an umbrella grouping called the "Industrial Solidarity Pact."
 Unions are free to affiliate with international organizations, and some have done
 so.
 Strikes in both the public and private sectors are legal, but there are many ave-
 nues through collective bargaining agreement and government procedures which
 may preclude a strike. The law prohibits the police and fire departments from strik-
 ing. Other "essential services" workers-water and sewer authority workers, electric
 utility workers, nurses, and doctors-must give 31 days' notice before striking.
 Strikes became more common in the wake of the October 1993 protest by banana
 farmers, perhaps because militancy appeared to have been effective. Public sector
 employees in customs, air and sea ports, inland revenue, Radio Saint Lucia, and
 others struck in 1994.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have the legal right
 to engage in collective bargaining, and they fully exercise that right. The 6-year
 wage agreement that the Government reached with six public sector unions ap-
 peared to break down in the summer, resulting in widespread strike action. Public
 sector unions sought wage increases comparable to the over 50-percent increases
 granted to the most highly ranked ministry officials. The law prohibits antiunion
 discrimination by employers, and there are effective mechanisms for resolving com-
 plaints. It also requires that employers reinstate workers fired for union activities.
 Labor law is applicable in the export processing zones (EPZ's), and there are no
 administrative or legal impediments to union organizing or collective bargaining in
 those zones. In practice, however, many firms do not welcome union efforts to orga-
 nize in the EPZ's.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced or compulsory labor is ille-
 gal and does not exist.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Women's and Young Persons
 Act stipulates a minimum legal working age of 14 years. Ministry of Labor officials
 effectively enforce the law.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Wages Regulations (Clerks) Orders, in ef-
 fect since February 1985, set out minimum wage rates only for clerks. These office
 workers receive a legislated minimum wage of about $300 (EC $800) per month. The
 minimum wage is not sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for a worker
 in a four-person family, but almost all categories of workers receive more than the
 legal minimum for clerks, which is used only as a guide for setting pay for other
 professions.
 There is no legislated workweek, although the common practice is to work 40
 hours in 5 days. Special legislation covers hours which shop assistants, agricultural
 workers, domestics, and young people in industrial establishments may work.
 Occupational health and safety regulations are relatively well developed. The
 Labor Ministry periodically inspects health and safety conditions at places of em-
 ployment under the Employees' Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1985. The
 Ministry enforces the Act through threat of closure of the business if it discovers
 violations and the violator does not correct them. Workers are free to leave a dan-
 gerous workplace situation without jeopardy to continued employment.
