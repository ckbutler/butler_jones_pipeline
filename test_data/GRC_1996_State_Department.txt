 GREECE
 Greece is a constitutional republic and multiparty parliamentary democracy with
 an independent judiciary in which citizens periodically choose their representatives
 in free and fair elections. In 1996 parliamentary elections, the Panhellenic Socialist
 Movement (PASOK) won a majority of the parliamentary seats, and its leader, Con-
 stantine Simitis, was returned to office as Prime Minister. The defeated New De-
 mocracy Party retained the role of the main opposition.
 The national police and security services are responsible for internal security. Ci-
 vilian authorities maintain effective control of all security forces, and police and se-
 curity services are subject to a broad variety of legal and constitutional restraints.
 The Parliament, a vigorous free press, the judiciary, the European Parliament, and
 Greek and international human rights organizations monitor their activities. Some
 members of the police and security forces nevertheless committed human rights
 abuses.
 Greece has a mixed economy in which the market system is overlaid by a large
 public sector that accounts for more than 40 percent of gross domestic product. Mod-
 erate growth, a high but declining inflation rate, a large but also declining budget
 deficit, and a 9.8 percent unempoyment rate characterize the economy, which nev-
 ertheless provides residents wi  a relatively advanced standard of living. To pro-
 mote further economic development, Greece relies heavily on the European Union
 for subsidies, grants, and loans, the latter two directed mainly toward major infra-
 structure projects.
 
 
 The Government generally respected the human rights of most citizens, but prob-
 lems remained in some areas. There continued to be credible reports that security
 force personnel sometimes abused suspects during arrests and interrogations and
 abused Albanian illegal aliens. Relations between Greece and Albania improved sub-
 stantially, however, and an agreement was reached to regulate the flow of Albanian
 seasonal workers to Greece. The Government continued to use Article 19 of the Citi-
 zenship Code to revoke the citizenship of Greek citizens who are not ethnically
 Greek, and Article 20 of the same code was used to revoke the citizenship of Greek
 citizens abroad who have asserted a "Macedonian" ethnicity. On occasion the Gov-
 ernment placed international and domestic human rights monitors under surveil-
 lance. Information about their private meetings and activities subsequently ap-
 peared in the press.
 Responding to criticism, the Government continued to take corrective action to re-
 lieve severe overcrowding and harsh living conditions in some prisons and police
 holding centers. Problems remain, however, as evidenced by violent prison riots in
 March and June. There are some restrictions on freedom of religion; four persons
 were prosecuted for proselytizing, two persons were prosecuted for illegal operation
 of a "house of prayer," and a number of Jehovah's Witnesses were harassed by au-
 thorities. Discrimination against minorities continued to be a problem.
 The Government formally recognizes only one minority, the Muslim minority re-
 ferred to in the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. It refuses to acknowledge formally the
 existence of any other ethnic groups under the term "minority" and denies members
 of the Slavophone community the right to identify themselves as a minority. As a
 result, some individuals who define themselves as members of a minority find it dif-
 ficult to express freely their identity and to maintain their culture.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political
 killings.
 There were several reports of shootings at the Greek-Albanian border of illegal
 Albanian migrants being apprehended by Greek authorities. The Albanian Govern-
 ment protested four separate incidents to the Greek Government, including alleged
 shootings on the border in June and August and elsewhere in the country in Janu-
 ary and April. At least two migrants were killed in these incidents. According to
 the Greek Government, each of the incidents was investigated, and criminal pro-
 ceedings were initiated against the responsible officers. The Government empila-
 sized that the incidents represented violations of an official policy against the use
 of force.
 According to press reports, a man who died in police custody had suffered a heart
 attack after being beaten. An internal investigation concluded that he died of natu-
 ral causes (see Section 1.c.).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution specifically forbids torture, and a 1984 law makes the use of tor-
 ture an offense punishable by a sentence of 3 years' to life imprisonment. However,
 this law has never been invoked, even though a 1993 report by the Council of Eu-
 rope (COE) Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment (CPT) concluded that certain categories of persons de-
 tained or arrested by the police, particularly persons arrested for drug-related of-
 fenses or for crimes such as murder, rape, or robbery, run a significant risk of being
 mistreated and are occasionally subjected to severe mistreatment or torture.
 The Government continued its own internal review of the CPT charges and as of
 September reported that of the 33 lawsuits filed against policemen in the period
 1989-93 for abuse, torture, and mistreatment, 10 cases were still pending in court
 or under investigation. One case was closed when the police officer was found inno-
 cent.
 Five police officers were under internal investigation following allegations that
 they severely beat a man arrested in January in Irakion, Crete. Criminal charges
 filed by the individual were pending at year's end. Press reports claimed that a man
 found dead the same month in a police detention center in Vyron had died of a heart
 attack after being beaten. An internal investigation determined that he had died of
 natural causes and resulted in no disciplinary action; a related court case was also
 pending. In February a man arrested on robbery charges in Thessaloniki filed as-
 sault charges against several police officers. The charges and an internal investiga-
 tion were pending. Some police also abused suspects during interrogations (see Sec-
 tion 1.d.).
 
 
 958
 In February a security team raided a Romani settlement near Athens in search
 of a murder suspect. Television coverage of the raid showed heavily armed team
 members dragging camp residents, including the elderly and juveniles, from their
 shack, forcingthem to lie face down in the dirt, and kicking them. Seventy persons
 were arrested, but the murder suspect was not found. A subsequent internal police
 investigation cleared the chief of police of wrongdoing, but it resulted in the dismis-
 sal of two other officers and the reprimand of a third officer for violations of police
 procedures and the use of excessive force.
 Prison conditions remained poor. Despite several changes in the law to permit
 earlier parole of prisoners, substantial overrowding continued to plague prisons
 throughout the country. Overcrowding contributed to unrest in six provincial prisons
 in March, and there were violent prison riots in March and June. While the capacity
 of Korydalls (the largest prison, located in Athen) is 40 inmates, some 960 were
 housed there in the first 10 months of the year. As of September 1, the Ministry
 of Justice reported that the number of prisoners was 5,178 (of whom approximately
 2,000 were foreigners), while the total capacity of the prison system was 4,302.
 The Government has instituted new training programs for wardens and new voca-
 tional training programs for inmates. The Mistry of Justice announced plans to
 begin construction of two major new prisons in 1997 in order to reduce overcrowd-
 ing. Prison conditions for conscientious objectors continued to improve as a result
 of government actions to reduce overcrowding and to increase work opportunities in
 prisons, which reduced the time of imprisonment. A law passed in June granted vot-
 ing rights to certain inmates.
 In past years there were credible reports of rape by inmates (including rape of
 juveniles by other juveniles), physical abuse by prison guards, and violence per-
 petratd by inmates, including against foreign prsonrs. There were no press re-
 ports of such incidents in 1996. In Augut, however, the Albanian Government pro-
 tested mistreatment of inmates in the Patras and Iwannina prisons that was report-
 edy condoned by prison officials. Albanian consular officials were denied permission
 to visit either prison. Several inmate disturbances over conditions occurred.
 A 1995 bilateral agreement between Greece and Albania provides for the transfer
 of Albanian inmates to Albanian prisons. Although there are approximately 1,000
 Albanian prisoners in Greek jails, only 23 were repatriated under the agreement
 during the first 9 months of the year. The Government attributed low participation
 in the repatriation program to the unwillingness of Albanian prisoners to consent
 to repatriation.
 The Government is inconsistent in granting permission for prison visits by non-
 governmental organizations.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution rquires judicial war-
 rants for all arrests, except during the actual commission of a crime, and the law
 prohibits arbitrary arrest orders. Police must, by law, bring a person arrested on
 the basis of a warrant or while committing a crime before an examining magistrate
 within 24 hours. The magistrate must issue a detention warrant or order the release
 of the detainee within 3 days, unless special circumstances require a 2-day exten-
 sion of this time limit.
 Defendants brought to court before the end of the day following the commission
 of a charged offense may be tried immediately, under a "spedy procedure." Al-
 though legal safeguards, including representation by counsel, apply in speedy proce-
 dure cases, the short priod of time may inhibit the defendants ability to present
 an adequate defense. Defendats may ask for a delay to provide time to prepare
 their defense, but the court is not obliged to grant it. The speedy procedue was
 used in less than 10 percent of misdemeanor cases. It does not apply to felonies.
 The police sometimes violated these legal safeguards. CPT team members stated
 that the police, durin investigation of serious crimes, occasionally interrogated sis-
 pects as "witnesses," alegedly because witnesses d not have the right tolegal rep-
 resentation during police questioning. Statements made to the police in these cir-
 cumstancs maybe used against these persons in court if they are later charged
 and brought to trial. Witnesses do not have the legal right to remain silent, al-
 though they are not required to testify against themselves. In such cases access to
 a lawyer can be effectively denied until aftr interrogation, which in some cases has
 resulted in torture or mistreatment and the subsequent signing of a statement.
 These cirumstances were reportedly most likely to occur in cases of serious crimes,
 including drug offenses, inwich the police did not have sufficient evidence to con-
 vict without a confession. The Government did not prosecute and punish any offi-
 cials for such misconduct during the year.
 The effective maximum duration of pretrial detention is 18 months for felonies
 and 9 months for misdemeanors. Defense lawyers complain that pretrial detention
 is overly long and overused by judges. A panel of judges may grant release pending
 
 
 959
 
 trial, with or without bail. Pretrial detainees made up 32 percent of those incarcer-
 ated, according to government sources. A person convicted of a misdemeanor and
 sentenced to 2 years or less may, at the court's discretion, pay a fine in lieu of being
 i   rned.
 I   e is unconstitutional, and no cases have been reported since the restoration
 of democracy in 1974. However, Greek citizens not of ethnic Greek origin who travel
 outside the country may be deprived of their citizenship and refused readmittance
 to the country under Article 19 of the Citizenship Code. Article 20 of the Code per-
 mits the Government to strip citizenship from those who "commit acts contrary to
 the interests of Greece for the benefit of a foreign state.- Article 19 was applied in
 84 cases in 1996; the Government would not reveal the number of Article 20 cases
 it pursued in 1996 (see Section 24.).
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for the independence
 of the judiciary, but there have been charges that judges sometimes allow political
 criteria, including the desire to obtain promotion, to influence their judgments.
 The judicial system includes three levels of courts, appointed judges, an examin-
 ing magistrate system, and trial by judicial panels.
 The Constitution provides for public trials, and trial court sessions are open to
 the public, unless the court decides that privacy is required to protect victims and
 witnesses, or the cases involve national security matters. According to defense attor-
 neys, the latter provision has not been invoked since the restoration of democracy
 in 1974. The defendant enjoys the presumption of innocence, the standard of proof
 of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the right to present evidence and witnesses, the
 right of access to the prosecution's evidence, the right to cross-examine witnesses,
 and the right to counsel. Lawyers are provided to defendants who are not able to
 afford legal counsel only in felony cases. Both the prosecution and the defense have
 the right of appeal.
 Although non-Greek speaking defendants have the right to a court-appointed in-
 terpreter, the low fees paid for such work often result in a poor quality of trans-
 lation; foreign defendants complain that they do not understand their trials.
 The legal system does not discriminate against women or minorities, with some
 exceptions: Article 19 of the Citizenship Code (see Section 2.d.) applies only to Greek
 citizens who are not ethnically Greek; Orthodox and non-Orthodox religions have
 different legal procedures for applying for a "house of prayer" permit (see Section
 2.c.); nonethnic Greek citizens are  gally prohibited from settling in a large "super-
 vised zone" near the frontier (in practice this prohibition is not enforced); and a
 1939 law prohibits the functioning of private schools in buildings owned by non-Or-
 thodox religious foundations. (However, in practice this prohibition is not enforced.)
 Although laws that limit freedom of expression remain in force (see Section 2.a.),
 no one has been imprisoned as a result of such charges in the last year. Those con-
 victed in the past were allowed to convert their convictions into a fine of approxi-
 mately $14 per day.
 Amnesty International reported several derogations from international standards
 in group trials of students stemming from violent demonstrations in late 1995 at
 Athens Polytechnic University.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution prohibits the invasion of privacy and searches without warrants, and
 the law permithe he monitoring of personal communications only under strict judi-
 cial controls. However, the number of persons and groups subjected to government
 surveillance in recent years raises questions about safeguards.
 The security services continued to target human rights activists, non-Orthodox re-
 ligious groups, and minority group representatives and to monitor foreign diplomats
 who met with such individuals. On several occasions, information about such pri-
 vate meetings, including official government documents, was published by the press.
 Human rights activists also reported the continuation of suspicious openings and di-
 versions of mail, some of which was never delivered but was subsequently published
 in newspapers with apparent links to security services. As far as is known, the Gov-
 ernment took no steps to stop such practices or to prosecute those involved.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and the press is provided
 for in the Constitution, and the Government generally respected these rights in
 practice, but with some exceptions. Some legal restrictions on free speech remain
 in force; the Government continued to use such laws against individuals who raise
 p9litically sensitive topics such as the assertion of nonrecognized ethnic minority
 identification.
 
 
 960
 
 Articles of the Penal Code that are at times used to restrict free speech and the
 press include Article 141, which forbids exposing the friendly relations of the Greek
 state with foreign states to danger of disturbance; Article 191, which prohibits
 spreading false information and rumors liable to create concern and fear among citi-
 zens and cause disturbances in the country's international relations and inciting
 citizens to rivalry and division, leading to disturbance of the peace; and Article 192,
 which prohibits inciting citizens to acts of violence or to disturbing the peace
 through disharmony among them.
 These laws were invoked in September when the public prosecutor of Florina or-
 dered the Rainbow Party to remove a bilingual sign outside its office that used a
 Slavic place name for a Greek city, on the grounds that it "promoted divisiveness."
 The public prosecutor pressed charges against the Rainbw Party for the display of
 a siiar sin in 1995. In addition, an official of the Rainbow Party was charged
 with a criminal offense under Article 191 for attempting to import two wall cal-
 endars in March that identified Greek cities by their Slavic names. No trial date
 had been set by year's end.
 On matters other than those involving the question of ethnic minorities, Greece
 generally enjoys atradition of outspoken public disourse and a vigorous free press.
 rnment repealed a law that forbade "insulting authority" and it
 proscribed prosecution of otherwise actionable "offenses committed by or through
 the press."
 Satirical and opposition newspapers do not hesitate to attack the highest state au-
 thorities. The Constitution allows for seizure (but not prior restraint), by order of
 the public prosecutor, of publications that insult the President, offend religious be-
 liefs, contain obscene articles, advocate violent overthrow of the political system, or
 disclose military and defense information. Seizures have been rare, however, and
 none occurred in 1996.
 Despite the official prohibition on prosecuting offenses committee by or through
 the press, Musim journalist Abdul Ded was ch arged under Article 191 as well as
 undr libel codes for an article he wrote in January concerning extremist groups in
 Thrace. His trial, originally scheduled for December, was postponed until 1997.
 The Government is prosecutng Radio Icik, a Turkish-language station in Xanthi,
 for operatinmg without a icense in 1994 and 1995. No other radio stations have been
 prsecuted under these statutes despite the fact that many operate without licenses.
 The case is to be heard in February 1997.
 In April a Turkish-language radio station in the Thracian village of Selero was
 damaged in a fire that the station owner claimed was caused by arson. He claimed
 that he had received warnings prior to the fire; he did not produce evidence, how-
 ever, to refute the finding of the Government's investigation, which was that the
 cause was electrical.
 The Constitution provides that the state exercise "immediate control" over radio
 and television. An independent, government-appointed body with the authority to
 enact rules governing private broadcasting established procedural regulations for
 radio several years ago. In 1993 it did so for television as well, issuing licenses to
 six private stations, Many other private television stations operated without li-
 censes, however. State-run stations tended to emphasize the Government's views
 but also reported objectively on other parties' programs and positions. Private radio
 and television stations operated independently of any Government control over their
 reporting. Members of ethnic, religious, and linguistic minorities freely publish peri-
 odicals and other publications, often in their native language. In Thrace, Turkish-
 language television broadcasts are widely available.
 An Athens court acquitted actor Vassilis Diamantopolous and professor George
 Roussis in May of charges of "praising a criminal act" n conjunction with their de-
 fense of rioting students on a television talk show. The public prosecutor appealed
 the decision, and the case was pending at year's end.
 Academic freedom is res   Cd.
 b. Freedom of Peacef As sembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly. Police permits were routinely issued for public demonstrations,
 and there were no reports that the permit requirement was abused.
 The Constitution provides for the right of association, which was generally re-
 apeted, except in cases involving ethnic minorities. In 1994 the Supreme Court
 upheld the 1991 decision of lower courts to deny registration to the -'Macedonian
 Cultural Center" in Florina, organized by Greeks who consider themselves of Slavic
 descent. The 1991 ruling held that "the true goal of the society *** is to affirm
 the idea of the existence of a 'Macedonian' minority in Greece, which contradicts
 (Greece's) national interests and the law." The organizers have appealed the deci-
 sion to the European Court of Human Rights, which declared the application admis-
 sible in June but had not delivered a judgment by year's end.
 
 
 961
 Government authorities legally recognize the existence of the Muslim minority but
 not any other minorities (see Section 5). The Government's position is contrary to
 the 1990 Copenhagen document of the then-Conference on Security and Cooperation
 in Europe (CSCE) to which the Government is a signatory, which asserts that "to
 belong to a national minority is a matter of a person's individual choice."
 -,-0 ,Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution establishes the Greek Orthodox Church,
 Kto which perhaps 95 to 97 percent of the population at least nominally adhere, as
 �the prevailing religion, but it prohibits discrimination against adherents of other re-
 "'igions. The Greek Orthodox Church wields significant influence through its rela-
 tionship with the Ministry of Education and Religion. Religious training is manda-
 tory in public schools for Greek Orthodox pupils. Non-Orthodox students are exempt
 from this requirement. However, some teachers suspended Jehovah's Witnesses for
 not parti'pating in school national day pra~d. The Constitution limits religious
 practice by prohibitingproslytizing; four Jehovah's Witnesses were prosecuted for
 poselytizng in 1996.More Jehovas Witnesses were harassed by authorities who
 arrested and held them for several hours at poie headquarters but subsequently
 released them without pressing charges. Several cases involving proselytism from
 previous years resulted in verdicts of acquittal in 1996; one such case was postponed
 until 1997. Several past convictions for prselytizing were pending before the Euro-
 penCourt of Human Rights at year's end.
 Traditionally, Jehovah a Witnesses ministers were not granted the exemption
 from military service accorded under the law to clergy of "known religions" and thus
 served prison sentences for refusing military service. Since 1990-91 the Council of
 State, the highest court dealing with civil and administrative matters whose opin-
 ions are bindig on the Government, has ruled that Jehovah's Witnesses were a
 "known religion and has ordered the release of ministers who had refused induc-
 tion. However, the recruiting service of the armed forces regarded these rulings as
 applying only to individual appellants, rather than as binding precedents for subse-
 quent Jehovah's Witnesses ministers who were called up. It thus continued to rely,
 in the first instance, on the opinion of the Ministry of Education and Religion, which
 in turn accepted the view of the Greek Orthodox Church that Jehovah's Witnesses
 are not a "known religion." As a consequence, for the past few years, ministers of
 Jehovah's Witnesses have been called up for military service and prosecuted for re-
 fusal to serve; only after conviction could they apeato the Council of State.
 To open and operate a non-Greek Orthodox ouse of worship requires approval
 by the Minitry of Education and Religion. The Ministry bases its decision on the
 advisory opinion of the local Orthodox bishop. In recent years, such permission has
 been granted to some groups only after long delays and withheld altogether from
 other denominations. Two Jehovah's Witnesses were charged in February with the
 ilegal use of a house of prayer in Komotini.
 In September the European Court of Human Rights ruled in favor of four Jeho-
 vah's Witnesses who had been found guilty by the Supreme Court in 1991 of ille-
 gally" operating a house of prayer. The Court found that the house of prayer author-
 ization procedure allowed the Government to limit the exercise of religious freedom
 by members of non-Orthodox religions and was therefore contrary to Article 9 of the
 European convention on human -ights. The Government nevertheless denied after
 the verdict that any restrictions were imposed.
 In May an appeals court considering the case of former Greek Orthodox priest
 Nikodomos Tsarknas overturned three of his previous convictions for "pretense of
 authority." Human rights monitors note that the language of the court's decision im-
 plied recognition of the Macedonian Orthodox Church.
 Mosques operate freely in Western Thrace and in the islands of Rhodes and Kos,
 where most Greek citizens of the Muslim faith reside. However, in December 17
 Muslims were arrested in Xanthi province for rebuilding a mosque without a proper
 permit. Their case had not been resolved by year's end.
 In accordance with a 1990 presidential decree, the State appointed two muftis (Is-
 lamic judges and religious leaders) and one assistant mufti in Greece, all resident
 in Thrace, based on the recommendations of a committee of local Muslim scholars,
 religious authorities, and community leaders. The Government argued that it must
 appoint muftis because, in addition to their religious duties, they perform judicial
 functions in many civil and domestic matters under Muslim religious law, for which
 the State pays them.
 The Muslim minority remains divided on the mufti selection issue. Some Muslims
 accept the authority of the two officially appointed muftis; other Muslims have cho-
 sen two other muftis to serve their communities. The Government prosecuted the
 two unofficial muftis again in 1996. Mehmet Amin Aga was sentenced in May to
 12 months in jail, and again in July to 20 months in prison for usurping the author-
 ity of the mufti; he appealed both sentences and was not incarcerated. Ibrahim
 
 
 962
 Sherif was sentenced in October to 6 months in jail on identical charges. He elected
 to pay a fine instead of serving the jail sentence.
 Some Muslims claimed that a 1980 law weakens the financial autonomy of the
 "wakfs" community associations which raise funds used for maintaining mosques
 and schools and for charitable works, by placing the Wakfs under the a istra-
 tion of appointed mufis and their representatives. Those who object to this system
 say that it violates the terms of theTrenty of Lausanne. A presidential decree is-
 sued in March put the Wakfs under the administration of a temporary committee
 as an interim measure toward resolving their outstanding problems.
 Leaders of various non-Greek orthodox religious groups assert that their members
 face discrimination in reaching the senior ranks in government servce. Furter-
 more, the historical record generally indicates that only those of the Greek Orthodox
 faith can become officers in the Greek mila. To avoid this restriction some mem-
 bers of other faiths resort to declaring themselves Orthodox. Senior government offi-
 cials, when questioned about such  egation of discrimination, deny that it exists
 and point out certain persons not of the Orthodox faith who have successful careers
 in the military. Although only two Muslim officers have been allowed to advance
 to the rank of reserve officer mn the military, insufficient statistical evidence is avail-
 able to support definitively either side.
 A 1991 law mandates that citizens declare their religion on European Union (EU)
 identity cards that--if and when issued--could be used instead of passports to trav-
 el freely within the EU. Current national identity cards, which   be replaced
 when the new EU cards are issued, include reference to the holder's religion, al-
 though individuals have the option of leaving that section blank. The law mandating
 the declaration of religion on the EU cards has caused particular concern among the
 Catholic and Jewish religious communities in Greece and abroad and has drawn
 strong criticism from the European Parliament. Despite such criticism and concern,
 the Government declined to either change the law mandating the declaration of reli-
 gion on the cards or to issue the new EU cards.
 d Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.r-The Constitution calls for freedom of movement within and outside the
 country and the right to return. However, Article 19 of the Citizenship Code distin-
 guishes between citizens who are ethnic Greeks and those who are not. Most Article
 19 cases involve Muslims from Western Thrace, since only the Muslim .minority"
 is recognized as having non-Greek ethaicity: Citizens who are not ethnic Greeks
 may be deprived of their citizenship if it is determined that they left Greece with
 no apparent intent to return. Determination of intent is made without input from
 the affected individual; in practice, this law is applied to members of the Muslim
 community considered to be "undesirable" by the security services. However, immi-
 grants who are ethnic Greeks are normally recognized as citizens and accorded fl
 rights, despite years or even generations of absence.
 The Interior Ministry initiates proceedings under Article 19 on the basis of i'e-
 ports by local authorities or by Greek embassies or onsulates abroad.vAffected per-
 sons are not notified of Article 19 hearings and are not permitted to attend. Those
 who lose citizenship as a result of such hearings sometimes learn of this loss only
 when they seek to reenter Greece. According to the Ministry of the Interior, 8 per-
 sons lost Greek citizenship under Article 19 in 1996 (compared with 72 in 1995).
 Of this number, the Government claims that 35 voluntarily relinquished their citi-
 zenship (omnpared with 45 in 1995).
 Persons who lose their ci ptin   u      icle 19 have the right of "administra-
 tive apdpl" to the Interior Minist  the can also appeal to the Council of State
 and to the Council of Europe. Lead     m f the Muslim community complained that
 the time and expense involved tended to discourage such appeals. In addition, some
 pisons who lose their citizenship under Article 19 d not discover that fact until
 apPeals deadlines have passed. Three persons who lost citizenship in 1994 have fied
 a-inistrative appeals which are pending.
 Another section of the Citizenship Code, Article 20, permits the Government to
 strip citizenship from those who "commit acts contrary to the interests of Greece fur
 theceneflt of a foreign state." While the law as written applies equally to all Greeks
 regardless of their ethnic background, to date it has been  forced only against citi-
 zens who identified themselves as members of the Macednian  minority. The tov-
 ernment would not reveal the number of Article 20 cases it pursued in 1996. Dual
 citizens who are stripped of Greek citizenship under Article 20 have been prevented
 from entein the country using the passport of their second nationality.
 Greece maintains restricted military zones along its borders, inclu g aong the
 northern border with Bulgaria, an area where many Pomaks live. Until 1995 entry
 into the zone was controlled by authorities even for local inhabitants, causing resi-
 dents to complain that their fredm of movement was restricted. The Government
 
 
 963
 announced in 1995 that the sole remaining checkpoint into the village of Exinos
 within the zone would be removed and that restrictions for entry into the zone
 would be lifted. Although the regulations concerning the zone remain formally in
 place, in practice they are no longer enforced for Greek citizens. Several foreign
 groups were, however, turned away from the zone in 1996.
 Ethnic Greek immigrants, including those who came from the former Soviet
 Union since 1986 and from the civil war in Georgia, normally qualify promptly for
 citizenship and special assistance from the Government. The returnees were settled
 initially in Western Thrace, where government programs encouraging them to re-
 main have met with limited success. Most move to Athens, Thessaloniki, or other
 cities, where job prospects are better.
 Greece frequently offers first asylum toa grwing number of refugees from Tur-
 key, a    and Iran. The Government provids      s ylum to an average of over
 100 persons per month. However, it reserves the right to refuse first asylum to ille-
 gal immigrants who do not apply within 48 hours. If they do not, their applications
 can be denied at their "admissibility interviews" when and if they are apprehended
 regardless of the potential merit of claims of persecution. �
 Permanent resettlement is not normally available for refugees who are not eth-
 nically Greek. Approximately 6,000 refugees were officially recognized between 1980
 and 1995, including 400 Vietnamese refugees accepted since 1979 for permanent re-
 settlee nt. Of the 858 individuals who submitted applications for refugee status in
 the first 9 months of 1996, 86 were approved. The remaining applications, many of
 which were submitted by ethnic Kurds from Turkey and Iraq, are under review by
 the Government in cooperation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 The Government continues to apprehend and return to Albania illegal Albanian
 immigrants. Greece and Albania signed a treaty of friendship in March, followed in
 May by a seasonal employment agreement designed to regularize the flow of Alba-
 nian workers to Greece. The Parliament has not yet passed the implementing legis-
 lation necessary for the agreement to take effect.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Greece is a multiparty democracy in which the Constitution provides for full polit-
 ical rights for all citizens and for the peaceful change of governments and of the
 Constitution. The Government headed by Prime Minister Constantine Simitis of the
 Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) won in free and fair elections in Septem-
 ber. Parliament elects a President for a 5-year term. Voting is mandatory for those
 over the age of 18, but there are many conditions that allow one not to vote and
 penalties are not applied in practice. Members of the unicameral 300-seat Par-
 liament are elected to maximum 4-year terms by secret ballot. Opposition parties
 function freely and have broad access to the media.
 Although there are no legal restrictions on the participation of women or minori-
 ties in government or politics, they are underrepresented at the higher levels of po-
 litical life. Women held 2 ministerial positions in the Government and only 1 of 29
 submiisterial positions. Of the 300 Members of Parliament, 17 were women.
 Women are also underrepresented in the leadership of the two largest parties. The
 head of the Communist Party is a woman.
 While the Government generally respects citizens' political rights, there are some-
 times charges that the Government limits the right of some individuals to speak
 publicly and associate freely on the basis of their self-proclaimed ethnic identity,
 thus impinging on the political rights of such persons. It also combined voting dis-
 tricts in Thrace, which had the consequence of making it difficult for Muslims to
 be elected to regional positions. However, candidates from the Muslim minority and
 members of the "Macedonian minority" ran in the national parliamentary elections.
 Three Muslim deputies were elected in Thrace, one each from PASOK, New Democ-
 racy, and the Coalition of the Left. Romani representatives report that local authori-
 ties sometimes deprive Roma of the right to vote by refusing to register them.
 In April the Government transferred responsibility for oversight of all rights guar-
 anteed to the Muslim minority under the Treaty of Lausanne, including education,
 zoning, administration of the "wakfs,* and trade, from the governors to the Regional
 Development Director of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace. Because the governors are
 elected, but the Development Director is appointed by the central government this
 reduced the ability of the minority to influence decisions that affect it throug the
 democratic process. The Government stated that it made the change because
 Greece's treaty obligations could be administered more effectively by the central au-
 thorities.

 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Government allows domestic human rights organizations to operate, but co-
 operation with them varies. In principle it does not prohibit fore i plomats from
 meeting with officials and other citizens, including critics of official policy. However,
 the security services on occaon n monitor contacts of Greek human rights groups,
 includig listening in on conversations held between those groups and human rights
 investigators and diplomats. The security services have also questioned monitors'
 interlocutors in the aftermath of meetings, reports of which have subsequently ap-
 peared in the press. Official government documents regarding the activities of
 uman rights monitors have also been reproduced in the press. Monitors view this
 activity as a form of intimidation which deters others from meeting with investiga-
 tors.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equality before the law and the full protection of
 individual life, honor, and freedom irrespective of nationality, race, language, or reli-
 gious or political belief. Government respect for these rights in practice is uneven.
 Violence against homosexuals is not common. However, police occasionally harass
 gay bar owners and gay men, including detaining them at police stations overnight
 and sometimes physically mistreating them.
 Women.-The incidence of violence against women reported to the authorities is
 low, but Athens' Equality Secretariat--which o~perates the only shelter for battered
 women-believes the actual incidence is "high.  According to the Ministry of Public
 Order 234 cases of rape were reported in 1995. No other statistics were available.
 The deneral Secretariat for Equaility of the Sexes (GSES), an independent govern-
 ment agency, asserts that police tend to discourage women from pursuing domestic
 violence charges and instead.undertake reconciliation efforts, although they are nei-
 ther qualified for nor charged with this task. The GSES also claims that the courts
 are lenient when dealing with domestic violence cases.
 As a result of pressure from women's groups, the Government established a center
 for battered women in Athens in 1988, and a residential facility for battered women
 and their children opened in 1993. These centers provide legal advice, psychological
 counseling, information on social services, and temporary residence for battered
 women and their children. Battered women can also go to state hospitals and re-
 gonal health centers, although these facilities are oten not adequately staffed to
 handle such cases properly.
 According to the police, trafficking in women for prostitution, mostly from the
 former Svi Yet Union, Albania, Bulgaria, and Romania, has increased sharply in re-
 cent years. Of the 118 foreign women arrested in Attica province (which includes
 Athens) du ring the first 9 months of the year for prostitution without a license, 60
 were from Albania, 19 were from Russia, and 25 were from elsewhere in the former
 Soviet Union. Police estimate that foreigners constitute 2,000 of the 5,000 pros-
 titutes in Greece. Although information on this subject is fragmentary, January
 press reports indicated that Greek and Cypriot police were cooperating to break up
 a prostitution ring specializing in Russian women.
 There are broad constitutional and legal protections for women, including equal
 pay for equal work. However, the GSES an~i the unions maintain that women re-
 ceive lower salaries overall than men because they are hired for lower-level jobs.
 The National Statistical Service's moat recent data (the fourth quarter of 1995) show
 that women's salaries in manufacturing were 71 percent of those of men in com-
 parable positions; in retail sales, women's salaries were 83 percent of those of men
 in comparable positions. These same groups claim that women face a "glass ceiling"
 when they are considered for promotions in bth the pubic and private sectors. A
 gSES report shows that although  women make up 42 percent of permanent civil
 servants, only 10.6 percent hold directors' positions. Women represent 60 percent of
 the unemployed and 69 percent of those affected by long-term unemployment. Al-
 though ther    e    still relatively few women in senior positions, in recent years
 women have entered traditionally male-dominated occupations such as the legal and
 medical professions in larger numbers.
 Children.-he Government is committed to providing adequate basic health and
 education services for children. Education is wompulsory through the ninth grade
 and free through university. However, some social groups, such as Roma and illegal
 Smants, are undrserved, according to child health specialists.
 Welfare legislation enacted in 1992 prohibits the mistreatment of children and
 provides penalties for violators. The State provides preventive and treatment pro-
 grams for abused children and for children deprived of their family environment; it
 
 
 965
 also seeks to ensure that alternative family care or institutional placement is made
 available to them.
 The Institute of Child Health, which receives referrals of children who have been
 abused, estimates that 4,000 children are abused each year. The Institute reports
 that its cases involve physical abuse (52.5 percent), neglectlmalnutrition (37 per-
 cent), burns (7 percent) and sexual abuse (3.5 percent) the latter including sexual
 exploitation, incest, and rape. According to a report submitted by the Government
 at the 1996 Stockholm International Congress on the Sexual Exploitation of Chil-
 dren, 238 cases of sexual exploitation of children and young people up to the age
 of 18 were reported in 1995.
 Children's rights advocacy groups claim that protection of high-risk children in
 state residential care centers is inadequate and of low quality. They cite lack of co-
 ordination between welfare services and the courts, inadequate funding of the wel-
 fare system, and poor staffing of residential care centers as systemic weaknesses in
 chld abuse prevention and treatment efforts. Societal abuse of children in the form
 of prstitution, pornography2 and child labor is rare.
 In recent years, the number of street children who panhandle or peddle at city
 intersections on behalf of adult family members or for criminal gangs has grown.
 May in the Athens area are ethnic Albanian. Polie occasionally round up these
 children and take them to state or charitable institutions that care for wayward
 children. Parents can reclaim their children but risk deportation if they are illegal
 immigrants.
 People With Disabilities.-Legislation mandates the hiring of disabled persons in
 public and private enterprises employing more than 50 persons. However, the law
 is reportedly pearly enforced, particularly in the private sector. The law states that
 disabled persons should number 3 percent of staff in private enterprises. In the civil
 service, 5 percent of administrative staff and 80 percent of telephone operator posi-
 tions are reserved for disabled persons. Persons with disabilities have been ap-
 pinted to important positions the civil service, including that of Secretary Generil
 of the Ministry of Welfare.
 The Construction Code mandates physical access for disabled persons to private
 and public buildings, but this law too is poorly enforced. Ramps and special curbs
 for the disabled have been constructed on some Athens streets and at some public
 buildings, and sound signals have been installed at some city street crossings. Since
 1993 the Government has been replacing old city buses with new ones with stairs
 specially designed for the disabled. Officials say that the new Athens subway lines
 under construction will provide full access for the disabled.
 Religious Minorities--Several..   religious denominations ..reported difficulties in
 dealing with the authorities on a variety of administrative matters. Privileges and
 legal prerogatives granted to the Greek Orthodox Church are not routinely extended
 to other recognized religions. Rather, the non-Greek Orthodox must make separate
 and lengthy applications to government authorities on such matters as arranging
 appointments to meet with Ministy of Education and Religion officials and gaining
 permission to move places of worship to larger quarters.
 According to Jehovah's Witnesses, teachers no longer face difficulties gaining or
 keeping employment in public and private schools, except in rare instances in rural
 areas. Jehovah's Witnesses are now treated as a "known religion" for the purpose
 of employment by the Ministry of Education, which hires public school teachers.
 Jehovah's Witness leaders have prtested the existence of a derogatory passage
 in the high-school level textbook used nationwide in religious instruction classes.
 The see nt criticizes minority religions as a threat to the nation.
 Leacoerof the Jewish community in Greece he dlobbied the government for sev-
 eral years to delete anti-Semitic references from public school textbooks. The Min-
 istry of Education and Religion agreed to delete all such references as new editions
 were published. The references have been deleted in the new editions that have
 since been released. The central board of Jewish communities in Greece expects the
 remaining references to be deleted in the cming years.
 The Government gave approval for construction of a memorial for the 48,000 vic-
 tims of the Holocaust in Thessaloniki. The city of Thessaloniki will open a Jewish
 folk and history museum, and a privately funded holocaust museum will open in
 early 1997.
 eadetioalRacialEthnic Minoriti.-There are communities in Greece that iden-
 tify themselves as Turks, Pomaks, Vachs, Roma, Arvanites (ethnic Albanians), and
 "Macedonians or Slavomacedonians." Many are fully integrated into Greek society.
 The only minority the Government formally recognizes is the "Muslim minority" re-
 ferred to in the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. The Government insists on the use of that
 rubric to refer to several different ethnic communities. A substantial part of the
 Muslim minority is ethnically Turkish or consists of Turkish-speakers tn Western
 
 
 Thrace; the Government estimates their number at some 120,000 persons. In addi-
 tion to people of Turkish origin, the Muslim minority includes Pomaks and Roma.
 Many Greek Muslims, including Pomak   identify themselves s Turks and say that
 the Muslim minority as a whole has a Turkish cultural consciousness. The use of
 the word "tourkos" ("Turk") is prohibited in titles of organizations, though individ-
 uals may legally call themselves "tourkos." To most Greeks, the word "tourkos" con-
 notes Trih identity or loyalties, and many object to its use by citizens of Turkish
 origin. Use of a similar adjective, "tourkoyennis (of Turkish descent, affiliation, or
 ethnicity) however, is allowed.
 Northern Greece is home to an indeterminate number (estimates range widely,
 from under 10,000 to 50,000 or more) of citizens who are descended from Slavs or
 Slavophones. Some still speak a Slavic dialect, particularly in the Florina district.
 A small number of them consider themselves to be members of a distinct ethnic
 group which they identify as 'Macedonian" (self-described "Macedonians" are here-
 after referred to Macedonian") and assert their right to minority status. The Gov-
 ernment harasses and intimidates some of these people, including denying their
 right of association (see Section 2.b.), mnitoring activists' meetings with human
 rights investigators (see Section 2.d.), and accusing activists publicly of being agents
 oa foreign government. As a result, some Greeks who consider themselves "Mac-
 edonian"   no     lare themselves openly for fear of losing their jobs or other sanc-
 tions. The Government's sensitivity on this issue stems from its belief that people
 who claim to be members of a "Macednian" minority may have separatist aspira-
 tions. Greece's dispute with the Former Yugoslv Republic of Macedonia over that
 country's name heightened this sensitivity.
 Government officials and courts deny requests by individuals and groups to iden-
 tify themselves using the ancient term 'Macedonian," because some 2.2 milon eth-
 nic (and lingistically) Greek citizens in the northern Greek region of Macedonia al-
 ready use te term to identify themselves. The Government does not define the
 Slavic dialect spken by some thousands of northern Greeks as "Macedonian,' and
 rnment officias deny that it is a separate language at all. The officials also note
 tjat Greece regulates the estabishment of all ommercial language academies and
 question whether advocates of "Macedonian" language schools meet the relevant re-
 qurments. They say that the Government would not interfere with the holding of
 informal language classes within the Slavophone community. When a political party
 hung a biigulGrek and Slavic name sign outside its offic, the publi prosecutor
 in Forina ordered that it be removed (see Seion 2.a.). Criminal charges were filed
 aginst an official of the same party under a law banning "inciting rivalry and divi-
 smon" when he attempted to import two wall calendars identifyng Greek cities by
 their Slavic names (see Section 2.a.).
 The Secretariat for Adult Education (a government agency) estimates the number
 of Roma at some 300,000. Almest half oft te Rmani population is permanently set-
 tled, mainly in the Athens are. The other half is mobile, working mainly as agricul-
 tural laborers, pedders, and musicians throughout the country. Government policy
 is to encourage the integration of Rms. Poverty, illiteracy, and social re dice con-
 tinue to plague large parts of the Romani population. The Secretariat 1or AdultEdu-
 cation conducts education and training programs targeting the Romani population,
 including the use of mbile schools. Te illiteracy rate among Rma is estimated at
 80 percent. Some 1,00 Rmani children attended the mobile school program during
 the last school year.
 The usage of public health facilities by Roma is low because of the low rate of
 integration of Romani communities into Greek society and social security systems
 Ninety prcnt of Rma are not insured by any of the government social security
 systems because they are self-employed or work in off-the-boks jobs that d not
 make contributions to the social security system. The fact that health facilities are
 not located close to te Rma camps als contributes to their low rate of access.
 In July the Government announced new projects, subsidized by EU social funds,
 to improve Rmani living conditions. The projects include the establishment of orga-
 nized camps, subsidies or the purchase of mobile homes, and the creation of mbile
 medical units. None of the projects was implemented by year's end.
 The Treaty of Lausane provides that the Muslim minority has the right to Turk-
 ish-language education, with a reciprocal entitlement for the Greek minority in Is-
 tanbul (now reduced to about 3,000). Western Thrace has both Koranic and secular
 Turkish-language schools. Government disputes with Turkey over teachers and text-
 books cause these secular schools serious problems in obtaining faculty and teach-
 ing materials in sufficient number and quality. Under a 1952 educational protocol,
 Greece and Turkey may annually exchange 35 teachers on a reciprocal basis. The
 teachers serve in Istanbul and Western Thrace, respectively, but in recentyears the
 Greek side limited the exchanges to 16 teachers per country due to the dwindling
 
 
 needs of the small and aging Greek population Turkey. In Greece over 9,000 Muslim
 children attended Turkish-language primary schools. Around 650 attended Turkish-
 language secondary schools, and approximately 1,000 attended Greek-language sec-
 ondary schools. Many Muslims reportedly went to high school in Turkey due to the
 limited number of places in the Turkish-language secondary schools, which are as-
 signed by Iottery
 I  1995 the Government enacted several measures designed to improve the edu-
 cational situation of Muslims in Thrace. A new education law provides incentives
 for Muslim and Christian educators to reside and teach in isolated villages. The new
 law also permits the Minister of Education to give special consideration to Muslims
 for admission to universities and technical institutes. Under this law, faculties of
 each university and technical institute nationwide created at least one position for
 Muslim students, a total of some 250 places. All Muslim students who applied were
 admitted to these institutes of higher learning, and about 70 attended.
 The rate of employment of Muslims in the public sector and in state-owned indus-
 tries and corporations is much lower than the Muslim percentage of the population.
 In Xanthi and Komotini, while Muslims hold seats on the prefectural and town
 councils, there are no Muslims among the regular employees of the prefecture. Mus-
 lims in Thrace claim that they are hired only for lower level, part-time work. The
 Government says lack of fluency in written and spoken Greek and the need for uni-
 versity degrees for high-level positions limit the number of Muslims eligible for gov-
 ernment jobs. Muslims have not received any of the government subsidies offered
 to corporations establishing or expanding their business operations in Thrace. Ac-
 cording to government sources, however, no Muslims applied for these subsidies.
 Public offices in Thrace do their business in Greek; the courts provide interpreters
 as needed. In the Komotini district in Thrace, where many ethnic Turks live, the
 office of the district governor ("nomarch7) has Turkish-language interpreters avail-
 able.
 Claims of discriminatory denial of Musli  applications for a license to operate
 businesses, own a tractor, or construct property have diminished greatly in recent
 years. One Muslim's application for membership in the Komotini chamber of com-
 merce, which is necessary to obtain import licenses and other privileges, was re-
 fused because his business partner was Turkish. Basic public services provided to
 Muslim-populated neighborhoods and villages (electricity, telephones, paved roads)
 in many cases continue to lag far behind those provided in non-Muslim areas.
 In August rightg orthodox Christian extremists vandalized around 40 Muslim-
 owned businesses and institutions in Komotini, including the Muslim youth organi-
 zation and the mosque that was the headquarters of the mufti. Four Muslims were
 hospitalized following the attacks. Police made five arrests in connection with the
 incident.
 In 1995 the Defense Minister reported that members of the Muslim minority
 would for the first time be allowed to advance to the rank of reserve officers in the
 military. To date, two Muslims have done so. Members of the Muslim minority in
 the Dodecanese islands of Rhodes and Kos are much more integrated into local soci-
 ety.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution and subsequent legislation provide
 for the right of association. All workers, with the exception of the military, have the
 right to     or oin unions. Police have the right to form unions but not to strike.
 Approximately 30 percent of workers (nearly 1 million persons) were organized in
 umions. Unions receive most of their funding from a Ministry of Labor organization,
 the Workers' Hearth, which distributes mandatory contributions from employees
 and employers. Workers, employers, and the state are represented in equal numbers
 on the board of directors of the Workers' Hearth. Only the five most powerful public
 sector unions have dues-withholding provisions in their contracts, in addition to re-
 eiving Workers' Hearth subsidies.
 Over 4,000 unions are grouped into regional and sectoral federations and two um-
 brela confederations, one for civil servants and one, the General Confederation of
 Greek workers (GSEE), for private sector employees. Unions are highly politicized,
 and there are party-affliated factions within the labor confederations, but day-to-
 day operations are not controlled by political parties or the Government. There are
 no restrictions on who may serve as a union official. Legal restrictions on strikes
 include a mandatory period of notice, which is 4 days or public utilities and 24
 hours for the private sector. Legislation mandates a skeleton staff during strikes af-
 fecting public services, such as electricity, transportation, communications, and
 banking. Public utility companies, state-owned banks, the postal service, Olympic
 
 
 968
 Airways, and the railroads are also required to maintain a skeleton staff during
 strikes.
 The courts have the power to declare strikes illegal, although such decisions are
 seldom enforced. Unions complain, however, that this judicial power serves as a de-
 terrent to some of their membership from participating in strikes. In 1996 the
 courts declared a majority of strikes illegal for reasons such as failure of the union
 to give adequate advance notice of the strike, or the addition of demands by the
 union during the course of the strike. No striking workers were prosecuted, how-
 ever.
 Unions are free to join international associations and maintain a variety of inter-
 national affiliations.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectivey.-Legislation provides for the
 right to organize and bargain collectively in the private sector and in public corpora-
 tions. These rights are respected in practice. There are no restrictions on collective
 bargaining for private sector employees. The union of civil servants negotiates with
 the Office of the Minister to the Prime Minister.
 In response to union complaints that most labor disputes ended in compulsory ar-
 bitration, legislative remedies were enacted providing for mediation procedures,
 with compulsory arbitration as a last resort. The legislation establishing a national
 mediation, reconciliation, and arbitration organization went into effect in 1992 and
 applies to the private sector and public corporations (the military and civil service
 excluded).
 Antiunion discrimination is prohibited. The Labor Inspectorate or a court inves-
 tigates complaints of discrimination against union members or organizers. Court
 ruling have mandated the reinstatement of           fipyred union organizers.
 There are three free trade zones, operated accoriding to EU regulations. The labor
 laws apply equally in these zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-aThe Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and the Ministry of Justice enforces this prohibition. However,
 the Government may declare the "civil mobilization" of workers in the event of dan-
 gerto national security, life, property, or the social and economic life of the country.
 The International Labor Organization (ILO) Committee of Experts has criticized
 thispower as violating the standards of ILO Convention 29 on forced labor.
 d. MinimumAe for Employment of Children.-The minimum age for employment
 in the industri  sector is 15 years, with higher limits for certain activities. The
 minimum age is 12 years in family businesses, theaters, and the cinema. These age
 limits are enforced by occasional Labor Inspectorate spot checks and are generally
 respected. However, families engaged in agriculture, food service, and merchandis-
 ing often have younger family members assisting them, at least part time.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.--Collective bargaining between the GSEE and
 the Employers' Association determines a nationwide minimum wage. The Ministry
 of Labor routinely ratifies this minimum wage, which has the force of law and ap-
 plies to all workers. The current minimum wage of $24 (Dr 5,746) daily and $533
 (Dr 128,329) monthly, effective July 1, is sufficient for a decent standard of living
 for a worker and family. The maximum legal workweek is 40 hours in the private
 sector and 37% hours in the public sector. The law provides for at least one 24-
 hour rest period per week, mandates paid vacation of 1 month per year, and sets
 limits on overtime.
 Legislation provides for minimum standards of occupational health and safety. Al-
 though the GSEE characterized health and safety legislation as satisfactory, it
 charged that enforcement, the responsibility of the Labor Inspectorate, was inad-
 equate. In its most recent review of this issue in 1992, the USEE cited statistics
 indicating a high number of job-related accidents over the past two decades. Inad-
 equate inspection, failure to enforce regulationswoudated industrial plant and
 equipment, and poor safety training of emplcontributing to the
 aident rate. Workers do not have the legal right to remove themselves from situa-
 tions they believe endanger their health. They d have the right, however, to lodge
 a confidential complaint with the Labor Inspectorate. Inspectors have the right to
 close down machinery or a process for a period of up to 5 days if they see safety
 or health hazards that they believe represent an imminent danger to the workers.
