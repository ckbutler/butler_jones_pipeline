 CANADA
 Canada is a constitutional monarchy with a federal parliamentary
 form of government. Representatives in the multiparty political
 system are elected by universal suffrage at local, provincial,
 and federal levels. The national Constitution defines
 government responsibilities and is subject to interpretation by
 an independent judiciary.
 Elected civilian officials control the federal, provincial, and
 municipal police forces, which are responsible for national and
 local law enforcement and the armed forces, which have no role
 in domestic law enforcement except in strictly defined national
 emergencies.
 Canada has an open economic system that encourages private
 ownership, investment, and entrepreneurship.
 Canadians enjoy, in law and in practice, a wide range of
 freedoms and individual rights as enumerated in the Charter of
 Rights and Freedoms, added to Canada's revised Constitution in-
 1982. Principal complaints of human rights abuses arise in the
 area of discrimination against ethnic minorities (including
 actions by police) and discrimination (much of it familial)
 against women. The Constitution and laws provide avenues for
 legal redress of such abuses, and the Government and private
 organizations try to ensure that human rights are respected in
 practice at all levels of society. Canada actively promotes
 respect for human rights around the world.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no politically motivated killings. However,
 Canadian authorities and the general public are concerned about
 the potential for terrorist activity by resident ethnic groups
 with active ties to troubled homelands. On May 1Q. a Sikh-
 Canadian was found guilty on charges related to the explosion
 on June 23, 1985, that killed two baggage handlers at Tokyo's
 Narita Airport.
 b; Disappearance
 Secret arrest, clandestine detention, and politically motivated
 disappearances did not occur.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 These abuses are~prohibited by law, and none was reported.
 d.. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Canadian law prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment, and
 this prohibition is respected-in practice. A 1988 law
 authorizes the Federal Government to take. special measures to
 ensure safety and security during national emergencies,
 including the suspension of civil liberties. The 1939 Official
 Secrets Act prohibits the private possession, distribution, and
 publication of information deemed prejudicial to the interests
 of the State and provides that persons under suspicion may be
 arrested without a warrant.

 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The judicial system is based on English common law at the
 federal level and in most provinces. In the Province of
 Quebec, the judicial system is based on the Napoleonic Code.
 Judges in Canada'are appointed. In criminal trials, Canadian
 law provides for a presumption of innocence of the defendant
 until proven guilty, as well as the right to a public trial and
 to counsel. Free counsel is provided to indigents.
 The Official Secrets Act provides that trials involving
 classified government information be held in secret, with
 certain presumptions in favor of the State. Prosecutions under
 this statute are extremely rare, and convictions are hard to
 sustain on appeal. There are no political prisoners in Canada.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Federal and provincial governments do not interfere with a
 person's basic rights. Intrusive searches may only be carried
 out when there is a reasonable basis for presuming that the
 person is involved in criminal activity. Police officials face
 judicial penalties if they abuse a person's privacy without
 first obtaining a search warrant.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press is provided for by the Constitution
 and respected in practice. Laws prohibiting certain forms of
 hate literature and pornography, restrictive decisions by
 provincial film censorship boards, and legislation that
 specifically protects language and cultural rights are the sole
 exceptions to these freedoms. The Canadian Human Rights Act
 makes it illegal to make repeated communications by telephone
 that expose a person or people to hatred or contempt.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly and association is guaranteed. Permits are
 not required for meetings.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is complete freedom of religion.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on movement within or outside Canada,
 including the rights of emigration and repatriation. Canada
 continues to be a haven for many refugees and displaced
 persons. Widespread concern that many economic migrants have
 taken advantage of Canada's generous attitude toward true
 refugees and made spurious requests for asylum led to the
 passage of a new refugee law, which went into effect in January
 1989 and has not resulted in a reduction in asylum applications.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Canada is governed by federal and-provincial governments that
 are freely elected by the Canadian people through universal
 
 
 1075
 CANADA
 suffrage. Legislative elections at both the federal and
 provincial levels must be held at least every 5 years and often
 result in a transfer of power to opposition parties. Voter
 ,participation rates are high. The Governor General is the
 British Queen's representative as Head of State. In practice,
 power is exercised by the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, who
 usually are elected members of the 295-seat House of Commons.
 Three main parties are represented in the Commons, and several
 others function at the provincial level. All provinces and
 territories have similar freely elected legislatures.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations.
 of Human Rights
 A wide variety of private human rights organizations operate
 freely. The Canadian Human Rightd Commission and its
 provincial counterparts investigate and resolve complaints of
 discrimination in public and private cases.
 Canadian natives have brought allegations of human rights
 abuses related to a 1990 standoff between Mohawk Indians and
 the Government near Montreal, as well as other longstanding
 grievances, including land claims, to the attention of the
 United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) and various
 international human rights organizations. The Canadian
 Government submitted information to the UNHRC on the cases and
 permitted a Europe-based human rights organization to monitor
 the situation involving the Mohawks.
 Canada actively promotes human rights in international forums,
 and the Federal Government encourages nongovernmental
 organizations to pursue investigations of human rights abuses
 throughout the world.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Food, shelter, health care, and education are available to all
 inhabitants without discrimination. 'Article 15 of the Charter
 of Rights and Freedoms guarantees equal benefits and protection
 of the law regardless of race, national or ethnic origin,
 color, religion, sex, age, or mental or physical disability.
 These rights are respected in practice.
 Nevertheless, Canada's multicultural society does have racial
 problems. Canada's treatment of its native peoples is probably
 the most important human rights problem facing the country.
 Age-old disputes between the Federal and Provincial Governments
 and Aboriginals have led to civil disobedience and
 confrontation. Native (Indian) protests during the summer of
 1990 led to enmity between Indians and their nonnative
 neighbors south of Montreal. Natives, religious groups, and
 human rights activists alleged human rights abuses during the
 78-day armed standoff between Mohawks and the Government at
 Oka, Quebec. In January 1991, tension between police and
 natives again erupted at a police checkpoint near Montreal.
 There was also a confrontation between whites and Mohawks near
 the Kanawake reserve on April 4.
 The Federal Government in 1991 began to address many of the
 issues underlying aboriginal complaints. On September 24, as
 part of a constitutional reform package, the Government
 proposed a guaranteed, court-enforceable right to self-
 government. Under the proposal, the definition of self-
 
 
 1076
 CANADA
 government would be negotiated between the Provincial
 Governments and the native peoples over a maximum of 10 years,
 after which the court system would define self-government where
 agreements could not be reached. The Government also proposed
 aboriginal representation in a reformed Federal Senate. A poll
 taken after the proposals were announced indicated that
 Canadians strongly support an aboriginal right to self-
 government. It is likely that some form of aboriginal self-
 government will be part of the final constitutional package.
 On August 27, the Federal Government established the Royal
 Commission on Aboriginal Affairs. The Commission, in which
 Aboriginals have majority representation, has a broad mandate
 to examine aboriginal concerns including self-government, land
 claims, and native justice. The work of the Commission will
 likely play an important role in future constitutional
 negotiations.
 On August 6, Ontario became the first province to acknowledge
 that aboriginal peoples have an inherent right to be self-
 governing. The accord will be used as a basis in resolving
 land claims and in devolving some provincial powers to native
 groups.
 Tensions also continued between the black and white communities
 in Halifax, Nova Scotia. On July 18, two blacks were allegedly
 beaten by a group of whites. In retaliation, approximately 150
 blacks rioted and assaulted 15 whites on July 19 and 20.
 Discrimination toward blacks in Halifax bars is thought to be
 the root cause of the incidents.
 Women's groups have been effective in bringing the issue of
 family violence to the fore. Various reports have documented
 the incidence of physical, psychological, and emotional abuse
 within families. Federal and Provincial Governments have
 attempted to address the issue of family violence.
 Women are well represented in the labor force, including
 business and the professions, at wages comparable to those of
 men, according to an official from the Canadian Advisory Council
 on the Status of Women. Ontario law requires all employers
 (public and private) with more than 10 workers to provide equal
 pay to men and women for work of comparable skill. Women enjoy
 marriage and property rights equal to men.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association
 Workers in both the public and private sectors have the right
 to associate freely and to strike. The Labor Code, which
 covers all employees under federal jurisdiction, protects these
 rights at the federal level, while provincial labor legislation
 protects all other organized workers. About 36 percent of
 Canada's nonagricultural work force is organized into trade
 unions. Worker rights that are protected in law are respected
 in practice. Trade unions are independent of the Government
 and may freely affiliate with international organizations.
 Slightly more than one-third of the Member unions of the
 Canadian Labor Congress are also branches of American
 Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Crganizations
 unions.
 In practice, certain groups of essential public sector
 employees are not allowed to strike. Restrictions vary from
 
 
 1077
 
 province to province. In the federal public sector strike that
 began on September 9, approximately 46,000 of the 155,000
 eligible members of the Public Service Alliance of Canada were
 designated essential. These included: border crossing guards,
 airport workers, prison guards, administrators who process
 government income security checks, and meat inspectors. The
 strike was ultimately ended by legislation extending the
 contract for'an additional 2 years, thus removing the
 employees' right to strike.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Workers in both the public and private sectors have the right
 to organize and bargain collectively. Collective bargaining is
 protected by law and freely practiced, though some essential
 public sector employees have limited collective bargaining
 rights which vary from province to province. Antiunion
 discrimination is banned by law, and there are effective
 mechanisms for resolving complaints.
 All labor unions have full access to mediation, arbitration,
 and the judicial system. Canada has no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Forced labor is illegal and not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 Child labor legislation differs from province to province. The
 Federal Government generally prohibits those under 17 years of
 age from working for the Federal Government while school is in
 session. Provinces generally prohibit those under age 15 or 16
 from working without parental consent, working in any hazardous
 employment, or working at night.. These prohibitions are
 effectively enforced through inspections conducted by the
 Federal and Provincial Labor Ministries.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 Minimum wages are established in both federal and provincial
 jurisdictions. The federal minimum wage covers about 10
 percent of the Canadian work force. Five provinces (Prince
 Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Alberta, and British
 Columbia) have lower minimum rates for youths and students.
 Collectively, only 1 percent of workers governed by the federal
 minimum wage are paid at the minimum rate. Eight percent of
 all workers are paid at the respective minimum wage coverinig
 their class of employment. A family with only one member
 employed and working at minimum wages would fall below the
 poverty level. All provinces have established minimum wages
 higher than the federal minimum. Labor standards vary from
 province to province, but all limit the standard workweek to 40
 or 48 hours.
 The Federal Government establishes health and safety standards
 for the approximately 10 percent of workers covered by federal
 labor legislation. Provincial legislation provides for health
 and safety standards for other workers. Federal and regional
 authorities enforce these standards through inspections.
