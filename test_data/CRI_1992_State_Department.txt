 COSTA RICA
 Costa Rica is a well-established, stable democracy with separate executive, legisla-
 tive, and judicial branches. A Supreme Electoral Tribunal is considered a fourth
 branch of Government. Elections for President, two Vice Presidents and 57 Deputies
 to a unicameral Legislative Assembly are held every 4 years; they have been free
 and fair. Rafael Angel Calderon won the February 1990 presidential election, in
 which approximately 80 percent of eligible voters participated. The President is con-
 stitutionally barred from reelection for life. Members of the Legislative Assembly
 ma be reelected but only after at least one term out of office.
 The 1949 Constitution abolished Costa Rica's army. Several government min-
 istries share responsibilities for law enforcement and national security: the Ministry
 of Public Security includes the Civil Guard, the Crime Prevention Unit, and the
 Antidrug Police; the Ministry of Government includes the Rural Guard and the Di-
 rectorate of Narcotics and Intelligence; and the Ministry of the Presidency has the
 Directorate of Intelligence and Security. The Judicial Police under the Supreme
 Court is an investigative force, while the San Jose Metropolitan Police and the
 Transit Police within the Ministry of Public Works and Transportation also have
 limited police functions. Public security forces generally observe procedural safe-
 gards established by law and the Constitution, but there have been occasional inci-
 dents of the use of excessive force by the police.
 Export-oriented businesses, both in agriculture and light industry, lead the Costa
 Rican economy. Steady economic growth of recent years slowed in 1991 to around
 1.5 percent, but improved modestly in 1992 (projections were for over 2 percent).

 The right to own private property is protected by the Constitution however, foreign
 and Costa Rican property owners who have had land expropriate for nature or In-
 dian reserves have experienced considerable delay and difficulty receiving com-
 pensation. Squatter invasions of private property sometimes occur, especially in the
 southern border area, and sometimes turn violent.
 Costa Ricans enjoy a wide range of individual rights and freedoms. Complaints
 of human rights abuse, when they arise, tend to cite delays in the judicialprocess
 (many prisoners are subjected to excessive periods of pretrial custody) or de facto
 discrimination against blacks, Indians, and women. The police, particularly the
 Rural Guard, have sometimes used excessive force. There were credible charges that
 in February, a 13-man rural guard unit tortured and killed two suspected drug-traf-
 fickers (see Section 1.c.). Overall Costa Rica has an excellent human rights record.
 Reflecting a society-wide consensus, the Government is committed to extending ef-
 fective basic protections and privileges to all Costa Ricans.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Exb-ajudicial Killing.-The Government does not practice,
 abet, or condone political killing, and none was reported.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no known or reported incidents of politically moti-
 vated abductions or secret arrests.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution prohibits cruel or degrading treatment and holds invalid any state-
 ment obtained through violence. These prohibitions are generally respected in prac-
 tice, but incidents of police mistreatment are sometimes reported. The most serious
 credible charges arose in February when residents of the Talamanca region testified
 that members of a 13-man counternarcotics rural guard unit beat and shot two sus-
 pected drug traffickers. These Rural Guards, known as the "Cobra Command,' were
 also accused of mistreating local residents, forcing some to serve as supply-bearers,
 and assaulting two women. The entire squad was taken into custody when the Judi-
 cial Police began an immediate investigation. All but the two commanding officers
 (charged with committing the murders) were subsequently released. As of the end
 of 1992, the investigation continued.
 While an ongoing debate over the suitability and adequacy of the current law en-
 forcement system received considerable attention, efforts to professionalize the var-
 ious police agencies and standardize training have had little success. A bill to grant
 career status to the police and set minimum entry requirements was pending in the
 Legislative Assembly for more than a year and a halt.
 Prisoners generally receive humane treatment in Costa Rica. While physical
 abuse by prison guards is uncommon, a limited number of guards have been impli-
 cated in swindles, robberies, and drug trafficking. Prisoners may bring complaints
 before the special defense counsel for prison inmates, which will investigate them.
 Especially serious cases are handled by the Office of the Chief Prosecutor. Public
 concern about crowded penitentiaries and the availability of weapons in prisons is
 growing. Occasional rioting is a problem in several large prisons. The Government
 continues to earmark funds to repair or improve the more rundown facilities, and
 carried out several projects in 1992.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Judicial warrants are required for ar-
 rests and an arraignment before an officer of the court must take place within 24
 hours of arrest. Article 48 of the Constitution entitles detained persons to a judicial
 determination of the legality of the detention. These rights are generally respected,
 although persons charged with serious offenses often remain in pretrial custody for
 long periods due to judicial backlog. The past year brought some improvement in
 this regard. The number of prisoners awaiting trial stood at 776 at the end of Au-
 gust 1991; by the end of June 1992, it had dropped to 688.
 The right to bail is provided for in law and observed in practice. Bail is sometimes
 denied to repeat offenders, however, and is usually denied to foreigners and major
 drug offenders on the assumption they would leave the country before coming to
 trial. Generally, detainees are not held incommunicado. With judicial authorization,
 however, suspects may be held for 48 hours after arrest or, under special cir-
 cumstances, for up to 10 days. The judiciary has proven effective at ensuring that
 legal and constitutional safeguards are observed.
 The Constitution bars exile as punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The judiciary is independent and assures a fair
 public trial.
 The Supreme Court supervises the work of the lower courts, known as tribunals.
 Its 24 magistrates are elected by the Legislative Assembly to 8-year terms. Accused
 
 
 368
 persons may select an attorney of their choice. Access to legal counsel is guaranteed
 and honored in practice. The State provides counsel to those who cannot afford to
 hire their own.
 There are no political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-There
 were no reported instances during 1992 of extralegal invasions of privacy conducted
 by, or with the knowledge of, the Government. Judicial warrants are required to
 search private homes and police seldom fail to comply.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution specifically provides for free-
 doma of speech and press, and these freedoms are respected in practice. Nine major
 private newspapers, several periodicals, 6 private television stations and over 70
 private radio stations pursue independent editorial policies. The media freely criti-
 cize the Government, and there is no evidence of self-censorship or governmental
 intimidation.
 A 1969 law requires journalists to be accredited by the government-sponsored
 Journalists' Guild. After the Supreme     Court upheld the conviction     of a
 nonaccredited U.S. journalist in 1983, a 1985 advisory opinion by the Inter-Amer-
 ican Court of Human Rights declared the law incompatible with the Inter-American
 Human Rights Convention. The Arias Government (1986-1990) publicly supported
 the 1969 law, though, and there were two additional convictions in 1989, resulting
 in suspended prison sentences and fres. The current Calderon administration pub-
 licly supported the licensing requirement on the grounds that it ensures profes-
 sionalism.
 An Office of Censorship rates films and has the authority to restrict or prohibit
 their showing, it has similar powers over television shows and plays. A Censorship
 Tribunal reviews appeals of the Office's actions. In 1989 the Censor's office banned
 the film "The Last Temptation of Christ," drawing charges of violating freedom of
 expression. An association of law students brought the case to the Attorney Gen-
 eral's Ombudsman for Human Rights, which overturned the ban in November 1989.
 The acting Attorney General rescinded that decision in January 1990, and, as of the
 end of 1992, the case was still pending before the Constitutional Chamber of the
 Supreme Court.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Constitutional provisions for
 freedom of assembly and association are fully respected. Permits required for pa-
 rades or similar large-scale gatherings are granted routinely; they are not required
 for other public meetings.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Freedom of religion is protected by the Constitution and
 generally observed in practice. Roman Catholicism, however, is the official state reli-
 gion. Foreign missionaries and clergy of all denominations work and proselytize
 freely. Coesta Ricans affiliated with non-Catholic groups note, though, that non-
 Catholic churches are required, by law, to comply with building codes from which
 Catholic churches are exempt. These groups seek remedial legislation. The current
 law on career educators stipulates that all teachers of religion, including non-Catho-
 lic teachers, must be approved by the Catholic Church's episcopal conference. In
 July 1991, a number of teachers of religion (most of them Catholic) filed suit before
 the Supreme Court asking that the law be overturned. As of the end of 1992, their
 plea was still pending.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Though there are no restrictions on travel within the country, all citi-
 zens and residents are required to obtain an exit visa before traveling abroad. Emi-
 gration and right of return are not restricted, however. Costa Rica suports multi-
 national refugee programs and has accepted many refugees from Central and South
 America. The Constitution specifically prohibits repatriation of anyone subject topo-
 litical persecution. Political asylum traditionally has been granted to exiled dis-
 sidents of various political orientations.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Right&- The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Costa Ricans choose their government through free, open, and competitive elec-
 tions (by secret ballot) every 4 years. The integrity of elections is ensured by the
 independent Supreme Electoral Tribunal, and election results are respected. The
 Legislative Assembly can and does reject executive branch initiatives. Citizens can
 and do petition their elected representatives for legislative redress and assistance
 with government bureaucracies. The ruling Social Christian Unity Party and the op-
 position National Liberation Party control 29 and 25 seats, respectively, in the 5-
 
 
 369
 member legislative assembly. A leftist coalition party holds one seat, and two inde-
 pendent provincial parties each hold one seat.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 A 1984 executive order created the office of Ombudsman for Human Rights, now
 housed in the Ministry of Justice. The Ombudsman's office hears complaints from
 individuals about human rights abuses. As noted above, a similar offle considers
 complaints within the penitentiary system. Three nongovernmental groups monitor
 and report on human rights in Costa Rica: the Costa Rican Commission for Human
 Rights, the Commission for the Defense of Human Rights in Central America, and
 the Family and Friends of Political Prisoners of Costa Rica. There are also several
 private groups dedicated to assisting refugees.
 Costa Rica has traditionally been a strong supporter of international and private
 human rights organizations. Both the Inter-American Institute of Human Rights
 and the Inter-Anerican Court of Human Rights maintain their headquarters in San
 Jose. The Government has invited the Inter-American Human Rights Commission
 to visit the country whenever it wishes.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Rel4gion, Language, or Social Status
 Costa Rica's population includes some 24,000 indigenous people. Most live in tra-
 ditional communities on 21 reserves which, in part because of their remote location,
 often lack access to schools, health care electricity, and potable water. Although
 hampered by budgetary restraints, the Government is attempting to improve the
 quality of basic services in the indignou areas. Indigenous people participate in
 the management of their own affairs through the National Indian Commission
 (CONAD, and indigenous leaders .ntinue to urge the Government to devote more
 resources to helpig tei communtes. Unti quite recsntly about 20 percent of in-
 digenous people were undocumented and so lacked p roof of citizenship. That prob-
 lem has been all but eliminated by legislation that helped nearly 7,000 indillenous
 people obtain identification papers, alowing them to ve and making it easier for
 them to obtain credit.
 The role of women, although still primarily domestic, is legally unrestricted. Ac-
 cording to the latest census bureau statistics, 30 percent of working-age women earn
 wages, as opposed to 79 percent of working-age men. The number offemale profes-
 sionals and technical workers (while still low in comparison with men) is growing.
 Women and men are generally paid equally for equal work. In 1990 the Legislative
 Assembly passed significant legislation designed to supplement existing laws
 against sex discrimination. The new law reinforces women's proper its, forbids
 employers from firing a woman for becoming pregnant or adopting children, and re-
 aflTrms the necessity for institutional safeguards to prevent an punish violence
 against women. Two relatively new government agencies the Justice Ministry's
 omens Defense Counsel and the Government Ministry's Women's Delegation, act
 as advisors and legal advocates for women who have suffered abuse, harrassment,
 or discrimination.
 According to the Women's Delegation, the number of reported sex crimes against
 women in Costa Rica more than doubled during the last year. This may partly re-
 flect the fact it has become easier for women to ile charges and take advantage of
 social services but many concerned observers feel that more women are becoming
 victims of violent crime. Physical abuse of women, including domestic violence, is
 prosecuted and often results in stringent punishment. Still, many proponents of
 women's rights want an overhaul of the Penal Code to stiffen penalties and broaden
 the definitin of rape (currently various forms of sexual assault are overlooked).
 Abuse of female minors is considered aggravated assault. There are a number of pri-
 vate organizations, including the Aria Foundation, that monitor abuse of women,
 provide counseling, and work to inform women of their legal rights.
 Costa Rica's population of 30,000 blacks (approximately 1 percent of the total op-
 ulation), who reside largely on the Caribbean coast, enjoy full rights of citizenship,
 including the protection o laws agnst racial discrimination. The 1990-1994 Legis-
 lative Assembly includes one black member, as did the last Assembly. The Govern-
 ment treats al matters of racial discrimination as human rights issues and estab-
 lished the Offie of the Ombudsman for Human Rights to deal with these issues.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Assocation.-Workers are free to join unions of their choosing
 without prior authorization. Approximately 15 percent of the work force is orga-
 nized. Unions are independent of government control and are generally free to form
 federations and confederations (three social democratic labor federations merged in
 1991), and to affiliate internationally. However, the American Federation of Labor
 
 
 370
 and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), the International Confed-
 eration of Free Trade Unions (ICYI'U), and other trade union organizations contend
 that trade unionism's right of association has been hurt by Costa Rica's
 asolidarismo" (solidarity) movement. This movement espouses cooperation between
 employers and workers, offering workers such benefits as credit unions and savings
 plans in return for their renunciation of the right to strike and to bargain collec-
 tively. Solidarity associations are financed in part by employers and are allowed
 under Costa Rican law to offer a wide range of services and engage in profit-making
 activities, which unions are not permitted to do.
 "Permanent Workers' Committees" made up of members of solidarity associations
 have entered into 'direct apeements" with their employers, sometimes in order to
 sink attempts by an established union to negotiate a collective bargaining pact. In
 June 1991, the International Labor Organization's (ILO) Committee on Freedom of
 Association (CFA) concluded a 2-year investigation and ruled that management use
 of solidarity and the associations' involvement in trade union activities (such as col-
 lective bargaining) are violatiods of freedom of association. Since then, the Calderon
 administration initiated efforts to comply with the letter of the ILO ruling, notably
 by instructing the Labor Ministry not to recognize any "direct agreements* con-
 cluded between management and solidarity associations (which are implicitly ex-
 cluded from engaging in collective bargaining under the 1984 Solidarista Act) where
 unions are negotiating as well. The administration also introduced a bill-but with
 low priority on the Legislative Assembly agenda-which would explicitly prohibit
 solidarity associations from engai  "directly or indirectly' in collective bargaining.
 The bill was still "under study" in the Assembly's Social Affairs Committee at year's
 end.
 Costa Rican law restricts the right of public sector workers to strike and imposes
 penalties on those who do. Nevertheless, public sector workers do strike on occasion,
 and fines imposed or pay suspensions are often rescinded as part of a settlement.
 In 1992 an executive decree suspended two articles of the Penal Code which man-
 date tough punishment for striking government workers. A bill to repeal these arti-
 cles permanently has been before the Assembly since 1991.
 As in recent years, strikes and labor unrest were at low levels in 1992. There are
 no restrictions on the rights of private workers to strike, but the Labor Code con-
 tains clauses which employers can use as a license to fire employees who try to or-
 ganize or strike. Very few private sector workers are union members and there were
 no notable private sector strikes in 1992. Public sector labor dis utes roduced a
 scattering of demonstrations and brief strikes, particularly in the atterhalf of the
 year.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The right to organize is pro-
 tected by the Constitution; much ofthe 1943 Costa Rican Labor Code, however, is
 outdated. One clause permits workers to be discharged "at the will of the employer,"
 provided the worker is paid severance pay. Currently mandated severance pay
 equals 1 month's salary for every year worked, up to a total of 8 years. This clause
 has often been used to fire labor organizers. Public sector workers cannot engage
 in collective bargaining because the Public Administration Act of 1978 makes labor
 law inapplicable in relations between the government and its employees. In mid-
 1991, the Government told the ILO it would draft remedial legislation to protect
 union organizers. Several proposals to modernize the Labor Code were under consid-
 eration in both the Assembly and the tripartite labor council (which is made up of
 representatives of labor, government, and business), but at year's end no major re-
 form appeared likely to pass in the near future.
 Collective bargaining is allowed in the private sector but due to the dearth of
 unions, is not a widespread practice. All normal Costa Rican labor regulations apply
 to the country's nine export processing zones (EPZ's). Labor regulations both within
 and outside the EPZ's, are often not enforced, mainly because the Labor Ministry
 lacks expertise and resources.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and there are no known instances of either.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Constitution provides special
 employment protection for women and minors and establishes the minimum work-
 ing age at 12 years, with special regulations in force for workers under 15. A child
 welfare agency, in cooperation with the Labor Ministry, is responsible for enforce-
 ment. Although data are lacking, child labor appears to be an integl part of the
 large informal economy. Enforcement in the formal sector is reasonabl, effective.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Constitution provides the right to a mini-
 mum wage. A National Wage Board, composed of three members each from govern-
 ment, business, and labor, sets minimum wage and salary levels for all sectors that
 are legally enforceable. The wages set are minimum and are legally enforceable. Pay
 
 
 can and does exceed the set amounts. The Board usually meets at the beginning
 and middle of each year. While violations sometimes occur, the wage and salary lev.
 els are generally respected. The minimum wage was last set in June and July 1992
 for the private and public sectors. Workers at the low end of the wage scale often
 find it difficult to maintain an acceptable standard of living whether they have a
 family to support or not, and must spend an inordinate percentage of their pay on
 food.
 The Constitution sets the workday hours, remuneration for overtime, days of rest,
 and annual vacation rights. It requires compensation for discharge without due
 cause. Maximum work hours are 8 during the day and 6 at night, up to weekly to-
 tals of 48 and 36 hours, respectively. Ten-hour days are permitted for work not con-
 sidered unhealthful or dangerous, but weekly totals may not exceed 48 hours. Non-
 agricultural workers receive an overtime premium of 50 percent of regular wages
 for work in excess of the daily work shift. Agricultural workers are not paid over-
 time, however, if they work beyond their normal hours voluntarily. There is little
 evidence that employers coerce such overtime from employees.
 A 1967 law governs health and safety at the workplace. This law requires indus-
 trial, agricultural and commercial firms with 10 or more workers to establish a
 management-labor committee, and allows the Government to inspect workplaces
 and to fine employers for violations. Most firms required to set up such committees
 have followed the letter of the law, but often little effort is made to utilize the com-
 mittees or turn them into effective instruments for improving the workplace. There
 are too few labor inspectors, especially outside of San Jose, to ensure that minimum
 conditions of safety and sanitation are maintained.
