 BULGARIA
 Three years after the overthrow of Communist dictator Toder Zhivkov, Bulgaria
 is a constitutional republic ruled by a democratically elected government. President
 Zhelyu Zhelev, former chairman of the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), was
 elected in January to a 5-year term in the country's first direct Presidential elec-
 tions. A government headed by Prime Minister Philip Dimitrov, formed after free
 parliamentary elections in late 1991, resigned after losing a vote of confidence in
 October 1992. President Zhelev, following his constitutional mandate, invited the
 three parliamentary groups in descending order of size to attempt to form a new
 government. The UDF, with 110 seats in Parliament, and the Bulgarian Socialist
 Party (BSP), with 106, were beth unsuccessful. The Movement for Rights and Free-
 doms (MRF), which largely represents the ethnic Turkish minorit and has 24 seats,
 nominated independent centrist Lyuben Berov as its candidate for Prime Minister.
 On December 30, Berov successfully formed a Cabinet, drawing on support from
 moderates within both the UDF and BSP.
 Reforms of the military and security apparatus continued in 1992. The Govern-
 ment has not released statistics on military expenditures. It is anticipated, however,
 that there will be a future reduction below existing levels in these expenditures
 based on downsizing initiatives taken by the Government in light of its withdrawal
 from the Warsaw Pact. A parliamentary intelligence committee strengthened over-
 sight responsibilities for the Interior Ministry, which controls the police, national se-
 curity service, internal security troops, border gards, and special forces. Stricter
 controls on electronic eavesdropping were introduced in March. Despite these con-
 trols, and despite public assurances by the Minister of the Interior that electronic
 monitoring of government critics had ceased, there were a number of charges by
 trade union, BSP, and MRF officials alleging wiretapping (see Section 1.f.).
 Bulgaria continued its difficult transition from a command economy to a free mar-
 ket system. Fuel and energy shortages led to blackouts and interrupted deliveries
 of many goods. Overall industrial production fell dramatically. On the positive side,
 Bulgaria launched negotiations to restructure $9 billion of its defaulted commercial
 debt and began partial interest payments. The first state-owned firms were
 privatized, new legislation and the conclusion of a bilateral investment treaty with
 the United States encouraged foreign investment, and Communist-era agricultural
 collectives began to be broken up and returned to individual ownership. Thousands
 of new small businesses sprang up, mostly in the service and consumer goods sec-
 tors.
 Bulgaria's overall human rights performance was generally good in 1992. Freedom
 of press, assembly, religion, speech, association, and travel were generally respected.
 However, specific legislation to reinforce the rights enshrined in the Constitution re-
 mained weak, and little progress was made toward establishing a clear judicial
 basis for addressing human rights complaints. Discrimination against Gypsies and
 other ethnic minorities remained aproblem. Several violent clashes took place be-
 tween Gypsy groups and police, and there were credible reports of police beatings
 of Gypsies. While the Government continued to make efforts to redress the human
 rights complaints of ethnic Turks and began to address those of Gypsies, constitu-
 tional provisions against ethnically based political parties continue to jeopardize the
 legality of the mostly ethnically based MRF and to prevent the political participa-
 tion of parties representing Gypsy interests.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHIS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of such
 kill*ngs
 b isappearanc.-There were no reported instances of disappearance.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution expressly prohibits: torture; cruel, inhuman or degrading treat-
 ment; forcible assimilation; and subjection to medical, scientific, or other experimen-
 tation without consent. There were several credible reports of police beatings of
 GyxsrieS upon arrest.
 bitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution provides for access to
 legal counsel from the time of detention. Judicial authorities must rule on the legal-
 ity of a detention within 24 hours. Defendants have the right to know the charges
 against them, but charges may not be made public without the permission of the
 chief prosecutor. Pretrial detention is limited to 2 months under normal cir-
 cumstances, although this may be extended to 4 months and then 6 months at the
 discretion of the Chief Prosecutor, who may also start the process all over again.
 In the event of a conviction, time spent in pretrial detention is credited towards
 completion of the sentence. The Constitution provides for bail, and some detainees
 have been released under this provision. Bail, however, is not a widely used means
 of predetention release.
 A number of international observers expressed concern about the pretrial deten-
 tion of former Prime Minister Andrey Lukanov (Prime Minister between February
 and December 1990 and Minister of Foreign Trade under the Communist dictator
 Todor Zhivkov from 1987 to 1989), asserting that it was detrimental to his health.
 Lukanov was stripped of his parliamentary immunity and arrested in July on the
 basis of a request from the Chief Prosecutor of the National Assembly. The defense
 claimed that the Government unlawfully singled out Lukanov and several others for
 what were ostensibly collective policy decisions taken by a former government, rais-
 ing the question of whether the criminal justice system was being misused for politi-
 ci ends. The Government asserted that charges against Lukanov would involve in-
 dividua criminal culpability. On December 29, Parliament voted to rescind the Gov-
 ernment's authority to arrest Lukanov, and on December 30 he was released from
 detention.
 Neither internal nor external exile is employed as a form of punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Under the Constitution, the judiciary is guaran-
 teed independent and coequal status with the legislature and the executive branch.
 The court system consists of regional courts, district courts and two main courts
 of final appeal, the Supreme Court and the Constitutional dourt. The Constitution
 stipulates that "all courts shall conduct their hearings in public, unless provided
 otherwise by law." Closed trials may be held in cases involving state security or to
 preserve state secrets. Defendants are considered innocent until proven guilty, may
 not be compelled to confess, and may not be judged guilty solely on the basis of a
 confession. Defendants have the right to know the ch   es against them and are
 given ample time to prepare a defense. The right of appeal is guaranteed and widely
 utilized. Defendants in criminal procedings have the right to confront witnesses
 and to have an attorney, provided by the State, if necessary, in serious cases.
 The Constitution provides for a Constitutional Court, based on Western European
 models, to decide matters of constitutional import. Military courts handle cases in-
 volving military personnel and some cases involving national security matters. The
 Constitutional Court does not have specific jurisdiction in matters of military jus-
 tice.
 Former dictator Todor Zhivkov was convicted in 1992 of abuses of power involving
 personal expense accounts and inappropriate allocation of state privileges. Despite
 initial concerns about possil~le bias in the proceedings, it was generally agreed that
 the court observed due process. Zhivkov faces proceedings on three more criminal
 counts, including one related to forced assimilations and expulsions of the ethnic
 Turkish minority.
 The Constitutional Court overturned a "decommunization" provision in Bulgaria's
 new banking and credit law that would have barred former high-level Communist
 Party members from positions of authority and denied them social security rights
 earned during the period of their former service. Several other laws, each having
 significant decommunization elements, are in various stages of parliamentary con-
 sideration. These laws in their current forms would almost certainly conflict with
 international human rights standards by applying a presumption of collective guilt.
 Bulgaria has no political prisoners.
 
 
 732
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution stipulates inviolability of the home, protects the freedom and confiden-
 tiality of correspondence, and provides for the right to choose one's place of work
 and residence. Police may not legally conduct a search without the permission of the
 prosecutor.
 There were two known violations of this provision in 1992. In Khaskovo, after a
 Gypsy-police confrontation, police forcibly entered a number of Gypsy residences
 without a search warrant, apparently as a punitive operation. In Pazardzhik, a theft
 of fruit from a police-owned orchard resulted in a Gypsy-olie skirmish in which
 several policemen and Gypsies were wounded. On the following morning, between
 4 a.m. and 6 a.m., police conducted an extensive house-to-house search for passport
 irregularities. Credible reports, including a preliminary report issued by experts in
 the Presidency, described widespread beatings and significant destruction of prop-
 erty. In addition to excessive force, police reportedly committed numerous due proc-
 ess violations, such as breaking doors windows, and furnishings and confiscating
 money. Only one minor passport irregularity was found.
 Charges persisted in 1992 that the intelligence services continued in some in-
 stances to monitor correspondence and telephone communications, particularly those
 of government critics such as union and opposition leaders and the MRF. Some of
 these charges appeared to be credible, although they were difficult to substantiate
 because many buildings remain riddled with listening devices from the Zhivkov re-
 gime, and it is difficult to determine if a given device has actually been used. The
 Minister of Internal Affairs denied authorizing any such activity, and by the end
 of the year such complaints had ceased.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and a free and independent
 press continued to flourish in 1992. Nearly every political party and many smaller
 local organizations published newspapers representing the full spectrum of political
 opinion. Turkish-language papers appear regularly, as well as a newspaper rep-
 resenting the viewpoint of one Gypsy group. Censorship of the press and mass
 media is prohibited by the Constitution.
 Bulgarian television remains a state monopoly under the supervision of the Na-
 tional Assembly (legislature). In addition to two government-controlled channels, a
 third broadcasts Russian programming. Television and radio news programs present
 opposition views but are generally seen as being biased in favor of the Government.
 There are no formal restrictions on programming, but both the BSP and the
 Podkrepa trade union confederation criticized programming for being one-sided, al-
 though both groups acknowledged that their representatives were interviewed regu-
 larly. Opinion polls rate television as the most credible news source. Both television
 and radio provide a variety of news and public interest programming, including talk
 format and public opinion shows. More than 25 new radio stations were licensed in
 1992, of which 6 were in Sofia and the balance outside the capital. Radio transmit-
 ter facilities are owned by the Government.
 Private book publishing remained lively in 1992, with more than 50 publishers
 in business. Academic freedom continued to increase during the year as university
 rectors and other leaders were replaced by persons less associated with the rigid
 policies of the former regime.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The right to peaceful and un-
 armed assembly is provided for by the Constitution. Permits are required for rallies
 and assemblies held outdoors. Legally registered organizations were routinely grant-
 ed permission to assemble. Political rallies and protest demonstrations were a com-
 mon occurrence in 1992.
 Article 44 of the Constitution prohibits organizations that threaten the country's
 territorial integrity or unity, or that incite racial, ethnic, or religious hatred. In 1990
 a separatist Macedonian rights grou , UMO-llinden, was denied registration as a
 legal organization. The group's appeawas denied in 1991, and attempts on the part
 o its members during 1992 to hold public meetings were broken up by police. TMO-
 Ilinden, a Macedonian cultural group, was legally registered in June and has oper-
 ated freely, as do Gypsy, ethnic Turkish, and Vlach groups.
 Article 11 forbids the formation of political parties along religious, ethnic, or racial
 lines. In addition, Article 12 prohibits "citizens' associations, including trade
 unions," from engaging in political activity. A clause in the electoral law prohibits
 any organization not legally registered as a political party from running an inde-
 pendent list of candidates in parliamentary or local elections.
 These restrictions have been used to challenge the legitimacy of one of the three
 leading pblitical parties, the MRF, which is largely composed of ethnic Turks. In
 1991 a court denied the party's attempt to register. The Central Electoral Commis-
 
 
 733
 sion, however, ruled that its registration for the Grand National Assembly elections
 in 1990 was still valid, thus permitting it to run as a political party. In late 1991,
 a group of BSP Members of Parliament challenged the Electoral Commission's rul-
 ing on the grounds that the MRF was based on an ethnic and religious foundation,
 and the case was brought before the Constitutional Court in which the votes of 7
 of the 12 judges are needed for an official decision. The final vote in April was 6
 to 5 in favor of declaring the MRF an illegal party; the 12th judge did not vote due
 to illness. The party's legal status was therefore preserved by a technicality. Legal
 observers believe the right of the MRF to operate as a political party maybe chal-
 lenged again at the next elections.
 Another ethnically based party, the "Roma" union, dedicated to protecting the
 rights of Gypsies, was denied registration as a political party in 1991. Its subse-
 quent affiliation with the UDF did not result in national representation. In October
 the group reorganized under the name 'United Roma Organization," elected new
 leadership, and began lobbying the Government for more active policies on behalf
 of Gypsies. The new group has chosen not to challenge the stricture preventing it
 from declaring itself as a political party.
 The constitutional prohibition against political activities on the part of "citizens'
 associations, including trade unions," has not yet been tested to determine the limi-
 tations it may place upon the activities of such associations. However, in the after-
 math of a June transport strike, employers initiated court actions against some
 union organizations, charging them with violation of the prohibition against political
 activities. The result of these actions may clarify this constitutional provision, which
 appears to represent a potential for broad challenges to what are generally consid-
 ered to be normal union activities.
 Bulgaria, as a member state of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Eu-
 rop, has undertaken to respect the right of individuals and groups to establish, in
 full freedom, their own political parties or other political organizations. The effect
 of the above limitations and related statutory provisions is to limit the rights of mi-
 nority groups and others to form associations of their choosing and to participate
 meaningfully in the political process.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-Religious freedom continued to flourish in 1992. Eastern
 Orthodox Christianity is designated in the Constitution as the "traditional" religion
 of Bulgaria, but all of the major religious bodies receive some degree of govern-
 mental mancial support. Religious bodies must register with the Directorate for Re-
 ligious Affairs, but no group was denied registration, and more than 25 are now offi-
 cially recognized, representing a broad spectrum of faiths.
 Return of church property confiscated by the State under the Zhivkov regime con-
 tinued in 1992. One contentious issue was the decision of the Religious Affairs Di-
 rectorate to remove from office the leaders of the Orthodox and Muslim religious
 communities and of one Protestant church. The Directorate justified this action on
 the basis of irregularities in the selection process as laid down by the statutes of
 each religious body. Some observers saw this as governmental interference in
 church affairs, while others saw the Government's actions as correct and long over-
 due.
 There were no restrictions on attendance at religious services or on private reli-
 gious instruction. A school for imams, a Muslim cultural center, university theo-
 ogical faculties, and religious primary schools all operated freely. Bibles and other
 religious materials in the Bulgarian language were freely imported and printed in
 BulBgaria. Musim, Catholic, and Jewish newspapers were published on a regular
 basis. Missionaries of various faiths appeared to operate unhindered throughout the
 country.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-Freedom of movement within the country and the right to leave it are
 constitutionally enshrined and not limited in practice, except in rare cases involving
 national security or detention on criminal charges. No exit visa is required to leave
 Buloaria. Thousands of Bulgilrians left during the year in search of economic oppor-
 tunities in the West, particularly as unemployment increased. Every citizen has the
 right to return to Bulgaria, may not be forcibly expatriated, and may not be de-
 prived of citizenship acquired by birth. A number of former political emigrants were
 granted passports and returned to visit or live in Bulgaria.
 Bulgarian law provides for the granting of asylum to persons persecuted for their
 opinions or activities in defense of internationally recognized rights. In practice,
 Bulgaria received few applications for asylum, more often serving as a temporary
 refuge for third-country nationals seeking to travel to Western Europe. Many of
 these have not returned to their countries of origin and live in Sofia in substandard
 conditions.
 
 
 734
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Bulgarian citizens have the right to change their government through the election
 of the President and members of the National Assembly. The most recent par-
 liamentary elections were held in October 1991, when more than 40 parties and coa-
 litions participated. At the same time, Bulgarians voted in the country's first
 multiparty elections for local government bodies since the Communist era. In Janu-
 ary 1992, incumbent President Zhelyu Zhelev was reelected in the country's first di-
 rect presidential elections.
 The Constitution provides for unicameral parliamentary elections by secret ballot.
 The 240 parliamentary deputies are elected by a proportional system from party
 lists. Their term is for 4 years, although the Constitution provides for early elections
 if Parliament is unable to agree on a government. Suffrage is universal over the age
 of 18.
 A distinct separation of powers exists between the Government (Prime Minister
 and Cabinet) and the President, who is the Chief of State. The President has rel-
 atively limited powers and is elected for a term of 5 years. A bill passed in Decem-
 ber 1991 authorized confiscation of all property obtained from the State by Com-
 munist organizations between 1945 and 1989. Dspite the loss of much of this prop-
 erty, the BSP, heir to the extensive Communist party structure, maintains a strong
 system of patronage, particularly in rural areas, which some observers feel gives the
 party an unfair advantage at election time.
 While there are no restrictions in law on the participation of members of minori-
 ties in elections as individuals, the constitutional ban on ethnically based parties
 significantly limits the ability of ethnic and religious minorities to participate mean-
 ingfully in the political process (see Section 2.b.). Additionally, credible rep.rts sug-
 gest that in some areas minorities were discouraged from voting by intimidation or
 manipulation of electoral lists. There are no restrictions in law or practice on the
 participation of women in government or politics, and many women hold elected and
 appointed office at high levels, among them Vice President Blaga Dimitrova.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 An increasing number of local and international human rights groups operated
 freely in Bulgaria in 1992, including a newly founded Bulgarian chapter of Helsinki
 Watch (not to be confused with a self-proclaimed Helsinki-Watch chapter headed by
 BSP deputy Rumen Vodenicharov). The Bulgarian Association for Free Elections
 and Human Rights established itself as a genuinely independent monitor of human
 rights issues. One group, the Bulgarian Cnter Against Torture which claimed to
 represent persons who were imprisoned and tortured under the Communist regime,
 was denied registration on the questionable grounds that its stated aim, to gather
 criminal information, usurped a state function.
 Bulgaria ratified the European Convention on Human Rights in 1992, including
 the right of individual complaint under the Convention. It also accepted the optional
 protocol under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which al-
 lows individuals to file complaints directly to the United Nations.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Language, or Social Status
 The Constitution guarantees individual rights and equality, although in practice
 instances of discrimination, particularly against Gypsies, still exist.
 The Government continued to make progress in redressing the grievances of eth-
 nic Turks who were victims of the forced assimilation campaigns of 1984-85 and
 1989. A new compensation bill provided for the return of homes to those who had
 been forced to sell them, although some Socialist and nationalist observers felt that
 new injustices were caused when insufficient compensation was given to those who
 had moved into these residences. Man ethnic TuIrks and ethnic Bulgarian Muslims
 (often referred to as Pomaks, although they consider this to be a demeaning term)
 continue to live in housing inferior to that of most Bulgarians. The tens of thou-
 sands of ethnic Turks who migrated from the Kurdzhai region to Turkey during
 the last 2 years left primarily for economic reasons, although local rumors of an-
 other assimiliationist campaign may have played a part in this exodus. The Govern-
 ment appointed a commission to address the concerns of ethnic Turks and other mi-
 norities in the region.
 There are no restraints on the practice of Muslim religious traditions the speak-
 ing of Turkish in public, or the use of non-Slavic names. Voluntary turkish-lan-
 guage classes, first introduced in 1991, were conducted without significant con-
 troversy, despite initial concerns of a nationalistic backlash. Bulgaria conducted a
 natinnsl rpnmia in lpn-rnhPhr tn uindatp dat.R from  the lst cnsu in 1995. Thn c.n-
 
 
 735
 sus included questions on ethnicity, religion and mother tongue. The BSP and a
 Macedonian nationalist organization in southwestern Bulgaria accused local MRF
 chapters of pressuring ethnic Bulgarian Muslims to declare Turkish their mother
 tongue. MRF leadrs denied these charges.
 Gypsy groups, divided among themselves and denied the ability to form political
 associations by the Constitution, did not participate to a significant degree in politi-
 cal life. As individuals and as an ethnic group, they continued to face significant
 de facto discrimination. The quality of housing in Gypsy areas, as in many ethnic
 Turkish and Bulgarian Muslim areas, is relatively inferior, with many houses lack-
 ing water, electricity, and sewage facilities. Gypsies reportedly encounter difficulties
 applying for social benefits, and rural Gypsies are discouraged from claimingland
 to which they are entitled under the law dividing up agricultural collectives. There
 were a number of credible reports of police mistreatment of Gypsies, including beat-
 ings destruction of property, and abuse of search and seizure powers (see Section
 1). nrespose to t ese complaints, the Government announced a number of re-
 forms including efforts to investigate and prosecute charges of police use of exces-
 sive force, hire Gypsies as police officers, educate police in Gypsy relations and
 crowd control techniques, and improve working contacts between police and Gypsy
 leaders. As of the end of the year, two police officers had been dismissed over the
 incident in Khaskovo (see Section 1.f.), and the Minister of Internal Affairs had pub.
 licly admitted police excesses. However, an investigation begun in August into the
 Pazardzhik incident appeared to be making little progress (see Section I.f.).
 Schoolbooks printed in Bulgarian andGypsy dialects were introduced, although
 some Christian Gypsy groups complained these texts favor Gypsies who speak dia-
 lects closer to Turkish. The President's Advisor on Ethnic and Nationality Issues
 has sponsored studies of particular Gypsy problems in individual communities and
 made efforts to work toward solutions. The Ministry of Labor began preparations
 for pilot employment and literacy programs for a Gypsy-inhabited area in Plovdiv,
 and local police forces hired several Gypsies.
 Workplace discrimination against minorities became an increasingly important
 issue as unemployment rates continued to rise. Supervisory jobs are generally given
 to ethnic Bulgarian employees, with ethnic Turks, Bulgarian Muslims, and particu-
 larly Gypsies often being among the irst to be laid off During compulsory military
 service, minorities are routinely shunted into labor units, where they perform civil-
 ian as well as military construction and maintenance instead of serving in normal
 military units. There are only a few ethnic Turkish, and reportedly no Gypsy, offi-
 cers in the military. Despite threats by shadowy antiethic groups, no concrete ac-
 tions took place in 1992.
 Several organizations exist to defend women's interests, including a number of
 small political parties supporting both the UDF and BSP. While the Constitution
 forbids privileges or restriction of rights on the basis of sex, in practice women are
 sometimes laid off from their jobs fore men, a form of de facto discrimination. Pro-
 visions in the old labor code which identified certain professions as being more fa-
 vorable" for women were removed from the new Labor Code passed in December.
 However, the new Code provides relatively limited protection for pregnant women
 and women with small children, and thus appears to conflict with International
 Labor Organization Convention 3 on Maternity Protection, which Bulgaria has rati-
 fied. No statistics are available for violence directed against women. Such figures
 were not kept under the Communist regime and have not been gathered since then.
 Rape is prosecuted in the courts, although it remains an underreported crime be-
 cause some stigma still attaches to the victim. The maximum sentence for rape is
 8 years; convicted offenders often receive a lesser sentence or are paroled early for
 good behavior. There are no figures on the occurrence of domestic abuse, and no evi-
 dence, anecdotal or otherwise, that it is either pervasive or increasing. There are
 no organizations or government agencies which exist specifically to provide support
 to victims of domestic violence.
 Section 6. Worker Rights  "1
 a. The Right of Association.-The 1991 Constitution guarantees the right of all
 workers to form or join trade unions of their own choosing. Bulgaria has two large
 trade union confederations, the Confederation of Independent Trade Unions of Bul-
 garia (KNSB), and Podkrepa. The KNSB is the successor to the trade union inte-
 grated with the former Communist Party but claims it is independent of the BSP.
 pa, the independent confederation created in 1989 was one of the earliest op-
 position forces but is no longer a member of the ruling UDF coalition. It has formed
 a tactical alliance with KNSB on many, but not all, union and political issues.
 Podkrepa's founder, Dr. Konstantin Trenchev, continues to play an active role in
 union affairs and politics despite government threats to prosecute him on criminal
 
 
 charges. One of those charges, involving illegal occupation of a building, has been
 dropped. The other, concerning a fire in the former security service headquarters,
 is still pending. The Government during 1992 appeared to be progressively dis-
 inclined to negotiate directly with the unions in a tripartite setting, and criticized
 their activities sharply. However, there were no direct challenges to union activities,
 political or otherwise. Both union confederations were active critics of various gov-
 ernment policies throughout 1992. Podkrepa has sought to shape economic legisla-
 tion through an informal labor lobby in the UDF parliamentary group. One con-
 troversial issue is the return of union property to private citizens under legislation
 providing for such restitution.
 A new Labor Code passed in December recognizes the right to strike when other
 means of conflict resolution have been exhausted, but political strikes are forbidden.
 Of the strikes that occurred in 1992, the most serious were those by uranium min-
 ers, transport workers, and defense workers. The first two were settled without sig-
 nificant concessions on the part of the Government and without accusations of im-
 proper government action. As part of the resolution of the defense workers' strike,
 the Government agreed to assume responsibility for some state enterprise debts. In
 the wake of the transport strike, employers initiated legal action against some of
 the unions involved on the grounds that their activities violated the constitutional
 prohibition against political activities by citizens' associations, defined to include
 trade unions. The outcome of these actions may help define this otherwise untested
 provision of the Constitution.
 The International Labor Organization's Committee of Experts urged the Govern-
 ment in 1992 to continue and strengthen its ongoing efforts to eliminate employ-
 ment discrimination against ethnic Turks, Gypsies, and other minorities.
 There are no restrictions on affiliation or contact with international labor organi-
 zations, and Bulgarian unions actively exercise this right.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectivdy.-The new Labor Code insti-
 tutes collective bargaining and codifies prohibitions against antiunion discrimina-
 tion. Podkrepa officials expressed concern that these prohibitions were too weak to
 protect union activists adequately from retribution by employers, but these guaran-
 tees appear to fit within Western norms.
 The National Social Council, a three-part body composed of workers, employers,
 and the Government, was formed in 1992 as a successor to the similarly constituted
 Trilateral Commission. Smaller unions complained they were excluded from the
 Council and had no effective forum in which to appeal their exclusion. The Council
 was hampered in its activities because most employers remain servants of the State,
 blurring the line between negotiating partners. As privatization proceeds, the Coun-
 cil may become a more balanced and effective arbiter of work force issues.
 Some newly established export processing zones exist on a small scale. There do
 not appear to be any special restrictions on worker rights.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution prohibits forced
 or compulsory labor, and there were no reported violations.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-The Labor Code sets the minimum
 age for employment at 16, and at 18 for dangerous work. Employers and the Min-
 istry of Employment and Social Welfare enforce these provisions. An increasing
 number of children are engaged in street trading in central Sofia, where informal
 bazaars have become fixtures.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-A national minimum wage, set by the Tri-
 lateral Commission in 1991, was adjusted upward in 1992 as inflation and devalu-
 ation of the currency dramatically increased the cost of living. The minimum wage
 is not sufficient for a single wage earner to provide a decent standard of living or
 a family. The Constitution stipulates the right to social security and welfare aid and
 assistance for the temporarily unemployed.
 The new Labor Code provides for a standard workweek of 40 hours, with at least
 one 24-hour rest period per week. Enforcement is the responsibility of the Ministry
 of Labor and Social Welfare.
 Bulgaria has a national labor safety program with standards established by the
 labor code. The Constitution states that employees are entitled to healthy and
 nonhazardous working conditions. The Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare is re-
 sponsible for enforcing these standards. The generally poor state of much industrial
 equipment, often outdated and lacking spare parts, complicates enforcement of
 health and safety regulations.
