 VENEZUELA':'
 Venezuela is a republic with an active multiparty democratic
 systemifree-press, strong unions, and an ardent commitment to
 democracy. For the past 29 years; poWerhas passed peacefully
 between the two major'political-parties through open elections.
 Venezuelahas-a mixed econ6my, dominated by the public
 sector. The stdte-owned petroleum industry currently accounts
 for some 16 percent of the gross domestic product, more than
 any other industry, although this percentage has declined due
 to recent-low oil prices. .Venezoela has experidnced economic
 problems resulting from declining petroleum revenues, a large
 foreign debt, and'high government expenditures which include
 debt servide. -      ,-                               "

 RESPECT FOR HUM'IAN RIGHTS  2         -
 Section 1 Respect for the'Integrity of the"Person, Including
 Freedom from:                   ï¿½      .
 a; -:Political Killing
 Authorities do not engage in or condone unlawful or arbitrary
 killing f6r political motives, and there were no reports of
 such killings. There have been instances of police and
 security forces shooting and killing criminal suspects, of
 arrestedpersons dying while in police custody, and of
 shooting deaths during student protests that-some attribute to
 the police. Such incidents are investigated when there is
 reason to believe that the killing was illegal. Perpetrators
 may be charged with'a crime and prosecuted in the courts. In
 July, Jhonny David Villarreal Matds, a'student, was shot and
 killed in-Trujillo during a student demohstration. The police
 denied that they were responsible, but the Trujillo Governor
 turned over eight state police officials to the federal
 judicial police for an investigation in connection with
 Villarreal's death. There is no evidence to indicate the
 death was politically motivated.
 b. Disappearance
 As a matter of policy, police authorities do not abduct,
 secretly arrest, or hold people in clandestine confinement.
 There were no reports of such incidents.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Venezuelan law prohibits the torture of prisoners.
 Constitutional provisions for the integrity of the individual
 are usually enforced, but allegations of physical abuse of
 detainees remain common. These infractions are usually
 attributed to excesses on the part of law enforcement
 officials or inadequate supervision of prison guards.

 VENEZUELA
 Prison conditions are Spartan, often very poor. Sanitation
 and health care are inadequate, as is the diet unless
 supplemented by donations from friends and family. Discipline
 is sometimes inadequate, and violence by guards against the
 prisoners and among the prisoners is especially common in the
 more crowded prisons. Personnel responsible for such violence
 are not known to be punished. The low educational level and
 limited training of many prison guards are contributing
 factors.
 In November Humberto Lopez, a student, died in police custody
 in Merida. Police claimed he was arrested because he was
 drunk and disorderly, and subsequently died of a cocaine
 overdose. An official autopsy revealed that he had swallowed
 small packets of cocaine. However, this version was disputed
 by Lopez' family, who claimed he was not a drug addict, and by
 others who reported he was beaten to death. His death was
 well publicized and sparked student protests throughout the
 country, some of which were marked by violence committed by
 both the students and security forces.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, Exile, or Forced Labor
 The right to judicial determination of the legality of
 detention is provided for by law. Arrested persons or persons
 under preventive detention legally cannot be held more than 8
 days without a formal detention order, during which time they
 may be held incommunicado. Arbitrary arrests and arrests with
 improper warrants are common, and the time limits are
 frequently exceeded, usually because of inefficiencies in the
 legal system. Elements of the Catholic Church have publicized
 allegations of frequent and arbitrary roundups by the police
 in poor neighborhoods under vagrancy laws. Undocumented
 aliens are frequently held incommunicado and then deported
 without legal proceedings.
 Of the hundreds of persons detained in connection with student
 disturbances in the spring, 31 persons were turned over to
 military courts on charges of subversion. The government
 spokesman asserted that some of those arrested were engaged in
 a terrorist plot against the State, spearheaded by the Red
 Flag guerrilla movement. The government position was received
 with skepticism by many members of opposition political parties
 and commentators. Twelve of those initially arrested are still
 in custody, 7 are before civilian courts, charged with
 destruction of property, and 5 are before military courts,
 charged with sedition.
 There is no forced or compulsory labor; unremunerated labor is
 prohibited by law.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Fair trial is provided for by law and a number of procedural
 safeguards. The accused is presumed innocent until guilt is
 proven beyond a reasonable doubt. However, preventive
 detention for criminal activity is legal and common. The law
 provides public defenders for those unable to afford competent
 defense; however, the workload of the approximately 350 public
 defenders in the entire country exceeds their ability to
 fulfill this provision. According to Ministry of Justice
 officials, approximately 51 percent of the 28,000 persons in
 prison have not yet been charged or sentenced. The same
 judicial authorities attribute the backlog to an insufficient
 number of qualified judges; automatic review of all lower

 court decisions by higher courts which cannot limit their
 dockets;.,and failure to-enforce procedural deadlines at each
 stage of the legal process. Delays of-.2 or 3 years in-a 
 normal case are not infrequent. Bail is only permitted for
 relativelyminor crimes. Pii-soners are commonly released
 before a.-final decision is reached after serving more time
 than the Rroseztion originally sought., 'A Judges Association'
 study revealed in 1980.that there was one judge for each
 180,000 inhabitants inx the Caracas area. The extraordinarily
 slow pace qf justice appears to be primarily a product of the
 system's complexity and the formality of criminal trial
 procedures. The judicial process is almost exclusively a
 written one, requirin-g costly and, time-consuming production of
 voluminous reports by judges, attorneys, and witnesses at
 every stage.
 President,  uonchi-, among-others, has also attributed delays
 and irregukarities to corruption and use of personal .influence.
 The civilipn judiciary is legally independent, but connections
 to the two major poli-tical parties are important in the
 judici4a selection p,[ocess. The-nine members of the Judicial
 Council, an inependent ,body elected by, the Congress, are
 responsible for the training, nomination, and discipline of.
 judges. The Government is aware that improvement of the
 judicial syptemis necessary to increase, public confidence in
 the courtz. The Justice ministerannounced the formation of a
 Ministerial .C0Mrssion.reporting to the. President to  - .

 Civilians chargqd.with: armed subversion zre tried by military
 courts. - Such pprsons-are considered insurgents by the
 Government. There is.no statutory'time limit on military
 adjudication of their cases.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence    .
 The Constitution and law provide safeguards against arbitrary
 interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence.
 These safegua~rcs- are honored in practice.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a..- Freedom of Speech and Press
 Venezuela bas a free and lively press which frequently
 criticizes the Government and denounces the sporadic instances
 of government interference in the media. Some Venezuelan
 journalists assert, however, that they are sometimes asked by
 the Government to exercise self-censorship and are occasionally
 pressured to avoid reporting on sensitive subjects. The
 respected Inter-American Press Association (IAPA) states that
 "press freedom exists in Venezuela." However, it also reports
 the complaints of several- journalists, that they have been
 subjected to government pressure for reporting or commenting
 on certain sensitive topics. According to the IAPA report,
 Luis Marcano Barrios, editor of a daily newspaper, charges
 that he and other members of his staff were beaten by a group
 of 50 politically motivated persons at a radio station because
 Marcano intended to broadcast statements critical of local
 government party leaders. In some cases, journalists contend
 that government pressure on their employers has resulted in
 dismissals or lack of access to media outlets. Rodolfo
 Schmidt, twice arrested in 1986 on libel charges, finally
 
 
 630
 VENEZUELA
 resigned from his position as managing editor of El Diario de
 Caracas. He currently writes a regular column for that paper
 and publishes his own newsletter.
 Venezuela has 3 nationwide television networks, one of which
 is government-owned, a regional television station, more than
 156 radio stations, and numerous newspapers and.magazines,
 with 8 thriving dailies in Caracas alone. The Government
 currently subsidizes newsprint consumption through
 preferential exchange control and is a source of advertising
 revenue for the media.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of peaceful assembly and association is respected.
 Public meetings, including those of all political parties, are
 held without interference. In the interest of public safety,
 permits are required for public marches. Several student
 marches with the potential for disruption, and for which no
 permit had been issued, were dispersed by police in 1987 after
 smaller marches had resulted in street violence. Professional
 and academic associations operate without interference
 although some have ties to political parties.
 An object of "special protection" under the Constitution,
 labor unions are free, independent, and powerful. They have
 the right to strike and to bargain collectively. Unions
 associate with the recognized public and private international
 bodies in their fields. The Confederacion de Trabajadores de
 Venezuela, an affiliate of the International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions, dominates organized labor in Venezuela and
 has close ties to the ruling Accion Democratica party. Other
 confederations occupy a lesser role on the labor scene.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The population is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, although
 other religious groups enjoy freedom of worship and
 proselytize actively.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Citizens generally have freedom to travel within the country
 and abroad and to return.  Travel in the Amazon military zone
 is an exception and requires a special permit for security
 reasons. Venezuelans may emigrate if their tax obligations
 have been met. Citizenship can be renounced. Recovery of
 nationality requires a residence period of 2 years for
 Venezuelan-born repatriates. The Constitution provides for
 revocation of citizenship for naturalized citizens on specific
 and limited legal grounds.
 Venezuela traditionally has been a haven for refugees and
 displaced persons from many European and Latin American
 countries. Refugees are given normal residence status and can
 be expelled only for criminal activities. A special family
 reunification program exists for Cuban refugees living in
 Venezuela.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 The Government is freely elected. Venezuela is a multiparty
 democracy, and the political process is open to all.
 
 
 631
 _VENEZUELA  :
 Opposition views are freely expressed, and persons from the
 entire political spectrum contend for positions ranging from
 municipal council seats to the nation's presidency. Some of
 the minor parties are outgrowths of former guerrilla
 organizations, and they currently hold.bout 7 prcent of the
 seats in'the national legislature. The-two major parties are
 the centrist Social Democratic indSocial Chistian-. They
 both support the participation of minority parties in the
 political proceqs, a reflection of the widespread desire to
 have radisal'eleients participate in-the electoral process
 rather than, engage in armed insurrection. These minor, mainly

 Section 5 Discriminiation Bsed on Race, Sex, ReligioIn,
 ,Language,.o3 Social Status,,"
 There is no evidence that egonomic and, social needs and
 cultural aspirations are denied on a discriminatory basis to
 any portion of the population.
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the. basis of sex,
 and accords women and children "special protection" in the
 workplace. Women workers receive extensive maternity leave
 benefits, and laws limit their involuntary overtime. Women
 are heavily represented in many of the professions, but
 differences still exist between men and women in wage and
 employment opportunities.
 Women continue to be underrepresented in the political sector,
 but are increasingly active in all political parties, public
 administration, and the judiciary. Two Ministers of State are
 women, and 11 were elected to the 200-member Chamber of
 Deputies.
 Restrictions on property rights based on sex, religion, or
 social status do not exist,. but there are some restrictions on
 ownership of business property and employment based on
 nationality.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The legal minimum age for employment is 14, with certain other
 restrictions applying. The Government establishes a minimum
 wage. The workday is 8 hours, and the workweek 48 hours for
 workers over 16. The Government has difficulty enforcing
 these laws in the informal sector of the economy which employs
 roughly 25 percent of Venezuelan workers. Despite passage of
 new industrial safety statutes, enforcement of occupational
 safety regulations is inconsistent due to the lack of
 enforcement resources nationwide.
