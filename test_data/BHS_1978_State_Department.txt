 BAHAhAS
 Tne Commonwealth of the Bahamas is a democracy
 ana has been inaependent since 1973. Its
 political, cultural and legal traditions are
 similar to those of Great Britain and the United
 States. Its governmental structure is patterned
 after that of Great Britain, with a Prime Minister,
 a Cabinet, a Parliament, an independent judiciary
 and national ana local elections.
 The bahamas has one dominant political party,
 the Progressive Liberal Party (PLP), which won
 inaepenaence for the country in 1973 without
 violence. The PLP has grown stronger ever
 since and now holds thirty-of the 38 seats in
 Parliament. Two small opposition parties to
 the right of the PLP hold the other eight seats;
 a minor party on the left has no seats. The PLP
 ooes not shrink from using its authority and power
 of office to strengthen its political position
 ana, conversely, to weaken the opposition. It
 uoes so without threat to persons, property, due
 process or basic political freedoms.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freeaon from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by law. There are no reports
 of any instances of torture.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 (207)
 
 
 Such treatment or punishment is prohibited by law.
 The last recoroed execution occurred in 1976 when a
 convicted murderer (an American citizen) was hanged
 following a series of appeals and reviews, some
 of which were made at the request of the United States
 Government. Prison conditions are austere. The
 downtown Nassau holding cells, where prisoners
 can be confined 48 hours or more awaiting
 preliminary hearings, are small and unsanitary.
 There have been occasional reports of use of excessive
 force by Bahamian police, particularly officers of
 the Criminal Investigation Division (CID), while
 making arrests. host of these accusations have
 proven false. However, one exception occurred
 recently in Freeport, when two American citizens
 arrested on drug and firearms charges apparently
 were badly beaten. The United States Government
 immediately requested an investigation and ex-
 planation. An investigation was initiated and a
 report is expected soon.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Arrests or imprisonment of Bahamian citizens follow
 standard British legal and constitutional practices,
 which prohibit arbitrary arrest or imprisonment.
 Unlike the British practice, however, illegal aliens
 ao not have access to the courts to prevent summary
 arrest and deportation. The large numbers of Haitians
 illegally in The Bahamas are deemed a cause of unemploy-
 ment, making their presence a political issue. As
 a consequence the Government periodically arrests
 and eeports such Haitians. The Catholic Archbishop
 of the Bahamas issued a pastoral letter in August 1978
 in which he protested the Government's methods. A
 program is now under way for voluntary repatriation
 of illegal Haitians. About 200 or 300 are returned
 to Haiti each month at Bahamian Government expense,
 along with most of their belongings.

 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are fair and public, as provided for in the
 Constitution.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 Invasion of the home is not prohibited by law. However,
 with one exception, there have been no known cases of
 such violations. Overzealous immigration authorities
 sometimes take illegal aliens from their homes at
 night, to deport them. As noted above, illegal aliens
 are denied access to the courts and therefore enjoy no
 legal protection against these police methods.
 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education
 According to World Bank statistics, The Bahamas has
 the third highest per capita annual income in
 the Western Hemisphere, $3,450. If expatriates
 resident in the Bahamas are excluded from the
 calculations, the per capita income is around
 $2,000. The literacy rate is 93 percent, and life
 expectancy is 66.8 years. Housing, health care,
 and education standards are generally adequate.
 The Government and the ruling PLP emphasize the
 need for social programs, but expenditures in these
 areas are relatively low. There is no income tax
 and import duties provide 60 percent of public revenue.
 Most of the rest comes from license fees and property
 taxes. The tax structure is not, therefore, progressive.
 There is no evidence of corruption serious enough to
 divert significant public resources from the poor.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 
 
 210
 a. F'reeaom of Thought, Speech, Press, Religion
 ana Assembly
 There is full freedom in all of these areas. Labor
 unions are active and are completely free to organize.
 b. Freedom of hovement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 There is full treedom in all of these areas.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 The political process is open to all sectors of
 society. For historic reasons, based primarily on
 economic class but also on race, members of the
 traoitional white, Bahamian elite, while free to
 participate, are not particularly welcome in the
 political process. Nevertheless white Bahamians
 continue to hold high level civil service and
 political posts.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Allegea Violations of Human Rights
 Participation by The Bahamas in international
 organizations ana activities is limited by its
 representational resources. Although an active
 participant in the UN, The Bahamas have not sought
 to 3oin the OAS, for example, because the Govern-
 ment sees its interests as lying more with the
 Unitea States and the United Kingdom than with
 countries in the southern portion of the hemisphere.
 The Government aoes send aelegates to conferences
 involving issues of direct interest. There have
 been no requests to investigate human rights condi
 tions in The Bahamas, but the Government's human
 rights record and support for the principles of
 human rights indicate that the Government would be
 cooperative.
