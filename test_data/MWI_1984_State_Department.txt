 MALAWI
 The Government of Malawi is a one-man autocracy in which Life
 President Dr. H. Kamuzu Banda has held virtually unchallenged
 power, based on a philosophy combining nationalism and
 traditionalism, since independence in 1964. The President has
 maintained nearly undisputed control over political life and
 government and heads the sole political party, the Malawi
 Congress Party. Opposition to the Government is banned, and
 challenges to the system are suppressed. Total loyalty, not
 merely passive acceptance of party and government policy, is
 demanded under penalty of suspicion, if not detention by the
 authorities. Civil liberties exist at the sufferance of the
 authorities and are highly circumscribed. Political activity
 is limited to participation in the sole legal party and to
 conforming with its views and practices.
 Malawi inherited a parliamentary form of government from Great
 Britain. Elections are held every five years but all
 candidates must be members of the Malawi Congress Party and
 hold views consistent with the prevailing political philosophy
 of the President, whom the party proclaimed "Life President"
 in 1970. Constitutional amendments and laws passed by the
 101-member parliament, in effect, reflect decisions already
 taken by the President.
 Military, police, and party security organs form a pervasive
 network throughout the land, assure the security of
 government, and are largely responsible for the human rights
 violations which do occur.
 Malawi pursues a basically market-oriented economic
 philosophy, with substantial government involvement in the
 foTm of interventions through government-controlled
 enterprises. Individuals are relatively free to operate
 private businesses, hold property, and travel. A limited
 resource base has resulted in a low level of economic
 development and consequent de facto restraints on economic
 opportunities for most citizens.
 In June 1984, the President commuted the death sentences of
 Malawi dissident leader and former Minister of Justice Orton
 Chirwa and his wife to life imprisonment. The Chirwas had
 been convicted of treason in May 1983 and the mandatory death
 penalty was upheld on appeal in February 1984. Their son
 Fumbani, who had been taken into custody with his parents in
 December 1981, was released from detention in February 1984
 and allowed to leave the country. These cases had commanded
 international attention and clemency appeals, including
 appeals from Amnesty International.
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There have been no allegations of politically-motivated
 killings within the country during 1984.
 b. Disappearance
 Surreptitious detentions by the police, acting at the behest
 of the party, are not unknown. Lasting from a few weeks to
 several months, such disappearances usually occur in the name
 of either national security or party discipline.

 MALAWI
 There are no known instances in which such detentions have led
 to death.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Beatings by the police at the time of detention or arrest, or
 during interrogation are not officially condoned, but do
 occur. Persons convicted of violations of the law are
 sentenced to prison terms of varying lengths or are executed
 for capital offenses by hanging. An unknown number of
 political prisoners is said to be under a loose form of
 detention such as house arrest. Less severe and dangerous
 offenders frequently are sent to prison farms. Prison terms
 with hard labor are the norm for common criminals, with
 political detainees normally receiving less harsh or degrading
 treatment. Prison conditions are generally poor. In 1983,
 there were credible reports that prisoners considered to be
 incorrigible criminals received inhumane treatment, such as
 severely reduced food rations, lack of medical care, absence
 of sanitary facilities, and extended periods of confinement in
 shackles. Such treatment has caused general deterioration of
 the prisoners' health and, it is believed, some deaths.
 There exists in Malawi a form of unusual punishment called
 forfeiture. The Forfeiture Act permits the Government to
 revoke the property rights of those suspected of economic
 crimes without recourse to appeal. It is an executive fiat
 with no judicial review. When the Forfeiture Act is invoked,
 the individual loses all his worldly possessions, including
 business, financial holdings, and personal possessions.
 Invocation of the Act against an individual does not extend to
 the family.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 At any given time there may be numerous detainees held without
 charge who have been arrested arbitrarily for real or
 perceived offenses against the party or Government. A Malawi
 resident (including Africans and those of Asian extraction)
 may be picked up almost at the whim of the authorities, held
 for varying lengths of time, beaten, and released after
 several weeks or months. The usual cause for such treatment
 is suspected disloyalty to the President or expression of
 views which differ even slightly from the accepted norm.
 Rarely are those so detained charged officially and brought
 before either traditional or modern courts. A suspect,
 however, may be held without charge for a long period of time
 while authorities develop a case. It is impossible to
 estimate the number of arbitrary detentions and arrests made
 in Malawi in 1984.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Those charged with criminal offenses are tried in either the
 traditional or modern court system, depending on the nature of
 the charge. Those charged under the military codes of justice
 are tried in military courts. Lawyers usually are not
 permitted to assist the defendant in traditional court cases,
 but legal counsel is permitted in the modern court system. In
 the latter case, the defendant has the right of access to
 counsel before and during the judicial proceeding. Government
 and party exert little control over the trial system in cases
 tried before the High Court or magistrate courts; hence, the
 
 
 201
 MALAWI
 modern judiciary is almost totally independent of the
 executive branch, other than the fact that the President
 appoints the Chief Justice of the High Court who, in turn,
 appoints other modern court justices. These courts are open
 to the public, and defendants are charged publicly.
 Traditional court justices are appointed directly by the
 President. It is generally believed that there is little
 executive interference in traditional court cases dealing in
 matters of customary law, and there is no evidence of indirect
 executive pressure on traditional courts adjudicating cases of
 a political nature. Although the decision is that of the
 Director of Public Prosecution or the Attorney General, the
 recent trend indicates that political cases are likely to be
 tried before a traditional court. There is a right to appeal
 in both the modern and traditional court systems.
 On May 6, 1983, a traditional court found former Minister of
 Justice and captured leader of the banned Malawi Freedom
 Movement, Orton Chirwa, and his wife Vera guilty of treason
 for conspiring to overthrow the Malawi Government. In
 February 1984, the National Traditional Court of Appeals
 upheld the verdicts, which carried mandatory death sentences.
 Subsequently, in June 1984, the President commuted the death
 sentences to life imprisonment. The Chirwa case has generated
 considerable attention in the United States and other
 countries, with many charging that the Chirwas had not received
 a fair trial.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In private life, the average citizen or alien resident is not
 unduly affected by government authority. Malawi law calls for
 the issuance of individual warrants before entry of the home,
 but this is not always observed in practice. Police and
 paramilitary groups enter houses of suspects at will under
 special entry authority to conduct searches for people or
 incriminating evidence. Other violations of the home
 generally do not occur. Membership in the only political
 party is not mandatory but is expected of those who aspire to
 government/party positions or even professional success.
 Access to government services, and even to some non-government
 services, such as a local market, is frequently based upon
 party membership. There is both official and self-
 censorship. Correspondence is monitored (mail is opened and
 read) by the authorities and those violating prescribed norms
 are punished.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Criticism of the Government and its policies is not
 tolerated. This proscription extends even to the Parliament,
 where the expression of total loyalty to the President and his
 Government is both expected and enforced under threat of
 expulsion or worse. All media are under direct or indirect
 government control. The two newspapers and sole radio station
 disseminate news directly authorized by the government
 information agency and operate under informal self-censorship
 guidelines. Recently both media have exhibited increasing
 candor in coverage of international issues. In practice, the
 principal focus of government censorship is on material deemed
 critical of the Government. Freedom of inquiry into the
 
 
 202
 MALAWI
 natural and social sciences exists at the university level,
 and includes examination of political ideologies at radical
 variance with those of the Government, provided this does not
 extend to explicit criticism of the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Individuals and organizations generally are free to meet and
 associate as long as the purpose is not to protest against
 government or party policy or practices. Professional,
 fraternal, and service organizations exist and are encouraged
 by the Government. No political meetings are permitted other
 than those of the party. Labor unions exist, but their
 activities are highly circumscribed and they are generally
 ineffective. Strikes are not legally prohibited but rarely
 occur, and when they do they are not publicized. Labor unions
 fall under the umbrella of the Malawi Trade Union Congress,
 which in turn is subject to direction by the Ministry of
 Labor. With government permission and supervision, the trade
 union organization associates with international
 organizations, and the Malawi Trades Union Congress is a
 member of both the Organization of African Trade Union Unity
 and of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
 While the labor movement has yet to achieve major gains for
 its constituents, the principal explanation is economic rather
 than political: the economy of Malawi can sustain only a
 small number of wage earners, most of whom occupy positions as
 unskilled laborers on large estate farms.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is relative freedom of religion in Malawi (for all but
 Jehovah's Witnesses) as long as particular religious tenets do
 not preclude recognition of the temporal authority of the
 state. The Watch Tower Sect is banned; the Government
 considers the Sect's activities to be disruptive of *the
 prevailing calm, law, and order." There is no state or
 preferred religion, and conversion from one religion to
 another is permitted. There are no restrictions on religious
 observances and ceremonies which do not impinge on government
 authority. Religious groups may establish places of worship
 and train clergy. There is no licensing of religious groups,
 but their publications, like all others, are subject to
 government censorship. Religious groups are free to establish
 and maintain links with coreligionists in other countries, and
 religious travel may be undertaken. Similarly, missionaries
 from abroad are permitted to enter Malawi and proselytize.
 There is no tie between a particular religion and the Malawi
 Congress Party.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Few restrictions have been observed on movement within Malawi,
 but denial of passports to some on political grounds
 frequently extends to family members of persons in political
 disfavor and to those persons whom the Government suspects may
 prove embarrassing to it when traveling abroad. Legal
 provisions exist for restricting the movement of those
 convicted of political or criminal offenses. Formal
 emigration is neither restricted nor encouraged. With the
 exception of a small group of political dissidents, there is
 no outward flow of Malawian refugees from the country.
 Expatriates born in Malawi may return. Citizenship may be
 
 
 203
 MALAWI
 revoked but in practice this is not done. Malawi does not
 accord official refugee status, but has treated de facto
 refugees from neighboring countries generously, and has
 pursued a policy of persuading rather than coercing such
 refugees to return to their own lands. Asian residents and
 citizens are free to travel within the country, but must
 reside and work in one of three urban areas (Lilongwe, Zomba
 and Blantyre/Limbe). Within some of these urban centers,
 strict rules governing where Asians may own property result in
 limitations on where they may reside. Asian residents,
 whether Malawian citizens or not, have been compelled to
 transfer ownership of rural shops and trucking businesses to
 ethnic African Malawian citizens. Asians are free to expand
 into other areas of business, however, and industrial licenses
 for new Asian industries are routinely granted.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights% The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Malawi is ruled by one man, the Life President, through the
 apparatus of the sole political party and government, which
 are closely linked. Decisions are taken either directly by
 the President or those few closely associated with him. No
 opposition political parties or movements are permitted. One
 must be a party member to participate in the political life of
 the nation, to be a member of Parliament, or to be a civil
 servant. Nearly half of the population has at least nominal
 party membership, but active party membership is obligatory if
 one aspires to higher levels of leadership. This prescription
 does not apply to the military per se, but adherence to party
 policy and directives is expected of all. The party's
 pervasiveness and broad based structure provide for some
 choice among candidates for party, parliamentary, and other
 offices. For example, as was the case in the 1983 election,
 there are often three candidates for election to a
 parliamentary constituency, but all nominees are selected by
 the party and submitted to the President for vetting. Active
 campaigning is not permitted. The National Assembly
 (Parliament) consists of both elected and nominated members
 and is mainly concerned with ratifying government policy. Its
 powers are broadly based in law but highly circumscribed in
 practice.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government does not permit organizations such as the
 International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty
 International to conduct investigations. No non-governmental
 organizations devoted to the furtherance of human rights are
 permitted to exist. Expressions of interest in alleged human
 rights problems by outside groups or individuals are not
 welcomed and usually are ignored. Few in government are even
 willing to discuss the subject of human rights. In its 1984
 Report Amnesty International continued to express concern
 about the use of detention without trial and the lack of
 effective safeguards against ill-treatment of political
 detainees. Freedom House considers Malawi "not free.-
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Malawi is a small, densely-populated, landlocked country,
 whose principal assets are moderately fertile soils, good
 
 
 204
 MALAWI
 water resources, and a climate favorable to crop production.
 Possessing no significant mineral resources, Malawi has
 pursued a successful export-oriented agricultural growth
 strategy since independence. The estate sector produces tea,
 tobacco, and sugar for export, while smallholders cultivate
 maize and to a lesser extent, tobacco, cotton, and
 vegetables. In recent years the country has been
 self-sufficient in food production and has exported surplus
 maize to its neighbors.
 Malawi's small manufacturing sector is devoted principally to
 the processing of agricultural products; in addition, there
 are a few small import-substitution projects. Over 90 percent
 of the workforce is still engaged in subsistence agriculture.
 Wage levels are low, reflecting the abundance of unskilled
 labor, and the Government's desire to limit the rural-urban
 income gap and hence the rate of internal migration.
 Malawi achieved an impressive record of economic growth from
 independence in 1964 through 1979: real GDP grew at an
 average rate of 5.5 percent per annum over this period. Since
 the mid-seventies, however, the country has experienced
 mounting balance of payments problems and an interruption in
 economic growth, due to such factors as escalation in import
 prices of fuel and capital goods; cyclical swings in the
 prices of agricultural exports--tea, tobacco, and sugar; and
 interruptions and resulting higher costs of transport in
 traditional rail routes to the Indian Ocean. With assistance
 from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, the
 Government has embarked on an ambitious structural adjustment
 program, including currency devaluation and agricultural
 pricing reform, aimed at restoring economic growth and
 achieving a sustainable balance of payments position.
 Despite the strides made since independence, Malawi remains
 one of the world's least developed countries. Per capita GNP
 in 1982 measured only $213, reflecting the absence of any
 appreciable mineral or manufacturing base in the economy.
 Primary school enrollment has climbed dramatically since
 independence, with the 1980 enrollment ratio of school-age
 children estimated at 83 percent (male 95 percent, female 70
 percent), and the adult literacy rate is estimated to be 25
 percent. Health indicators likewise testify to the limited
 resources available for this sector: life expectancy at birth
 is 45 years and the infant mortality rate is 129 per 1000 live
 births; about 29 percent of the rural population and 70
 percent of the urban population have access to safe water
 supplies (1976). Calorie supply is about 95 percent of
 requirements (1977).
 Malawi's current population of 6.8 million people is growing
 at an estimated annual rate of 3.3 percent. With nearly all
 of Malawi's arable land already under cultivation, substantial
 increases in yields will be necessary to feed the ever-growing
 population.
 As mothers, women have enjoyed a high degree of access to the
 traditional health services and to extension programs geared
 toward improving women's homemaking abilities. Such programs,
 while beneficial, have failed to recognize the important role
 women play as agricultural producers in the rural sector
 (roughly 70 percent of all smallholder farming and over 50
 percent of subsistence holdings are headed by women) and the
 potential role women can have in the modern sector. Although
 
 
 205
 MALAWI
 males still have a comparative advantage in terms of
 educational and employment opportunities, the Government has
 initiated sufficiently broad-scale programs to begin to
 rectify the discrimination which exists. A third of the
 positions in the public education system have been reserved
 for women.
 Women are entitled to party membership and voting rights, and
 hold 13 of 101 elected seats in Parliament. No women hold
 ministerial-level appointments. Within Malawi's traditional
 and primarily matrilineal tribal leadership structures, there
 are several small ethnic groups wherein women possess fewer
 rights and privileges and where female circumcision
 occasionally is practiced.
 Malawi enjoys a considerable degree of ethnolinguistic
 uniformity. Ethnic and regional differences exist but have
 not been a disruptive element within the society. The vast
 majority of the population speaks and/or understands Chichewa,
 which became the national language in 1968. However, English
 is the official language for government and business.
 Malawi's indigenous groups are sufficiently alike in culture
 and social organization to permit relatively easy interaction,
 including intermarriage, mixing in agricultural settlements,
 and mixed grouping for political purposes.
