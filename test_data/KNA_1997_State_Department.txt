 ST. KITTS AND NEVIS
 St. Kitts and Nevis is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy and a member of
 the Commonwealth of Nations. The Constitution provides the smaller island of
 Nevis considerable self- government, as well as the right to secede from the Federa-
 tion in accordance with certain enumerated procedures. The Government comprises
 a prime minister, a cabinet, and a bicameral legislative assembly. The Governor
 General, appointed by the British Monarch, is the titular head of state, with largely
 ceremonial powers. After national elections in June 1995, Dr. Denzil Douglas of the
 St. Kitts and Nevis Labour Party became Prime Minister and formed a government
 with 7 of 11 seats in the legislature. The judiciary is independent.
 Security forces consist of a small police force, which includes a 50-erson Special
 Services Unit that receives some light infantry training, a coast guard and a small,
 newly formed defense force.
 The mixed economy is based on sugar cane, tourism, and light industry. Most
 commercial enterprises are privately owned, but the sugar industry and 85 percent
 of arable land are owned by a state corporation. Per capita gross domestic product
 was about $5 400 in 1995.
 Human rights were generally respected. Poor prison conditions, apparent intimi-
 dation of witnesses and jurors, government restrictions on opposition access to gov-
 ernment-controlled media, and violence against women were the principal problems.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no political or other
 extraiudicial killings.
 b. Tisappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Deqrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 Law enforcement authorities abide by the constitutional prohibitions against the use
 of torture or other forms of inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Family
 members, attorneys, and clergy are permitted to visit detainees regularly.
 Prison conditions are poor. St. Kitt's prison was built in the 1830's. Prisoners suf-
 fer from severe overcrowding, poor food, and lax security. These conditions have con-
 tributed to riots in the past, although none occurred in 1997.
 The Government permits prison visits by independent human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest and detention, and this provision is respected in practice. The law requires that
 persons detained be brought fore a court within 48 hours.
 There were no reported cases of exile.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the judiciary is highly regarded. However, intimidation of witnesses and
 potential intimidation of jurors in high-profile drug-related cases threatened this
 traditional independence.
 The court system comprises one high court and four magistrate's courts at the
 local level, with the right of appeal to the Eastern Caribbean Court of Appeal. Final
 appeal may be made to the Privy Council in the United Kingdom. There are no mili-
 tary or political courts. Legal assistance is available for indigent defendants.
 The Constitution provides that every person accused of a crime must receive a
 fair, speedy, and public trial, and these requirements are generally observed.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-There
 were no reports of arbitrary government or police interference in the private lives
 of individuals. The law requires judicially issued warrants to search private homes.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and the press, and, for the most part, the authorities respected these provisions in
 practice. However, the Government owns the only radio and television station on St.
 Kitts, and these media generally did not adequately publicize rallies and conven-
 tions held by the oppsition political party. There is a religious television station
 and a-privately owned radio station on Nevis.
 St. Kitts and Nevis does not have a daily newspaper; each of the major political
 parties publishes a weekly or biweekly newspaper. A third weekly newspaper is
 
 
 642
 nonpartisan. The papers are free to criticize the Government and do so regularly
 and vigorously. The nonpartisan paper claims that politicians both in opposition and
 the Government have threatened to close it down; however, the paper recently cele-
 brated its second anniversary without interruption of its publication. International
 news publications are readily available.
 The Government does not restrict academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 the right of peaceful assembly. Political parties organized demonstrations, rallies,
 and public meetings during the 1995 election campaign without signficant govern-
 ment interference. Many meetings sponsored by the Nevis Island administration
 and opposition parties were held in Nevis to discuss the secession question.
 The Constitution provides for the right of association, and the Government re-
 spects this right in practice.
 c. Freedom of-Religion.-The Constitution provides for the free exercise of religion,
 and religious practices are not restricted. All groups are free to maintain links with
 coreligionists in other countries.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Government does not restrict travel within or departure from the
 country.
 No formal government policy toward refugee or asylum requests exists. The issue
 of provision of first asylum did not arise. There were no reports of forced expulsion
 of anyone having a valid claim to refugee status; however, government practice re-
 mains undefined.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Citizens are free to change their government by peaceful means. A vigorous
 multiparty political system exists in which political parties are free to conduct their
 activities. Periodic elections are held in which all citizens 18 years of age and older
 may register and vote by secret ballot.
 The Legislative Assembly has 11 elected seats; 8 for St. Kitts and 3 for Nevis.
 In the June 1995 elections, Dr. Denzil Douglas' St. Kitts and Nevis Labour Party
 won seven of eight seats at stake in St. Kitts with 60 percent of the popular vote,
 and Douglas became Prime Minister. The People's Action Movement (PAM), the
 former ruling party, took only one seat, but received 40 percent of the vote. The
 Concerned Citizens Movement won two of the three Nevis seats; the Nevis Reforma-
 tion Party won the remaining one. The island of Nevis has considerable self-govern-
 ment and its own legislature.
 In accordance with its rights under the Constitution, the Nevis Island Assembly
 in 1996 initiated steps towards secession from the Federation. After failing to obtain
 the required two-thirds majority of the five-seat Assembly in 1996, a secession bill
 was reintroduced following the elections, and passed its first reading in June. The
 bill must clear a second and third reading before it is approved. Should the bill be
 approved, a new constitution would have to be drafted, followed by an islandwide
 referendum on secession in which two-thirds of the votes cast would have to favor
 secession. All parties involved have adhered to constitutional procedures, and no
 acts of violence have been recorded in connection with the secession question.
 Although the Constitution prohibits discrimination on grounds of political opinion
 or affiliation, the opposition PAM alleges widespread employment discrimination by
 the St. Kitts and Nevis Labour Party against public sector employment of persons
 perceived to be opposition supporters. PAM alleges that the ruling party dismissed
 or demoted many PAM supporters from their jobs in order to replace them with its
 own supporters. The Government acknowledged that it had withheld pension bene-
 fits from opposition members of Parliament voted out of office and entitled to such
 benefits.
 There are no impediments in law or in practice to the participation of women in
 leadership roles in government or political parties. St. Kitts and Nevis' sole female
 member of Parliament chose not to run for reelection in the June 1995 elections,
 and there were no other female candidates. However, women do hold such high gov-
 ernment offices as permanent secretary and are active within the political parties.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While there are no governmental restrictions, no local human rights groups have
 been formed. There were no requests for investigations or visits by international
 human rights groups.

 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on grounds of race, place of origin, birth
 out of wedlock, political opinion or affiliation, color, sex, or creed, and the Govern-
 ment generally respects these provisions in practice.
 Women.-According to a government official, violence against women is a problem,
 but many women are reluctant to file complaints or pursue them in the courts. De-
 spite this reluctance, there were publicly reported cases of both domestic violence
 and rape, and a few convictions. A special police unit works closely with the Min-
 istry of Women's Affairs and Health to investigate domestic violence and rape cases.
 The role of women in society is not restricted by law but is circumscribed by cul-
 ture and tradition. There is no overt societal discrimination against women in em-
 ployment, although sectoral analyses suggest that women do not yet occupy as many
 senior positions as men. An active Women's Affairs Bureau is promoting change in
 this area.
 Children.-The Government is committed to children's rights and wellfare and has
 incorporated most of the provisions of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the
 Child into domestic legislation.
 People With Disabilities.-Although ther'e is no legislation to protect the disabled
 or to mandate accessibility for them, the Government and the Constitution prohibit
 discriminatio  n n employment, education, and other state services.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution provides for the right of all work-
 ers to form and belong to trade unions. The law permits the police, civil service, and
 other organizations to have associations which serve as unions. The major labor
 union, the St. Kitts Trades and Labour Union, is affiliated with the St. Kitts and
 Nevis Labour Party and is active in all sectors of the economy. There is also an
 independent teachers' union, a union representing dockworkers in the capital city,
 and two taxi drivers' associations.
 The right to strike, while not specified by law, is well established and respected
 in practice. St. Kitts and Nevis joined the International Labor Organization in 1996
 and assumed all its obligations for enforcement of labor standards. There were no
 major strikes during the year.
 Unons are free to form federations or confederations and to affiliate with inter-
 national organizations. The islands' unions maintain a variety of international ties.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Labor unions are free to orga-
 nize and to negotiate for better wages and benefits for union members. The law pro-
 hibits antinion discrimination but does not-require employers found guilty to rehire
 employees fired due to antiunion discrimination. However, the employer must pay
 lost wages and arrange for severance pay. There is no legislation governing the or-
 ganization and representation of workers, and employers are not legally bound to
 recognize a union, but in practice employers do so if a majority of workers polled
 wish to organize. Collective bargaining takes place on a workplace by workplace
 basis, not industrywide. The Labor Commission mediates all types of disputes be-
 tween labor and management on an ad hoc basis. In practice, however, few disputes
 actually go to the Commission for resolution. If neither the Commission nor the
 Minister of Labor can resolve the dispute, legislation allows for a case to be brought
 before a civil court.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor-The Constitution forbids slavery
 and forced labor, and they do not occur in practice. While neither the Constitution
 nor law specifically addresses bonded labor, it has not been a problem in practice.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment-The 1966
 Employment of Children Ordinance outlaws slavery, servitude, and forced labor,
 and prescribes the minimum legal working age, which is 14 years. Although the law
 does not specifically address bonded labor (see Section 6.c.), it has not been a prob-
 lem in practice. The Labor Ministry relies heavily on school truant officers and the
 community affairs division to monitor compliance, which they do effectively. The law
 mandates compulsory education up to the age of 16.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work. A 1984 law, updated in 1994, establishes mini-
 mum wage rates for various categories of workers, such as domestic servants, retail
 employees, casino workers, and skilled workers. The minimum wage varies from
 $56.18 (EC$ 150) per week for full-time domestic workers to $74.91 (EC$ 200) per
 week for skilled workers. These provide an adequate, though Spartan, living for a
 wage earner and family; many workers supplement wages by keeping small animals
 such as goats and chickens. The Labor Commission undertakes regular wage inspec-
 
 
 644
 tions and special investigations when it receives complaints; it requires employers
 found in violation to pay ack wages.
 The law provides for a 40- to 44-hour workweek, but the common practice is 40
 hours in 5 days. Although not required by law, workers receive at least one 24-hour
 rest period per week. The law provides that workers receive a minimum annual va-
 cation of 14 working days. While there are no specific health and safety regulations,
 the Factories Law provides general health and safety guidance to Labor Ministry
 inspectors. The Labor Commissioner settles disputes over safety conditions. Workers
 have the right to report unsafe work environments without jeopardy to continued
 employment; inspectors then investigate such claims.
