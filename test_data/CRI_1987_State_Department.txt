 COSTA RICA
 Costa Rica has a strong democratic tradition. The Constitution
 of 1949 established a government of independent executive,
 legislative, and judicial branches. Free and fair elections
 for president and 57 deputies to the Legislative Assembly are
 held every 4 years. Oscar Arias was elected President in
 February 1986; approximately 80 percent of all eligible voters
 participated. Under the Constitution, the president may not
 be reelected. Members of the Legislative Assembly may be
 reelected but only after at least one term out of office. The
 ruling National Liberation Party (PLN) and the opposition
 Social Christian Unity Party (PUSC) control 29 and 25 seats
 respectively in the Legislative Assembly. Two rival Communist
 parties, which freely participate in the political process,
 hold two seats between them.
 The 1949 Constitution abolished Costa Rica's standing army.
 The country's small security forces are subject to strict
 civilian control. Police and national security functions are
 shared by the Ministry of Public Security's Civil Guard and
 the Ministry of Government's Rural Guard. The Judicial
 Police, charged with investigating crimes, report directly to
 the Supreme Court. These public security organizations have
 not been associated with human rights violations.
 The Constitution protects a person's right to hold private
 property. The private sector accounts for 70 percent of the
 gross national product. The Government is proceeding with
 efforts to sell several state companies to the private sector.
 Economic growth has resumed in recent years after the severe
 crisis of 1980-82. The Government is attempting to control
 inflation and unemployment and to relieve a serious housing
 shortage.
 Costa Rica maintained its excellent human rights record in
 1987. The Arias administration has expressed its strong
 commitment to the longstanding Costa Rican tradition of
 respect for human rights.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 Neither the Government nor any other official entity practices,
 abets, or condones political killing, and there were no reports
 of such killings.
 b. Disappearance
 There were no known or reported incidents of abductions, secret
 arrests, or persons held clandestinely by any agency of the
 Government.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 There were no known allegations of mistreatment. The
 Constitution states that "no one shall be submitted to cruel
 or degrading treatment or to life imprisonment. A statement
 obtained through violence shall have no value." These
 prohibitions are respected in practice. Prisoners generally
 receive humane treatment in Costa Rica.

 Section 2 ,Respect forCivil"Libeties, Includfing:
 a. Fkeeoto cif Speeli7 and Press'
 The Constitution specifically provides for freedom of speech
 and press. These freedoms are fully respected in. practice.
 Two Communist parties publish weekly newspapers, Three
 private newppapers, four priyate television stations, and
 severa l radio siatidrs pursu'" inaependent beitorial policies.
 The media -reely criticize the Government, There is'no
 evidence of self-censorship or intimidation. Terrorist
 activities hre fully reported.
 Foreign journalists have challenged a law reqiiring
 accreditat6ih by the goVernment-spoinsored Costa'Rican Nationial
 Journalists Association. The Organiz~tion of American States'
 Inter-American Court of Human.Rights declared in1985 that the
 law is incompatible with the Zreedom bf.infrmation prvisions
 of the InterAekican Human Rights Cbnvetidx.. '-The Government
 of Costa' Rgia has not yet officially responded to the Court's
 decision.'      -
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Constitution'l'provisions of freedom of assembly and
 association are fully respected in practice. The right of
 organized" labor to associate, as defined by the International
 Labor Organization, is fully honored. Unions are independent
 of government control and are free to maintain relations with
 recognized international'bo.dies such as the'Ipternational
 Confederatidn of Free Trade'Unions.
 
 
 438
 COSTA RICA
 Procedures for collective bargaining and arbitration of labor
 disputes are prescribed in law and followed in practice. The
 country's labor code states that when one-third of the workers
 in an operation are union members, the employer must conclude
 a collective agreement, if requested. The code also permits
 employees to set up permanent grievance committees to handle
 both individual and collective disputes.
 When labor disputes arise within the San Jose metropolitan
 area, the presiding judge of the Labor Tribunal attempts to
 find a settlement that is satisfactory to both labor and
 management. Labor inspectors handle disputes that occur
 outside the capital. If conciliation fails, the case is
 referred to a labor court which must provide legal sanction
 for a planned strike or lockout. Unions have complained that
 this process is complicated, time-consuming, and often
 fruitless. Public sector strikes are illegal.
 In late 1987, a weeklong strike involving three transportation
 unions caused estimated export losses of $6 million. Central
 issues were wages, retirement benefits, and relations between
 labor and management. There were two brief dockworkers'
 strikes earlier in the year. Both democratic and Communist
 unions frequently displayed their displeasure with price hikes
 and delays in salary increases by organizing peaceful
 demonstrations.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is provided for in the Constitution and
 observed in practice. Roman Catholicism is the official state
 religion. However, Costa Ricans affiliated with a wide range
 of religious groups participate without prejudice in the
 social and political life of the nation. A non-Catholic may
 be elected president of Costa Rica. Foreign missionaries and
 clergy of all denominations work and proselytize freely in
 Costa Rica. There are no restrictions on religious activity.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There are no unusual restrictions on travel within the country
 or abroad. Emigration is not restricted. A citizen's right
 of return is ensured. Costa Ricans and foreigners are free to
 live anywhere within the national boundaries. Costa Rica
 supports multinational refugee programs and has accepted many
 refugees from Central and South America. The continuing influx
 of Nicaraguan refugees has provoked government expressions of
 concern over strains on the economy and social fabric.
 The Constitution specifically prohibits the Government from
 repatriating any foreigner who may be subject to political
 persecution in his own country. Costa Rica has traditionally
 granted political asylum to exiled dissident groups of various
 political orientations. However, the Civil Guard reportedly
 refused entry on October 18 to hundreds of Nicaraguans who
 fled toward Costa Rican territory during a Sandinista-staged
 family reunion event at the Penas Blancas border station.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Costa Rica is an authentic democracy. The Constitution
 provides for a free, open, and competitive electoral system.
 Election results are always respected. The integrity of
 elections is ensured by the independent Supreme Electoral
 
 
 439
 COSTA RICA'
 Tribunal. No political party is outlawed or excluded from the
 electoral process; no party has dominated the affairs of the
 nation; no eligible voter is deterred from participating in
 elections; no ethnic, economic,.or other group dominates; no
 segment of the citizenry is excluded from the political
 process. The Legislative Assembly can and does reject
 executive branch initiatives. Citizens can and do petition
 their elected representatives for legislative redress and
 assistance with government bureaucracies.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There have been no requests for investigation of human rights
 abuses in Costa Rica. The country has traditionally been a
 strong suppOrter of international and private human rights
 organizations. The Inter-American Institute of Human Rights
 maintains its headquarters in San Jose. The Government has
 invited the Inter-American Human Rights Commission to visit
 the country whenever it wishes.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Costa Rica's population includes some 25,000 Indians, most of
 whom live in traditional communities on 19 reserves which,
 because of their remote location, often lack access to
 schools, health care, electricity, and potable water. The
 Government is attempting to improve the quality of basic
 services in the Indian communities. Indians participate in
 the management of their own affairs through the National
 Indian Commission. Nevertheless, some Indian leaders urge the
 Government to devote more resources to improving the welfare
 of the indigenous-population.
 The role of women, although still primarily domestic, is
 legally unrestricted. Although women and men in general are
 paid equally for equal work, women tend to occupy lower paying
 jobs. Nevertheless, women are represented in all professions,
 in high ranks of organized labor, in the private business
 sector, and in the Government. Women and minority groups
 participate freely in Costa Rica's elections. The nation's
 second Vice President, the Minister of Foreign Commerce, and
 the president of the Legislative Assembly are women.
 Costa Rica's population of 30,000 English-speaking blacks, who
 reside largely on the Caribbean coast, enjoy full rights of.-
 citizenship. The Government has special programs to improve
 the conditions of residents of depressed areas as well as
 other disadvantaged groups, and does not practice or condone
 discrimination in the economic, social, or cultural spheres.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The Constitution defines the normal hours of the workday,
 remuneration for overtime, days of rest, and annual vacation
 rights. It specifies compensation for discharge without due
 cause, the right to a minimum wage, and special protection for
 women and minors. The minimum working age is 12, with special
 regulations in force for workers under 15. A National Wage
 Board, composed of three members each from government,
 management, and labor, sets minimum wages and salaries for all
 sectors. While violations sometimes occur, these regulations
 are rigorously enforced.
 
 
 440
 COSTA RICA
 The Constitution sets normal work hours at 8 hours for daytime
 and 6 hours for nighttime work, with weekly totals of 48 and
 36 hours respectively. Ten-hour days are permitted for work
 not considered unhealthful or dangerous, but weekly totals may
 not exceed 48 hours. Nonagricultural workers receive an
 overtime premium of 50 percent of regular wages for work
 performed in excess of the daily work shift. Agricultural
 workers are not paid overtime if they voluntarily work beyond
 their normal hours.
 A 1967 law governs health and safety at the workplace.
 Industrial, agricultural, and commercial firms with 10 or more
 workers are required to have a joint safety committee. The
 law allows the Government to inspect workplaces and to fine
 employers for violations. However, a shortage of labor
 inspectors, especially outside of San Jose, limits the
 Government's ability to ensure that minimum conditions of
 safety and sanitation are maintained.
