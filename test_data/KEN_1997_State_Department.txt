 KENYA
 President Daniel Arap Moi won reelection in December in Kenya's second general
 elections since the restoration of multiparty politics in 1991. While observers consid-
 ered the elections imperfect, they concluded that the vote broadly reflected the popu-
 lar will. In addition to his role as President, Moi also commands the military serv-
 ices and controls the security, university, civil service, judiciary, and provincial, dis-
 trict, and local governance systems. The ruling party, the Kenya African National
 Union (KANU) has a slim majority of the unicameral National Assembly's 200 seats.
 The judiciary is subject to executive branch influence.
 The large internal security apparatus includes the Police Criminal Investigation
 Department (CID), the Directorate of Security and Intelligence (DSI), the National
 Police, the Administration Police (AP), and the paramilitary General Services Unit
 (GSU). The CID and the DSI investigate criminal activity and monitor persons
 whom the State considers subversive. Members of the security forces committed se-
 rious human rights abuses, and on a larger scale than in 1996.
 The economy includes a well-developed private sector in trade, light manufactur-
 ing, and finance. The large agricultural sector provides food for local consumption,
 substantial exports of coffee, tea, cut flowers, and vegetables, and ap proximately 70
 percent of total employment. Tourism remained the largest single foreign exchange
 earner, despite a major setback caused by ethnic violence along the coast in August
 and September. Drought, followed by floods kept upward pressure on food prices.
 Annual per capita gross domestic product is $270.
 
 
 Throughout the first 8 months of the year, the Government's human rights record
 deteriorated, with serious problems in many areas. Many aspects of the situation
 improved significantly in the last 4 months of the year, although human rights vio-
 lations continued to occur. Police continued to commit extrajudicial killings and to
 torture and beat detainees. They arbitrarily arrested and detained citizens (al-
 though not for political reasons after the enactment of the reforms), and held them
 for prolonged periods. Prison conditions remained life threatening. The judiciary was
 subject to executive branch influence, and several judges complained in public about
 executive interference in judicial affairs. Authorities infringed on citizens privacy
 rights. Through the spring and summer, as the tempo of political activity quickened,
 government harassment and intimidation of opponents significantly increased. The
 Government detained critics of the ruling party, including opposition parliamentar-
 ians, journalists, clergy, and human rights activists, for periods ranging from a few
 hours to several days. Government authorities severely limited freedom of speech,
 assembly, and association, and blocked opposition leaders' access to their supporters
 and to the electronic media. Journalists practiced some self-censorship. The Govern-
 ment deployed the National Youth Service (NYS), which traditionally has provided
 young Kenyans job training in exchange for several years of national civilian serv-
 ice, to block opposition political meetings. The number of disrupted opposition politi-
 cal meetings and civic education workshops in the first 8 months of the year rose
 sharply over 1996.
 Beginning in late September, however, there was a visible improvement in the
 human rights situation, as the bipartisan Interparties Parliamentary Group (IPPG)
 brokered a package of wide-ranging political reforms, which the Government en-
 acted in early November. These paved the way for a generally free campaign and
 credible, if imperfect, national elections at year's end. The results broadly reflected
 the popular will and marked a step forward in citizen's ability to change their gov-
 ernment peacefully, although their ability to do so has not yet been fully dem-
 onstrated at the presidential level. After denying registration to many political par-
 ties for several years, the Government finally acted on the applications and reg-
 istered 16 new parties. Government disruption of opposition and civic education
 meetings declined in September, then halted altogether-by mid-October.
 Discrimination against women and violence against women and children remained
 serious problems. Animosity against and among various ethnic groups continued,
 and there were a series of incidents involving ethnic violence on the coast in August
 and early September, causing at least 100 deaths. Mob violence also resulted in
 many deaths. After 12 years in operation, the Government's standing committee
 on human rights has yet to make public any of its reports or make a visible impact
 on the human rights situation. The Government arrested and prosecuted a number
 of police officers or abuses. It also directed police not to harass journalists or carry
 guns when covering public meetings. In February the Government acceded to the
 United Nations Convention Against Torture and directed police not to torture or
 beat detainees, albeit with limited results.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-Prior to September, security forces
 continued to use lethal force frequently and committed extrajudicial killings. Accord-
 ing to government figures, police killed 94 suspected criminals in 1997. The non-
 governmental Kenyan Human Rights Commission (KHRC) reported that police
 killed 123 people in the period from January through September, including at least
 12 by torture. Human rights groups criticized police "recklessness" and eagerness
 to open fire, as well as the Government's failure to take appropriate action against
 most policemen responsible for killings. Hundreds of prisoners died in custody due
 to life threatening prison conditions, including inadequate food and medical treat-
 ment (see Section 1.c.).
 In February Administration Police in Migori shot and killed Frederick Adhiambo.
 The police report stated that the police opened fire when Adhiambo charged them
 with a knife, a claim contradicted by the local KHRC monitor who reported that
 Adhiambo was shot in the head inside his house. In March Nairobi police shot and
 killed Anthony Chege Muthoni, a student scheduled to enter the University of
 Nairobi.
 The same month University of Nairobi student leader Solomon Muruli died in a
 mysterious fire in his dormitory room. A week before his death, Muruli positively
 identified a senior police officer as one of the men who abducted and tortured him
 in November 1996. Shortly before his death, he received a letter threatening his life
 
 
 160
 if he proceeded to identify police officers in connection with his abduction. The pub-
 lic inquest into Muruli's death is continuing.
 While the majority of the police killings occurred during the pursuit of criminal
 suspects, a number involved innocent bystanders. In January Brother Larry
 Timmons, a Catholic monk, was shot and killed by two Administration Police offi-
 cers responding to an alleged robbery in Njoro near Nakuru. Police initially de-
 scribed the incident as an accident, but church officials termed the incident "sus-
 picious," noting that Timmons had recently confronted local government officials
 over corruption.
 There are indications that some of the people who died in police custody were vic-
 tims of torture. These included Moses Macharia Gicheru in Pangani, Ali Hussein
 Ali in Wajir, and Lomurodo Amodoi in Lokichoggio (see Section 1.c.). According to
 credible accounts, the notorious Makuyu "flying squad" police unit tortured a num-
 ber of detainees, several of whom died, including Joseph Mwangi Muiruri, Irungu
 Kimani Noah Njuguna Ndung'u, Joseph Ndunj'u Njoroge, James Gitau Kuanju,
 and Julius Mwangi Njoroge. There were also credible reports that security forces
 beat and brutalized citizens in the Likoni and Kwale areas of the coast, in connec-
 tion with searches for the raiders who perpetrated ethnic attacks in August and
 September. Reportedly, several of these victims were beaten to death (see Section
 1.c.). -
 Police investigated some extrajudicial killings by security forces, and several po-
 lice officers faced prosecution. According to the Attorney General's office, at least 15
 police officers were charged with brutality, excessive force, and wrongful killing in
 1997. In the course of the year, a police officer was charged with murder in the
 deatl of Anthony Chege Muthoni, and police constable Francis Kimanzi Mabaya
 was charged with the murder of Brother Timmons. The Government charged 11 po-
 lice officers with murder in the December 1996 death of 2 Kenyatta University stu-
 dents, and 3 police officers and 1 army corporal with murder in the June death of
 Ali Hussein Ali. After the latter four men were discharged by the court in October,
 the Government opened an inquest file and the first public inquest is scheduled for
 February 1998. The inquest into the July 1995 death from torture of Rosemary
 Nyambura finished, and the magistrate recommended that the police officers re-
 sponsible be arrested and charged with murder. The Government also launched in-
 quests into the following deaths in police custod: Moses Macharia Gicheru in
 Pangani, John Kibuki Kanini in Lari, and Lomurdo Amodoi in Lokichoggio. In re-
 sponse to a KHRC quer, the Government launched an inquest into the November
 1996 death of Francis  unahi from torture while in pin Nyang'ori. In-
 quests into the 1996 police killing of Egerton University student Festo Etaba
 Okona and the 1996 death in police custody of Amodoi Achakar Anamilem are con-
 tinuing, and an inquest into the 1996 death in police custody of Francis Munahi is
 scheduled to open January19981
 There have, however, been no effective police investigations into many cases of
 extrajudicial killing. There have, for example, been no investigations of the deaths
 in police custody of Joseph Mwangi Muirri, Irngu Kimani, Noah Niuguna, and
 Julius Mwangi Nioroge. Police made no arrests in connection with the deaths of 14
 civilians during proreform rallies on July 7 ("Saba Saba") in several cities. A num-
 ber of these individuals are known to have died at the hands of police. The Govern-
 ment announced public inquests into the fatal shootings of Paul Njore Macharia and
 student David Kanuni Mutugi in Thika, and four people in Nyahurur on July 7.
 According to an eyewitness, a police woman shot Mutugi at point blank range as
 he knelt pleading before her. The authorities usually explain that the lack of inves-
 tigation of extrajudicial killings is because no official complaint has been filed. But
 the form required for filing complaints is available only at police stations, which are
 often "out" of the forms or not forthcoming in providing them. There is also consid-
 erable skepticism of a process that assigns the investigation of police abuse to the
 police itself.
 Prior to September, KANU youthwingers perpetrated a number of violent attacks,
 some involving fatalities. Human rights activists charge that the youthwingers were
 operating with tacit or explicit police approval, and several cases lend credence to
 this charge. All but one of the KANU youthwingers who beat Evans Baraza Obango
 to death in a Nairobi slum in March were released by the police; an investigation
 into the incident was completed and the file was forwarded to the Attorney General
 for action. Prior to the IPPG initiative, President Moi and other KANU leaders
 called upon KANU youthwingers on a number of occasions to help the police put
 down prreform rallies or threatened that the youthwingers would prevent rallies.
 There were also cases, however, in which the police intervened to protect opposition
 and  nongovernmental organization   (NGO) leaders from    attacks by KANU
 youthwingers, particularly in the last 4 months of the year.
 
 
 There was a major outbreak of ethnic-targeted violence along the coast in August
 and early September, resulting in at least 100 deaths and thousands of people flee-
 ing to safe havens in Mombasa or inland. Most of the victims were immigrants from
 upcountry Kenya who had settled along the coast, and the attacks reflected indige-
 nous ethnic animosity and economic discontent toward the upcountry settlers. How-
 ever, there were indications that the violence had political roots, with local KANU
 political leaders reportedly involved in the planning. The efforts of security forces
 to contain the violence were slow and piecemeal, allowing the violence and the exo-
 dus of refugees to continue for many weeks.
 Deadly attacks and revenge counterattacks occurred frequently between Pokots
 and Marakwets, Turkanas and Samburus, and Maasais and Kisiis. There were also
 incidents of ethnic-targeted violence and killing in Isiolo, Meru/Nyambene, Garissa,
 and Klgoris. In early 1997, the KHRC published a special report, "The Forgotten
 People, which detailed a series of raids from Ethiopia into Kenya involving pillage,
 rape and torture at the hands of tribal bandits and Ethiopian army troops who en-
 tered Kenya searching for fleeing Ethiopian rebels.
 Mob violence increased during the year. Human rights observers attribute this to
 lack of confidence in the police and the judicial process. The KHRC documented 99
 deaths by mob violence in the period from January through September, compared
 with 95 deaths by mob violence in the whole of 1996. "Mob justice" most often is
 inflicted on individuals suspected of criminal activities. Occasionally strangers or so-
 cial misfits were targets. The Government condemned the practice of mob justice
 and arrested and charged 358 people in court with participating in incidents of mob
 violence.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution states that "no one shall be subject to torture or degrading punish-
 ment or other treatment." However, security forces continued to use torture as a
 method of interrogation and to punish both pretrial detainees and convicted pris-
 oners. On February 11, the Government acceded to the U.N. Convention Against
 Torture, although it denied that torture was a problem in Kenya, apart from iso-
 lated instances. Several days later, Commissioner of Police Duncan Wachira di-
 rected police not to beat suspects during interrogation. Despite the Commissioner's
 directive, however, the use of physical violence by the security forces and credible
 reports of police abuse and torture continued. The KHRC reported at least 55 cases
 of torture by police in the first 9 months of 1997. In 12 instances, police torture re-
 sulted in death (see Section L.a.).
 In January police tortured Yusuf Haji who reported that four policemen whipped
 him in the Kibera section of Nairobi in the presence of the Provincial Commissioner.
 In February, 15 people charged with robbery in Kibera told the court that they had
 been tortured in police custody. In March eight people charged with theft in Nairobi
 told the court that they had been tortured by police. Mandera primary school teach-
 er Mohammed Abdi Aden reported that he had been tortured by police for failing
 to produce a national identification card on demand. A number of the approximately
 200 people arrested in connection with an August 8 proreform rally that turned vio-
 lent, resulting in four deaths, reported that they were subjected to torture, starva-
 tion, and inadequate medical attention in Kaniti maximum security prison in
 Nairobi. Other reported cases of police torture included Charles Ritho Gicheru in
 Nyeri in August, a 17-year-old student named Mugeti in Kisii in August, and James
 Kobi Masagala in Thika in September. There were credible reports that police tor-
 tured several people arrested in connection with the outbreak of ethnic violence on
 the coast during the summer. Police also reportedly abuse street children (see Sec-
 tion 5).
 Security forces used excessive force to break up several proconstitutional reform
 rallies in Nairobi from May to August. They fired tear gas into crowds and beat par-
 ticipants and bystanders at random. Police also beat journalists (see Sections 1.d.
 and 2.a.). Police deployed in the Likoni and Kwale areas of Coast province to stem
 ethnic violence there engaged in random beatings of local people, causing several
 deaths. There are credible reports that the police also committed several rapes (see
 Section 1.d.).
 During the year the Government investigated some allegations of police torture
 and prosecuted some members of the police. Three police constables were sentenced
 to 10 years in prison for torturing prisoner Charles Ireri in Embu in 1994; two po-
 licemen were arrested and charged in the January 1994 detention and torture of
 Truphena Obwaka Shirako in Langas in Uasin Gishu District, but no verdict has
 been reached yet. Human rights activist Josephine Nyawira Ngengi has filed suit
 against the Government claiming damages for illegal confinement, torture, and har-
 assment by Nakuru police in 1994. In November Police Commissioner Wachira dis-
 
 
 1banded the notorious Makuyu "flying squad" police unit (see Section L.a.) that re-
 pbte dly'frequently beat and tortured detainees, often demanding bribes. (At year's
 envhowever, area Members of Parliament stated that only two police officers had
 been transferred, while the other 28 continued working in Makuyu.) There has,
 however, been no officil investigation into the reported torture of Jane Wambui and
 Virginia Nyambura Wambui in Xikuyu Town in December 1995, although the two
 wmen had the charge of robbery against them dismissed on the grounds they had
 beea torture.
 Prison conditions are often life threatening, due both to a lack of resources and
 to the Gvernment's unwillingness to address deficiencies in the penal system. Pris-
 oners are subjected to severe overcrowding, inadequate water, poor diet, sub-
 standard bedding, and deficient health care. According to the Government, 631 pris-
 oners died in jais during the year, due chiefly to anemia, heart attack, malaria, ty-
 phoid fever, dysentery, tuberculosis, and AIDS. The country's 78 prisons are se-
 verely overcrowded, averaging 30 percent above holding capacity with a daily aver-
 age of 34,775 inmates in 1996. Some facilities, such as the Nairobi Remand Prison,
 are overcrowded by several hundred percent. In late 1996, the Government released
 over 4,000 prisoners imprisoned on lesser charges to alleviate prison overcrowding.
 Rape of both male andfemale inmates is a serious problem, as is the growing inci-
 dence of AIDS. Disease is widespread in prisons and the death rate is high. Prisons
 do not have resident doctors, and only one prison had a doctor permanently as-
 signed. In January prisoners held in Kamiti Maximum Prison refused to appear in
 court because they had been barred from seeing their attorneys and were being de-
 nied food ahd medicine. Prisoners are sometimes kept in solitary confinement far
 longer than the maximum 90 days allowed by law. Prisoners and detainees report
 that they are frequently denied the right to contact their relatives or lawyers. Pris-
 oners are subjected to torture and inhuman treatment by police.
 Officially, men, women, and children are kept in separate cells. However, there
 are reports of men and women being placed in cells together, and youths (as young
 as early teenagers) are frequently kept in cells with adults in overcrowded prisons
 and remand centers.
 The Government does not permit independent monitoring of prison conditions.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-Despite constitutional protections, police
 continued to arbitrarily arrest and detain citizens. The Constitution provides that
 persons arrested or detained shall be brought before a court within 24 hours in non-
 capital offenses and 14 days in capital cases. A 1993 amendment to the Penal Code
 excludes weekends and holidays from this 14-day period. The law does not stipulate
 the period within which the trial of a charged suspect must be gin. Suspects are
 often held for weeks, even months, before being brought to court. The Government
 has acknowledged cases in which persons have been held in pretrial detention for
 several years. Persons arrested and charged are statutorily allowed access to their
 families and attorney, however, this right is often not honored. Prisoners may be
 visited by family members and attorneys only at the discretion of the State. This
 privilege is often denied. For those who have been charged, it is often possible to
 be released on bail with a bend or guarantees of return.
 The parliamentary reforms passed in November repealed the detention without
 trial provisions of the Preservation of Public Security Act (PSA), the provision under
 which particularly troublesome political activists had been imprisoned in years past.
 The reforms also greatly reduced the powers of local officials called chiefs under the
 Chiefs' Act (formerly Chiefs' Authority Act). The authority of chiefs to restrict move-
 ment of people was repealed and, while they still have the power to detain people,
 they must take them immediately 'to the nearest police station." The reforms also
 repealed the Vagrancy and Outlying Districts Acts, whose broad discretionary pow-
 ers had been used to detain people or restrict movement.
 The Task Force on the Reform of Penal Laws and Procedures, created by the At-
 trney General in 1993, submitted its final report to the Attorney General in De-
 cember. The report recommended seven new bills to reform the criminal justice sys-
 tem.
 Through the first 8 months of the year, security forces continued to harass, follow,
 inconvenience, and occasionally briefly detain opposition Members of Parliament
 (M.P.'s), NGO officials, clergy, journalists, and other government critics. The detain-
 ees were usually held for several hours then released without charge. In a few cases,
 they were held for weeks or months. One KANU dissident experienced an escalating
 pattern of harassment, which began when his business was "staked out" by police
 officers, and there was minor vandalism to his property. This escalated to attacks
 on patrons of his hotel, and death threats against his family, and culminated with
 the resurrection of a 1994 criminal case against him. The charges were dropped
 when he withdrew his dissident candidacy. He then encountered further threats and
 
 
 intimidation when he ran opposite President Moi in the December 1997 parliamen-
 tary race.
 Harassment of political and human rights activists in the first 8 months of 1997
 functioned to criminalize opposition political positions and human rights advocacy
 (see Section 4). In February police charged into and clubbed Safina activists, jour-
 nalists, and members of the Release Political Prisoners (RPP) pressure group in a
 market town near Nyeri. In April Kitui police surrounded the home of opposition
 presidential candidate Charity Ngilu and kept her blockaded inside overnight (see
 Section 2.b.). Following the outbreak of ethnic violence on the coast in August, police
 arrested KHRC investigator Alamin Mazrui, Safina founder Khelef A. Khalifa, and
 National Democratic Union leader Ali S. Chizondo, releasing them on bond several
 days later. Harassment of opposition and human rights activists, however, dimin-
 ished greatly with passage of the IPPG-brkered reforms.
 The KI-RC charged plie and security forces with abetting disorder in the far
 north districts of Masbit and Moyale. Polie arbitrarily arrested and tortured citi-
 zens, especially members of the Borana tribe, in the course of their efforts to repress
 banditr in the border region over the past several years.
 The Governmient does not use formal exile as a means of political control. It did,
 however, prevent Sheik Khalid Balala, a self-styled leader of the unregistered Is-
 lamic Party of Kenya (IPK), from returning to enya in 1994, and then effectively
 kept him in exile in Germany for 3 years.ln July the Government allowed Balala
 to return to Kenya.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Tria!.-Although the Constitution provides for an inde-
 endent judiciary, it is subject to executive branch influence in practice. The Presi-
 dent has extensive powers over appointments, including those of Chief Justice, At-
 torney General, and Appeal and High Court judges. The President can also dismiss
 judges and the Attorney General upon the recommendation of a special presi-
 dentially appointed tribunal. Judges do not have life tenure and serve on a contract
 basis.
 The court system consists of a Court of Appeals, a High Court, and 2 levels of
 magistrates' courts, where most criminal and civil cases originate. The Chief Justice
 is a member of both the Court of Appeals and the High Court, which undercuts the
 principle of judicial review. President Moi's appointment of Zacchaeus Chesoni in
 December as Kenya's Chief Justice raised widespread protest among legal experts,
 who argued that the lack of independence Chesoni displayed as Chairman of the
 Kenya Electoral Commission did not augur well for the prospects of judicial inde-
 pendence.
 Statements by President Moi on matters before the courts are a major problem
 plaguing the judicial system. They are often tantamount to interference with the
 independence of the judiciary. For example, in 1997 President Moi directed the
 courts not to "interfere" in internal KANU party matters. Another problem is the
 power that the Constitution gives the Attorney General to discontinue proceedings
 in private prosecution cases. Attorney General Amos Wako has argued that citizens
 must first notify his office before initiating private prosecution. He has used this au-
 thority on a number of occasions to terminate cases against government officials.
 On several occasions, judges spoke out and sought to assert judicial independence.
 In March the Chairman of the Kenya Magistrates' and Judges' Association publicly
 criticized government interference in the judiciary and restrictions imposed on the
 freedom of association of magistrates and judges. A Nairbi judge overruled Presi-
 dent Moi's February directive to the courts not to entertain disputes arising within
 political parties. These two justices have not been transferred or otherwise nega-
 tively affected by their public statements. In the past, judges who made public criti-
 cisms or issued rulings against the Government have been punished with transfer
 to isolated places or nonrenewal of their contracts.
 Customary law is used as a guide in civil matters affecting persons of the same
 ethnic group so long as it does not conflict with statutory law. Civilians are tried
 publicly although some testimony may be given in closed session. Jud es hear all
 cases; there is no jury system. There is a presumption of innocence, anddefendants
 have the right to attend their trial, to confront witnesses, and to present witnesses
 and evidence. Civilians can also appeal a verdict to the High Court and ultimately
 to the Court of Appeals. Military personnel are tried by military courts-martial, and
 verdicts may be appealed through military court channels. The Chief Justice ap-
 points attorneys for military personnel on a case-by-case basis.
 Defendants do not have the right to government-provided legal counsel, except in
 capital cases. For lesser charges, free legal aid is not usually available outside
 Nairobi. As a result, poor people without an attorney may be convicted for lack of
 an articulate defense. Although defendants have access to an attorney in advance
 of trial, defense lawyers do not always have access to government-held evidence,
 
 
 since the Government can plead the state security secrets clause as a basis for with-
 holding evidence. The Government raised court fees for filing and hearing cases by
 severa hundred percent in 1995. The daily rate for arguing a case before a judge,
 for example, rose from $10 to $50; out of reach for most citizens.
 Critics of the Government-politicians, journalists, lawyers, students-have been
 harassed through abuse of the legal process. In a study of the judiciary published
 in early 1997, the International Bar Association concluded that there has been "a
 persistent and deliberate misuse of the legal system for the purpose of harassing
 opponents and critics of the Government." Many opposition M.P.'s, student leaders,
 and human rights activists have one or more court cases hanging over their heads,
 often for months or even years.
 The Government did not hold any political prisoners at year's end. In January the
 Government released on bail the last two of the three prisoners in the well known
 human rights case of Koigi Wa Wamwere. Koigi and his two associates had been
 denied a fair judicial process in their 1993 conviction on apparently politically moti-
 vated charges of armed robbery. In October the KHRC and the Pelease Political
 Prisoners organization presented the Attorney General with a list of 774 persons
 they claimed were political prisoners, either imprisoned or out on bail pending trial
 on sedition or related political cases. Among these were James Apny Adhiambo,
 convicted of participation in a 1982 failed coup attempt, and the "Koigi Three" de-
 fendants. In December the Government released Apiny and dropped all charges
 against the Koigi Three.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-Al-
 though the Constittion provides that "no person shall be subjected to the search
 of his person or his property or the entry by others on his premises," it permits
 searches without warrants "o promote the public benefit." The Police Act permits
 police to enter a home forcibly if the time required to obtain a search warrant would
 "prejudice" their investigation. Although security officers generally obtain search
 warrants, they occasionally conduct searches without warrants to apprehend sus-
 pected criminals or to seize property believed to be stolen.
 Prior to September, security forces closely monitored the activities of dissidents.
 They followed and otherwise harassed a number of them. Security forces employ
 various means of surveillance, including a network of informants to monitor the ac-
 tivities of oppsition politicians and human rights advocates. Opposition leaders,
 students, and others report that the Government targets them with surveillance,
 telephone wiretaps, and interference with written correspondence. One leader of the
 constitutional reform movement, for example, frequently changed his place of resi-
 dence to avoid surveillance. In March seven leaders from various universities in-
 formed the press that they were being stalked and threatened by government secu-
 rity forces.
 Although citizens are free to choose their political affiliations, the Government
 discourages civil servants from membership in opposition parties.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Although the Constitution provides for freedom
 of speech and of the ress, the Government has interpreted broadly several existing
 colonial-era laws to mit free expression (see Section 1.d.). It has used these laws
 to disperse opposition rallies andto prevent speakers from criticizing the Govern-
 ment. Some indepenent periodicals Teport that the business community is under
 pressure from the Government to refrain from advertising in their magazines, push-
 ing some to the ede of insolvency. The court conviction in June of the independent
 weekly, The People for defaming an adviser to the President, and the accompanying
 awardf a record 180,000 (10 million shillings) in damages, sent fear through the
 independent press. A High Court judge, however, set aside the award in November,
 requiring the publication to pay only court costs. In September Nakurn police de-
 tained Joseph Kainki, editor of the Rift Valley Times, and held him incommunicado
 for4daysbecause ofa report in hispapercritical of thesamepresidential advisor.
 In spite of these pressures, the press, civic organizations, and the opposition con-
 tinued to present their views to the public, particularly in the print media. However,
 government pressure leads journalists to practice some self-censorship.
 On the whole, however, the prin me ia remained candid and independent, de-
 spite continued government pressure and harassment. Weekly newspapers and mag-
 azines, many openly critical of the Government, have substantial audiences. The
 p  t media include three daily newspapers that report on national politics. The
 argest newspaper, The Nation, is independent and publishes articles critical of gov-
 einernment policies. The second largest newspaper, East African Standard, is con-
 trolled by an investment group with close ties to the Government and the ruling
 KANU party. Despite the new management's pledge to maintain the newspaper's
 
 
 independent editorial policy, it has evolved into a tabloid that is less critical of the
 Government. The third daily newspaper, Kenya Times, reflects KANU party views.
 According to members of the independent press, relations between the press and
 the Government have greatly improved in recent years. Even when government offi-
 cials have requested the independent press to suppress damaging articles, the final
 decision has been left to the editors. While the traditional taboos surrounding the
 President and, to a lesser extent, his family remain in effect, political cartoons pic-
 turing President Moi, often in a negative light, appear frequently in the independent
 press. Nevertheless, newspaper and magazine editors continued to be subjected to
 varying degrees of government pressure to censor themselves, particularly regarding
 President M oi's family and corruption involving his advisers.
 There were a number of instances of overt harassment and occasional detention
 of journalists in the first 8 months of the year, which dropped off dramatically in
 the last 4 months. In January police disrupted what they called an "illegal" press
 conference called by Democratic Party leaders to protest denial of campaign meeting
 licenses. In February police seized Nation photographer Susan Musoke as she was
 photographing delays and extortion in the issuing of new identity cards and held
 her for 2 hours before releasing her. The same month, police beat up two Daily Na-
 tion reporters in Mathara, a suburb of Nairobi, for photographing identity card reg-
 istration. In March Police Commissioner Wachira directed police not to harass jour-
 nalists. There were, nevertheless, further incidents of police harassment of journal-
 ists. GSU troops beat two journalists covering the ethnic violence in Likoni in Au-
 gust. The September-October parliamentary reform dialog and legislation noticeably
 improved the behavior of security forces toward journalists.
 The Government maintains a near monopoly over the electronic broadcast media
 through tight control of broadcasting-particulary radio, the principal news me-
 dium for most Kenyans. It controls the Kena Broadcasting Corporation (KBC),
 which operates the country's premier radio, broadcast television, and cable tele-
 vision networks. KBC stations do not criticize the Government and give a large
 share of news time to government or KANU party functions and scant coverage to
 opposition activities. KANU supporters also own two other television networks-
 Kenya Television Network (KTN), which airs news programs with somewhat more
 balanced political coverage, and Stellavision (STV). KTN which provided the only ef-
 fort at balanced television news coverage, is limited to the Nairobi metropolitan
 area. But even this limited openness is now threatened by the purchase of KTN late
 in the yearby the Standard Newspaper Group, which is sympathetic to the Govern-
 ment.
 The Government, moreover continued to delay action on numerous radio and tele-
 vision license applications. The Ministry of Information explains that it is waiting
 for the recommendations on media liberalization from the Attorney General's task
 force on press law. That task force is now into its fourth year with no sign of any
 recommendations. There was some movement on radio licensing during the year.
 The Government granted broadcast licenses to Royal Media Services (owned by a
 leading KANU supporter), the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), Universal
 Entertainment, and Kitcom Africa. However, it ignored more than 50 outstanding
 radio and television applications, many of long standing. The Nation Newspaper
 Group, the most respected media organization in Kenya, has been waiting almost
 6 years for a license to go into the broadcast media, highlighting the arbitrariness
 of the broadcast licensing process.
 The government monopoly of the broadcast media fosters unbalanced and unfair
 reporting. This monopoly severely limited the opposition's ability to communicate
 with the electorate, since the KBCis the only source of current information for most
 Kenyans outside the Nairobi area. An indicator of the Government's tight control
 over the broadcast media was the suspension of two KTN news editors for over 2
 months for showing footage of police beating people in their homes and in a church
 during the July 7 prreform rally. In September the two men were reinstated, but
 in different positions.
 The parliamentary reforms passed in early November somewhat improved the
 outlook for freedom of speech and the press. In November, the chairman of the Elec-
 toral Commission directed the KBC to accord equal treatment to all political parties
 and to provide all registered parties participating in the cam ai  25 minutes of
 free radio and television broadcast time. Although the KBC slightly increased its
 coverage of the opposition during the election campaign, access by political parties
 to KBC remained heavily biased in favor of KAN and President Moi. Moreover,
 the KBC coverage of the opposition was generally negative, whereas it was uni-
 formly positive towards KANU.
 Representatives of the international media are generally free to operate. The Gov-
 ernment complains that its hospitality to foreign correspondents indirectly worsens
 
 
 166
 Kenya's national image because foreign journalists write so many negative articles
 about other countries that bear a Nairobi dateline. However, in September Presi-
 dent Moi met informally with the local and international press for the first time in
 memory in an effort to improve relations.
 The Government continued its ban on 30 books and publications on grounds of
 sedition or immorality. These included "Development Agenda," Kenneth Matiba's
 "Return to Reason," "The Quotations of Chairman Mao Tse Tung," and Salmon
 Rushdie's "Satanic Verses," and the Catholic periodical, Inooro. However, the par-
 liamentary reforms eliminated sedition as a ground for censorship of publications,
 and they called for the creation of a board to review the decision to prohibit these
 publications and to review any future ban on publications.
 Despite constitutional provisions for free speech, academic freedom is cir-
 cumscribed by both schoor administrators and security forces. Administrators and
 police frequently take harsh action against even peaceful student demonstrations,
 whther over political or bread-and-butter issues, forcefully dispersing and some-
 times arresting students. Student leaders report that they are sometimes followed
 and even threatened by government security forces (see Sections .e. and 1.f.). A
 number of student activists have been expelled from universities in recent years be-
 cause of political activities, and most have been refused readmission.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly, although the Government's use of the Public Order Act, which
 gave the authorities power to controlpublic gatherings, seriously restricted this
 right for many years. The act prohibited meetings or processions of10 or more per-
 sons without a license from the District Commissioner. Through the first 8 months
 of the year, the Government continued to restrict the right of peaceful assembly by
 refusing to license, or by forcefully disrupting, opposition political meetings and civic
 education workshops sponsored by churches and NGO's.
 Continuing an increase in disruptions in the last quarter of 1996, the number of
 meetings blocked or disrupted by the Government surged in the first 8 months of
 the year. The Government continued to approve few applications by opposition par-
 liamentarians to hold political meetings, effectively blocking them from meeting
 with their constituents. Their applications were either routinely denied as a "threat
 to security," or just not acted on. Police disrupted a large number of opposition polit-
 ical meetings, including by-election campaign rallies in January and March. In Feb-
 ruary police charged into and beat upa group of Safina party activists in a market-
 place near Nyeri. Over a single weekend in April, police disrupted three separate
 meetings by opposition leaders Raila Odinga, Charity Ngilu, and Kijana Wamalwa,
 shooting and seriously wounding Wamalwa s bodyguard.
 Ruling KANU party leaders, on the other hand, had no trouble obtaining meeting
 licenses. They usually do not even bother to apply for licenses, since the police do
 not interfere with their meetings even without a license. The few KANU meeting
 license applications refused, or meetings disrupted, were those of KANU leaders
 critical of, or at odds with, the national party leadership.
 The Government also blocked a series of constitutional reform rallies and meet-
 ings. Security forces broke up rallies in Nairobi on May 3 and 31, June 1 and 19,
 and July 7, the last resulting in 14 deaths (see Section L.a.). The Government de-
 ployed the National Youth Service (NYS), which traditionally has provided young
 Kenyans job training in exchange for several years of national civilian service, to
 block opposition political meetings. The Government blocked a proreform rally on
 Madaraa y, rune 1, by placing all the reform leaders it could find under house
 arrest. In the face of increasing domestic and international criticism, the Govern-
 ment then allowed two reform rallies to proceed, one in Mombasa on July 21 and
 one at Uhuru Park in Nairobi on August 8. The latter turned violent leaving four
 persons dead, including two policemen.
 Following domestic and international criticism of the spate of disruptions in April,
 Police Commissioner Wachira warned that police who misused firearms at political
 gatherings would be punished "according to the law." A few days later, Minister of
 State Kalweo announced that police covering public functions would bear only clubs
 and tear gas, not guns. Two administration policemen were detained and charged
 in the Wamalwa shooting. Following the enactment of the parliamentary reforms in
 November, Commissioner Wachira directed the police to remain neutral in the elec-
 tion campaign and offered round-the-clock police protection to all presidential can-
 didates. Both of these directives were effectively implemented and markedly im-
 proved the election atmosphere.
 One of the November reforms was revision of the controversial Public Order Act,
 replacing the requirement that public meetings must be licensed with a simplified
 requirement that organizers merely notify the local police of planned meetings. The
 revision expressly excluded "meet the people" tours by politicians from the notifica-
 
 
 167
 tion requirement and provided that only a senior police officer could halt a meeting
 on the grounds of "clear, present or imminent danger of a breach of the peace or
 public order.
 Prior to enactment of the IPPG reforms, the Government repeatedly criticized
 NGO's and the concept of civic education, accusing NGO's of engaging in covert ac-
 tivities and questioning their patriotism because of their foreign funding. Civic edu-
 cation, President Moi declared, is unnecessary in Kenya. The Government gave form
 to this hostility in a February circular directing local officials that NGO's sponsoring
 civic education are "a threat to the security of the state and their activities must
 be curtailed." The authorities disrupted numerous civic education workshops
 through the spring and summer. In April the Catholic Church protested the contin-
 ued government "harassment and intimidation" of its civic education workshops in
 Turkana District.
 Meeting disruptions began to taper off after the IPPG started its reform dialogue
 at the end of August. In Septhmer police blocked four opposition political meetings
 and three civic education meetings, and in October three opposition political meet-
 ings and two civic education meetings. They allowed many other meetings to take
 p lace in various plaes around the country. Following passage of parliamentary re-
 forms in early November, the    re very few government disruptions of opposition
 and civic education meetings, police interventions largely involved potentially vio-
 lent situations.
 The Government used the Societies Act to restrict freedom of association. The act
 requires every association to be registered or to be exempted from registration by-
 the Registrar of Societies. For the past 3 years, however, the Government refused
 to act on a number of political party registration applications. However, in Novem-
 ber following passage of the parliamentary reforms, the Government finally acted
 on pending part applications, increasing the number of registered political parties
 from 12 to 26. me are tiny, inactive groups, others such as Safina are potentially
 major parties. The Islamic Party of Kenya (lPK), however, remained unregistered.
 The party is challenging the 1994 denial of registration in the courts.
 At mid-year, a shadowy group, "Jeshi La Mzee" ("the old man's army), surfaced
 whose purpose was apparently to harass reformers calling for significant constitu-
 tional  anes.   e group was active in disrupting severalproconstitutional reform
 rallies in Nairobi. Rformers charged that Jeshi La Mzee was a "terrorist gang" re-
 cruited and paid by KANU leaders to attack reform rallies. The group has been in-
 active since early August.
 NGO's are registered by the Government NGO Coordination Board under the
 NGO Act. The Government has used this structure to _put pressure on the non-
 governmental National NGO Council. In July it directed the Council to compile a
 list of "political NGO's," presumably to carry out President Moi's threat of
 deregistering all "political NGO's. When the Council refused, the President threat-
 ened to withdraw its operating permit, accusing it of diverting funds intended for
 civic education to finance subversive organizations. The Government did not carry
 out this threat.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government does not infringe on religious activities, except to require registration
 by new churches.
 The Government did interfere with some activities sponsored by churches, notably
 civic education, which it perceived as disguised support for opposition political par-
 ties. In the first 8 months of the year, the authorities disrupted numerous civic edu
 cation workshops sponsored by the Catholic Church and the National Council of
 Churches of Kenya (NCCK), the major Protestant umbrella organization (see Sec-
 tion 2.b.).
 On July 7, pursuing demonstrators who had taken refuge inside security forces
 stormed All Saints Cathedral in Nairobi. They beat the demonstrators. After origi-
 nally denying that the incident occurred, the police later apologized. This desecra-
 tion was, however, a product of government intolerance of political dissent, not of
 religious persecution.
 d. Freeom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-By law, citizens may travel freely within the country. However, the es-
 tablishment of security zones during the 1992 elections and again following ethnic
 clashes in 1993, restricted the ability of many citizens to travel in large parts of
 Kenya. In the first 8 months of 1997, opposition leaders were blocked on a number
 of occasions from visiting, or forced to leave, certain locations. In May, for example,
 KANU youthwingers roughed up opposition leader Raila Odinga in Kapsabet and
 forced him to flee, while police stood by and watched. President Moi stated in April
 that no opposition politicians should "dare step into Rift Valley," stirring fears that
 st      zones" closed to the opposition would be restored.
 
 
 168
 Many of the rural people displaced by the violent ethnic clashes in Rift Valley in
 1991-93 have still not returned to their homes and remain displaced in urban areas.
 Late in the year, the Government made some efforts in the Molo area (northern Rift
 Valley) to regularize land ownership for some of the displaced there. Many of the
 thousands of people displaced by the violence in Coast Province in the late summer
 remained afraid to return to their homes because of a fear of renewed violence.
 (Voter turnout in Likoni was less than 37 percent, the lowest in the country.)
 The Government does not restrict emigration or foreign travel. However, the law
 requires a woman to obtain her husband's or father's permission in order to obtain
 a passport (see Section 5). Civil servants must get government permission for inter-
 national travel, which is normally granted.
 The Government offers first asylum and provided it to the approximately 180,000
 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)-registered refugees
 who live in official camps. An undetermined number of refugees live outside camps
 in cities and rural areas. Somalis account for about 80 percent of the total refugee
 population, followed by a large number of Sudanese, and a scattered number of
 other nationalities from across the region. A total of less than 2,700 refugees, mostly
 Ethiopians, were repatriated in 1997.
 At the direction of the Government, the UNHCR took steps to close the three refu-
 gee camps near the coastal city of Mombasa. Two of these camps were effectively
 closed in August and some 7,000 people living there moved, against their expressed
 wishes, to camps near the Somali and Sudanese borders. Many of the refugees in
 the remaining Mombasa camp have registered to return to Somalia rather than re-
 locate to another camp in Kenya. However, this repatriation has not yet occurred,
 and significant numbers of people in this camp appear likely ultimately to accept
 relocation within Kenya.
 In July the authorities began rounding up hundreds of refugees and other aliens
 in urban areas. During these roundups, police often detained any African foreign na-
 tional they happened across regardless of whether the person had proper docu-
 mentation or not. Entire families were picked up, treated roughly during arrest, and
 then kept in detention for days or sometimes weeks under harsh conditions. The
 treatment of these detainees improved somewhat following foreign embassy and
 UNHCR intervention. However, the arrests continued, albeit at a much slower pace.
 The position of refugees and improperly documented aliens became even more pre-
 carious when, on September 6, President Moi criticized refugees for abusing Kenya's
 hospitality and verbally ordered the UNHCR to remove all refugees from the coun-
 try. A few days later, the Government told the UNHCR it had 1 month to remove
 all refugees. However, President Moi subsequently relaxed his order to expel refu-
 gees from the country, suspended the roundup of aliens, and established a mecha-
 nism for direct communication between his office and the UNHCR.
 The law provides for the granting of asylum or refugee status in accordance with
 the standards of the 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and
 its 1967 Protocol. Nevertheless, when over 400,000 refugees fleeing civil strife and
 drought arrived from the neighboring countries of Somalia, Sudan, Ethiopia, and
 Uganda in 1991, the Government suspended indefinitely the process by which it
 ruled on applications for refugee status or asylum. Since then, a handful of affluent
 individuals have effectively purchased de facto convention status, but for practical
 purposes, an official asylum or refugee application process no longer exists. Con-
 sequently, resettlement is not an option.
 Incidents of rape of women and young girls in refugee camps continued to occur,
 though police attention to the problem slightly improved this situation. Acts of vio-
 lence, including carjackings and banditry, still occur with frequency in the camps
 and the Dadaab area (near the Somali border), which sometimes led to the injury
 or death of some refugees and police. Late in the year, flooding displaced 20,000 of
 the refugees in these camps.
 Despite the apparent hardening of the Government's policy toward refugees, there
 were no reports of expulsions from the country of those having a valid claim to refu-
 gee status. However, early in the year, the Government moved forcefully to prevent
 a mass wave of persons fleeing drought conditions in Somalia from crossing the bor-
 der. Once this flow of potential refugees was halted, the Government invited the
 UNHCR and other humanitarian organizations to provide assistance in place to
 these individuals. The Government followed the same procedure when a similar sit-
 uation occurred in late 1996.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 through free and fair multiparty elections, although their ability to do so has not
 
 
 169
 yet been fully demonstrated at the presidential level. The December 29 presidential
 election, despite numerous logistical and other flaws, generally reflected the will of
 the peopie.he e 1997 presidential and parliamentary elections were marked by
 much less violence and intimidation than the 1992 polls, and by less fraud, and
 other irregularities. Opposition candidates won 60 percent of the vote, but these
 votes were split among four main and several fringe parties, thereby giving XANUJ
 a maority of seats in Parliament and President Moi a mandate to dominate the po-
 litical rocess for another 5 years.
 At the local level, the President exercises sweeping power over the political struc-
 ture. The President appoints both the powerful provincial and district commis-
 sioners and a multitude of district and village officials. In past elections, many local
 officials actively assisted the ruling KANU. However, in the December elections
 there was a real effort to delink provincial government officials from the campaign
 and polling processes. Before the campaign began, the Government issued instruc-
 tions enjoining provincial and local officials from partisan involvement; nearly all
 local government and security officials adhered to these directives.
 At the national level, the Constitution authorizes the President to dissolve the
 legislature and prohibits debate on issues under consideration by the courts. This
 law, in conjunction with a ruling by the Speaker of the Assembly that the Presi-
 dent's conduct is inappropriate for parliamentary debate, has limited the scope of
 deliberation on controversial political issues. M.P.'s are entitled to introduce legisla-
 tion, but in practice it is the Attorney General who does so. As the head of KANU,
 which now controls a slim majority of parliament seats, the President is also able
 to influence significantly the legislative agenda.
 Government harassment and intimidation of the political opposition significantly
 increased in the first 8 months of 1997, but the last 4 months of the year saw a
 marked easing of this interference. Although the government monopoly of the elec-
 tronic media prevented opposition parties from reaching television and radio audi-
 ences, this situation improved somewhat towards the end of the year, as the par-
 liamentary reforms mandated more evenhanded coverage of opposition activities
 (see Section 2.a.). In the first 8 months of the year, the licensing provision of the
 Public Order Act prevented opposition leaders from meeting their supporters, and
 the Government's use of other colonial-era sedition laws restricted freedom of ex-
 j ression (see Sections 2.a. and 2.b.). The IPPG reforms ameliorated somewhat the
 ack of statutory independence of the presidentially appointed Electoral Commis-
 sion, which oversees elections, by nearly doubling its size. The President appointed
 the new members from a list proposed by opposition parties. However the opposition
 continued to charge that voter constituencies were gerrymandered in favor of
 KANU.
 The two-step process of new national identity card issuance, followed by voter reg-
 istration, was flawed. The process of applying for the new generation identity card
 went relatively well; about 11 million of the 13.3 million eligible citizens, i.e., age
 18 and above, applied before the close of the application process in February. Actual
 issuance of the new cards, however, was often very slow and sometimes occurred
 months after the application.
 The voter registration drive in May-June registered slightly more than 9 million
 people. There were, however, numerous inefficiencies in the process, including reg-
 istration sites running ut of application forms and cards issued with errors. There
 were, moreover, widespread and credible allegations of bribery in the registration
 process. In addition, hundreds of thousands of young people who had reached the
 voting age of 18 were unable to register to vote. Because they were too young to
 have received ulder model identity cards and because of the inefficiency of the new
 card issuance, they did not receive their new cards before voter registration closed.
 Possession of an old or a new model card was a prerequisite for voter registration.
 This disenfranchisement is widely seen as a result of inefficiency rather than politi-
 cally inspired, although there were claims that many youths were denied identifica-
 tion cards for ethnic and political reasons (see Section 5).
 The violence that erupted along the coast in August (see Section L.a.) was eth-
 nically targeted against "upcountry" immigrants who tend to vote for the opposition.
 The violence, reportedly organized in part by local KANU politicians, probably effec-
 tively disenfranchised large numbers of opposition supporters.
 The 3-week presidential and parliamentary campaigns in December were largely
 free of government interference. Election meetings occurred without hindrance, and
 most local government nfficials kept their distance from the campaign. Although
 there were numerous problems with ballot distribution on the December 29-30 elec-
 tion days, the voting for president largely reflected the will of the people. The over-
 whelming majority-95 percent-of the 210 parliamentary elections likewise appear
 
 
 170
 to have reflected the popular will, although there-were credible reports of vote rig-
 ging in 10 to 12 constituencies.
 Although there are no legal restrictions traditional attitudes circumscribe the role
 of women in politics,. Women are seriously underrepresented at decisionmaking lev-
 els in the Government. The new Parliament elected on December 29 included four
 female M.P.'s, down from seven in the last Parliament. Within the opposition,
 women figure most prominently in the Democratic Party and the Social Democratic
 Party. A group of women in Nairobi formed the Women's Political Caucus early in
 the year to lobby for issues of concern to women and to increase the influence of
 women on government policy. A parliamentary proposal that one-third of the par-
 liamentary seats be reserved for women was defeated in April. The IPPG reform leg-
 islation requires that half of the nominations for the 12 nominated M.P.'s be women.
 Members of all tribal and ethnic gups participate in the political process. How-
 ever, since white paleontologist Richard Leakey announced his involvement in the
 Safina party in 1995, President Moi has repeatedly cautioned against the participa-
 tion of white Kenyans in political activities. (Nonetheless, one white Kenyan was
 reelected as an M.P. on a KANU ticket in this year's election.) Numerous tribes-
 including the Kisii, Meru, Embu, Kamba, Kikuyu, Taita, Kalenjin, Luhya, Turkana,
 Maasai, Giriama, Luo, and Somali-are represented in the President's Cabinet. (Sig-
 nificantly, two of the largest tribes-the Kikuyu and the Luo-were excluded.) How-
 ever, the President reportedly relies on an inner circle of advisers, drawn mostly
 from his Kalenjin tribe. There is widespread anti-Asian sentiment, which some op-
 position political leaders have sought to use for their own ends (see Section 5).
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There is a growing number of human rights organizations in Kenya. These in-
 clude the KHRC, the Kenya Antirape Organization, the Legal Advice Center, the
 Catholic Justice and Peace Commission, the Protestant NCCK, the Release Political
 Prisoners pressure group, and the Center for Governance and Develepment (CGD).
 There is aIso an array of legal organizations, including the Public Law Institute, the
 Law Society of Kenya (LSK), the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ/Kenya),
 and the International Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA/Kenya), that are con-
 cerned with human rights.                          /
 NGO's and some oppsition parties maintain comprehensive files on human rights
 abuses. The Kenya Social Congress (KSC) Party has /published several detailed
 studies of human rights violations in Nyanza Province. The Safina party tracks
 extrajudicial violence and disruption of opposition political meetings. A number of
 attorneys represent the poor and human rights defendants without compensation,
 though they can meet only a small percentage of the need and are largely con-
 centrated in urban areas.
 The KHRC produces a "Qua terly Repression Report" cataloging the human rights
 situation in the country, as Well as a steady stream of special reports. It organizes
 activities to publicize special causes, such as its campaign against police killing. The
 Institute for Education in Democracy (IED) land other NGO's monitor elections in
 cooperation with the Electoral Commission. The IED, along with the Catholic
 Church and the Protestant NCCK, monitored the sequential steps in the electoral
 process, including identity card registration, voter registration, election monitor
 training, media access, and the dctual elections (nomination of candidates, cam-
 paign, and polling day).
 Prior to agreement on the IPPG reform package, the Government's relations with
 human rights groups, domestic and international, were poor. It regularly criticized
 human rights organizations and other NGO's and disrupted their meetings and
 workshops. Police disrupted the launch of the KH-RC's campaign against plice kill-
 ing in January (see Section 2.b.). The following month,  licemen kicke  dbeat
 up a KHRC monitor in Nairobi for collecting signatures for a petition against police
 violence. In August Mombasa police detained KHRC bard member Professor
 Alamin Mazrui in connection with the outbreak of ethnic violence on the coast (see
 Section 1.d.).
 While the Government often criticized domestic and international human rights
 NGO's, it also made some efforts to reach out and engage them. It allowed human
 rights organizations to witness autopsies of several persons who had died in police
 custody. In August it issued a formal response to Amnesty International's Memoran-
 dum of Concern over the Kenyan human rights situation issued in May. Amnesty
 International welcomed the dialog with the Government but still expressed "serious
 concerns about the human rights situation in Kenya." During an August visit, Am-
 nesty International discussed the human rights situation with numerous senior gov-
 ernment officials. The Attorney Genera's Office responded in detail to foreign em-
 
 
 171
 bassies' human rights inquiries. The Electoral Commission facilitated the March
 visit of the U.S.-based International Foundation for Election Systems to analyze the
 electoral system.
 The Government Standing Committee on Human Rights established in May 1996
 has maintained a low profile and kept its distance from most pressing human rights
 problems. After a year and a half, it has not made any public report of its findings
 or activities. The 10-member committee is empowered to "investigate alleged viola-
 tions of constitutional freedoms," including abuse of power by public officials. It is
 tasked with drafting recommendations on human rights problems and providing
 these to the government agencies under whose purview the problems fall. The com-
 mittee presented its first report to President Moi in November 1996, but details of
 the report have not been made public.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of a person's "race, tribe,
 place of origin or residence or other local connection, political opinions, color, or
 creed." However, the authorities did not effectively enforce all these provisions.
 Women.-Violence against women is a serious and widespread problem. The num-
 ber of rapes reported to police has increased from 1,274 in 1993 to 1,455 in 1995
 and 1,020 in the first 6 months of 1996. KHRC figures on assaults on women and
 girls rose from 4,580 in 1994 to 4,889 in 1995 and 3,674 in the first half of 1996.
 The available statistics probably underreport the number of incidents, however,
 since social mores deter women from going outside their families or ethnic groups
 to report sexual abuse.
 The Government has condemned violence against women, and the law carries
 penalties of up to life imprisonment for rape. Still, the rate of prosecution remains
 low because of cultural inhibitions against publicly discussing sex, the fear of ret-
 ribution, the disinclination of police to intervene in domestic disputes, and the un-
 availability of doctors who might otherwise provide the necessary evidence for con-
 viction. Furthermore, wife beating is prevalent and largely condoned by much of
 Kenyan society. Traditional culture permits a man to discipline his wife by physical
 means and is ambivalent about the seriousness of spousal rape. There were contin-
 ued incidents of rape of refugee Somali women at the Dadaab camps, where women
 were assaulted outside camp perimeters in the course of gathering firewood.
 Women experience a wide range of discriminatory practices, limiting their politi-
 cal and economic rights and relegating them to second class citizenship. The Con-
 stitution extends equal protection of rights and freedoms to men and women, but
 long lacked a specific prohibition of discrimination on grounds of gender. This was
 corrected by theparliamentary reforms of November, which amended the Constitu-
 tion to include discrimination on the grounds of gender as one of the Constitu-
 tionally prohibited forms of discrimination. Constitutional provisions on citizenship,
 however, continue to discriminate against women by allowin men, but not women,
 to automatically bequeath citizenship to their children. Whi~e the Government has
 ratified international conventions on women's rights, it has not passed domestic en-
 abling legislation. The task force on laws relating to women, established by the At-
 torney Gneral in 1993, has yet to make its report.
 Levels of education and literacy are widely different for men and women. The
 number of boys and girls in school is roughly equal at the primary level, and then
 becomes increasingly disproportionate until men outnumber women almost 2 to 1
 in higher education. Literate men significantly outnumber literate women.
 Women continue to face both legal and actual discrimination in other areas. For
 example, a woman, is legally required to obtain the consent of her husband or father
 before obtaining a national identity card or a passport. In practice, a woman must
 also have her husband's or father's approval to secure a bank loan. Women can le-
 gally work at night only in the export processing zones (EPZ's). According to pension
 law, a widow loses her work pension upon remarriage, whereas a man does not.
 The Law of Succession, which governs inheritance rights, provides for equal con-
 sideration of male and female children. In practice, most inheritance problems do
 not come before the courts. Women are often excluded from inheritance settlements
 or given smaller shares than male claimants. A widow, moreover, cannot be the sole
 administrator of her husband's estate unless she has her children's consent.
 Women have long dominated agricultural work in terms of numbers of laborers,
 and they have become more active in urban small business. Still, the average
 monthly income of women is about 37 percent lower than that of men. Not only do
 women have difficulty moving into nontraditional fields, they are also promoted
 more slowly than men and bear the brunt of job retrenchments. Societal discrimina-
 tion is most apparent in rural areas, where women account for 75 percent of the
 
 
 agricultural work force. Rural families are more reluctant to invest in educating
 girls than in educating boys, especially at the higher levels.
 The nation's best known women's rights and welfare organization, Maendeleo Ya
 Wanawake (Development of Women in Kiswahili) was established as a nonpolitical
 NGO during the colonial era, but now operates under the close supervision of the
 Government. A growing number of women's organizations are active in the field of
 women's rights, including FIDA, the National Council of Women of Kenya, the Na-
 tional Commission on the Status of Women, the Education Center for Women in De-
 mocracy, and the League of Kenyan Women Voters.
 Children.-The system of free education in the early years of Kenya's independ-
 ence (1963) has given way to a "cost-sharing" education system in which students
 pay both tuition and other costs. These are a heavy burden on most families. While
 there is mandatory schooling for all up to grade 12, there is a very high dropout
 rate in part because of the heavy educational expenses. Moreover, the shortage of
 schools also obviates the legally required universal schooling. The health care sys-
 tem for school children, which once provided periodic medical checkups and free
 milk, now appears to be completely defunct.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM) which is widely condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is practiced
 by certain ethnic groups and remains widespread, particularly in rural areas.
 Health officials estimate that as many as 50 percent of females nationwide have suf-
 fered FGM. According to Maendeleo Ya Wanawake, the percentage is as high as 80
 to 90 percent in some districts of the Eastern, Nyanza, and Rift Valley provinces.
 FGM is usually performed at an early age. President Moi has issued two presi-
 dential decrees banning FGM, and the Government prohibits government-controlled
 hospitals and clinics from practicing it. So far, however, there is no law banning
 FGM. In 1996 Parliament defeated a motion outlawing FGM just I week after it
 passed a motion to implement the Beijing Women's Conference platform, one provi-
 sion of which called for ending FGM.
 Economic displacement and population growth continued to fuel the problem of
 homeless street children. The child welfare society of Kenya estimated that the
 number of Nairobi's street children increased from 33,000 in 1990 to 45,000 this
 year, while the Government estimates their growth at 10 percent per year. These
 children are often involved in theft, drug trafficking, assault, trespass, and property
 damage. According to a 1997 Human Rights Watch report, these street children face
 harassment as well as physical and sexual abuse from the police and within the ju-
 venile justice system simply because they are poor and homeless. They are held in
 deplorable conditions in crowded police station cells, often without toilets or bed-
 ding, with little food, and inadequate supplies. They are often incarcerated with
 adults and frequently beaten by police.
 Child rape and molestation are rapidly growing problems. There are frequent
 press reports of rape of young girls, with rapists often middle aged or older. Legally,
 a man does not "rape" a girl under 14 if he has sexual intercourse with her against
 her will; he commits the lesser offense of "defilement." The penalty for the felony
 of rape can be life imprisonment, while the penalty for defilement is up to 5 years'
 imprisonment. Men convicted of rape normally receive prison sentences of between
 5 and 20 years, plus several strokes of the cane.
 Child prostitution has emerged as a major problem in urban areas, often con-
 nected with the tourist trade. There have been numerous press reports regarding
 the rapid increase in child prostitution in Nairobi and Mombasa. A provincial gov-
 ement study in Nyanza province last year found that Kisumu city had 300 male
 and female child prostitutes as young as 8 years of age and that the practice existed
 in small towns through out the province.
 People With Disabilities.-Government policies do not discriminate against people
 with disabilities with regard to employment, education, or state services. Disabled
 persons are frequently denied driving licenses, however. There are no mandated pro-
 visions of accessibility for the disabled to public buildings or transportation.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-According to the 1989 government census
 released in May 1994, the Kikuyu are the largest ethnic community, comprising 21
 percent of Kenya's then 22 million people. Luhya, Luo, Kamba, and K alenjin ( an
 amalgamation of 9 small tribes) follow, each with more than 11 percent of the popu-
 lation.
 Opposition politicians and local human rights gups report that the Government
 continues to discriminate against Rift Valley Kikuyus. They assert that provincial
 authorities have denied national identification cards to a substantial number of
 Kikuyu youths, even those born and raised there. Without identification cards, these
 youths cannot marry, attend universities, obtain employment, or register to vote.

 There is widespread resentment by African Kenyans toward Asians living in
 Kenya. The large Asian community consists of second and third generation Asians
 with full Kenyan citizenship and smaller body of recent immigrants. Many African
 Kenyans resent people of Asian descent for th  auence, and their reluctance to
 assimilate African culture and to employ black Kenyans in management positions.
 They also see Asians as taking jobs and commercial opportunities away. The in-
 volvement of some Asians in corrupt activities with government officials further
 fuels popular resentment.
 Pohticians, both opposition and ruling party, from time to time sought to appeal
 to majority prejudices by attacking Asian Kenyans, accusing them of exploiting and
 usurping the natural inheritance of African enyans. In March opposition leaders
 Kenneth Matiba and Raila Odinga verbally attacked Asians and called for the ex-
 pulsion of "some Asians" President Moi ledthe response in rejecting this racist dia-
 tribe, but at times even he resorted to racist attacks, as in his criticism in Septem-
 ber of one Asian member of the constitutional reform movement, using typical slurs
 directed at the Asian community.
 The Government has singled out the overwhelmingly Muslim ethnic Somalis as
 the only group required to carry an additional form of iden tiion to prove that
 they are citizens. They must produce upon demand their Kenyan identification card
 and a second identification card verifying screening. Both cards are also required
 in order to apply for a passport. The continued presence of Somali refugees has ex-
 acerbated the problems faced by Kenyan Somalis.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Except for central government civil servants, includ-
 ing medical personnel and university academic staff, all workers are free to join
 unions of their choice. The law provides that as few as seven workers may establish
 a union, provided that the objectives of the union do not contravene the law, and
 that another union is not already representing the employees in question.
 The Government may deregister a union, but the Registrar of Trade Unions must
 give the union 60 .days to challenge the deregistration notice. An appeal of the Reg-
 Therere e at least 33 unions representing approximately 350,000 workers, less
 than 20 percent of the countts inusrial work foreecept for the 150,000-mem-
 ber Kenya National Union of Teachers, all unions are affiliated with the one ap-
 proved central organ-the COTU. The COTU leadership generally does not pursue
 worker's rights vigorously. As a result, most union activity takes place at the shop
 steward level, which disadvantages the average worker in disputes with manage-
 ment.
 The Government created COTU in 1985 as the successor to the Kenya Federation
 of Labor and the Kenya African Workers Congress. The 1965 decree establishing
 COTU gives the President the power to remove COTU'a three senior leaders from
 office and grants nonvoting membership on the executive board to representatives
 of the Ministry of Labor and of KANU. A 1993 High Court decision nullified an at-
 tempt to install leaders more acceptable to the Government, but the plotters refused
 to vacate COTU headquarters. Following a 1994 Appellate Court order, however,
 the Registrar of Trade Unions agreed to recognize the old COTU leadership. Al-
 though the board is composed of the leadership of affiliated unions, it is common
 for KANU to provide funding and other support for the election of senior union offi-
 cials. For the past few years, trade union leaders from affiliated unions have sought
 to bring about democratic reforms in the election and appointment of labor officials,
 independence from the Government, and establishment of links with any political
 party that spports worker rights. The reelection of the COTU leadership in July
 1996 indicated that there would be no major changes in the near future. During the
 period prior to the scheduled 1997 national election, some trade union leaders began
 pushing COTUJ to take part in the election reform dialogue. The COTU leadership
 took a progovernment position.
 The Trade Disputes Act permits workers to strike, provided that 21 days have
 elapsed following the submission of a written letter to the Minister of Labor. Mem-
 bers of the military services, police, prison guards, and members of the National
 Youth Service are precluded by law from striking Other civil servants, like their
 private sector counterparts, can strike following t he 21-day notice period (28 days
 if it is an essential service, such as water, health, education, or air traffic control).
 During this 21-day period, the Minister may either mediate the dispute, nominate
 an arbitrator, or refer the matter to the Industrial Court, a body of five judges ap-
 pointed by the President, for binding arbitration. Once a dispute is referred to either
 
 
 mediation, fact-finding, or arbitration, any subsequent strike is illegal. However, the
 act gives the Minister of Labor broad discretionary power to determine the legality
 of any strike.
 The Minister used this power to declare strikes by bank workers and bus drivers
 illegal, although the required notice had been given. The Government's response to
 wildcat strikes is usually severe. Several unions, including municipal workers, and
 other civil servants held brief strikes for back or increased wages. Air traffic control-
 lers and pilots, as well as the powerful independent Kenya National Union of Teach-
 ers (KNUT), initiated successful job actions, e.g., strikes, sick-outs, and work slow-
 downs, without government reprisal. This is due to civil aviation workers' critical
 place in the tourist economy and the potential to adversely affect the country's inter-
 national air safety reputation. The Government quickly settled the teacher's wage
 dispute rather than risk antagonizing the well-organized and influential teachers
 before the general election. Notwithstanding their success, workers' rights groups
 continue to raise the general problem of the Government's harshness towards labor
 with the International Labor Organization's (ILO) Committee on Freedom of Asso-
 ciation.
 Internationally, COTU is affiliated with both the Organization of African Trade
 Union Unity and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. Many of its
 affiliates are linked to international trade secretariats.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectiuely.-While not having the force
 of law, the 1962 Industrial Relations Charter, executed by the Government, COTU,
 and the Federation of Kenya Employers, gives workers the right to engage in legiti-
 mate trade union organizational activities. Both the Trade Disputes Act and the
 Charter authorize collective bargaining between unions and employers. Wages and
 conditions of employment are established in negotiations between unions and man-
 agement. In 1994 the Government relaxed wage policy guidelines to permit wage
 increases of up to 100 percent and renegotiation of collective agreements. Collective
 bargaining agreements must be registered with the Industrial Court in order to en-
 sure adherence to these guidelines.
 The Trade Disputes Act makes it illegal for employers to intimidate workers. Em-
 ployees wrongfully dismissed for union activities are generally awarded damages in
 the form of lost wages by the Industrial Court; reinstatement is not a common rem-
 edy. More often, aggrieved workers have found alternative employment in the
 lengthy period prior to the hearing of their cases.
 Legislation authorizing the creation of export processing zones (EPZ's) was passed
 in 1990. The EPZ Authority decided that local labor laws, including the right to or-
 ganize and bargain collectively, would apply in the EPZ's, although it grants many
 exemptions in practice. For example, the Government waived aspects of the law that
 prevent women from working at night (see Section 6.e.). Labor and some govern-
 ment officials continued to criticize health and safety conditions in the EPZ's.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution proscribes slav-
 ery, servitude, and forced labor, including forced and bonded labor by children. How-
 ever, under the Chiefs' Authority Act, a local authority can require people to per-
 form community services in an emergency, although this did not occur in 1997. The
 ILO Committee of Experts has found that these and other provisions of the law con-
 travene ILO Conventions 29 and 105 concerning forced labor.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The Em-
 ployment Act of 1976 makes the employment in industry of children under the age
 of 16 illegal. The act applies neither to the agricultural sector, where about 70 per-
 cent of the labor force is employed, nor to children serving as apprentices under the
 terms of the Industrial Training Act. Ministry of Labor officers nominally enforce
 the minimum age statute, and the Government is making strong efforts to eliminate
 child labor, working closely with the ILO's International Program for the Elimi-
 nation of Child Labor. Kenya is a signatory to ILO Convention 138, which sets the
 minimum working age at 15, but applies a more stringent standard.
 Children often work as domestic servants in private homes, including those of rel-
 atives. Although there is no widespread pattern of children being used as forced or
 bonded labor, which is prohibited by law (see Section 6.c.), there are some cases,
 mostly in rural areas, of children being loaned as workers to pay off debts. There
 are many instances of children working in the informal sector, mostly in family
 businesses. In commercial agriculture, children usually assist parents, who are
 small shareholders, rather than work as employees in their own right. However, de-
 teriorating economic conditions have given rise to more child labor in the informal
 sector, which is difficult to monitor and control. In addition, there has been an in-
 creasing number of underage girls employed in the sex industry (see Section 5).
 Given the high levels of adult unemployment and underemployment, the employ-
 
 
 ment of children in the formal industrial wage sector in violation of the Employment
 Act rarely occurs.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The legal minimum wage for blue collar work-
 ers in the wage sector has 12 separate scales, varying by location, age, and skill
 level. The lowest minimum wages were $34 (1,700 shillings) per month in urban
 areas and $19.50 (955 shillings) in rural areas. The minimum wage is insufficient
 to meet the daily needs of a worker and family. The annual 2 percent wage increase
 had a limited impact on worker income. Most workers relied on second jo s, subsist-
 ence farming, informal sector opportunities, or the extended family for additional
 Te Regulation of Wages and Conditions of Employment Act limits the normal
 workweek to 52 hours, although nighttime employees may be employed for up to
 60 hours per week. Some categories of workers have a shorter workweek. As is the
 case with respect to minimum wage limitations, the act specifically excludes agricul-
 tural workers from its purview. An employee in the nonagricultural sector is enti-
 tled to 1 rest day per week. There are also provisions for 1 month of annual leave
 and sick leave. The law also provides that the total hours worked (i.e., regular time
 plus overtime) in any 2-week period for night workers may not exceed 144 hours;
 the limit is 120 hours for other workers. Workers in some enterprises claimed that
 employers forced them to work extra hours without overtime pay. The Ministry of
 Labor is tasked with enforcing these regulations, and there are few reports of viola-
 tions.
 The Factories Act of 1951 sets forth detailed health and safety standards; it was
 amended in 1990 to include the agriculture, service, and government sectors. The
 65 health and safety inspectors attached to the Ministry of Labor's Directorate of
 Occupational Health and Safety Services have the authority to inspect factories and
 work sites. As a result of the 1990 amendments, the Directorate s inspectors may
 now issue notices enjoining employers from practices or activities that involve a risk
 of serious personal injuries. Previously, only magistrates were vested with this au-
 thority. Such notices can be a ppealed to the Fatories Appeals Court, a body of four
 members, one of whom must be a High Court judge. The number of factory inspec-
 tions increased dramatically in 1993 and subsequently has continued at a high level.
 Workers are not forced by law to remain in hazardous conditions; however, many
 would be reluctant to remove   ev          as of the high unemployment prb-
 leni.
