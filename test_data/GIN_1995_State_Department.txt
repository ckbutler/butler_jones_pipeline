 GUINEA
 The Republic of Guinea held its first multiparty legislative elections in June, de-
 livering more than 60 percent of Parliament s seats to President Lansana Conte's
 Party of Unity and Progress (PUP). President Conte took office in January 1994,
 after multiparty elections in which the Government dominated the electoral process.
 Opposition leaders, some international observers, and segments of the citizenry
 have voiced suspicion of PUP's considerable victories in both parliamentary and mu-
 nicipal elections. The country has a professed goal of moving from its authoritarian,
 one-party legacy to democracy. Although the PUP continues to dominate all three
 branches of government, opposition parties remain a sharp--if brittle-thorn in the
 Governments side.
 The gendarmerie and the national police share responsibility for internal security
 and sometimes play an oppressive role in the daily lives of citizens. The Red Be-
 rets-autonomous presidential guards-are accountable to almost no one except the
 President. Members of all of Guinea's security forces, which many citizens view as
 corrupt, ineffective, and even dangerous, committed frequent human rights abuses.
 Eighty percent of Guinea's 7 million citizens engage in subsistence agriculture,
 and annual per capita gross domestic product is about $528. Major exports include
 bauxite, gold, and diamonds.
 Human rights remain circumscribed. Major human rights abuses include: the de-
 nial of citizens' rights to change their government; occasional instances of vigilante
 justice; extrajudicial killings by security forces; police abuse of prisoners and detain-
 ees; instances of arbitrary detention; governmental failure to guarantee access by
 attorneys to clients in prison; inhumane prison conditions; the executive branch's in-
 fluence over the judicial system; societal discrimination and violence against women;
 discrimination against minorities; and prostitution and genital mutilation of young
 girls.
 The Government dominated the electoral process and rejected popular demands
 for important changes. An independent press occasionally criticized the Govern-
 ment, but the latter owns and operates the electronic media, the major medium for
 
 
 reaching the vast majority of the public. The Government uses the official press to
 denounce efforts by international organizations to scrutinize its human rights prac-
 tices.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-here were no reports of targeted
 political killings, but there were several extrajudicial killings by security forces. On
 January 1, 16 prisoners died in custody in Conakrys central jail. Government offi-
 cials offered conflicting explanations for the deaths, including an escape attempt and
 gang warfare. Thirteen of the victims were buried quickly without autopsy, and au-
 thorities did not release the autopsy results from the other three. Human rights or-
 ganizations condemned the Government for failing to protect prisoners and for ne-
 glecting conditions at the jail. Opposition leaders accused the Government of order-
 ing the killings to prevent the 16 from speaking about their links with senior gov-
 ernment officialIs. The opposition has given no evidence to support their accusations.
 Despite persistent rumors and vacillating statements by the Government, there has
 been no public call for the examination of government culpability.
 Altercations between civilians and police prior to the legislative elections ended
 in several civilian deaths, as reported by Guinea's two independent newspapers.
 One confirmed extrajudicial killing took place following a political rally in downtown
 Conakry on June 22, when a police officer shot and killed a youth. One day later,
 the President indefinitely postponed the upcoming municipal elections in that dis-
 trict. City authorities arrested the policeman involved, but at year's end no trial had
 been held.
 In April an army sergeant killed three civilians using a hand grenade; military
 authorities charged him with murder and sentenced him to death. Authorities also
 charged two police officers with the killing of a civilian following an outbreak of vio-
 lence in the city of Kissidougou on June 22. The officers are currently awaiting trial
 (see Section i.e.).
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Penal Code and the Constitution prohibit torture and cruel, inhuman, and de-
 grading treatment. However, both civilian and military security forces often use
 eatings to extract onfessions and employ other forms of brutality.
 On June 15, the independent newspaper L'Independant interviewed four men who
 described their escape from a Kankan prison, where antiriot police had reportedly
 detained and tortured them. They described crowded, filthy, unventilated cells, in
 which they were beaten and attested to the rape of female prisoners by guards. One
 of the interviewees had lash marks on his back and a broken hand as evidence of
 mistreatment. The British Broadcasting Corporation also reported that 137 civilian
 students whom police had incarcerated escaped from the military barracks in
 Kankan; police had threatened them with execution or 5 years' imprisonment for
 supporting opposition political parties. There were no reported judicial proceedings
 against the plice officers involved.
 Prison conditions are inhumane and life threatening. Family members and friends
 are responsible for feeding prisoners. Standards of sanitation remain poor, and
 deaths due to malnutrition and disease are frequent. Prisoners report threats and
 harassment by guards. The Government does not permit local human rights organi-
 zations to visit prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Penal Code requires that detainees
 must be charged before a magistrate within 72 hours. Once charged, the accused
 may be held until the final outcome of the case, including a period of appeal. Re-
 lease on bail is at the discretion of the magistrate who has jurisdiction. The Con-
 stitution proscribes incommunicado detention. The law provides for access by attor-
 neys to their clients, but authorities frequently do not respect this prvision.
 In practice, administrative controls over the police are ineffective, and security
 forces rarely follow the Penal Code; arbitrary arrest remained a persistent threat.
 In October 1994, police arrested four student leaders during a student strike and
 held them incommunicado for 24 hours. They were later ch arged, convicted, and im-
 prisoned. The President pardoned them on January, 1 week after sentencing. In a
 similar incident, authorities detained five other students on December 28, 1994, de-
 nying them access to a lawyer for 3 days. Only a very small percent of the prison
 population are pretrial detainees.
 In September the olice detained between 200 and 300 activists from the Rally
 of the  fuinean Peope (RPG) party, following the killing of a plice officer during
 an RPG demonstration which turned violent. According to credile reports, some of
 
 
 115
 those detained were suspected in the killing; hundreds of others were detained for
 being RPG members or sympathizers. Most were subsequently released without
 charge, but at year's end 35 remained in detention charged with inciting violence.
 On December 28, members of the presidential guard arrested, beat, and detained
 the U.S. Embassy React Team--composed of four Guinean employees--who were re-
 sponding to a call by an American citizen for assistance. Subsequent radio reports
 falsely declared them to be "bandits" engaged in "dirty work." The team remained
 in the presidential guard's detention building until January 9 when they were re-
 leased without being charged with a crime. No action was taken against the mem-
 bers of the guard who were involved.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for the judiciary's inde-
 pendence. Magistrates, however, are civil servants having no guarantee of tenure
 and are susceptible to influence by the executive branch. Judicial authorities often
 defer to central authorities in politically sensitive cases. In addition, the administra-
 tion of justice is plagued by numerous other problems, including shortages of mag-
 istrates (who generally are poorly trained) and lawyers, and an outdated and overly
 restrictive Penal Code. Owing to corruption and nepotism in the judiciary, relatives
 of influential members of the Government are virtually above the law.
 The judiciary includes courts of first instance, two Courts of Appeal and the Su-
 preme Court, the court of final appeal. There is also a State Security court, but it
 has not met since the trial of those allegedly involved in a coup attempt in 1985.
 Since 1988 civilian courts have rendered all judgments involving civilians under the
 Penal Code. A military tribunal prepares and adjudicates charges against accused
 military personnel, to whom the Penal Code does not apply.
 The Penal Code provides for the presumption of innocence of accused persons, the
 independence of judges, the equality of citizens before the law, the right of the ac-
 cused to counsel, and the right to appeal a judicial decision. Although in principle
 the Government is responsible for funding legal defense costs in serious criminal
 cases, in practice it rarely disburses these funds. The attorney for the defense fre-
 quently receives no payment.
 A traditional system of justice exists at the village or urban neighborhood level.
 Litigants present their civil cases before a village chief, a neighborhood leader, or
 a council of wise men. The dividing line between the formal and informal justice
 systems is vague, and a case may be referred from the formal to the traditional sys-
 tem to ensure compliance by all parties. Similarly, if a case cannot be resolved to
 the satisfaction of all parties in the traditional system, it may be referred to the
 formal system for adjudication. The traditional system discriminates against women
 in that evidence given by women has less weight.
 Suspected criminals, notably thieves and rapists, are sometimes beaten to death
 by their victims or by others. Though police authorities rarely intervene to rescue
 victims of vigilante justice, Kissidougou residents held security forces in the Forest
 region responsible for the death of a youth during the arrest of a rape suspect. On
 June 22, violence erupted over the alleged rape of a young girl. Police, attempting
 to arrest one suspect, killed another youth in the agitated mob. Relatives of the
 slain victim carried his body to the prefect's office, demanding that the prefect eat
 the flesh of the person who had been killed (see Section L.a.).
 Government-controlled radio and television broadcast live trial proceedings, re-
 flecting the more open and publicly monitored judicial system.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides for the inviolability of the home, and judicial search warrants
 are required by law. However, police frequently ignore these procedures. Police and
 paramilitary police often ignore legal procedures in the pursuit of criminals and fre-
 quently detain private citizens at night roadblocks in order to extort money to sup-
 plement their incomes. It is widely believed that security officials monitor mail and
 telephone calls. Local businesses, especially expatriate companies, often complain of
 intimidation and harassment by public officials and authorities.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Government has stated publicly that it sup-
 ports free speech and a free press, and the Constitution provides for freedom of ex-
 pression, subject to certain limitations. But the Government can and does employ
 a broad range of restrictions vitiating any real protection. It prohibits what it con-
 siders seditious talk or chants uttered in public, has established defamation and
 slander as criminal offenses, and prohibits communications which personally insult
 the President, or incite violence, discrimination, or hatred, or which disturb the pub-
 lic peace.
 
 
 116
 The Government also publishes the official newspaper. Reporters for the official
 press, who are government employees, practice self-censorship in order to protect
 their jobs.
 There is a vocal independent press which is occasionally critical of the President
 and the Government. The independent Le Lynx, for example, condemned the
 Conakry jail killing (see Section L.a.). Two weekly newspapers and up to two dozen
 other publications continue to publish, despite technical and financial difficulties.
 Some newspapers are affiliated with opposition parties while others offer news and
 criticism of both the Government and the opposition. The Government owns and op-
 erates the electronic news media, with national radio serving as the most important
 electronic means of reaching the public. There were no known attempts to interfere
 with foreign radio broadcasts.
 Journalist Diallo Souleymane was arrested in August and convicted in October of
 "offense to the head of state." He was sentenced to a 3-month suspended prison
 term and ordered to pay a fine of 2.5 million Guinean francs ($2,500). Diallo ap-
 pealed the conviction and at year's end his case was still pending.
 There is no licensed independent radio. The Government shut down one independ-
 ent radio station for operating without a license, but the station continues to broad-
 cast occasionally.
 Political tracts circulate widely throughout Conakry and other regions and include
 specific criticisms of the President and high officials. Foreign publications, some of
 which include criticism of the Government, are usually available. In April Govern-
 ment officials removed all posters and photographs of opposition party leaders from
 public areas in Kankan. According to independent newspapers, the officials also
 threatened "exemplary penalty" to anyone caught replacing the campaign material
 during the election season.
 The Ministiy of Higher Education exercises control over academic freedom
 through its influence on faculty hiring and control over curriculum. In general,
 teachers are not subject to classroom censorship.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom of association is pro-
 tected by law, but there are legal restrictions on assembly, a power which the Gov-
 ernment exercises to thwart unwanted political assembly. The Penal Code bans any
 meeting that has an ethnic or racial character or any gathering "whose nature
 threatens national unity." Public gatherings are legal only if the Government re-
 ceives notification 72 hours prior to the event. Authorities cited this law when they
 refused to allow Siradiou Diallo, leader of a major political opposition party, to hold
 a preelection rally in Kankan on May 20.
 The Government bans all street marches except for funerals. Pursuant to this
 statute, local authorities may cancel a demonstration or meeting if they believe that
 it will threaten public order. They may hold event organizers criminally liable if vio-
 lence or destruction of property ensues.
 The opposition coalition conducted a 3-day general strike in August to protest the
 legislative elections and deteriorating economic conditions. Isolated incidents in-
 cluded tire-burning and rock-throwing, which prompted a heavy military presence
 on Conakry's streets.
 Political parties must provide information on their founding members and produce
 internal statutes and political platforms consistent with the Constitution before the
 Government recognizes them. There are 46 legally recognized political parties.
 There were credible reports of harassment and oppression of the RPG party.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right inpractice. Foreign missionaries and church-affili-
 ated relief agencies operate freely. The Government and the quasi-governmental Na-
 tional Islamic League have spoken out against the proliferation of Shi'ite fundamen-
 talist sects which they alleged were "generating confusion and deviation" (within
 Guinean Islam), but have not restrictedthese groups. The Constitution provides re-
 ligious communities with the freedom to govern themselves without state inter-
 ference.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides citizens with the right to travel freely within
 the country and to change their place of residence and work. The Government re-
 quires all citizens to carry a national identification card which they must present
 on demand at security checkpoints. Travelers face harassment by police and at mili-
 tary roadblocks, particularly late at night. It is common to pay bribes at these road-
 blocks.
 The Government permits foreign travel, although it retains the authority to limit
 it for political reasons. The Government officially closed Guinea's borders and re-
 stricted internal travel during the June 11 legislative elections and closed the bor-
 ders again during municipal elections 3 weeks later.
 
 
 Guinea currently hosts over 580,000 refugees from Liberia and Sierra Leone. The
 Government works closely with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refu-
 gees, the World Food Program, and nongovernmental organizations to assist those
 designated as refugees, and has provided school buildings and access to local medi-
 cal facilities. However, relief organizations report that government authorities have
 demanded portions of donated fuel and food from delivery convoys, with losses esti-
 mated at up to 25 percent.
 While the Government has generally been hospitable toward refugees, there have
 been reports of local police and border patrol soldiers harassing refiugees and seek-
 ing bribes or sexual favors for entry into Guinea. There were credible independent
 reports of mistreatment of refugees in Gueckedou-Macenta. There were no reports
 of forced repatriation.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Although the 1990 Constitution provides for a popularly elected president and a
 multiparty parliament, the ability of citizens to exercise effectively this provision is
 restricted. The Government's tight control of the electoral process, one in which the
 Ministry of Interior functions as both player and referee, and the President's deci-
 sion to postpone municipal elections in Kissidougou and Kaloum, call into serious
 doubt the ability of citizens to change the government.
 In March the Carter Center characterized Guinea's political system as a "directed
 democracy,= i.e., a system in which formal institutions and practices of constitu-
 tional democracy are present, but which in practice, the extensive powers of the
 ruler, party, or regime "severely limit contestation by individuals, organized groups,
 legislative assemblies, and the judiciary."
 President Conte took office in January 1994 after multiparty elections in Decem-
 ber 1993 in which the Government dominated the electoral process. The President's
 party, the Party of Unity and Progress, won 62 percent of the legislative seats and
 56 percent of the municipal vacancies during the June legislative elections. The
 International Commission of Jurists reported seeing no seals on the legislative bal-
 lots, results envelopes left open, and various means of intimidation used at some
 polling places. The African-American Institute said that the National Electoral Com-
 mission-the supposed "moral guarantor of electoral fairness"-had only a marginal
 role.
 Opposition leaders deemed the entire process an "electoral masquerade" and "a
 comedy,* and openly questioned the credibility and legitimacy of PUPs municipal
 and legislative landslide victories. Shortly after results were announced, nine oppo-
 sition parties joined forces to form an umbrella organization, CODEM, dedicatedt
 act, organize, and combat together to make Guinea a land of liberty." However,
 these parties' deputies did take their seats in the National Assembly.
 Allegations of fraud by both the opposition and some international observers after
 the National Assembly elections on June 11 failed to incite popular outrage or even
 surprise. Voter turnout for the municipal elections on June 29 was low-about 30
 percent, according to government figures.
 Women are underrepresented in the Government, and hold just 4 of the 27 Cabi-
 net positions. They also play a minor role in the leadership of the major opposition
 parties.
 The Cabinet includes representatives of all major ethnicities, but a disproportion-
 ate number of senior military officers are Soussou, the ethnic group of President
 Conte.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 Local nongovernmental organizations primarily interested in human rights issues
 include: the Guinean Organization for the Defense of Human Rights; the Guinean
 Human Rights Association; the Children of the Victims of Camp Boiro; the Associa-
 tion of Victims of Repression; the Committee for the Defense of Civic Rights; and
 the Coordinating Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting Women's and Chil-
 dren's Health. Government officials are generally cooperative and responsive to
 their views.
 On April 12, border officials detained three Amnesty International delegates at
 the Conakry airport for several hours. The delegates were allowed to leave after the
 police had searched their bags and confiscated materials relating to Guinea's human
 rights situation.
 The government-controlled press denounced efforts by foreign governments and
 other organizations to interfere in Guinean internal affairs, including the protection
 of human rights.
 
 
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution states that all persons are equal before the law regardless of
 gender, race, ethnicity, language, beliefs, political opinions, philosophy, or creed, but
 the Government does not uniformly enforce these provisions.
 Women.-Violence against women is common, although estimates differ as to the
 extent of the problem. Wife-beating is a criminal offense and constitutes grounds for
 divorce under civil law; however, police rarely intervene in domestic disputes.
 Although the Government has made regular statements in the media against sex-
 ual harassment, women working in the formal sector in urban areas complain of fre-
 quent sexual harassment. Refugees from Liberia and Sierra Leone report some
 Guinean soldiers demand sex in exchange for entry into Guinea. There are credible
 reports from prisoners that female inmates are subject to harassment and sexual
 assault by guards. The social stigma attached to rape prevents most victims from
 reporting it. The Government has not vigorously pursued criminal investigations of
 a'eged sexual crimes.
 The Constitution provides for equal treatment of men and women, and a special
 government ministry works to ensure such equality. Women face discrimination,
 however, particularly in rural areas, where opportunities for women are limited by
 custom and the demands of child-rearing and subsistence farming. Women are not
 denied access to land, credit, or businesses, but women receive less inheritance. The
 Government has affirmed the principle of equal pay for equal work, but in practice
 women receive less pay than men in most equally demanding jobs. According to a
 1993 United Nations Development Program report, females receive only 20 percent
 as much schooling as males and constitute 30 percent of the labor force.
 Children.-Te Constitution provides that the Government has a particular obli-
 gation to protect and nurture the nation's youth, and the Government allocates a
 significant percentage of the budget to primary education. The President appoints
 a cabinet minister to defend women's and children's rights.
 Female genital mutilation (FGM), which is widely condemned by international
 health experts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is practiced
 in all regions and among all religious and ethnic groups in Guinea and performed
 on girls as young as four. According to an independent expert, about 60 percent of
 females have undergone this procedure. Infibulation, the most dangerous form of
 FGM, is practiced in the Forest region. Despite efforts by proponents of women's
 rights to call attention to the practice, and in spite of diseases resulting from crude
 and unsanitary surgical instruments and deaths resulting from the practice, the tra-
 dition continues, seriously affecting women's lives. The Government has made ef-
 forts to educate health workers on the dangers of this procedure and supports the
 World Health Organization rsolutions calling for its elimination.
 Prostitution exists in the informal eonomi~c sector and employs girls as young as
 10. The Government will take prohibitive action if prostitution of minors is brought
 to its attention, but does not actively monitor child or adult prostitution.
 People With Disabilities.-The Constitution provides that all persons are equal be-
 fore the law. There are no special constitutional provisions for the disabled. The
 Government has not mandated accessibility for the disabled, and few disabled peo-
 ple work.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-While the Constitution and the Penal Code
 prohibit racial or ethnic discrimination, ethnic identification is strong. Mutual sus-
 picion affects relations across ethnic lines, in and out of government. Promotions to
 the highest military ranks below the President include representatives all three
 major ethnic groups.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Associaton.-The Constitution provides for the right of employees
 to form independent labor unions and prohibits discrimination based on their union
 affiliation. Only an estimated 5 percent of the work force is unionized. Most union
 members are government employees, employees of the national utilities (electric,
 water, and telephone companies), or of foreign-controlled companies.
 The Labor Code states that all workers, except military and paramilitary, have
 the right to create and participate in organizations that defend and develop their
 individual and collective rights as workers. It requires elected worker representa-
 tives for any enterprise employing25 or more salaried workers.
 The National Confederation of Guinean Workers (CNTG) was the sole trade union
 before the Labor Code was enacted. Even though there are now other trade unions
 and labor confederations, the CNTG remains the largest confederation.
 The CNTG is indirectly funded by the State, although dissident members seek to
 increase the Confederation's freedom from government control. Independent unions
 
 
 and confederations have gained popularity, such as the Free Union of Teachers and
 Researchers of Guinea and the ational Organization for Free Trade Unions of
 Guinea. Several disgruntled groups within the CNTG left the Confederation, citing
 corruption in its leadership. Thespe groups joined with some independent unions to
 form a new confederation, the United Syndicates of Guinean Workers.
 The Labor Code grants salaried workers, including public sector civilian employ-
 ees, the right to strike 10 days after their representative union makes known its
 intention to strike. It prohibits strikes in sectors providing "essential services" (hos-
 pitals, radio and television, army, and police).
 Bank employees staged a 1-day strike in June to demand discounted mortgage
 rates. They settled after the banks agreed in part to their demands. One week later,
 Conakry taxi drivers went on strike to protest excessive fines imposed by police.
 Both events passed peacefully, but workers made little headway. Most workers went
 to work on all 3 days of the general strike in August, called to protest election re-
 suits and economic conditions.
 Unions may freely affiliate with international labor groups. The Government con-
 tinues to designate CNTG to represent workers in the International Labor Organi-
 zation conference.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Under the Labor Code, rep-
 resentative workers' unions or union groups may organize the workplace and nego-
 tiate with employers or employer organizations. The law protects the right to bar-
 gain collectively concerning wages and salaries without government interference.
 ork rules andwork hours established by the employer are developed in consulta-
 tion with union delegates. The Code also prohibits antiunion discrimination. Union
 delegates represent individual and collective claims and grievances with manage-
 ment. Individual workers threatened with dismissal or other sanctions have the
 right to a hearing before management with a union representative present and, if
 necessary, to take the complaint to the Conakry Labor Court which convenes weekly
 to hear such cases. In the interior, civil courts hear labor cases.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Labor Code specifically for-
 bids forced or compulsory labor, and there is no evidence of its practice.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-According to the Labor Code, the
 minimum age for employment is 16 years. Apprentices, however, may start at 14
 years. Workers and apprentices under the age of 18 are not permitted to work at
 night, nor for more than 12 onsecutive hours, nor on Sundays. The Labor Code also
 stipulates that the Minister of Labor and Social Affairs maintain a list of occupa-
 tions in which women and youth under the age of 18 cannot be employed. In prac-
 tic, enforcement by ministry insptors is limited to large firms in the modern sec-
 tor of the economy. Children of all ages work on family farms, in small trades, and
 in the informal sector, such as street vending.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Labor Code provides for the establishment
 by decree of a guaranteed minimum hourly wage, but the Government has not yet
 done so. There are also provisions in the Code for overtime and night wages which
 are fixed percentages of the regular wage. According to the Labor Code, regular
 work is not to exceed 10-hour days or 48-hour weeks, and there is to be a period
 of at least 24 consecutive hours of rest each week, usually Sunday. Every salaried
 worker has the legal right to an annual paid vacation, accumulated at the rate of
 at least 2.5 workdays per month of work. In practice, the authorities enforce these
 rules only in the relatively small modern urban sector.
 The Labor Code contains provisions of a general nature respecting occupational
 safety and health, but the Government has not yet elaborated a set of practicable
 workplace health and safety standards. Neither has it issued any of the ministerial
 orders laying out the specific requirements for certain occupations and for certain
 methods of work that are called for in the Labor Code. The Ministry of Labor and
 Social Affairs is responsible for enforcing labor standards, and its inspectors are em-
 powered to suspend work immediately in situations hazardous to health. However,
 enforcement remained more a goal than a reality. Labor inspectors acknowledge
 that they cannot even cover Conakry, much less the entire country, with their small
 staff and meager budget.
