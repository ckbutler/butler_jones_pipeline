 ANDORRA
 The principality of Andorra became a parliamentary democracy in 1993 when its
 Constitution was approved by popular referendum. Two Co-Princes representing
 secular and religious authorities have governed since 1278. Under the Constitution,
 the two Co-Princes-the President of France and the Spanish Bishop of Seu
 deUrgell-serve equally as Heads of State and are each represented in Andorra by
 a de egate. Elections were held in December 1993 to choose members of the Consell
 General, the Parliament, which selects the Head of Government. The judiciary func-
 tions independently.
 Andorra has no defense force. The national police have sole responsibility for in-
 ternal security.
 The market-based economy is dependent on those of its neighbors France and
 Spain. With creation of the European Union internal market Andorra lost its privi-
 
 
 leged duty-free status and is suffering an economic recession. Tourism is still an im-
 portant source of income. Because of banking secrecy laws, the financial services
 sector is growing in importance.
 The Government fully respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law and
 the judiciary provide effective means of dealing with instances of abuse.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of political or
 other extrajudicial killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punshment.-
 The Constitution prohibits such practices, and there were no reports that officials
 emloyed them.
 ison conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Government
 permits visits by human rights monitors.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution prohibits arbitrary ar-
 rest detention or exile and the Government observes this prohibition.
 e.' Denial of Pair Public Trial.-The Constitution provides for an independent judi-
 ciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice. The highest juicial
 body is the five-member Superior Council of Justice. One member each is appointed
 by: The two Co-Princes; the Head of Government; the President of the Parliament;
 and, collectively, members of the lower courts. Members of the judiciary are ap-
 pointed for 6-year terms. The judiciary provides citizens with a fair and efficient ju-
 dicial process.
 There were no reports of political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 Constitution provides citizens with safeguards against arbitrary interference with
 their "privacy, honor and reputation," and government authorities generally respect
 these prohibitions. Private dwellings are considered inviolable. No searches of pri-
 vate premises may be conducted without a judicially issued warrant. Private com-
 munications also are protected by law.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution provides for freedom of speech
 and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An inde-
 pendent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system
 combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 these rights, and the Government respects them in practice. Since adoption of the
 1993 Constitution, the Government has registered seven political parties.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the
 Government respects this right in practice. The Constitution acknowledges a special
 relationship between the Roman Catholic Church and the State, "in accordance with
 Andorran tradition." The Catholic Church receives no subsidies from the Govern-
 ment.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and
 Repatriation.-The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government re-
 spects them in practice.
 The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Ref-
 ugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. It is government
 policy not to expel persons having valid claims to refugee status, and there were
 no reports of such expulsions.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government
 peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair
 elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.
 Women have enjoyed full suffrage since 1970, but they continue to play a rel-
 atively minor role in politics. Notwithstanding the absence of formal barriers, few
 women have run for office; only 1 of 28 Members of Parliament is a woman, and
 only 2 women have occupied cabinet level positions.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 While there are no restrictions to prevent their formation, no formal human rights
 organizations operate in Andorra.
 
 
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution declares that all persons are equal before the law and prohibits
 discrimination on grounds of birth, race, sex, origin, religion, opinions, or any other
 personal or social condition, although the law grants many rights and privileges ex-
 clusively to citizens. The Government effectively enforces these provisions.
 Women.-No data exists on the incidence and handling of domestic violence cases,
 but spousal abuse appears to be virtually nonexistent. There is no legal discrimina-
 tion against women, either privately or professionally.
 Children.-There is no evidence of any special commitment by the Government
 to children's rights and welfare, although there is no indication of any problems in
 this area. Over the past 12 years there has been only one known case of child abuse.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no discrimination against disabled persons in
 employment, education, or in the provision of other state services. The law man-
 dates access to new buildings for people with disabilities, and the Government en-
 forces these provisions in practice.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Spanish nationals are the largest group of
 foreign residents, accounting for 47 percent of the population. Other sizable foreign
 groups are Portuguese, French, and British. A small number of North African and
 African immgrants work mostly in agriclture and construction.
 Although the Constitution states that legal residents enjoy the same rights and
 freedoms as Andorran citizens, immigrant workers do not believe that they have the
 same rights and security. They lack many social benefits paid to residents and often
 live in difficult and crowded conditions. The cost of living is high, and workers em-
 ployed in low-wage industries often cannot afford normal housing costs. Many of
 them live in trailers or crowded apartments, with as many as 8 or 10 people sharing
 quarters designed for 4. Many such workers are on temporary work permits. These
 permits are valid only as long as the job for which the permit was obtained exists.
 A worker hired on a temporary contract loses his workE permit when the contract
 expires. If unable to find new employment, the worker quickly becomes an undocu-
 mented alien with no visible means of support and may be deported.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution recognizes the right of all persons
 "to form and maintain managerial, professional, and trade union associations with-
 out prejudice." The Constitution provides that a registry of associations be estab-
 lished (through future legislation) and maintained. Strikes were illegal under the
 old system, and the new Constitution does not state explicitly that strikes are per-
 mitted.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The Constitution states that
 both "workers and employers have the right to defend their own economic and social
 interests." Parliament is charged with adopting legislation to regulate this right in
 order to guarantee the provision of essential services. The threat of immediate dis-
 missal (see Section 6.e.) is a powerful deterrent to complaints from workers, espe-
 cially since there is very limited unemployment insurance. This inhibits workers
 from organizing effectively to press their cases. Antiunion discrimination is not pro-
 hibited under current law.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is not specifically pro-
 hibited by law, but it does not occur.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Children under the age of 18 are
 normally prohibited from working although in exceptional circumstances children
 ages 16 and 17 may be allowed to work. Child labor regulations are enforced by the
 Laber Inspection Office in the Ministry of Social Welfare, Public Health, and Labor.
 That office does not routinely inspect work places but responds to complaints.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The workweek is limited to 40 hours, although
 longer hours may be required. The legal maximums for overtime hours are 66 hours
 per month and 426 hours per year. There is an official minimum wage, set by gov-
 ernment regulations. Other, higher wages are established by contract. The mini-
 mum wage is approximately $4.50 (Ptas 600) per hour. In principle it is enforced
 by the Labor Inspection Office, but self-enforcement is the norm. Living costs are
 high, and the current minimum wage is inadequate for a worker and fanily.
 Worker complaints center on the lack of job security. Workers may be dismissed
 without prior notice and receive social security and health benefits for only 25 days;
 thereafter, there is no unemployment insurance. Foreign workers who contribute to
 the social security system are ineligible to receive retirement benefits if they do not
 remain in Andorra after retirement; however, they may apply for a lump-sum reim-
 bursement of social security contributions when they leave the country. Retirement
 
 
 benefits are controlled by a board composed of Andorran nationals although they
 represent only a small portion of the work force. There is no special court or board
 to hear labor complaints.
 The Government sets occupational health and safety standards, but enforcement
 is loose as there are no routine inspections. There is no legislation giving workers
 the right to remove themselves from dangerous work situations without jeopardy to
 their continued employment.
