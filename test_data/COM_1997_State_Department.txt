 COMOROS
 The Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros comprises three islands and claims
 a fourth, Mayotte, which is governed by France. The Comoros has a democratically
 elected government and a Constitution but has been prone to coups and political in-
 surrection since independence in 1975. During the year, a secessionist movement
 rose in Anjouan, the countr's, second largest island. Government troops attempted
 to put down the movement in September but were defeated. The Organization of
 African Unity and the Arab League launched a mediation effort designed to help
 the Government and the secessionists reach a peaceful settlement, and hosted a me-
 diation session in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in December. Additional meetings were
 scheduled for 1998. President Mohame     . Taki Abdoulkarim, elected in March 1996,
 dissolved his government immediately following the confrontations in Anjouan and
 assumed full political powers, an act permitted by the Constitution, rovided that
 new elections are held within 90 days. As of yea s end, new elections ad not been
 scheduled. In October more than 99 percent of citizens in Anjouan voted in a legal
 referendum to secede from Comoros. The Government and the international commu-
 nity refused to recognize the vote. The judiciary is independent.
 The Comorian Deense Force (FCD) and the gendarmerie are responsible for inter-
 nal security. Both are under civilian control.
 The economy of this extremely poor country is dominated by agriculture. Reve-
 nues from the main rops-vanilla, essence of ylang-ylang, and clovesontinue to
 fall while the population of 550,000 continues to grow at a high rate of 3 percent
 annually. Per capita income is approximately $470 per year. Comors depends heav-
 ily on foreign assistance from Arab countries, France, and the European Union.
 The human rights situation worsened in 1997 due to widespread political protests
 and the Government's response to them. More than 50 civilians and soldiers died
 in confrontations between the Government and opposition political forces, most dur-
 ing the Anjouan military incursion in September. Several civilians were killed dur-
 ing protests earlier in the year, but the circumstances of their deaths are not clear.
 During the Anjouan crisis the Government suspendeda number of civil liberties
 such as the right to peaceful assembly. Prison conditio~is remain poor, and societal
 discrimination against women continued to be a serioud problem.
 RESPECT 1OR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, In uding Freedom From:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killin.-At least one dozen civilians and 30
 to 40 soldiers reportedly were killed in fighting between government troops and se-
 
 
 cessionists on the island of Anjouan from September 3 to 5. Both sides were armed,
 but there were no reliable reports of what occurred during the confrontations. The
 Government claimed that at least one soldier was beaten to death. Several non-
 gOVernmental organizations visited the island following the incursion, but have not
 issued any statements or published any reports that shed light on the 'nature of the
 ib.t Dsappearance.-There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 There were no substantiated rports of torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrad-
 ing treatment or punisbnment. There were press reports that soldiers tortured people
 in Anjouan during demonstrations in March. Credible sources confirm that individ-
 ual soldiers committed excesses.
 Prison conditions continued to be poor. A lack of proper sanitation, overcrowding,
 inadequate medical facilities, and poor diet are common problems. The Government
 has not taken action to remedy these problems.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The 1996 Constitution prohibits arbi-
 trary arrest and imprisonment. It does not specify a time limit between arrest and
 appearance before a maistrate. The law does not specify how long prisoners held
 for security reasons maybe detained without beg charged.
 The Government does not use forced exile as a means of political control.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The 1996 Constitution provides for an independ-
 ent judiciary assured by the President. The High Council, made up of four members
 appointed by the President, three members elected by the Federal Assembly, and
 a member of each island council, also serves as the High Court of Justice and rules
 on cases of constitutional law.
 The Constitution provides for equality before the law of all citizens. It does not
 mention the ight to counsel. Trials are open to the public except for limited excep-
 tions defined by law. The legal system incorporates Islamic law as well as French
 legal codes. There are very few lawyers in the country, making it difficult to obtain
 legal representation. The Government does not provide free legal counsel to the ac-
 cused. Most disputes are settled by village elders or by a civilian court of first in-
 stance.
 In September 1996, a man who had allegedly murdered a pregnant woman in
 front of several witnesses was found guilty in a public, 2-day trial before a lay penal
 court. He had legal counsel. Prior to the conclusion of the trial and sentencing,
 President Taki stated publicly that the trial process was unnecessarily slow and
 called for harsher pumshments for criminals. The man was publicly executed on
 September 16, 1996, and was the first person to be sentenced to death since the
 late 1970's.
 There are no known political prisoners.
 f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence-There
 were no known cases of arbitrary interference with privacy or correspondence.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution does not provide for freedom
 of the press, but small independent journals exist side-by-side with the semiofficial
 weekly AI-Watwan. The independent newspapers freely criticize the Government,
 and even A-Watwan has published comment    critical of President Taki.
 The government-controlled radio station, Radio Comoros, is the only station in the
 country following the closure by the Government of Tropic FM. Residents receive
 broadcasts from Mayotte Radio as well as from French television without inter-
 ference, but these carry only limited news about Comoros developments. Satellite
 antennas are popular and amateur radio licenses are issued without hindrance. For-
 eignnewspapers are available, as are books from abroad.
 There is no university, but secondary students and teachers speak freely and criti-
 cize the Government openly. Students led many of the antigoverment demonstra-
 tions early in the year. Security forces generally showed restraint  anllowed the
 prtests, despit the fact that they disrupted transportation and commerce.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The 1996 Constitution does
 not provide for freedom of assembly and association, but the Government generally
 respected these rights in practice, except during the height of the crisis in Anjouan,
 when it banned antigovernment demonstrations.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-An overwhelming majority of the population is Sunni
 Muslim. The Constitution prohibits discrimination before the law based-on religion
 or religious belief but establishes an Ulamas Council, which advises the President,
 Prime Minister, President of the Federal Assembly, the Council of Isles, and the is-
 land governors on whether bills, ordinances, decrees, and laws are in conformity
 with the principles of Islam. The Government permits non-Muslims to practice their
 
 
 66
 faith, and Christian missionaries may work in local hospitals and schools, but may
 not proselytize.
 President Taki's 1996 bans on alcohol and immodest dress remain in effect.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-There are no restrictions on travel within the country or abroad, and
 exit visas are generally freely granted.
 The Government has not formulated a policy regarding refugees, asylees, or first
 asylum.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 President Taki was elected in March 1996 in polling that international observers
 reported to be free and fair. Legislative elections were held in December 1996.
 Citizens have the right to change their government, but it has not yet been fully
 demonstrated that they, in fact, have the ability to change it peacefully through free
 and fair elections. The Constitution stipulates that sovereignty resides in the people
 and is to be exercised by elected representatives or through referendum. The crises
 that have beset the country since its independence in 1975, including a series of for-
 eign-led coups and coup attempts, have made it difficult for citizens to exercise that
 ight.
 resident Taki dissolved his Government in September following the military con-
 frontation in Anjouan, named 12 "commissioners" to assist him, and assumed full
 political powers. The Constitution allows the President to rule in this fashion, but
 requires that new elections be held within 90 days. However, elections had not been
 held by year's end.
 In October 1996, President Taki's proposed Constitution was approved in a na-
 tional referendum. The new Constitution mandates that all political parties that did
 not win at least two seats per island in the December 1996 legislative elections are
 automatically dissolved unless they join other parties validly represented in the
 Federal Assembly. If only one party is represented in the Assembly, the party or
 group obtaining the second largest number of votes is permitted to continue its ac-
 tivities.
 Village chiefs and Muslim religious leaders tend to dominate local politics. Tradi-
 tional social, religious, and economic institutions also importantly affect the coun-
 try's political life.
 Comorian, society is male-dominated, making it difficult for women to become in-
 volved in politics, although women have the right to vote and to run for office. No
 women hold senior government positions or serve in the National Assembly.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 The Comoros Human Rights Association, established in 1990, continues to func-
 tion, but many members are unwilling to criticize the Government vigorously for
 fear of losing their civil service positions. The Government cooperates with inter-
 national human rights organizations, including the International Committee of the
 Red Cross.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution provides for equality before the law without discrimination
 based on race, religion, or religious belief but is silent on sex, disability, language,
 and social status. The Government generally respects these provisions in practice
 but discourages the practice of religions other than Islam.
 Women.-Violence against women occurs, but medical authorities, the police, and
 women's groups believe that it is rare. In theory a woman could seek protection
 through the courts in the case of violence, but in fact the issue is most often ad-
 dressed within the extended family or at the village level.
 Men have the dominant role in society, and few women hold positions of respon-
 sibility in government or business. Societal discrimination against women is most
 apparent in rural areas, where women have onerous farming and child-rearing du-
 ties, with fewer opportunities for education and wage employment. In contrast,
 change in the status of women is most evident in the major towns, where growing
 numbers of women are in the labor force and generally earn wages comparable to
 those of men engaged in similar work. While legal discrimination exists in some
 areas, in general inheritance and property rights do not disfavor women. For exam-
 ple, the house that the father of the bride traditionally provides to the couple at
 the time of their marriage remains her property even in the event of divorce.
 Children.-The Government, while committed to the protection of children's rights
 and welfare in principle, has extremely limited ability to put this into practice. Pop-
 
 
 ulation pressure and poverty force some families to place their children in the
 homes of others. These children, often as young as 7 years of age, typically work
 long hours as domestic servants in exchange for food and shelter. The few legal in-
 struments which address the rights and welfare of children are not enforced because
 of a lack of inspectors.
 Female genital mutilation, which is widely condemned by international health ex-
 perts as damaging to both physical and psychological health, is not generally prac-
 ticed. Child abuse appears to be rare.
 People With Disabilities.-There is no evidence of widespread discrimination
 against the disabled in the provision of education or other services. No legislation
 is in force or pending concerning accessibility to public buildings or services for peo-
 ple with disabilities.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution does not provide for the right to
 unionize and strike, but these rights are practiced freely. Farming on small land
 holdings, subsistence fishing, and petty commerce make up the daily activity of most
 of the population. Hence, the wage labor force is small; less than 7,000 including
 government employees, and less than 2,000 excluding them. Teachers, civil serv-
 ants, and dock workers are unionized. Unions are independent of the Government.
 Teachers and hospital workers go on strike intermittently, mostly because they are
 not paid for months. There are no laws protecting strikers from retribution, but
 there were no known instances of retribution.
 There are no restrictions on unions joining federations or affiliating with inter-
 national bodies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-Unions have the right to bar-
 gain collectively, and strikes are legal. Wages are set by employers in the small pri-
 vate sector andby the Government, especially the Ministries of Finance and Labor,
 in the larger public sector. The Labor Code, which is only loosely enforced, does not
 set up a system for resolving labor disputes, and it does not prohibit antiunion dis-
 crimination by employers.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-The Constitution does not mention
 forced or compulsory labor, but it is not practiced.
 d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment.-The
 Labor Code defines the minimum age for the employment as 15 years of age. The
 Ministry of Labor has few resources to enforce this provision, but except for domes-
 tic work, child labor is not a problem, due to the general lack of wage employment
 opportunities. Children generally help with the work of their families in the subsist-
 ence farming and fishing sectors (see Section 5).
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government mandates minimum wage
 levels. The rates, which vary by occupation, have not been changed in over a decade
 and no longer reflect economic realities. The minimum wage for a laborer is about
 $67 (30,000 Comorian francs) per month. The Governnent periodically reminds em-
 ployers to respect the Labor Code, which specifies 1 day offper week, pus 1 month
 of paid vacation per year, but it does not set a standard workweek. There are no
 safety or health standards for the minuscule manufacturing sector.
