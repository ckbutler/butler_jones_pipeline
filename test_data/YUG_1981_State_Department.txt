 YUGOSLAVIA
 Yugoslavia, a multi-national, nonaligned state with a
 stormy and troubled past, has a serious concern about
 the continued terrorism employed by some emigre
 political organizations. Other problems include the
 persistence of historical ethnic and national tensions
 within the country, economic difficulties exacerbated
 by-regional economic disparities, and continued
 ideological and political differences with surrounding
 states. These concerns have led the LCY and the
 Yugoslav government to adopt a number of creative
 reforms, including decentralization of political and
 economic institutions, and encouragement of certain
 forms of cultural pluralism, e.g., use of local
 languages in courts, schools, and media. However, in
 meeting these problems Yugoslavia's leaders have also
 imposed restrictions with regard to many aspects of
 individual political behavior.
 Yugoslavs enjoy broad freedom of movement and access
 .tomany foreign publications and to radio broadcasts.
 Yugoslavia has a good record on freedom of emigration,
 and the-government emphasizes the fulfillment of
 economic needs. At the same time, the League of
 Communists of Yugoslavia (LCY) maintains a monopoly of
 political power, and the government imposes
 ,significant restricutions on freedom of political
 expression. The government does not tolerate public
 critkcism of the late President Tito, the LCY, the
 theory (as opposed to the practice) of socialist
 self-management, Yugoslavia's nonaligned orientation,
 statements undermining the country's unity or
 challenging the policy of "brotherhood" among
 Yugoslavia's diverse peoples.
 In the face of challenges in recent years from various
 elements, both inside and outside the LCY, the
 Yugoslav leadership has become noticeably more
 critical of breaches in political discipline. There
 are several hundred political prisoners.
 Simultaneously, however, the overall question of human
 rights appears to be gaining more attention from
 government authorities and is increasingly becoming a
 legitimate subject of discussion.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Article 176 of the Yugoslav constitution guarantees
 the "inviolability of the integrity of the human
 personality" and states that any extortion of a
 confession or statement shall be forbidden and
 punishable. Numerous references in the Yugoslav code
 of criminal procedure speak to this same point.
 The use of torture is not condoned and can become a
 legal issue. For example, in December 1978 and
 January 1979, a retrial took place in Zagreb of a
 number of persons previously convicted of an attempt
 
 (910)
 
 
 911
 on President Tito's life in 1975. According to
 Amnesty International's 1979 report as well as other
 available information on this case, the court
 reaffirmed the convictions of three of the accused,
 but conceded that "physical and psychological
 pressure" may have been used to obtain confessions.
 As a result, some of the sentences in this case were
 reduced.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Conditions within Yugoslav prisons appear to be
 strict, but not unhumane. There have been reports of
 particularly harsh conditions in some Yugoslav prisons
 including allegations that some prisoners have been
 held in solitary confinement for extended periods, or
 beaten for infractions of prison regulations. The
 Yugoslav press has also reported and editorialized
 against abuses of authority by the police and against
 excessive use of force. In July 1980, the Serbian
 authorities took vigorous legal and disciplinary
 action against three police officers and four of their
 superiors because of the beating death of a young man
 in their custody. While medical care is generally
 available to prisoners, there are persistent reports
 alleging denial of proper medical treatment to
 prisoners with special medical problems. However, in
 at least one such case the authorities did transfer
 the individual from prison to house arrest for a
 period of time and later to a military hospital for
 treatment. The government then allowed him to leave
 the country for emergency heart surgery in
 Switzerland; following this person's return to
 Yugoslavia, he was amnestied.
 c. Disappearances
 There is no indication of permanent or prolonged
 disappearance of persons in Yugoslavia. However,
 Amnesty International and the Western press have
 reported allegations in the past involving the
 kidnapping of Yugoslav emigres by the Yugoslav
 intelligence services for involuntary return to
 Yugoslavia for trial. Cases also occur in whiqh no
 public notice is made of an arrest or trial until
 sentence is pronounced.
 Although the People's Republic of Albania and certain
 Albanian emigre groups have alleged that hundreds of
 ethnic Albanians were killed, wounded, or arrested
 during demonstrations in the Autonomous Province of
 Kosovo during the period March - May, 1981, no one has
 offered hard evidence to challenge the Yugoslav
 government's figures on casualties or arrests--nine
 killed, several hundred injured, over 200 sentenced
 for more serious offenses and about 2,000 for
 misdemeanor-type offenses. Persons known to have been
 arrested and charged with criminal offenses during the
 Kosovo disturbances were brought to trial with
 reasonable dispatch.
 
 
 912
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Yugoslavs are generally free from arbitrary arrest,
 although large numbers of suspects reportedly have
 been detained for questioning after suspected acts of
 terrorism. The requirement to bring a defendant
 before a judge within 24 hours of arrest is designed
 to bring about "Judicial awareness" of the reason for
 detention. Normally arraignment quickly follows
 arrest. There are exceptions, especially in cases
 involving espionage or national security, where
 detention for questioning may extend beyond 24 hours
 without formal arrest or arraignment.
 Yugoslav law requires that an indictment be brought
 within three months, except that the investigating
 judge can request from the court an extension of three
 months, or even longer, if justification for a
 deferral is presented. The accused has the right to
 counsel from the time he or she is brought before a
 judge. However, until an indictment is handed down,
 consultations between the accused and his attorney
 must take place in the presence of a court official.
 Prisoners may receive visits from family members, but
 this right is sometimes restricted on the grounds
 that it would prejudice the investigation. Generally,
 consular access is permitted to prisoners of foreign
 nationality, although in such cases notification of
 arrests is frequently tardy, and this and other
 problems often arise in cases where dual nationality
 is involved.
 s.  Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Trials are generally open to the public except, in
 cases involving military or national security
 questions, when the judge has the authority to hold
 proceedings in camera. In cases of crimes relating to
 national defense and security and to matters
 concerning service in the Yugoslav military, civilians
 may be tried in military courts. The court may also,
 in-cases involving classified materials, appoint a
 military officer rather than a civilian as counsel for
 the defense. The trial record does not necessarily
 provide a full transcript and all testimony is
 recorded in the words of the presiding judge.
 Government controls on the media often affect the
 degree and nature of the publicity accorded to the
 proceedings, but these strictures are lessening.
 During 1981, the press provided an unprecedented
 degree of detailed reporting of a political trial in
 Serbia, including the testimony of the accused and
 defense witnesses.
 The accused has the right to counsel, and Yugoslav
 lawyers have often vigorously defended their clients.
 The government, however, is believed sometimes to
 influence judicial proceedings, particularly in cases
 of political interest. Amnesty International claims
 that, as a result, some attorneys are reluctant to
 take political cases. There are attorneys, however,
 who maintain a regular practice in this area without
 apparent adverse consequences. In ordinary
 
 
 913
 criminal and civil proceedings, the courts act
 according to the law and constitution, and the
 defendants' civil rights are generally respected.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The Yugoslav code of criminal procedure contains
 elaborate provisions for conducting searches,
 including the requirement for a court order except
 under certain limited circumstances. Article 184 of
 the Yugoslav constitution provides that entry may be
 made without a warrant if this is indispensable for
 the immediate arrest of the perpetrator of a criminal
 offense, to protect the safety of life or property, or
 if it appears obvious that the evidence in criminal
 proceedings could not be secured otherwise. The same
 article concludes with the provision that illegal
 entry is "prohibited and punishable." There are no
 indications of widespread violations of these
 provisions. Many dissidents, however, believe that
 the authorities still eavesdrop on their conversations
 and read their mail.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties,
 Includings
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 Public expression of political dissent is frequently
 suppressed. In particular, the government does not
 tolerate criticism of the League of Communists of
 Yugoslavia and its leadership, of basic domestic and
 foreign policies, of the self-management system (the
 theory is sacrosanct, criticism of the practice is
 not), or of the "brotherhood and unity" of the
 country's diverse ethnic groups. When the government
 does take action against such criticism, it resorts to
 arrest, trial, fines, warnings, imprisonment, or a mix
 of these. During 1981 Yugoslav political leaders
 publicly criticized opposition groups and certain
 dissidents; this criticism was echoed in the media.
 The Yugoslav Government is intensely concerned about
 terrorist acts by certain emigre groups, and this
 concern leads it to regard domestic political dissent
 as propaganda waged by such emigre groups; it reacts
 strongly to such dissent. Under Yugoslav law,
 dissidents can be charged with a variety of vaguely
 defined political crimes (e.g., hostile propaganda,
 counterrevolution, association against the state, and
 making statements prejudicial to brotherhood and
 unity) and sentenced to prison terms of up to ten
 years. In 1980, a Yugoslav official stated that
 nine-tenths of "political crimes" in Yugoslavia were
 verbal and that, of these, only one in six was of a
 serious nature. This appears to be an accurate
 accounting.
 Additionally, Yugoslavia takes the view that its
 authority over its citizens extends beyond its
 borders, and the Yugoslav government continues, when
 it can, to arrest and imprison its citizens for
 
 
 914
 political offenses committed abroad, even if the acts
 in question are not crimes in the country in which
 they took place, and even if the accused are also
 citizens of the country where the alleged offense
 occurred.
 Historic prejudices and tensions continue to exert
 their influence, and the nationalities question
 remains one of the key issues facing Yugoslavia. In
 1981 a Belgrade news magazine quoted the federal
 public prosecutor as saying that 70 percent of all
 political offenses had their origin in "nationalism".
 During the past year several prominent Croatian
 intellectuals received prison sentences for alleged
 hostile activities. In the province of Kosovo,
 following demonstrations and disturbances by ethnic
 Albanians in March. April, and May, over 200 persons
 were tried and sentenced to prison terms of up to 15
 years, for offenses ranging from advocacy of the
 establishment of a separate Kosovo republic, to
 violent acts. Additionally, about 2,000 persons
 received short jail terms of up to 90 days for their
 part in the demonstrations and a number were dismissed
 from the Party, school, or employment.
 Nevertheless, the Yugoslav government has done a
 great deal to ensure the legal and social rights of
 the many different nationalities and ethnic groups
 making up the Yugoslav state. The use of the major
 local language is required in official communication
 between Belgrade and the various republics, and local
 languages are also used in the schools, courts, in
 public administration generally, and in the local
 media. Social discrimination continues to be
 expressed, particularly against ethnic Albanians and
 gypsies, but government policy is one of strict legal
 equality.
 Various private organizations have reported on the
 human rights situation in Yugoslavia and have
 criticized restrictions on political expression and
 the arrest of persons espousig dissident political
 views. On the basis of official and unofficial
 reports, the number of persons currently imprisoned in
 Yugoslavia on political charges appears to be within
 the range of 500 to 700 including those recently
 sentenced in the Kosovo, many of whom were accused
 both of political offenses and of instigating or
 participating in rioting or various forms of sabotage.
 According to a Croatian official quoted in the
 press in February 1981, there were then 91 political
 prisoners in that republic. Amnesties, while not
 routine, are usually granted on the occasion of
 Yugoslav National Day, November 29. The 1981 Amnesty
 included 56 persons: 30 were set free and 26 had their
 sentenced reduced. Most of these are not believed to
 be political prisoners.
 Yugoslav media are responsive to political
 direction, although an increasing degree of
 objectivity and selective criticism is permitted.
 During 1981, the boundaries of press freedom appear to
 
 
 915
 have widened and the media itself became the focus of
 lively debate over the public's right to prompt and
 accurate information in a self-managing society.
 Publication and circulation of written materials are
 subject to regulations involving registration and
 post-publication censorship. Published material,
 films, and recorded material from other countries,
 including Western European countries and the United
 States, are readily available, although there is
 censorship of individual items. For example, specific
 issues of magazines or newspapers which contain
 articles offensive to the government are proscribed.
 However, the number of such instances recorded in the
 first eight months of 1981 has declined sharply in
 comparison with the first eight months of 1980.
 Although a group of Slovene intellectuals who
 petitioned to publish a new literary and cultural
 journal was criticized by party leaders, permission to
 publish was eventually granted. A similar petition
 for an independent magazine by groups of Serbian
 intellectuals was harshly criticized and rejected by
 the Serbian authorities. Amnesty International
 reports several instances where-Yugoslavs have been
 imprisoned for possessing or circulating certain
 "emigre" journals critical of the government. In
 several recent political trials of internationally
 known dissidents in Croatia, the prosecution charged
 that the accused committed criminal acts in
 communicating their views to foreign journalists.
 Freedom of religious practice and assembly is
 guaranteed by the constitution and is generally
 honored so long as religious organizations do not
 engage in activities considered political. The
 authorities in Croatia have engaged in political
 polemics against a leading prelate in that republic.
 In Bosnia-Hercegovina, a republic containing three
 sizable ethno-religious communities--Catholic,
 Orthodox, and Muslim-- some clergymen have been
 accused, end in some instances jailed, for alleged
 acts of "clerical nationalism" contributing to
 religious and ethnic intolerance. It was in southern
 Hercegovina that the alleged appearances of the Virgin
 took place.
 Constraints are imposed on proselytizing activities
 and religious education for children. This is one of
 the most contentious issues in church-state
 relations. Seminaries exist for training adults as
 priests, but they are taxed, and seminary students do
 not get military deferments. The Jewish community is
 quite small in Yugoslavia and there are no rabbinical
 seminaries.
 While some LCY members do attend religious services,
 such behavior is discouraged. Demonstrative religious
 belief is not officially condoned--it is considered
 imcompatible with the dedication to the principles of
 Marxism-Leninism necessary to advance to the highest
 levels in some careers -- but it is frequently
 overlooked. Public political gatherings are permitted
 only on the authority of official bodies. In
 practice, the right to political assembly is exercised
 exclusively by groups supporting government policy.
 
 
 916
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within the country is guaranteed
 in the Constitution and is not significantly infringed
 in practice. Certain restrictions on the travel of
 foreigners to the Kosovo were imposed following the
 outbreak of serious civil disturbances in the spring
 of 1981. Six months later these restrictions had been
 significantly relaxed.
 The vast majority of Yugoslavs travel abroad at will.
 In 1979, the law on travel documents extended the
 validity of passports and exit visas from two to five
 years, and on some passports the validity is ten
 years. In November 1979, the Federal Executive
 Council of Yugoslavia ruled that Yugoslavs would no
 longer need exit permits to travel to those countries
 with which Yugoslavia had diplomatic or consular
 relations. In September 1980, the Yugoslav Supreme
 Court ruled that the authorities must inform citizens,
 except in national security cases, of the reasons for
 denial of a passport. A small number of dissidents
 have been denied passports on national security
 grounds; some have, however, successfully contested
 denial.
 The law on the entrance of foreigners to Yugoslavia
 mentions the right of asylum and provides for
 government assistance to persons granted that right.
 In cooperation with the office of the United Nations
 High Commissioner for Refugees, Yugoslavia annually
 provides temporary assistance to numerous persons
 seeking resettlement in third countries.
 Approximately 800,000 thousand Yugoslav workers are
 currently employed in Western Europe. There are no
 restrictions on emigration, on return, or on the
 repatriation of earnings.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 The Yugoslav constitution provides for broad
 participation in the political process at the local
 level. Elections to primary units, e.g., as in
 factories, have sometimes involved multiple
 candidacies. Selection of candidates for higher
 offices is done indirectly through a delegate system
 operating at each successive tier, up to the level of
 the Federal Assembly. The "self-management" system
 encourages wide participation in the decision making
 process on economic issues, and there is evidence that
 major economic policy decisions are subject to broad
 discussion. The role of the League of Communists has
 evolved away from that of directing the political and
 economic process and towards an "educational" stance.
 In this connection, it is now unusual for policy-level
 Government elected or appointed officials to hold at
 the same time high party posts. The League of
 Communists' political power remains, of course,
 strong and, coupled with legal restrictions against
 unauthorized political expression, limits the
 parameters of the political process.
 
 
 917
 The 1974 Constitution guarantees the equality of
 citizens regardless of sex. The government is
 committed to improving the status of women. Media and
 government attention to the status and role of women
 in society has increased during the United Nations'
 International Year for Women. The main problems of
 equal treatment of the sexes occur in those areas of
 the country where economic development has lagged or
 where traditional Eastern or rural attitudes about
 female roles prevail. Women are represented in most
 walks of life, including government positions, and
 receive equal pay for equal work. Women are, however,
 underrepresented in high-level government and
 management positions.
 The 1974 constitution spells out the complicated
 system of the organization of business enterprises.
 In theory, the means of production are owned by the
 nation as a whole and entrusted to the workers,
 organized in enterprise-level workers' councils. In
 practice, it appears that the workers' councils exert
 a considerable influence over the choice of management
 in enterprises, their broad policies, and distribution
 of enterprise income. There are no business
 enterprises owned and operated directly by the state,
 with the possible exception of some defense-related
 establishments and agricultural research stations.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental Investigation
 of Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 Although the Yugoslav Government has shown a
 willingness to discuss and raise general questions of
 human rights in international forums, including
 meetings of the nonaligned countries and the
 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe
 review meetings, it remains sensitive to charges of
 human rights violations within Yugoslavia. On grounds
 of national sovereignty, the government views the
 adjudication of political cases as an internal matter
 not subject to outside investigation. In 1976,
 however, Yugoslav officials met with representatives
 of Amnesty International to discuss charges of
 political repression and individual cases of arrest
 and imprisonment. In early 1980, two members of
 Amnesty International who arrived in Yugoslavia on an
 unannounced visit were able to discuss the cases of
 several persons imprisoned in Kosovo with officials of
 that province. In August 1980, however, two
 representatives of the International Human Rights Law
 Group visiting Yugoslavia became the subject of
 obvious surveillance in Croatia following visits to
 the apartments of dissidents in Zagreb. Yugoslavia
 has, on the other hand, recently allowed or assisted
 foreign observers from the International League for
 Human Rights and from Amnesty International to observe
 trials. Nevertheless, Amnesty International has
 continued to express concern over the number of
 political trials, and the degree to which the legal
 rights of defendants are observed in them. Media
 coverage of "political" trials has increased in depth
 and objectivity over the past year.
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Health care and hospitalization are available to all
 citizens under a comprehensive system of health
 insurance. The average life expectancy at birth is 70
 years, and the infant mortality rate per 1,000 live
 births is 33.6.
 
 
 918
 Personal income is fairly evenly distributed, with 65
 percent of the population falling into the middle
 income range. The.nati-onal per capita income amounted
 to $2,430 in 1979. While there are significant
 differences in per capita income levels between the
 various republics, they stem from historical reasons.
 City-country differences also remain, but the
 different styles of life in urban and rural
 environments make statistical comparisons somewhat
 misleading. The overall growth annual rate of the
 population is 0.9% and the fertility rate is 1.1%, but
 population growth is much higher in the less developed
 .and rural areas of the country. A general movement of
 the population to the cities has strained housing and
 public services.
 Working conditions, labor safety, and rates of pay
 are loosely regulated by legislation. Each enterprise
 has wide latitude, through the system of workers'
 councils set forth in the Constitution, to adapt these
 regulations to local conditions. The trade unions are
 organized not by industry, but on a republican and
 provincial and federal basis. Their influence,
 insofar-as it has been exerted, has been directed
 toward general economic legislation rather than bread
 and butter issues. There is much talk in Yugoslavia
 of giving the unions a greater role in the enterprise,
 and of increasing their relevance to worker's direct
 concerns.
 Strikes are neither permitted nor prohibited by
 law. When they do occur, they are called "work
 stoppages". Such strikes are still limited to
 individual enterprises, and have almost always been
 caused by local grievances. They are also invariably
 short in duration. Around 200 work stoppages occur
 each year. Unless the perpetrators of a strike commit
 acts of violence against persons or property, they are
 not punished, although their political reputation with
 the local Party organization may suffer.
 The degree of application of political criteria for
 employment purposes, which was virtually absolute for
 many years after the war, has now diminished
 considerably, although individual dissidents have
 encountered discrimination from the authorities. The
 existence of such criteria is perhaps represented most
 sharply in the application of the criterion of "moral
 and social fitness", which measures loyalty to the
 state and to the LCY as a prerequisite for white
 collar employment opportunities.
 The constitution guarantees the right to education of
 all Yugoslav citizens, regardless of nationality, and
 to education in the-language of the various Yugoslav
 peoples. The state meets this obligation. The adult
 literacy rate is 85 percent (1976) and the primary
 school enrollment (1978) is 99 percent (male 100;
 female 98). There is no longer much discrimination in
 the Yugoslav educational system based on family or
 political background, although this was the case at
 least until the mid-1960's.
