 MADAGASCAR
 When 1991 began, President Didier Ratsiraka, who had been in
 power since 1975, and his party, the Vanguard of the Malagasy
 Revolution (AREMA), dominated the Government. By midyear, the
 nation's "Active Forces" (a group of opposition political
 parties, church groups, workers' syndicates, and private sector
 groups) were organizing almost daily demonstrations that
 challenged the Ratsiraka regime to meet demands for fundamental
 political change. Civil servants also began a widely observed
 strike that crippled the Government's administrative
 apparatus. The Government consequently agreed to negotiate,
 and on October 31 a compromise convention established an
 interim Government which reduced the powers of President
 Ratsiraka. This Government, headed by Prime Minister
 Razanamazy and including many opposition members, is tasked to
 provide a new constitution and elections within 18 months. The
 National Assembly suspended its activities according to the
 October 31 compromise, and transitional institutions were
 established, including a 31-member High Authority of State, a
 transitional administration, and a 130-seat Council for
 Economic and Social Recovery. After much debate, a
 transitional cabinet with considerable opposition membership
 was named in mid-December. Strikes and demonstrations
 continued although to a far lesser extent.
 The gendarmerie (rural police) and the national police (urban
 police) are responsible for internal security. At the year's
 end, the Directorate General of Internal and External
 Investigations and Documentation (DGIDIE) remained under the
 authority of President Ratsiraka, although the DGIDIE director
 also reported to the Prime Minister. In the past, the DGIDIE
 and the police employed physical mistreatment of detainees,
 particularly during interrogation, but reports indicate the
 DGIDIE stopped such practices by mid-1990. The presidential
 security guard, a unit of 1,800 men, remains under the direct
 command of the President. In an October 25 statement, senior
 officers of the military and the gendarmerie called on all
 political leaders to move urgently toward a compromise,
 demonstrating a degree of neutrality on their part.
 Agriculture, especially rice production, dominates the Malagasy
 economy. About 85 percent of the working population (39.3
 percent of the country's 12 million inhabitants) are employed
 in this sector, accounting for 80 percent of Madagascar's
 export earnings. Rich in minerals, Madagascar also has a small
 industrial base which accounts for 15 percent of the gross
 domestic product. Personal incomes remain very low, and
 unemployment remains high, particularly among youth (60 percent
 of the population is under 25). The strikes in support of the
 opposition have had a serious negative impact on an already
 weak economy.
 Serious human rights abuses occurred during 1991, despite the
 Government's increased tolerance of the freedoms of speech,
 press, and assembly, and popular pressures for a more rapid
 pace of political reform. In particular, while attempting to
 control and disperse crowds of demonstrators in Antsiranana,
 Antananarivo, and Mahajanga, security forces used tear gas,
 stun grenades, and other tactics which killed and injured
 numerous demonstrators (see Section l.a.). An effective
 government capable of performing basic functions was not in
 place for much of the year.

 MADAGASCAR
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There were no.reported incidents of targeted political killing
 in 1991. However, on several occasions, security personnel
 used force, sometimes excessive, to disperse demonstrators who
 participated in marches. In some cases, the demonstrators
 engaged in looting and other vandalizing activity. On August
 10, opposition leaders led a crowd estimated at over 100,000 on
 a march on the presidential palace of Iavo~oha, located about
 13 kilbmeters outside the capital. The demonstrators passed
 two security checkpoints without being hindered by security
 forces. However, when the crowd began to pass a final
 barricade approximately 1 kilometer from the presidential
 palace, the army and presidential guard dispersed it, first
 with teargas, then by dropping stun grenades from a helicopter
 that had been positioned at the presidential palace and
 reportedly firing rifles into the crowd. A group of civilians,
 reportedly transported to Antananarivo from the south by the
 Government, were-interspersed among the soldiers and threw
 stones at the retreating crowd. In the ensuing confusion, some
 demonstrators spilled over from the road into bordering rice
 paddies, which had been mined. Retreating demonstrators were
 pursued, and medical personnel confirm that at least two were
 shot in the back. At least 11 demonstrators were killed in
 this incident, and over 200 injured. Another. 20 died later of
 their wounds.
 ,Later on August 10 in the northwest city of Mahajanga, a group
 of 12,000 to 15,000 demonstrators looted and burned private
 businesses and government buildings. Reportedly, five were
 killed and seven, injured when security forces used tear gas and
 stun grenades.
 Again, on October 23, a group of demonstrators in the northern
 city of Antsiranana attempted, despite verbal warnings and
 warning shots, to enter a security zone. Subsequently, one
 member of the security forces rolled an offensive fragmentary
 grenade into the street. Reportedly, 2 demonstrators were
 killed, and 76 injured, many as they fled through a
 construction area.
 In late July and early August, four persons were killed in the
 port city of Toamasina during political demonstrations. Two of
 the deaths allegedly occurred at the hands of vigilantes
 belonging to the Militant Movement for Malagasy Socialism
 (MMSM), the then governing political coalition; the third
 victim was allegedly shot in the back by security forces. The
 fourth victim, an MMSM supporter, was reportedly killed by
 Active Forces' supporters.
 With the iWeakening of the police and gendarmerie's ability to
 keep order, mob action against suspected criminals became more
 frequent in July and August. At least five alleged thieves
 were chased, caught, beaten, and killed by angry crowds in four
 separate incidents. Their bodies were burned, and no official
 actions were taken to apprehend or punish'those responsible.
 
 
 212
 MADAGASCAR
 b. Disappearance
 Following the clash on August 10, opposition leaders claimed 57
 persons who had participated in the march on Iavoloha were
 missing and had been killed and buried. Though requested to do
 so, the opposition did not provide a list of names of those
 said to be missing, and no relatives came forward in response
 to an appeal by a local human rights group. The presidential
 palace turned over two bodies to families of the deceased.
 Prime Minister Guy Razanamasy set up a commission of inquiry to
 formally investigate the events of August 10. Also, the
 opposition-dominated High Authority of State announced an
 investigation. By year's end, the Prime Minister's report had
 been turned over to the Ministry of Justice, though its content
 was not publicized.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 In the past, the DGIDIE (the intelligence unitY has beaten
 prisoners in its custody, although there were no reports of
 such abuses in 1991. The director of the DGIDIE, a judge
 appointed in mid-1990, has attempted to reform the
 organization, stating publicly in 1991 that the role of the
 DGIDIE was to protect the rights of the individual.
 Conditions in Malagasy prisons are harsh and life threatening.
 The diet provided is inadequate, and family members must
 augment inmates' daily food rations. Those prisoners without
 .relatives in the vicinity sometimes go for days without food
 and some have starved in the past. Prison cells built for one
 inmate are now housing up to eight. Each prisoner has on
 average less than one square meter of space. Prisoners suffer
 a wide range of medical problems that are not routinely
 treated, including malnourishment, infections, malaria, and
 tuberculosis. The prison death toll rises significantly during
 the winter months. A number of children live in the prisons
 with their mothers, and there is prostitution by female inmates
 in collusion with guards.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Legal safeguards against arbitrary arrest and detention are not
 always followed. According to the law, in a normal criminal
 case, the detainee must be charged or released within 3 days
 after arrest. An arrest warrant may be obtained but is not
 always required. Generally, defendants in ordinary criminal
 cases are charged formally within the specified time frame,
 and, upon being charged, are allowed to obtain an attorney.
 Counsel is readily available, and court-appointed counsel is
 provided for indigents. Bail may be requested by the accused
 or his attorney immediately after arrest, after being formally
 charged, or during the appeal process. Denial of bail may be
 appealed. The Malagasy penal code provides for a determination
 of habeas corpus.
 Despite these legal provisions, average pretrial detention time
 exceeds 1 year, and 3 or 4 years of detention is common, even
 for crimes for which the maximum penalty may be 2 years or
 less. Prisoners may wait years in prison only to be found not
 guilty, with no recourse. The judicial process, always slow,
 was mired down even further in 1991 by a magistrates' strike in
 support of the political opposition. During July and August,
 several hundred prisoners walked away from their places of
 incarceration when prison guards joined the strike.
 
 
 213
 MADAGASCAR
 Under Malagasy law, persons suspected of activity against the
 State may be detained incommunicado for 15 days, subject to
 indefinite extension if deemed necessary by the Government.
 Over the summer the opposition named a shadow government as
 part of its strategy to contest power and instructed its shadow
 ministers to occupy government ministries. In July four of the
 shadow ministers were detained by government security forces.'
 Two were detained while trying to enter ministry buildings; the
 other two were taken into custody on the street. They were
 held incommunicado and released several days later. While two
 of the detentions were witnessed and one actually photographed,
 the other two were not verified and were treated with some
 skepticism in the press. The abductions were believed to have
 been carried out by the Government's antiterrorist squad. None
 of the'incidents were ever investigated, and the guilty parties
 remain unpunished. At the end of 1991, there were no persons
 held under this provision.
 In late July and early August, 57 arrests were made in the port
 city of Toamasina during the demonstrations. The arrests were
 authorized by the mayor and carried out by gendarmerie
 "antigang" units who concealed their identities and security
 affiliation. A Malagasy lawyer questioned whether these units
 were legally empowered to make the arrests, stating that only
 military police or gendarmes using proper arrest procedures
 have that authority. It was reported that the detainees had
 been denied access to counsel and to family members. All
 detainees were confirmed released by late September.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Malagasy trials are public,'and defendants have the right to be
 present, to confront witnesses, and to present evidence.
 Defendants enjoy a presumption of innocence under the Malagasy
 penal code.
 The 1975 Constitution provides for an independent judiciary,
 and, in practice, the judiciary seems to function largely
 without influence from the executive. However, the judiciary,
 unlike the executive and legislative branches, is not a
 separate branch of government. One aim of the 1991
 magistrates' strike was constitutional reform to raise the
 judiciary to the level of a separate government branch.
 The judiciary has three levels of courts: lower courts for
 civil and criminal cases carrying limited fines and sentences;
 a Court of Appeals which includes a criminal court for cases
 carrying sentences of 5 years or more; and a Supreme Court.
 The judiciary also has a number of special courts designed to
 handle specific kinds of cases under the jurisdiction of the
 higher courts.
 The Constitutional High Court, with a separate and autonomous
 status, is a body for review of laws, decrees, and ordinances,
 and for oversight of elections and certification of their
 results. It is clearly separated from the judicial hierarchy.
 Extralegal institutions known as "dina" also exist as a means
 of conflict resolution. Dina are village-based pacts and exist
 as specific agreements between villages. Technically, dina
 handle only civil matters among villages; criminal cases are to
 be turned over to the court system. In practice, the dina have
 been used to settle cattle rustling cases, prevalent in the
 south. Decisions by dina are not subject to procedural
 protections of due process or to judicial review. Dina are
 
 
 214
 MADAGASCAR
 traditional means of conflict resolution. Decisions are
 considered just as long as the parties involved accept this
 traditional concept.
 A military court has jurisdiction over all cases involving
 national security. The definition of national security is
 largely a matter of interpretation by the authorities but
 includes acts constituting a threat to the nation and its
 political leaders, invasion by foreign forces, and riots that
 could lead to an overthrow of the Government. In exceptional
 cases,-civilians may be tried in the military court if charged
 with breaking military laws. Military courts, like civilian
 courts, provide for an appeal process and are presided over by
 civilian magistrates. The rank of the four military officers
 comprising the court is determined by the rank of the accused.
 There were no reports of political prisoners being held in
 Madagascar at year's end.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The State does not generally intervene in the private aspects
 of the lives of the people. The home is inviolable under
 Malagasy tradition and law, though the Constitution permits
 authorities, to enter homes where a suspect is caught in a
 criminal act or where the owner explicitly consents to a
 search. There is no known monitoring of telephones or
 correspondence.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Press censorship was suspended in 1989 and formally abolished
 in December 1990. Beginning in 1989, the print media have
 openly criticized both the Government and the opposition.
 Opposition parties, independent trade unions, professional
 associations and others have benefited from regular access to
 the newspapers and journals and often have their statements
 published. Following the temporary reimposition of censorship
 under the State of Emergency in July, the press first printed
 both censored and uncensored editions and then, within a few
 days, decided to ignore the censor because the Government did
 not enforce the emergency censorship regulation.
 By mid-1991, the state-owned Malagasy Radio-Television (RTM)
 had begun to broadcast a weekly discussion program, often
 featuring prominent opposition figures, and to televise live
 each evening the French Antenne 2 network news. However, the
 Government kept close watch over these important media
 outlets. During May and June, the RTM provided limited
 coverage of opposition activities, and in late June RTM ceased
 coverage of opposition activities altogether. RTM personnel
 joined the general strike in part to protest this tight
 government control. While a portion of the RTM strikers
 returned following the installation of a new cabinet led by
 Prime Minister Razanamasy in late August, some of the remaining
 RTM strikers created a private radio station, Radio Active
 Forces, without benefit of'a license from the Government. In
 October Prime Minister Razanamazy gained control of television
 facilities which had been moved to the presidential palace.
 Since then, television news has covered the full spectrum of
 political activities. A Sunday program was inauguarated in
 October featuring lively debate among political figures.
 
 
 MADAGASCAR
 Academic freedom was in theory restricted by a constitutional
 prohibition of any public lectures or teachings that condemn
 the Socialist revolution. However, this provision was deleted
 in the constitutional reform package presented by President
 Ratsiraka to the National Assembly in June. In 1991 high
 school students in Antananarivo were prevented from taking
 their baccalaureate examinations by opposition demonstrators.
 Teacher strikes which mingled opposition and union demands
 largely paralyzed the public education sector during the second
 half of the year.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Some legal restrictions remain on the right of assembly and
 association. Municipal permits are required to hold public
 meetings and may be denied by the Government on the grounds of
 endangering national security. However, from the time-the
 protest movement began in May, Antananarivo municipal
 authorities granted the opposition permission to hold their
 rallies. Despite the State of Emergency, which technically
 banned political meetings, municipal authorities continued to
 permit opposition rallies to take place. However, in several
 cities, -the Government set up security zones which
 demonstrators were not allowed to enter. The violent events
 cited in Section l.a. took place as marchers crossed into these
 security zones. Municipal authorization for rallies and
 marches continued through year's end.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The Constitution provides for freedom of religion. The
 Government is secular, and there is no discrimination on the
 basis of religious affiliation. Between 40 and 50 percent of
 the population adheres to Christian beliefs, with the remainder
 following traditional Malagasy beliefs, Islam, and other
 faiths. Missionaries and clergy are permitted to operate
 freely.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 There is no restriction on travel within the country. All
 Malagasy must obtain official approval for trips outside the
 country. All residents of Madagascar (Malagasy and foreign)
 require exit visas issued by the Ministry of Interior, but
 these are seldom denied. There is no refugee population in
 Madagascar.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 At the end of the year, this right remained in question as
 Madagascar had not yet-undergone fully free and fair general
 elections. However, a transitional process intended to bring
 about a new constitution and new elections by 1993 was under
 way. Under these interim arrangements brought about by popular
 pressure, governmental power had shifted substantially from
 President Ratsiraka and the institutions of the 1975
 Constitution to Prime Minister Razanamazy and the transitional
 institutions established under the October 31 convention. The
 legislature and Supreme Revolutionary Council had been
 suspended in accord with the convention, and the nonelected,
 transitional institutions that replaced them provided for
 significant opposition representation. A 36-member Cabinet for
 the transitional Government was named in mid-December in which
 
 
 216
 MADAGASCA.
 the Active Forces held some key ministries and about 40 percent
 of all seats; the Cabinet had no AREMA members.
 Suffrage is universal, with no discrimination based on sex or
 minority status. There is recognition among members of the
 MMSM, the opposition parties, and civic organizations that the
 electoral system must be reformed in order to prevent such
 abuses as voter intimidation at the local level.
 The electoral system is complex, with individual parties, not
 the national Government, responsible for printing ballots and
 distributing them to all voting sites. Costs associated with
 ballots must be borne by the parties, and only those parties
 garnering a minimum 10 percent of the vote are reimbursed for
 those costs. A special legislative by-election was held on
 February 3 to fill seats in three districts. The MMSM fielded
 three candidates, while the the Active Forces chose to present
 candidates from individual parties rather than the coalition.
 In each case, the MMSM candidate won. Although there were
 allegations of misuse of government assets in favor of the MMSM
 candidates and voter intimidation, the widely respected
 National Committee of Election Observers (CNOE) confirmed that
 the MMSM candidates were in fact the winners. At year's end,
 36 political parties were legally registered in Madagascar.
 The Christian Council of Churches (FFKM) is at the forefront of
 the constitutional reform movement and played a major role in
 mediating the compromise solution of October 31 between the
 Government and the Active Forces. The FFKM is composed of the
 Anglican, Catholic, Lutheran, and Church of Jesus Christ
 (Protestant reformed) Churches, representing about 50 percent
 of the Christian churches operatinq in Madagascar.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Human rights groups are considered to be political groups under
 Malagasy law and must register with the Government. At the
 beginning of 1991, the National Committee of Election Observers
 attempted to register as a.nonpartisan, human rights group but
 was denied registration by the Ministry of the Interior, which
 insisted that CNOE shouId register as a political group. While
 an appeal to the courts is pending, CNOE continues to function
 and increasingly played a mediation role in 1991 during the
 political crisis. In the last half of the year, a number of
 new human rights organizations emerged, although in no instance
 had the application process for their legal registration been
 completed at year's end. Magistrates have been on strike for
 several months, causing serious backlogs in the legal system.
 The Government historically has not cooperated with groups
 wishing to investigate alleged human rights violations. In
 1991 it did permit visits by regional delegates of the
 International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to confer on
 educational activities with regional representatives of the
 Malagasy chapter of the Red Cross.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Madagascar is inhabited by approximately 12 million people,
 mainly of mixed Malayo-Polynesian and African origins, and are
 divided into 18 distinct groups based on regional and ancestral
 affiliation. While legal discrimination does not exist,
 
 
 MADAGASCAR
 favoritism based on regional origin is often a. determining
 factor in selecting personnel for positions in ministries and
 the private sector. In addition, in 1991 supporters of the
 President attempted to exploit ethnic tensions to counter the
 opposition movement.
 An Indo-Pakistani community of about 24,000, primarily engaged
 in commerce, has been in Madagascar since the early part of
 this century. Few have integrated into local society,
 preferring to retain their language, religion, and culture, and
 most have opted to retain French.rather than Malagasy
 citizenship. There were several incidents of looting and
 burning of Indo-Pakistani enterprises in the port cities of
 Toamasina and Mahajanga during the months of June,'July, and
 August" in connection with the protest demonstrations.
 Women.have traditionally played a prominent role in the-
 business and economic life of the country, with many of them
 managing or owning business concerns or filling management
 positions in state industries. Education at all levels is open
 to women, but the participation of women in secondary and
 higher studies is much lower than that of men. Women in rural
 areas and among.the urban poor face a greater degree of
 hardship, bearing the traditional responsibilities of raising a
 family and engaging in farm labor or other subsistence
 activities., Under the law, wives have an equal say in choosing
 where a married couple will reside, and they receive a more or
 less equitable distribution of marital property in divorce
 cases. In the-case of the death of a husband, a wife inherits
 one-half of the joint marital wealth. A widow receives a
 -ension; however, a widower does not.
 According to various sources, including magistrates,
 journalists, and women doctors, violence against women, such as
 wife beating, is not widespread. Malagasy society tends to
 resolve conflict through a combination of patience and
 negotiation, and marital confrontation is not considered
 acceptable; in the rare cases where physical abuse is detected,
 police and legal authorities do intervene, although there is no
 law dealing specifically with violence against women.
 Section 6 Worker Rights -
 a. The Right of Assoiation
 The Malagasy in both the public and private sector have the
 right in law and in practice to establish and join labor unions
 of their own choosing without prior authorization. Unions are
 required to register with the Government, and registration is
 routinely granted. However, the labor force of 4.9 million is
 mostly agrarian (85 percent), and unionized labor accounts for
 less than 5 percent of the total. Many unions are affiliated
 with political parties.
 In organizing workers during opposition rallies this year, the
 Active Forces bypassed the unions and organized "strike
 committees." These committees made the decision to strike or
 not to strike for the opposition throughout the period of
 political turmoil. Civil servants, with the exception of those
 providing "vital services to the nation," and private sector
 workers have the right to strike as provided for in the Labor
 Code, and many strikes occurred in 1991, including a civil #
 servants' strike which lasted over several months and brought
 the Government to a near stop. Opposition calls for general
 strikes to exert pressure on the Government were very effective.
 
 
 218
 MADAGASCAR
 Unions may freely form federations or confederations and
 affiliate with and participate in international bodies. There
 are Malagasy members in all three trade union internationals.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 Both public and private sector union activity is governed by
 the Labor Code of 1975, which provides for free unions and the
 right to bargain collectively. The Code states that collective
 bargaining may be undertaken between management and labor at
 either party's behest. When there is failure to reach
 agreement, the Ministry of Labor convenes a committee of
 employment inspectors who attempt to resolve the matter. If
 this process fails, the committee refers the matter to the
 Chairman of the Court of Appeals for final arbitration.
 Collective bargaining agreements are not routinely negotiated
 but do exist. In 1991 the strike at the port of Toamasina was
 ended by collective bargaining-
 Although export processing zones are authorized in Madagascar,
 none is currently functioning.
 The Labor Code formally prohibits antiunion discrimination by
 employers against union members and organizers. In the case of
 antiunion activity, the union or its members may file a
 petition in civil court challenging the employer. While union
 activity in this country- of high unemployment had been minimal
 in the past, much of the unionized population was on strike
 during the latter half of 1991. In the case of the civil
 service, salaries were paid, though sometimes late, during the
 extended period of the strike, despite acute shortages of funds
 due to the dire state of the economy.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory-Labor
 Forced labor is explicitly prohibited by the Labor Code and is
 not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children
 The Labor Code describes a child as any person under the age of
 18. The minimum age for employment is 14, and the use of child
 labor is prohibited in those areas where there is apparent and
 imminent danger. The Government enforces these child labor
 laws relatively effectively in the small wage sector through
 inspectors from the Ministry of Civil Service, Labor, and
 Social Law. However, in the large subsistence agricultural
 sector, many young children work with their parents on family
 farms at much earlier ages. Similarly, in the urban areas,
 many children earn a living as parking attendants, newspaper
 vendors, and through other street trading.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The Labor Code and its enforcing legislation prescribe the
 working conditions and wage scales for employees, to be
 enforced by the Ministry of Labor and Social Law. The law
 distinguishes between agricultural and nonagricultural work.
 There is a 44-hour workweek in nonagricultural and service
 industries. There are also provisions for holiday pay, sick
 and maternity leave, and insurance. There are several
 administratively determined minimum-wage rates in Madagascar,
 depending on employment skills. The lowest (for unskilled
 workers) is inadequate to ensure a decent standard of living.
 Accordingly, such workers must supplement their incomes through
 
 
 219
 MADAGASCAR
 subsistence agriculture or reliance on the extended family
 structure. Given insufficient enforcement measures, official
 wage rates are sometimes ignored as high unemployment leads
 workers to accept salaries below the .legal wage.
 The Labor Code has rules concerning building safety, machinery
 and moving engines, operational safety, and'tanitation
 ostensibly enforced by the Ministry of Civil Service and the
 Ministry of Labor and Social Law. Labor inspectors do
 regularly visit industrial sites, and violations of Labor Code
 rules are subject to inspection reports. If cited violations
 are not remedied within a specified time frame, violators may
 be legally charged and subject to penalties. Nevertheless, in
 several sectors, protective measures are lacking due to the
 expense of even minimal protective clothing and other
 protective devices. To date, there have been no published
 reports on occupational health hazards, although there is clear
 evidence that they exist.
 In.any case, for 1991 discussions of enforcement-of the Labor
 Code were theoretical. Without a functioning government for
 much of the year, and with the civil servants' strike, the
 administrative apparatus was effectively out of operation.
