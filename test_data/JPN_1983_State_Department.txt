 JAPAN
 Japan is a parliamentary democracy in which democratic
 institutions are firmly established. Its industrial free-market
 economy is the second largest in the world in terms of Grdss
 National Product. Japan's culture incorporates many elements
 from the West while retaining strong Eastern roots. Buddhist
 and Shinto traditions continue to have a basic and pervasive
 influence on thought and social institutions, but several minor
 religions also flourish. Christianity is represented by less
 than one percent of the population. Though the Japanese are
 receptive to foreign ideas, the citizens of this densely
 populated nation have a cultural, ethnic, and racial homogeneity
 which makes them less willing or able to integrate alien
 residents in Japan into their society.
 The Japanese Constitution states, "All of the people are equal
 under the law and there shall be no discrimination in political,
 economic or social relations because of race, creed, sex, social
 status, or family origin." The human rights guaranteed by the
 Constitution are secured by a just and efficient legal system.
 Political liberties are guaranteed to all nationals, and over 70
 per cent of the electorate usually vote in general elections
 which involve candidates from seven freely-functioning political
 parties. The right of workers to organize and to bargain and
 act collectively is guaranteed by the Constitution with about 31
 percent of the active work force belonging to labor unions.
 Most unions are involved in political activity as well as labor
 relations.
 While the legal system has gradually evolved toward granting
 equality of opportunity to minorities there has been little
 change in the social prejudice against Koreans, approximately
 670,000 of whom are first, second, third, and fourth generation
 permanent residents, in addition to 116,000 naturalized Japanese
 nationals of Korean ancestry. As of September, 1983, 27 alien
 residents (including 23 Koreans and 3 Americans) had refused to
 be fingerprinted in accordance with the Alien Registration Act.
 Some of them were indicted and faced trial while others were
 refused reentry permits by the Justice Ministry on the grounds
 that they had violated Japanese law. In turn, the individuals
 in question charged that they had been deprived of certain
 rights guaranteed by the Japanese Constitution, since Japanese
 nationals are not subject to similar requirements. An
 estimtated 1.2 million Japanese, considered outcasts
 (Burakumin), have suffered social but not legal proscription.
 The Ministry of Justice has drafted legislation aimed at
 revising the nationality law to give women equal status with men
 in conferring nationality on their children, and the Ministry of
 Labor is currently drafting standards to guarantee equal
 employment and promotion opportunities for women. Both measures
 are scheduled to be introduced and passed in the Diet
 (Parliament) in 1984 in order to allow Japan to ratify by 1985
 the United Nations Convention on the Abolition of Discrimination
 Against Women.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1     Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 
 
 790
 There are no known cases of murder for political motive on the
 part of the Government. A left-wing extremist group, the
 Chukaku-Ha (Nucleus Faction), claimed responsibility for a
 firebomb attack on a Narita Airport pipeline construction site
 in June that killed two workmen.
 b. Disappearance
 There are no known cases in which people have been abducted,
 secretly arrested, or held in clandestine detention by security
 forces or any other organization.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Freedom from torture, cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or
 punishment is guaranteed by the Constitution and respected in
 practice. Criminal sentences do not include physical
 punishment. There is no evidence that penal treatment varies by
 social class, sex, or religion.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest or imprisonment is guaranteed by
 the Constitution and respected in practice. Japanese law
 provides for a writ of habeas corpus. Individuals cannot be
 detained without charge, and prosecuting authorities must be
 prepared to demonstrate before trial that sufficient evidence
 exists to detain the accused. The length of time before a
 suspect is brought to trial depends on the nature of the crime,
 but rarely exceeds two months; the average is one to two months.
 Preventive detention does not exist, and no political prisoners
 are held in Japan.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution guarantees the right to a speedy and public
 trial by an impartial tribunal in all criminal cases, and this
 right is respected in practice. The defendant is made aware of
 charges upon arrest and guaranteed a public trial by an
 independent civilian court with defense counsel and the right to
 cross examination. Defense counsels have free and private
 access to defendants and have the right of access to evidence
 after a formal indictment has been made and before a trial.
 Defendants also are protected from self-incrimination and the
 application of ex post facto laws. Judges are appointed by the
 Cabinet for permanent terms but face periodic review through
 popular referendum. A defendant who is dissatisfied with the
 decision of a trial court of first instance may, within the
 period prescribed by law, appeal to a high court as the
 reviewing court.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home or
 Correspondence
 Under the Constitution, each search or seizure shall be made
 upon separate warrant issued by a judicial officer. Japanese
 authorities have been scrupulous in observing the legal
 requirements for warrants. The standards for issuing such
 warrants exist to guard against arbitrary searches. There are
 no reports that the Government or any other organization has
 arbitrarily interfered with privacy, family, home, or
 correspondence.
 
 
 Section 2     Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Japanese Constitution, an independent press and judiciary,
 and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure
 freedom of speech and press.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 These freedoms are guaranteed by the Constitution and respected
 in practice. Japanese law grants unions the right to organize.
 strike, bargain collectively, lobby, and make political campaign
 contributions, and they actively do so. Unions are involved
 also in international bodies and bilateral exchanges. Public
 corporation employees do not have the right to strike but do
 have recourse to mediation and arbitration in order to resolve
 disputes. Members of the armed forces, police officers, and
 fire fighters are not permitted to organize. In an attempt to
 prevent the Japan Teachers' Union (Nikkyoso) from holding its
 annual convention in Yubaru, Okayama Prefecture, in 1983,
 right-wing extremists used threats and harassment to intimidate
 prefectural and municipal officials into refusing the union the
 use of public facilities at the convention site. Numerous city
 hotels also refused to accept Nikkyoso's delegates. Despite the
 disruptive tactics of 1,500 rightists equipped with 200 sound
 trucks, the union, with extensive police protection, held its
 convention in a prefabricated building hastily constructed on
 private land to which it bussed delegates from out-of-town inns.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 Freedom of religion is guaranteed by the Constitution and
 respected in practice. While Buddhism and Shinto remain the two
 major religions, there are many others, including several
 Christian denominations. Missionaries are welcome and receive
 special visa status. Some temples and shrines, as treasured
 national properties, receive public support for maintenance.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Nationals have the right to travel freely, both within Japan and
 abroad, to change their place of residence, to emigrate, and to
 repatriate voluntarily. Nationality is never revoked.
 Section 3     Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 As a parliamentary democracy, Japan is ruled by the political
 party able to form a majority in the lower House of its
 bicameral Diet. The Liberal Democratic Party currently holds a
 parliamentary majority. Six opposition parties are active,
 ranging from a Communist Party to a moderate conservative
 party. All adult nationals have the right to vote, and voting
 rates for lower house elections generally surpass 70 percent.
 Vote is by secret ballot. Political interest groups can
 organize and engage in nonviolent political activity regardless
 of their political hue. Well organized labor unions ensure
 participation by workers in the political process.
 According to law, aliens with five years continuous residence
 are eligible for naturalization and the simultaneous acquisition
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 51
 
 
 792
 of citizenship rights, including the right to vote. In fact,
 however, few eligible aliens have been naturalized.
 Naturalization is a difficult and complicated process requiring
 "proof of assimilation into the Japanese culture," and many
 Korean residents are unwilling to seek naturalization on the
 grounds that their cultural identity would be erased by the
 requirements. Although the law does not require applicants for
 naturalization to take on Japanese names, in practice the
 Ministry of Justice strongly encourages them to do so, and only
 a few who have been naturalized have retained their previous
 names. Korean human rights activists have urged Japan to
 restore unconditionally the citizenship which Korean residents
 of Japan had previously but which was revoked after World War II.
 Section 4     Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-Governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There were no known instances in 1983 of international
 investigations of alleged human rights violations in Japan. In
 past cases of alleged violations brought before the United
 Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC), the Japanese Government
 cooperated fully in the investigation of the allegations.
 Through its membership in the UNHRC, the Japanese Government
 plays an active role in working for the improvement of human
 rights practices in other countries.
 A large number of private organizations in Japan are interested
 in human rights. They mainly lobby against the death penalty,
 for increased social and economic opportunities for minorities,
 for certain rights and benefits denied nonnationals, and for
 human rights in other countries. By keeping these cases before
 the public eye, they have helped gradually to change the way
 many Japanese people and the Government view these problems.
 Amnesty International in its 1983 report expressed concern about
 the existence of capital punishment. Freedom House in 1983
 rated Japan as "free."
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Good quality food, shelter, health care, and education are
 widely available to inhabitants of Japan regardless of race,
 religion, sex, ethnic background, or political opinion.
 Discrimination by private employers against women continues
 despite its prohibition by the Constitution and by legislative
 measures adopted over the past 30 years to accord women the same
 legal status as men. A 1983 Government White Paper on the
 Status of Women noted that, as of 1981, 45 percent of companies
 discriminated against women in hiring and promotion. To
 eliminate such discrimination and to complement existing laws
 stipulating equal pay for equal work, the Ministry of Labor is
 drafting legislation for equality in employment standards which
 it hopes to submit to the Diet in 1984. Women hold 27 of 746
 seats in the Diet.
 The Government has enacted several laws and regulations in
 recent years extending to permanent resident aliens, 85 percent
 of whom are Koreans, the benefits of equal access to public
 housing, limited-tenure employment at public colleges and
 universities, and old age pensions for those who pay into the
 system for the requisite 25 years. Nevertheless, nationally-run
 institutions of higher learning still have not hired any
 
 
 793
 permanent resident Koreans, and Government guidelines
 restricting civil service jobs to nationals have prevented all
 but a handful of Korean residents from being hired as public
 school teachers. Local civil rights groups also charge that
 pensions will not be granted to the estimated 200,000 Korean
 residents who will not have paid into the system for the
 requisite 25 years before they reach age 60. Entrenched social
 prejudice against both Koreans and members of the Burakumin, or
 outcast, community (those who practice, or whose ancestors
 practiced, so called "unclean" professions such as hide tanning)
 restricts the access of both groups to private housing and
 employment and marriage opportunities.
 Japan's population in 1983 was 119,205,000, growing at an annual
 rate of 0.6 percent. The infant mortality rate was 6.8 per
 1,000 live births in 1983, while life expectancy at birth in
 1980 was 75.5 years. With a highly competitive education system
 that provides nine years of free, compulsory schooling, Japan
 has a primary school enrollment ratio of 101 per cent and has
 long had nearly total adult literacy. The ratio of calorie
 supply available for consumption relative to nutritional
 requirements was 125.95 percent in 1977.
