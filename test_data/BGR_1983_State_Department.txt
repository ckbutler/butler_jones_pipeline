 BULGARIA
 The Bulgarian political system is patterned after that of the
 Soviet Union, dominated by the Communist Party. While the
 Government claims to be a "dictatorship of the proletariat"
 according to the tenets of Marxism-Leninism. it is in fact a
 dictatorship run by the leaders of the elitist Communist Party,
 which comprises less than ten percent of the population. While
 official "elections" are held, no opposing candidates or
 viewpoints are allowed. The Government, especially the National
 Assembly, does include some members of a nominally non-Communist
 party, and some "non-party members", but they do not detract
 from the total domination of governmental functions by the
 Communist Party. The Communist regime has allowed no free
 elections since Soviet armed forces imposed the present system
 of government near the the end of World War I.
 The Communist Party uses a variety of means to impose its
 control over nearly all facets of peoples' lives. It
 manipulates basic human rights such as free expression, religion
 and assembly, due process of law, and the privacy and integrity
 of the person through such institutions as the party itself;
 labor, youth, professional, factory and similar mass
 organizations; and government agencies including the state
 security apparatus with its network of agents and informers.
 Those few who do speak or take action against the party are
 subject to arrest and detention. Measures against the integrity
 of the person, from torture to arbitrary arrest, are taken in
 relation to the need to suppress dissent or opposition. As
 these are limited, so is the frequency of abuse in terms of
 numbers of people directly affected.
 Overwhelmingly agricultural, with a low standard of living until
 the post war years, Bulgaria has only recently become
 industrialized and urbanized. The Government has followed the
 Soviet model of economic development, stressing state ownership
 of nearly all means of production, rapid development, central
 control of the economy, and heavy industry. While still a large
 producer of agricultural goods and a relative bread-basket of
 Eastern Europe, the country has also made strides in industrial
 development. Although most Bulgarians, especially
 city-dwellers, own their own homes or apartments and can sell
 produce raised on their own private plots, the private sector of
 the economy is dwarfed by the government-controlled sector. The
 Government has taken steps in the last few years to decentralize
 economic decision-making, however, even allowing a limited
 private sector and "moon-lighting" for personal profit during
 off-duty hours.
 Bulgaria makes no secret of its support, including training and
 arms, for "national liberation movements," and the Government
 reportedly aids some international terrorist groups. Despite
 numerous press stories about Bulgarian involvement with
 terrorists, however, there was no conclusive evidence of
 Bulgarian involvement in any terrorist act during 1983.
 The Government's observance of human rights in 1983 has shown
 little change. The security apparatus has continued to harass
 the few people who dare to speak or act against government
 positions and policies. The Government continues to abridge
 basic human freedoms.

 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom From
 a.   Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 The Bulgarian criminal code calls for long prison sentences or
 the death penalty for certain political and economic crimes if
 committed by persons over 20 years of age. Crimes for which the
 death penalty may be imposed include treason, murder of a high
 government official, murder of a foreign government official,
 robbery or pillage of state property accompanied by murder or
 attempted murder, sabotage or negligent maintenance of
 transportation or water systems that leads to the death of one
 or more person, action that reduces the defense capability of
 the country, or passing state secrets to a foreign power.
 Because the broad definition of "state secrets" includes most
 economic statistics and information, persons could theoretically
 be sentenced to death for crimes related to the economy. No
 executions for such "economic" crimes have been reported.
 Death sentences in general have been rarely executed and more
 rarely announced in the last 10 years. It is impossible to give
 an accurate estimate of such executions. Trials in which the
 death sentence is imposed are almost always closed. Defense for
 the accused is sometimes inadequate. People who have fled
 Bulgaria are occasionally tried in absentia.
 b.   Disappearance
 In recent years, there have been no reports of mysterious
 disappearances in Bulgaria.
 c.   Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There continue to be unconfirmed reports of torture and cruel,
 inhuman, or degrading treatment and punishment in Bulgarian
 prisons. In 1983, a former prisoner reported that beatings were
 so frequent in prisons that the authorities found it necessary
 to post signs reminding guards not to beat prisoners.
 Reportedly at least three prisoners died during 1982 from
 beatings while in prison.
 General prison conditions are, by all reports, poor. The
 prisons are over-crowded and dilapidated. Prisoners accused of
 minor infractions of prison rules are subject to solitary
 confinement and are fed only once every two days. Food for all
 prisoners is said to be of bad quality and insufficient
 quantity. Visits by family and friends are allowed on a monthly
 basis for all but those sentenced for anti-government activity
 or espionage.
 d.   Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Bulgarians can be detained, punished, or tried for a large
 number of actions which are generally considered to be political
 in nature. Any type of unauthorized demonstration, public
 expression of views critical of the Government, or even the
 simple act of entering a Western embassy, can bring detention or
 arrest, although there is no law against such activity.
 Bulgarians detained for such acts are often charged with
 vaguely-worded political "crimes", or with common petty crimes,
 such as currency violations.
 
 
 935
 The principle of habeas corpus exists under the Bulgarian
 criminal code and is followed in most cases, except for those
 the Government considers politically sensitive. The law
 provides for "preliminary detention" for up to 10 days in cases
 where evidence indicates some justification for a later
 indictment. The accused.can be held for formal indictment for
 up to six months provided charges have been made. In all cases,
 according to the law, the accused must be informed of the
 charges pending against him. However, Bulgarians have
 reportedly been held in some cases without being told what they
 were charged with.
 There are occasional reports of exile and of informal
 detention. Militia authorities have required certain people to
 appear at the local police station several times daily to
 register. This informal detention in one's town rather than
 inside prison walls is apparently imposed without any sort of
 due process of law. Another form of punishment used is forced
 change of domicile, or internal exile. A person's right to live
 in a certain town may be revoked, and he may be required to move
 to a town far away from family, friends, and familiar
 surroundings.
 e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Bulgarian law and general practice provide for public trial in
 criminal cases. Defendants are entitled to counsel, but only
 after a preliminary investigation, sometimes lasting many weeks,
 has been completed and an indictment prepared. In the meantime,
 the accused may be detained without access to counsel..
 Special court procedures exist for cases involving state
 security. A trial may be held in camera to preserve a state
 secret or to protect "socialist morality". Amnesty
 International has reported that in political cases witnesses
 have been intimidated by the police into testifying against the
 accused and that the defendant's family and friends have been
 barred from the courtroom during the trial.
 While the Bulgarian penal system generally follows the letter of
 the law, the "spirit" behind legal safeguards in the law is
 often ignored, calling into question the effectiveness of those
 safeguards in protecting the individual. A basic problem is
 that, while the laws themselves are codified and published,
 numerous procedural and administrative regulations are not.
 Frequently, such regulations, most of which are secret, are
 invoked arbitrarily. The defendant and his counsel have little
 recourse, since the regulation in question cannot easily be
 verified. Manipulation of these procedural regulations in the
 judicial system enables the Government to manipulate the
 circumstances and outcome of trials.
 f.   Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home or
 Correspondence
 The Bulgarian Government interferes in its citizens' private
 lives in myriad ways. An elaborate system of informers,
 directed by the party and security apparatus, with
 representation at virtually all work places, residential areas,
 and social organizations, monitors Bulgarians' daily lives in
 search of signs of dissidence or other unacceptable behavior.
 Sanctity of the home is safeguarded by law, and police may
 legally search property only with prior permission from a court
 or prosecutor. However, searches may be undertaken in urgent
 situations before judicial permission is given. Citizens who
 
 30-231 0 - 84 - 60
 
 
 936
 have attracted the Government's attention through contact with
 foreigners by mail, telephone, or in person, are subject to
 closer scrutiny. Such cases may involve close monitoring of all
 correspondence and telephone conversations and possible
 clandestine entry into homes. Loss of job and forced
 resettlement in another part of the country are possible
 consequences of continued activities which the Government might
 view as dissidence.
 The Government also organizes the private lives of its
 citizens. Virtually all citizens are expected to belong to mass
 political organizations. Children and young adults belong to
 the Pioneers and Komsomol while their elders join the Fatherland
 Front or, in the case of the elite, the Communist Party. There
 appears to be strong pressure on all citizens at least to pay
 dues and become nominal members of these mass organizations.
 Those who choose not to do so, an extremely small percentage of
 the population, are likely to be refused normal promotions and
 other benefits, and might come under official scrutiny.
 The Government tries to insulate its populace from foreign
 influence of nearly all kinds. International mail and telephone
 conversations are assumed to be closely monitored. Many radio
 broadcasts from the West are jammed. Western publications are
 virtually unavailable in Bulgaria. The end of Bulgarian jamming
 of Voice of America broadcasts during 1983 is a positive step,
 but should be seen more in the context of bilateral relations
 than information policy.
 in the case of one minority group, the Pomaks, the Bulgarian
 authorities have reportedly even interfered with the normal
 documentation of births, marriages, and other civil
 proceedings. The Pomaks, numbering some two hundred thousand in
 Bulgaria, are ethnic Slavs whose ancestors converted to Islam
 during the five hundred years of Turkish rule. Many, but not
 all, have kept the Muslim religion, habits, dress, and names.
 According to several sources, the Bulgarian authorities have
 refused in some areas to issue marriage documents, diplomas and
 other civil documents to Pomaks who keep their Muslim names and
 refuse to accept Bulgarian-style names.
 Section 2   Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a.   Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Bulgarian Constitution guarantees certain basic rights
 including rights to citizenship, work, rest, access to health
 care and free education, speech, press, association and
 demonstration, and freedom of worship. Women are guaranteed
 equal rights with men, and all citizens are declared to be equal
 before the law, regardless of national origin, creed, social
 status, education, or sex. In practice, these freedoms are
 circumscribed to varying degrees, and they are not permitted to
 be exercised in any way that might weaken Communist Party
 control. The State controls the press, decides which political
 organizations may exist, and determines which political
 demonstrations may take place.
 Domestic opposition to the state or Communist Party is not
 tolerated. If found, it is dealt with promptly and severely
 with prison sentences. For example, it is against the law to
 establish "an illegal anti-state organization". Criticizing the
 State is also illegal and subject to severe penalties. The
 Criminal Code proscribes the dissemination of "untruthful
 remarks which might increase mistrust of innocuous information"
 (for example, the size of the foreign debt).
 
 
 937
 Although censorship does not exist officially, the media are
 controlled and must operate within well-understood party and
 state guidelines and practices. For example, international news
 is usually limited to that provided by the government news
 agency or official Soviet sources. Forbidden topics in the
 Bulgarian press include unauthorized criticism of party and
 state leaders, of socialist ideology, and of the U.S.S.R. and
 other socialist countries. Self-censorship exists in the press
 and is practiced carefully by virtually the entire population at
 all times. Opposition views have not been aired since 1947,
 when the last independent newspapers were taken over by the
 state.
 The public is permitted to send criticism, suggestions, and
 complaints by letter to newspapers and to National Assembly
 representatives on a broad range of topics, such as inadequate
 service from public agencies and housing shortages. None of the
 published letters goes beyond criticisms of specific economic or
 services shortfalls, or failures of individuals in government
 administration. None deals with fundamental questions of how
 society, the economy, and the nation's political life are
 structured. In this limited way, the state allows some open
 criticism to take place, and reportedly tries to investigate
 complaints and respond to them.
 b.   Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.
 In practice, freedom of assembly is a right granted only to
 legally constituted organizations and only for approved
 purposes. Private associations in any normal sense are totally
 unknown. Public assemblies are never spontaneous, but rather
 are organized by the party or Government to achieve a particular
 purpose. Because of strict social controls, the possibility of
 an unauthorized group demonstration is remote.
 Bulgaria does not have an active free trade union movement. The
 unions that do exist are totally organized and controlled by the
 Government to increase its support among the people and to
 increase quality and quantity of production. Unions are not in
 a position to negotiate or strike for better pay or work
 conditions. They represent more often the interests of the
 management rather than those of the workers. The trade unions
 also organize vacations for workers and look after the general
 social welfare of their members, within the limits prescribed by
 the party and state.
 People working in the professions, such as lawyers, doctors,
 artists, musicians, writers, and academics are represented by
 "professional unions" which have the same functions as the labor
 unions. The professional unions are used as instruments of
 control just as are the labor unions. Professional unions are
 more likely to have contacts with foreign, even Western
 professional associations, however, and arrange foreign travel
 for their most trusted members to attend conferences and take
 part in various international exchanges.
 c.   Freedom of Religion
 Bulgaria is officially an atheistic state, and religious belief
 is not considered compatible with party membership or high
 Government position. In fact, people are regularly forced to
 choose between their religious beliefs and their careers.
 The practice of religion is generally discouraged, but it is
 nevertheless possible to attend religious services in a number
 of faiths and sects. Bulgarian Orthodoxy, the state religion
 
 
 938
 before the communists came to power, is the largest and most
 "acceptable" in the Government's view, largely because of the
 church's historical and cultural role. The church receives
 substantial financial aid from the Government in return for the
 church's support of the Government's policies in areas of mutual
 interest, such as propaganda for peace and disarmament. The
 Government also allows the Bulgarian Orthodox Church to gain
 revenue through the sale of candles, printing of certain
 religious brochures, etc.
 The two other main religions whose position is recognized by the
 state are Islam and Judaism. Bulgaria has about one million
 Muslims, mostly ethnic Turks, with some ethnic Bulgarians.
 Although the Sofia Mosque is being renovated at government
 expense, Amnesty International has reported that some Muslim
 believers have in recent years been imprisoned because of their
 religion. The fewer than five thousand Jews remaining in
 Bulgaria also receive some government funding, especially for
 their ethnic and cultural activities (rather than religious
 activities). The Sofia temple is also undergoing renovation
 with state funds.
 Relations between churches and the Government are regulated by
 the Foreign Ministry's "Committee for Questions of the Bulgarian
 Orthodox Church and Religious Cults". Although no churches are
 "licensed", only the Orthodox, Muslim, and Jewish religions
 enjoy official support. A number of other religions and sects
 are allowed to have churches and congregations in Bulgaria.
 Included in this group are: Catholics (both Uniate and Roman),
 Evangelicals, Baptists, Pentecostalists, Seventh Day Adventists,
 Armenians, Congregationalists, and Methodists.
 In spite of the Government's relatively tolerant position on the
 operation of churches, definite limits are placed on allowed
 activities. The training of clergy in all sects in numbers
 adequate to serve believers remains a problem. The Government
 has limited, albeit unofficially, the number of seminarians,
 both Protestant and Catholic, who can be trained in Bulgaria and
 abroad. Foreign missionaries are not permitted to enter
 Bulgaria to try to preach to the populace. Formal religious
 education of children under age 16 is prohibited. Importation
 of religious books is strictly controlled. Four years ago
 several Pentecostalists were jailed for currency violations when
 they tried to import Bibles. However, a Bulgarian language
 Bible was distributed in Bulgaria recently, but in limited
 numbers.
 d.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Bulgarian Government controls where its people live, work,
 and travel. All Bulgarians carry a personal identity card with
 them at all times stating their legal place of residence and
 work. Without this card, they cannot purchase domestic airline
 tickets, register at a hotel, or seek any kind of social service
 (such as medical assistance, etc.). Change of either place of
 residence or work is a complicated process unless the change is
 at the Government's initiative and convenience. Moving to Sofia
 from the provinces is especially difficult, because of the
 Government's desire to limit the size of the city. Travel
 around the country is unrestricted, except for border areas
 where nonlocal Bulgarians are stopped and questioned if they do
 not have special permission to be there.
 
 
 939
 Foreign travel is extremely restricted. Bulgarian citizens must
 have a passport for foreign travel and an exit visa specifying
 the destination for each trip. If they go to a country not
 mentioned in the exit permit, they face serious complications
 when and if they return home. Travel to Eastern European
 countries is encouraged; travel to the West is not. This is not
 only for political reasons but also because the Government wants
 to keep reserves of hard currency at home. Passport fees are
 also considerably higher for travel to the West. A citizen's
 application for an exit document may be refused for several
 reasons, but most often because travel is deemed "not in the
 interests of the state". Applications purely for tourist travel
 to the West are rarely approved, except for highly trusted and
 highly placed individuals, or for travel to neighboring
 countries (Greece, Turkey, Yugoslavia). Bulgarian citizens
 traveling to visit family or friends in the West must present
 declarations of support assuring that all expenses incidental to
 the trip will be borne by the foreign relative.
 Emigration is provided for by law, but is rarely permitted.
 However, the Bulgarian Government occasionally permits members
 of divided families to join relatives in the West in accordance
 with the Helsinki Final Act. In the fall of 1983, several of
 the approximately three dozen American divided-family cases were
 resolved, as were a few cases involving other Western
 countries. Bulgaria claims to have a labor shortage, and is
 generally unwilling to allow productive workers or future
 workers to leave the country, especially when their relatives
 might also apply for emigration. When emigration is allowed,
 citizenship is almost never revoked. The Government issues
 passports for five years to enable the person to return,
 although citizens are not guaranteed the right to return to
 Bulgaria.
 Generally, emigration is allowed to a citizen who has, with the
 permission of the government, married a foreigner. In applying
 for permission to marry a foreigner, however, the Bulgarian must
 sign a statement saying that he understands that permission to
 marry will not signify permission to emigrate. Occasionally,
 the marriage permission is granted while emigration permission
 is refused. In at least one case in 1983, a Bulgarian had to
 sign a statement promising not to apply for emigration before
 permission to marry was granted.
 Once a Bulgarian has applied for permission to emigrate, he is
 likely to be denied promotions, educational opportunities, and
 perhaps even his job. The effects of such punitive actions
 intensify while the applicant waits for approval to emigrate.
 The Government has encouraged the repatriation of its citizens
 in nearly all cases. in the summer of 1981, Bulgaria declared
 an amnesty for all Bulgarians who had left the country
 illegally, allowing them to return home without fear of
 prosecution. Few took advantage of this amnesty. A number of
 Bulgarian-born foreign residents and citizens who voluntarily
 return to Bulgaria to live in retirement appear to be
 well-treated by the Government. Less fortunate are those who
 are sent back against their will from other Communist countries
 for having attempted illegally to get to the West. Similarly,
 Bulgaria repatriates potential refugees from other Warsaw Pact
 members who have tried to cross the Bulgarian border into
 Greece, Turkey, or Yugoslavia.
 
 
 940
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Bulgaria is governed by a small ruling elite within the
 Bulgarian Communist Party. Rank and file members of the
 Communist Party have little, if any, actual political power or
 opportunity to change the party's policies. Non-party members
 are denied virtually any role in influencing the policies of
 their Government or in changing its form. Political pluralism
 and free participation in the political process are essentially
 non-existent.
 Bulgaria has no free elections in the Western sense, although it
 tries to maintain at least the appearance of pluralism.
 Bulgaria describes its political system as a two-party system
 composed of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the co-opted
 Bulgarian Agrarian Union. These two parties, together with
 labor, youth, and other organizations, comprise the Fatherland
 Front, an umbrella organization of Communist and non-Communist
 .progressive" elements established in 1942. In practice, the
 Fatherland Front, as well as its various organizations, are all
 ultimately controlled by the Communist Party, to which the
 Constitution gives clear primacy. The Agrarian Party runs
 separate candidates, and holds about one-fourth of the seats in
 the National Assembly, but all votes in the Assembly are
 unanimous. Candidates of the two parties do not run against one
 another, nor do they face any other opposition. Real opposition
 parties have remained effectively outlawed since the 1940's.
 From time to time, the Bulgarian press announces election
 results in which more than 99 percent of the population has
 participated in affirming the position of the party and
 Government.
 The National Assembly has no independent role in governing. No
 debate of alternatives takes place. The National Assembly never
 has a split vote and never fails to endorse government policy.
 It normally meets fewer than four times a year.
 Section 4   Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The only international human rights body in which Bulgaria
 participates is the International Red Cross. The Bulgarian
 chapter avoids human rights issues. Amnesty International has
 repeatedly investigated cases of Bulgarian human rights
 violations, and regularly publishes the results. Its 1983
 report focused on the plight of political prisoners, poor prison
 conditions, and capital punishment in Bulgaria. The Government
 has not responded to any allegations from international human
 rights groups, and has steadfastly maintained that human rights
 are strictly an internal matter for each government to resolve.
 The press regularly charges that human rights are violated in
 Western and Western-supported Third World countries but these
 comments are politically motivated.
 Bulgaria has not admitted any independent group to investigate
 questions of human rights violations, and has not responded to
 or communicated with any external non-governmental human rights
 group. There are no governmental or private organizations in
 Bulgaria (except for the judicial system, described in Section
 1, Part e above) which attempt to protect individual liberties
 or observe and report on human rights violations. Freedom House
 classifies Bulgaria "not free."
 
 
 941
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Bulgaria is relatively successful in feeding, educating, and
 looking after the basic necessities of its citizens. Its
 performance in all of these areas is better now than at any time
 in Bulgaria's history. All citizens are guaranteed a job, and
 officially there is no unemployment, although in practice
 under-employment is widespread. Basic needs are generally met
 on a non-discriminatory basis, although high party officials and
 those with access to hard currency can get superior health care,
 education, and food.
 Health care in Bulgaria is adequate, and free for citizens.
 Bulgarians' average daily caloric intake is among the highest in
 the world. The life expectancy is 72.65 years at birth, with an
 infant mortality rate of 18.90 per 1,000. Bulgaria's leaders
 are concerned about the country's low population growth rate of
 0.30 percent in 1983, and have established financial incentives
 to encourage families to have more children. Extensive
 construction of new public apartment buildings in the past
 decade has eased somewhat the general housing shortage.
 Education is free through the university level, with a system of
 merit selection for university admission. However, certain
 priorities and privileges go to the children of influential
 families. Adult literacy is high and the primary school
 enrollment is near 100 percent. Bulgarian educational and
 professional opportunities are not discriminatory against
 women. One half of the openings for university students
 available each year are reserved by law for women, who
 consequently are well represented in professions such as
 medicine. Women continue to be overrepresented in manual
 occupations in areas such as farming, light industry, and
 cleaning and maintenance.
