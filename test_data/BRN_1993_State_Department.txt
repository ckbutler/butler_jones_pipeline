 BRUNEI
 Brunei Darussalam is a small, wealthy monarchy located on the north coast of
 Borneo. The population of roughly 290,000 is predominantly Malay (65 percent).
 Chinese (15 percent), indigenous peoples (6 percent), and foreign residents (14 per-
 cent) make up the remainder. Brunei is a hereditary sultanate ruled by the same
 family for 600 years. It became a British protectorate in 1888 and fully independent
 in 1984.
 The 1959 Constitution provided for the first delegation of political power by the
 Sultan. In 1962 the Sultan invoked an article of the Constitution that allowed him
 to assume emergency powers for 2 years. These have been regularly renewed and
 remain in force. Although not all of the articles of the Constitution are suspended,
 the state of emergency places few limits on the Sultan's power. He also serves as
 Prime Minister, Minister of Defense, Dean of the National University, and chief reli-
 gious leader.
 The police force which has responsibility for internal security, reports to the
 Prime Minister's olfice and is firmly under the control of civil authorities.
 Brunei produces an average of 160,000 barrels of oil per day and about 5.5 million
 tons of liquefied natural gas per year. This bountiful natural resource endowment,
 in combination with Brunei's small population, gives it one of the world's highest
 per capita gross national products.
 In September Brunei participated in the issuance of the Kuala Lumpur Declara-
 tion which, among other things, confirmed the right of "all human beings, without
 distinction as to race, color, sex, langua-e, religion, nationality, ethnic origin, family
 or social status or personal convictions, to freedom of thought, opinion, conscience,
 and religion." Tihe Declaration also affirmed the right of citizens "freely to determine
 their political status." Nothing in Brunei's Constitution or laws states that its citi-
 zens cannot change their government. In practice, however, citizens do not have this
 right. Bruneians generally eschew political activity of any kind, knowing that such
 activity will be disapproved by the Government and ruler and may lead to punish-
 ment. Nor do Bruneians genuinely exercise the freedoms of speech, press, and asso-
 ciation provided for in the Constitution. Other human rights abuses, including man.
 datory flogging of prisoners for certain offenses, discrimination against women, and
 circumscription of religious freedom continued in 1993.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no reports of politically
 motivated killings.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of disappearances.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 In 1988 whipping with a cane became mandatory punishment for 42 criminal and
 drug-related offenses and for vandalism. Since then sentences of whipping have
 been handed down and carried out in the presence of a doctor who monitors imple-
 mentation and has the authority to interrupt and postpone the punishment for med-
 ical reasons. The incidence of crime in Brunei is low, and caning is infrequent.
 d. Arbitra-y Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The Constitution has no provision for ha-
 beas corpus. While legislative provisions granting the right of habeas corpus exist,
 those provisions, like the Constitution itself, may be superseded, either partially or
 wholly, through invocation of the emergency powers. No such action has occurred
 to date. Police officers have broad powers to arrest people without warrants. How-
 ever, under normal circumstances, a magistrate must endorse a warrant for arrest.
 Warrants ar issued without this endorsement on rare occasions, such as when po-
 lice are unable to obtain the endorsement in time to prevent the flight of a suspect.

 The Internal Security Act (ISA) permits the Government to detain suspects without
 trial for renewable 2-year periods. The Government has occasionally used the ISA
 to detain persons suspected of antigovernment activity.
 Brunei's prison population is not large. Prisoners are not known to be abused. The
 several facilities for prisoners range from adequate, for the short-term "lockup," to
 good, for the long-term prison at Jerudong.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-The Bruneian judicial system consists of five lev-
 els of courts, with final recourse available through the Privy Council in London. Al-
 though there is no trial by jury, procedural safeguards are available, including the
 right to defense counsel, the right to an interpreter, the right to a speedy trial, and
 the right to confront accusers. There were no known instances of government inter-
 ference with the judiciary in 1993 and no trials of political opponents.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-A1-
 though the Government is empowered by law to intrude into the privacy of individ-
 ual persons, families, or homes, this rarely happens.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-Freedom of speech and freedom of the press are
 not restricted by law, but the Government frequently censors international news-
 papers and periodicals by removing or blacking out articles or photographs found
 to be objectionable. In 1993 articles were subject to censorship if they were poten-
 tially embarrassing to Brunei's royal family, critical of the Government or the Sul-
 tan, or were judged improper by the censors. The growing use of facsimile (FAX)
 machines makes it increasingly difficult to keep such material from entering Brunei.
 The independently owned local newspaper practices self-censorship by avoiding is-
 sues it knows the Government would object to. The only television station is govern-
 ment owned. (The broadcasts of two Malaysian television stations can also be re-
 ceived.) Because of the almost total absence of criticism or opposing views, the Gov-
 ernment's tolerance of political criticism has not been effectively tested recently. In
 the past it has not hesitated to arrest those who attempted to espouse unwelcome
 political views.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-Freedom to assemble for politi-
 cal purposes also has not been seriously tested in recent years. Following the 1967
 ban on political parties, the Government allowed two parties to form in 1985 and
 1986. The Government severely restricted membership in both parties, disbanding
 one of them in 1988. The other political party, the Brunei National Solidarity Party,
 lingers on with a few dozen members.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution states, "The religion of Brunei
 Darussalam shall be the Muslim religion according to the Shafeite sect of that reli-
 gion: provided that all other religions may be practiced in peace and harmony by
 the person professing them in any part of Brunei Darrussalam."
 In 1991 the Government began to reinforce the legitimacy of the hereditary mon-
 archy and the observance of traditional Bruneian and Muslim values by reasserting
 a national ideology known as the Malaya Islam Beraja (MIB) or "Malay Muslim
 Monarchy," the genesis of which reportedly dates back to the 15th century. The re-
 sulting Islamization of Bruneian society has created a variety of impediments to the
 full and unconstrained exercise of religious freedom called for in the Constitution
 and in the recent Kuala Lumpur Declaration. Despite constitutional guarantees and
 the Kuala Lumpur Declaration, the Government routinely restricts the practice of
 non-Muslim religions by: prohibiting proselytizing; occasionally denying entry to for-
 eign clergy or particular priests, bishops, or ministers; banning the importation of
 religious teaching materials or scriptures such as the Bible; and refusing permission
 to expand, repair, or build new churches, temples, and shrines. The Ministry of Edu-
 cation has also restricted the teaching of the history of religion or other courses in
 religion in non-Islamic schools while requiring courses on Islam or the MIB in all
 schools.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-While the movement of former political prisoners was restricted during
 the first year of their release, there were no restrictions on freedom of movement
 in the country for most citizens, permanent residents, and expatriates. The Govern-
 ment places some contractual restrictions on foreign travel for certain expatriate
 employees, but this is limited to the first year of the contract. While Brunei has not
 been willing to accept asylum seekers, it has agreed in principle, and subject to cer-
 tain reservations, to the Comprehensive Plan of Action adopted by the 1989 Inter-
 national Conference on Indochinese Refugees.

 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 Bruneian citizens are unable to change their government through established
 democratic processes. Under the continuing state of emergency, there is no par-
 liament, and political authority and contrl rests in the hands of the ruling mon-
 arch. Individual citizens may seek to express their views or influence government
 decisions and policies by petitioning the Sultan or handing him letters when he ap-
 pears in public. The only form of popular representation lies in a traditional system
 of village chiefs, who, under a new system inaugurated in 1992, are elected by secret
 ballot at meetings in which all adults may participate and vote. Once elected, village
 chiefs serve for life. Candidates must meet 2-year village residency requirements;
 have a knowledge of Islam, though they need not be Muslims; and have no current
 or past involvement with any political party. These leaders communicate constitu-
 ents' wishes through a variety of channels, including periodic meetings, chaired by
 the Home Affairs Minister, with several officials appointed by the Sultan.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no government or private organizations in Brunei that deal specifically
 with the protection of human rights. Given the tight restrictions on freedom of
 spech and press and the Government's unwillingness to tolerate criticism, any
 group or individual attempting to investigate and report publicly on human rights
 issues would face severe constraints. There were no known allegations of abuses or
 requests to visit by international human rights groups.
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cil Status
 Women.-Based on Koranic precepts, women in Brunei are denied equal status
 with men in a number of important areas such as divorce, inheritance, and custody
 of children. Under the Brunei Nationality Act, citizenship is passed on through the
 male only. Female citizens of Brunei who are married to foreigners or bear children
 by foreign fathers cannot pass on Bruneian citizenship to their children, even when
 such children are ber  n Brunei. This has resulted in creation of a sizable popu-
 lation of stateless children, estimated at more than 5,000 residents, who are entitled
 to live in Brunei and be documented for travel by the Government, but who cannot
 enjoy the full privileges of citizenship, including the right to own land.
 Although men are eligible for permanent positions in government service whether
 or not they hold university degrees, women who do not have university degrees are
 eligible to hold government positions only on a month-to-month basis. While recent
 changes eliminated some previous inequities, women in month-to-month positions
 continue to receive slightly less annual leave and fewer allowances than their male
 and female counterparts in permanent positions.
 There are no separate pay scales for men and women and in recent years there
 has been a major influx of women into the work force. Women serve in a wide vari-
 ety of capacities in Brunei's armed forces, although they may not serve in combat.
 At the junior and middle levels of Brunei's large government bureaucracy there ar
 now substantial numbers of women. Maternity l eaves of 56 workdays are now grant-
 ed to women regardless of whether they hold permanent or month-to-month posi-
 tions and may be taken at any time before or after delivery. The number of female
 university graduates is increasing, and nearly two-thirds of the National Univer-
 sity's entering class is female.
 A woman now serves as an intermediate court judge, the highest judicial position
 held by Bruneians, and sat recently with a foreign high court judge in a capital case
 involving a foreign woman. Nevertheless, at higher levels of the bureaucracy a clear
 pattern of discrimination exists. Since independence, no woman has been appointed
 to ministerial rank; and women continue to be passed over despit e fact that
 there are by now a number of well-qualified candidates for promotion to positions
 at permanent secretary and deputy minister levels.
 Religious authorities strongly encourage Brunei Muslim women to wear the
 tudong, a traditional head covering, and many women do so. Some Muslim women
 do not, however, and there is no pressure on non-Muslim women to do so. The inci-
 dence of rape or domestic violence against women appears to be relatively low,
 though the extent to which either may occur and go unreported is not known.
 The criminal penalty for a minor domestic assault is 1 to 2 weeks in  ail and a
 fine. An assault resulting in serious injury would be punished by whipping and a
 longer jail sentence. One area of apparent abuse involves female domestic servants.
 Whlee f level of violence in Bruneian society is comparatively low, there is less
 taboo about the beating of servants--or refusing them the right to leave the house
 
 
 on days off, sometimes on grounds that they "might encounter the wrong company."
 Since most domestics are foreign workers, who are reasonably well paidand highly
 dependent on their employers for continued employment, those subject to abuse may
 be unwilling or unable to bring complaints, either to Bruneian authorities or to their
 governments' embassies in Brunei. When such complaints are brought, however, the
 Government is generally quick to take action, including the imposition of fines and
 punishment.
 Children.-While published statistics regarding the welfare of children, and
 crimes against children do not exist, the strong commitment to family within
 Bruneian society, the country's high standard of living, and government funding for
 children's welfare guarantee almost all children growing up in Brunei a healthy and
 nurturing environment. With a few exceptions involving small villages in extremely
 remote areas nutrition standards are high and poverty is almost unknown. In-
 stances of child abuse appear low.
 The Government's commitment to the welfare of children is demonstrated in
 Brunei's hospitals where health care is free for all citizens. This includes rural hos-
 pitals and traveling clinics which provide high levels of health care and public
 health outreach programs. There are excellent prenatal, neonatal, and postnatal
 programs, free childhood immunization, and rehabilitation and physical therapy
 programs for injured, sick, or handicapped children.
 Indigenous People.-Six percent of Brunei's population is comprised of indigenous
 peoples. They have long been integrated into Bruneian society, although a few still
 live in remote jungle areas. They enjoy the same rights of land ownership and ac-
 cess to natural resources as other Brunei citizens and have never possessed, or had
 a concept of, defined tribal lands. They are free to celebrate traditional festivals and
 to maintain cultural traditions. Presumably, since most are non-Muslim, they may
 feel the same discomfort as other minority groups over the Government's active el-
 forts, particularly through the Ministry of Education's directives to schools, to incul-
 cate in all citizens the concept of the MIB. There is no apparent pattern of job dis-
 crimination against indigenous peoples, a number of whom have risen to high posi-
 tions such as deputy director of the Anticrime Bureau, registrar of the University
 of Brunei Darussalam, and commanding officer of the Royal Bruneian Armed
 Forces' special combat squadron.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-Few of the substantial Chinese minority,
 constituting 15 percent of the population, are citizens. Those having no claims to
 other nationalities were "British-protected persons" prior to independence, and are
 now stateless and either permanent or temporary residents. Noncitizens may not
 own land but may hold property through long-term leases.
 The process of obtaining citizenship in Brunei is long and difficult. Many aspi-
 rants complain that the Malay-language test required for citizenship is adminis-
 tered so rigorously that it is almost impossible for a nonnative speaker topass.
 In general, however, the Chinese community, which conducts much of the coun-
 try's commercial activity, has prospered in Brunei. While the Chinese have done
 well economically, and some hold key governmental positions, including one position
 at the permanent secretary level, some are reevaluating their position in Brunei, es-
 pecially the prospects for their children in a society in which ethnic Malay citizens
 are favored in such areas as government employment and access to the National
 University, and some Chinese are emigrating.
 People with Disabilities.-There are no provisions for easy access to public places
 and no affirmative legislation for the disabled in Brunei. However, the disabled are
 well integrated into Brnei society and the work place, due mainly to past and ongo-
 ing efforts of the Government and associations for the disabled to raise public con-
 sciousness.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-Trade unions are legal in Brunei but must be reg-
 istered with the Government. Signatures of seven members are required for reg-
 istration. There are four registered trade unions, all of them in the oil sector, with
 a total membership amounting to less than 5 percent of the work force. All workers,
 including civil servants other than those serving in the military and police, may
 form or join trade unions. Unions are independent of the Government. The Trade
 Unions Act of 1962 permits the formation of trade union federations in Brunci but
 forbids affiliation of Brunei's trade unions with labor organizations outside Brunei.
 An individual contract is required between an employer and each employee, but
 legal trade union activities cannot be deemed to violate employee contracts. Local
 legal experts interpret this provision as conferring the right to strike, but there have
 been no strikes.
 
 
 586
 
 b. The Right to Organize and Bar ain Collectively.-The Government has not pre-
 vented the legal registration of trade unions, nor has it dissolved any. There is no
 government interference with lawful union activity. It is illegal to refuse employ-
 ment or discriminate against an employee on the basis of membership or
 nonmembership in a trade union. While unions are legal and easy to register, condi-
 tions in Brunei are not conducive to the development of trade unions. There is little
 interest on the part of workers in forming trade unions, and existing unions are not
 very active. Brunei law is silent on collective bargaining, and it occurs in only a few
 industries. There is a lack of those kinds of industries in which unions have tradi-
 tionally developed. Also, cultural tradition favors consensus over confrontation.
 Wage and benefit packages are based on market conditions and tend to be generous.
 There are no export processing zones.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.-Forced labor is prohibited by
 Chapter 93 of the Laws of Brunei, and it is not practiced.
 d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children.-Chapter XI of the Labour Enact-
 ment Laws of 1954 specifically covers the employment of children. Employment of
 children below the age of 16 is prohibited. Parental consent and approval by the
 Labor Commission is required for those below the age of 18. Women under 18 may
 not work at night or on offshore oil platforms. The Labor Department, which is a
 part of the Ministry of Home Affairs, effectively enforces laws on the employment
 of children.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-Skilled labor is in short supply, and market
 forces enable most citizens of Brunei to command good salaries. Brunei has no mini-
 mum wage. Overtime is paid for work in excess of 48 hours a week, and double time
 is paid for work performed on legal holidays. Occupational health and safety stand-
 ards are established by government regulations. Working conditions are subject to
 inspection on a routine basis and in response to complaints to Department of Labor
 (DOL) officials. The DOL generally enforces labor regulations effectively. However,
 in the unskilled labor sector, enforcement is lax, especially for foreign laborers. The
 DOL is empowered to close any workplace where health, safety, or working condi-
 tions are unsatisfactory, and it has done so in the past.
