 MALAWI
 The President of Malawi, Dr. H. Kamuzu Banda, has maintained
 nearly undisputed control over political life and government
 since he led the country to its independence in 1964. He was
 proclaimed "Life President" in 1970. Political activity is
 limited to participation in the sole legal party, the Malawi
 Congress Party. Military, police, and party security organs
 suppress opposition to the Government and monitor a wide range
 of activities.
 Malawi inherited a parliamentary form of government from Great
 Britain. Elections are held every 5 years; all candidates
 must be members of the Malawi Congress Party and approved by
 the President. Constitutional amendments and laws passed by
 the 124-member Parliament reflect decisions already taken by
 the President.
 Malawi is a small densely populated, landlocked country whose
 principal assets are moderately fertile soils, good water
 resources, and a climate favorable to crop production. Since
 independence the Government has used good planning and wise
 investment of the limited available resources to promote
 economic development. However, despite substantial progress,
 per capita gross national product in 1985 measured only $210.
 Malawi's current population of 7.2 million people is growing
 at an estimated annual rate of 3.1 percent. Possessing no
 significant mineral resources or industrial sector, Malawi is
 heavily dependent on agriculture for export earnings and
 employment.
 During 1986 two cases continued to receive outside attention
 from human rights groups. Appeals and inquiries were made on
 behalf of Orton and Vera Chirwa, both serving life sentences
 for treason (commuted from death sentences in 1984). Three
 journalists detained in March 1985, reportedly because of a
 misquotation published in the local newspapers, have been
 released.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section I Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There have been no allegations of politically motivated
 killings within the country during 1986.
 b. Disappearance
 In the past, secret detentions by the police have been behind
 disappearances lasting from a few weeks to several months.
 There are no known instances in which such detentions have led
 to death. There were no known political disppearances in 1986.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Beatings by the police at the time of detention or arrest, or
 during interrogation, are illegal but do occasionally occur.
 Prison terms of hard labor are the norm for common criminals,
 with political detainees normally receiving less harsh or
 degrading treatment. Prison conditions are generally believed
 to be poor but are difficult to verify since access to prisons
 
 
 182
 MALAWI
 is tightly controlled. According to one report, some
 hard-core criminals were sent to remote prisons where
 insufficient food was provided. Several are believed to have
 died of malnutrition.
 The Forfeiture Act permits the Government to revoke the
 property rights of those suspected of economic crimes. These
 revocations sometimes have political overtones. when the
 Forfeiture Act is invoked, the individual--but not his
 family--loses all worldly possessions, including business and
 financial assets and personal belongings. Revocation of
 property rights is carried out by executive fiat with no
 judicial review. Notice of forfeiture must be published in
 the Official Gazette. There were no such cases published in
 1986.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Under the Preservation of Public Security Act, the President
 may order the arrest, search, and detention of any person whom
 the Government suspects may cause trouble in the country. A
 person who is arrested under this law can be detained by the
 police without trial in a court of law.
 At any given time a number of persons may be detained for real
 or perceived offenses against the party or Government.
 Currently, for example, a senior official of the Government's
 Information Department is being detained, although charges
 against him have not been made public. Malawi residents
 (including Africans and those of Asian extraction) may be
 picked up at the whim of the authorities, held without charge
 for varying lengths of time, and released. While political
 detainees are rarely beaten, the length of their confinement
 is often uncertain.
 Suspicion of corruption is another cause for being held; those
 detained are rarely charged officially and brought before
 courts. A suspect may also be held without charge for a long
 period of time while authorities develop a case. One reported
 example is that of a young Malawian who was detained and
 interrogated in October 1985 for asking in jest if President
 Banda would live long enough to enjoy his newest residence,
 then being constructed in Mzugu. He has been held without
 charge since that time at Nsanje prison. It is impossible to
 estimate the number of arbitrary detentions and arrests made
 in Malawi in 1986.
 Forced labor is sometimes used as a form of criminal
 punishment.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Those charged with criminal offenses are tried in either the
 traditional or modern court system, depending on the nature of
 the charge. Those charged under the military code of justice
 are tried in military courts. Lawyers are not permitted to
 assist defendants in traditional court cases, but legal
 counsel is permitted in the modern court system. In the
 latter case, the defendant has the right of access to counsel
 both before and during the judicial proceeding. The right of
 appeal exists in both the modern and traditional court
 systems. In practice, the Government and party exert little
 control over the trial system in cases tried before the High
 Court or magistrate court. The modern judiciary is
 
 
 183
 MALAWI
 independent of the executive branch, although the President
 appoints the Chief Justice of the High Court who, in turn,
 appoints other modern court justices. Magistrates may be
 removed from their positions for reasons of incompetence,
 malfeasance or if it is deemed by the executive branch to be
 in the public interest. This lack of job security can act as
 an indirect form of government pressure. These courts are
 open to the public, and defendants are charged publicly.
 Traditional court justices are appointed directly by the
 President. It is generally believed that there is little
 executive interference in traditional court cases dealing in
 matters of customary law, and there is no evidence of indirect
 executive pressure on traditional courts adjudicating cases of
 a political nature. The three traditional courts at the
 regional level deal with most capital offenses. A guilty
 verdict is reviewed by the national traditional court and a
 ministerial committee considers clemency. Trials in
 traditional courts are conducted and death sentences are
 carried out without publicity. The number of expcutions is
 not a matter of public record but, according to one report,
 about a dozen occurred in early 1986. The death penalty is
 mandatory for murder and treason and can be imposed for armed
 robbery.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 In private life, most people are not unduly affected by
 government authority. Malawi law calls for the issuance of
 individual warrants before any home may be entered, but this
 is not always observed in practice. Police and quasi-military
 groups enter houses of suspects at will under special entry
 authority to conduct searches for people or incriminating
 evidence. Correspondence is monitored by the authorities and
 mail, including international mail, is often opened.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Criticism of the Government and its policies is not allowed;
 this proscription extends even to the Parliament. The media
 do not submit their news items and programs to the Information
 Department for approval or censorship, but the penalty for
 publishing material which meets with official displeasure can
 be severe and several journalists have been jailed for
 extended periods. As a result, the two newspapers and sole
 radio station operate under informal but strict
 self-censorship guidelines. Both media have exhibited
 increasing candor in coverage of international issues. In
 addition, criticism of the efficiency of some government
 departments has appeared in the media and Parliament. Limited
 freedom of inquiry into the natural and social sciences exists
 at the university level, and may include some examination of
 political ideologies at radical variance with those of the
 Government, provided this does not extend to explicit
 criticism of the Government.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Individuals and organizations generally are free to meet and
 associate as long as the purpose is not to discuss government
 or party policy or practices. Professional, fraternal, and
 
 
 184
 MALAWI
 service organizations exist and are encouraged by the
 Government. No political meetings are permitted, other than
 those of the party.
 Labor unions exist, but their activities are highly
 circumscribed, and they are generally ineffective. Collective
 bargaining is allowed, but its use is limited. Malawi law
 guarantees the right to strike, but in practice strikes never
 occur. Labor unions come under the Malawi Trade Union
 Congress which in turn is subject to direction by the Ministry
 of Labor. With Government permission and supervision, the
 trade union organization associates with international
 organizations, and the Malawi Trade Union Congress is a member
 of the Organization of African Trade Union Unity and of the
 International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. While the
 labor movement has yet to achieve gains for workers, the
 principal explanation is economic rather than political: the
 economy of Malawi can sustain only a small number of wage
 earners, most of whom occupy positions as unskilled laborers
 on large estate farms.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is relative freedom of religion in Malawi for all
 religions whose particular religious tenets do not preclude
 recognition of the temporal authority of the State. Jehovah's
 Witnesses have been banned since 1967 because the Government
 considers the sect's activities to be disruptive of "the
 prevailing calm, law, and order." There is no state or
 preferred religion, and conversion from one religion to
 another is permitted. There are no restrictions on religious
 observances and ceremonies which do not impinge on government
 authority. Religious groups may establish places of worship
 and train clergy. They are required to register with the
 Government, and their publications, like all others, are
 subject to government censorship. Religious groups are free
 to establish and maintain links with coreligionists in other
 countries and are free to travel abroad. Similarly,
 missionaries from abroad are permitted to enter Malawi and
 proselytize. There is no tie between a particular religion
 and the Malawi Congress Party.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Few restrictions have been observed on movement within Malawi,
 though legal provisions exist for restricting movement of
 those convicted of political or criminal offenses. Asian
 residents and citizens are free to travel within the country
 but must reside and work in one of four urban areas (Lilongwe,
 Zomba, Mzuzu, and Blantyre/Limbe). Within some of these urban
 centers, strict rules governing where Asians may own property
 result in limitations on where they may reside. Denial of
 passports on political grounds frequently extends to family
 members of persons in political disfavor and to those persons
 whom the Government suspects may criticize it if allowed to
 travel abroad. Civil servants and employees of state-owned
 enterprises have to obtain written permission to travel abroad
 even on vacation. Obtaining such clearance can take from a
 few days to several months. Formal emigration is'neither
 restricted nor encouraged. With the exception of a small
 group of political dissidents, there is no outward flow of
 Malawian refugees from the country. Expatriates born in
 Malawi may return. Citizenship may be revoked but in practice
 this is not done.
 
 
 185
 MALAWI
 Malawi does not accord official refugee status but has allowed
 private voluntary organizations to provide medical and other
 relief to some of the large number of displaced persons who
 have come into Malawi due to fighting and hunger in
 Mozambique. Approximately 70,000 Mozambicans have crossed the
 border to avoid harassment from government and insurgent
 forces.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 All political decisions are made either directly by the
 President or those few closely associated with him. No
 opposition political parties or movements are permitted.
 Membership in the Malawi Congress Party is not mandatory but
 is often coerced. Active membership is expected of those who
 aspire to government positions (including the civil service)
 or even professional success. Party membership is often
 required of school children and of those who seek access to
 government services or entrance to local markets. The annual
 renewal fee is only about 25 cents, but this can be nearly
 half a day's pay for a minimum wage earner. In addition, when
 the President visits an area, financial contributions from
 individuals and businesses are expected. Nearly half of the
 population has at least nominal party membership. The party's
 pervasiveness and broad-based structure provide for some
 choice among candidates for party, parliamentary, or other
 offices. For example, as was the case in the 1983 election,
 there are often three candidates for election to a
 parliamentary constituency. All nominees, however, are
 selected by the party and submitted to the President for
 review. Active campaigning is not permitted. The National
 Assembly (Parliament) consists of both elected and nominated
 members and is mainly concerned with ratifying government
 policy. Its powers are broadly based in law but highly
 circumscribed in practice. Women are entitled to party
 membership and voting rights and hold 15 of the 104 elected
 seats in Parliament. No women hold ministerial-level
 positions.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Government does not permit organizations such as the
 International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty
 International to conduct human rights investigations in
 Malawi. No nongovernmental organizations devoted to the
 furtherance of human rights are permitted to exist.
 Expressions of interest in alleged human rights problems by
 outside groups or persons are not welcomed and are usually
 ignored. Few government officials are even willing to discuss
 the subject of human rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 While Malawi remains one of the world's least developed
 countries, economic and social needs and cultural aspirations
 are met on a generally nondiscriminatory basis. Asian
 residents, whether Malawian citizens or not, have been
 compelled to transfer ownership of rural shops and trucking
 businesses to ethnic African Malawian citizens. Asians are
 
 
 186
 MALAWI
 free to expand into other areas of business, however, and
 industrial licenses for new Asian-operated industries are
 routinely granted.
 Women are limited to the roles defined by a traditional
 African society and do not have opportunities equal to those
 of men. As mothers, women enjoy a high degree of access to
 the traditional health services and to extension programs
 designed to improve women's homemaking abilities. Such
 programs, while benefical, have failed to recognize the
 importance of women as agricultural producers in the rural
 sector (roughly 70 percent of all smallholder farms and over
 50 percent of subsistence holdings are headed by women) and
 the potential role women can have in the modern sector.
 Although males still have a comparative advantage in terms of
 educational and employment opportunities, the Government has
 initiated sufficiently broad-scale programs to begin to
 rectify the discrimination which exists. A third of the
 positions in the public education system have been reserved
 for women. Within Malawi's traditional and primarily
 matrilineal tribal leadership structures, there are several
 small ethnic groups wherein women possess fewer rights and
 privileges, and:where female circumcision is occasionally
 practiced.
 Malawi enjoys a considerable degree of ethnolinguistic
 uniformity. The vast majority of the population.speaks and/or
 understands Chichewa, which became the national language in
 1968. English is the official language for government and
 business. Malawi's indigenous groups are sufficiently alike
 in culture and social organization to permit relatively easy
 interaction, including intermarriage, mixing in agricultural
 settlements, and mixed grouping for political purposes.
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The minimum working age is 14, though this applies only to the
 relatively small urban sector. Less than 15 percent of the
 work force is employed in the formal wage sector. For those
 fortunate enough to hold paid jobs, wages and working
 conditions are generally adequate, and paid holidays and
 safety standards in the workplace are required by law.
 However, wage levels are low (about $2 a day in the three
 major towns), reflecting the abundance of unskilled labor and
 government policy to limit the rural-urban income gap and
 hence the rate of migration to the towns.
