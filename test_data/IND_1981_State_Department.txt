 INDIA
 India has a multiparty Democratic political system, an
 independent judiciary, and a flourishing free press.
 Fundamental human rights are guaranteed in the
 constitution, and discrimination on the grounds of
 religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth is
 prohibited.
 India's constitution mandates the promotion of the
 education and economic interests of the disadvantaged
 sections of society. These aims are reflected in
 economic policies which give priority to developing
 India's rural areas and to increasing employment
 opportunities.
 One of the aims of government since independence in 1947
 has been the promotion of harmony among, and the
 advancement of, India's diverse peoples and castes.
 Over the years, legislation and government programs have
 helped to reduce the negative effects of the traditional
 social and economic systems.
 India is also a diverse country with many regions at
 varying stages of development. Popular expectations
 about the fruits of modernization have been rising
 steadily; inevitable frustrations have led to increased
 social tensions in some areas and among some groups.
 The Indian system is federal in nature with distinct
 spheres reserved for the national and 22 state
 governments.   The latter are primarily responsible for
 maintenance of law and order, local development and
 education. The states also have their own judicial and
 penal systems. The responsibility of the central
 government is to apply the constitution and to chart
 out policies based on constitutional directives and
 commitments with implementation resting primarily with
 the states. Thus, there may exist considerable
 variation in human rights-related conditions from one
 state or region to another, particularly where the
 fulfillment of vital human economic and social needs is
 concerned and in the administration of the criminal
 justice system.
 Unlike earlier years in which there were dramatic
 incidents raising human rights-related issues, public
 and media attention in 1981 was centered on
 institutional reforms in the criminal justice system. A
 special focus was on reducing police brutality in the
 treatment of prisoners held in custody. Suggestions for
 upgrading the quality of police recruitment, pay,
 training and discipline figured largely in this debate.
 There was also continuing attention to "undertrials"
 (i.e., prisoners awaiting trials in Indian jails).
 A relatively new issue arose from the reported
 conversion to Islam of some untouchable Hindus in south
 India. The right of citizens to change their religion,
 guaranteed by the constitution of India, evoked fears
 from some that India's communal balance could be
 affected. Thus, the dilemmas confronting   India's
 strong secular commitment were posed repeatedly in
 1981, but without resulting in any change of the
 national secular ideology.

 In September 1981, the government introduced the
 Essential Services Maintenance Ordinance (ESMO) limiting
 the right of trade unions to strike in essential
 industries and that of management to impose lockouts.
 Trade union reaction has been critical of this
 mechanism, but to date there has been no confrontation
 between government and trade unions on this issue.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is prohibited by the Indian code of criminal
 procedure (1973). The Indian Evidence Act requires a
 valid confession to be made in the presence of a
 magistrate. Article 20 (3) of the Indian constitution
 states that no one may be compelled to testify against
 himself. There is also ample case law extending over
 many decades demonstrating that recourse to torture in
 India for any purpose is contrary to law and that the
 introduction of confessions or information extracted by
 use of torture or force in trial procedure is
 inadmissible.
 Nonetheless, there is widespread circumstantial
 evidence that torture by the police does occur. Press
 reports in 1981 indicated that police brutality applied
 to prisoners under custody occurred in the states of
 Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Bihar, Rajasthan and in New
 Delhi.
 Amnesty International undertook in January and
 February 1981 a letter-writing campaign addressed to the
 president, prime minister and chief ministers of various
 states, expressing deep anguish about "deaths in police
 custody due to police brutality." Al made specific
 recommendations aimed at providing legal protection to
 suspects, establishing a code of conduct for police
 officials and a clear line of responsibility for the
 treatment of detained persons, and full investigations
 of instances of police conduct involving torture and
 deaths in police custody. The government informed
 parliament on April, 1981, that AI letters "receive
 earnest consideration of the government and wherever
 necessary the matter is taken up with the state
 governments and union territory administrations
 concerned."
 To date, the central government has not acted on
 the recommendations of the national police commission
 established in 1978 to overhaul police administration
 and bring them in line with modern practices. The basic
 law regulating Indian police remains the 1861 Police Act.
 b.   Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Such treatment or punishment is proscribed by law; there
 are no known instances of summary execution in India.
 Varying terms of imprisonment rather than physical
 punishment are imposed for crimes committed, as spelled
 out by the criminal code of India and the states.
 Persons convicted of murder can receive the death
 penalty.

 A more serious public issue in India is prison
 conditions. The continued presence of large numbers of
 undertrials has resulted in the crowding of jails in
 many parts of the country and the deterioration of
 conditions for all prisoners. According to a government
 statement in parliament on August 19, 1981, as of
 December 31, 1980, about 60 percent of India's jail
 population consisted of undertrials (105,562 of the
 total prison population of 168,542). Of these, the
 great majority (87,895) had been under detention for
 less than six months.
 A feature of imprisonment inherited from the
 British colonial period, and still in effect in India,
 is a system of classification of prisoners related to
 differential prison conditions and special privileges.
 Thus, while ordinary (or Class C) prisoners enjoy no
 special treatment, foreigners (Class B) and political
 prisoners (Class A) are entitled to less crowded cells,
 better food and  amenities. Income tax paying, (i.e.,
 middle.class) prisoners-are also often segregated from
 ordinary prisoners and granted more privileges. The
 special privileges for political prisoners date from the
 independence struggle when large numbers of respectable
 people courted arrest through a minor infraction of the
 law. Support for these principles remains widespread in
 India.
 c. Disappearances
 No instances have been reported of the abduction, secret
 arrest, clandestine detention, or "disappearance" of
 individuals at the hands of public authorities in India.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 The constitution provides that a person detained in
 custody must be informed of the grounds for arrest as
 soon as possible, and shall have the right to be
 represented by counsel. Such persons must be brought
 before a magistrate within 24 hours of arrest and not be
 detained further without the magistrate's authority.
 No information has been received in 1981 suggesting
 that these provisions are not generally respected in
 practice.
 However, the constitution also permits the
 enactment of preventive detention laws to *prevent
 threats to the public welfare and safeguard the national
 security." It requires that these laws provide for
 certain limits on the length of detention and for review
 of such detention.
 In February 1980, parliament ratified a
 preventive detention ordinance enacted in November 1979
 (The Prevention of Blsckmarketing and Maintenance of
 Essential Supplies Act) permitting the arrest of
 suspected 'economic offenders." In September 1980,
 following severe rioting in northern India, a National
 Security Ordinance (NSO) was adopted authorizing the
 central and state governments to order detention of
 individuals to prevent action "prejudicial to the
 defense or security of India, or to the maintenance of
 public order or the availability of supplies and
 
 
 969
 services essential to the community." The ordinance was
 ratified by parliament in December 1980 as the National
 Security Act. Its provisions parallel similar
 preventive measures adopted by several states. Each of
 these measures requires that written notification about
 the reason for detention be provided within five days of
 arrest. Detainees also are permitted legal counsel.
 Review boards appointed by the Chief Justice of
 individual state high courts and consisting of active or
 retired judges or persons qualified to be judges must
 review each case of detention to determine the necessity
 of detention. Under the NSO, imprisonment is for 12
 months, but this may be extended or shortened. The
 decision to implement the ordinance is left to the
 states, and a few states have refused to enforce it.
 In many cases, detainees are held only a short
 time and released, particularly where detention follows
 serious rioting. There is no evidence that these
 mandates have been used against political opponents of
 the current administration in the absence of some other
 allegation, such as inciting to riot. As of mid-August
 1981, according to press reports, about 700 persons had
 been detained under the National Security Act since
 September 1980 when the initial ordinance was
 promulgated. It is not clear how many persons remain
 under current detention.
 e. Denial of a Fair Public Trial
 There is no constitutional guarantee of public trial.
 The criminal procedure code provides for open trial,
 but also permits the judiciary to close the proceedings
 in part or in whole. The Official Secrets Act also
 permits proceedings to be closed on the plea that
 publication of any evidence or statements would be
 prejudicial to the safety of the state. The act
 requires, however, that the passing of sentence take
 place in public.
 In India, there are effective legal procedures to
 assure fair trial. One problem, however, is that of
 lundertrials," the largest number of prisoners awaiting
 trial, in some cases for as long as ten years. In many
 states, the percentage of undertrials to the jail
 population varies from 50 to 80 percent.
 In March 1979, the Indian Supreme Court ruled
 that speedy trial was a fundamental right of the citizen
 and ordered two state governments to release all
 undertrial prisoners who had been in jail longer than
 they would have been had they been tried and convicted.
 There are no comprehensive data concerning the
 implementation of the Supreme Court's directive. Press
 reports indicate that the situation is worst in Bihar,
 on which the Supreme Court has sought to press the state
 government to relieve the situation of undertrials. The
 Bihar government, in February 1981, admitted to 19,000
 undertrials, about one-quarter of the total number in
 India. The court ordered the state government to
 provide lawyers to those in jail for more than two years
 awaiting trial. Elsewhere, newspaper reports indicate
 that no significant progress in reducing the number of
 undertrials in Indian prisons has been made. A recent
 estimate is that 58 to 65 percent of prisoners in India
 currently fall in that category.
 
 
 970
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The criminal procedure code requires warrants for
 searches and seizures, but also permits the police in
 the course of a criminal investigation to institute
 searches without warrant if otherwise there would be
 undue delay. In such a case, the officer must state in
 writing the grounds for making the search without a
 warrant and specify the object of the search. There is
 no indication that this provision has been abused in
 practice, nor that other forms of violation of the home
 have occurred in India.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties
 Including:
 a. Freedom of speech, press, religion and
 assembly. The constitution of India guarantees freedom
 of speech and, by extension, press, religion, and
 assembly. These guarantees were honored in practice in
 1981. No distinction is made on the basis of sex,
 religion or social, background. There is no censorship
 of the media in a general sense. Material deemed
 inciteful of religious or communal hatred is proscribed,
 and occasionally some publications will have offending
 issues banned or seized. A censorship board screens
 films before their distribution is licensed, and
 material deemed offensive to public morals or to
 religious and communal sentiment may be excised. The
 government-controlled All India Radio has a monopoly of
 radio and television broadcasts and is often accused by
 opposition parties of slanting its broadcast material
 to favor the ruling party. There is no censorship of
 domestic and foreign books or publications nor of
 artistic works.
 There have been no restrictions in 1981 on
 criticism of the government of India. The press has
 played a major role in exposing serious cases of
 corruption at a high level in the state governments. It
 has been equally forthright in exposing the scale of
 police brutality as well as cases of exploitation of
 ,women and rural.labor. A good example is the revelation
 by the 'Indian Express" (April 28-29, 1981) of a white
 slave ring operating with official connivance in the
 states of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.
 The only limits on public meetings are those
 connected with crowd control--e.g., advance notification
 to police and the requirement of permits in some
 instances. Groups and parties of all persuasions are
 allowed to assemble freely, nor is any hindrance imposed
 on their efforts to attract as large a participation as
 can be organized.
 In general,.trade unions in India operate without
 restrictions on.their rights to organize, negotiate and
 strike. However, in September 1981 the government
 introduced the Essential Service Maintenance Ordinance
 (ESMO) banning strikes in key-industries. A
 conciliation and arbitration procedure is spelled out in
 the ordinance as an alternative to strike action. But
 'so far this mechanism has not been implemented. Strikes
 in other sectors of the economy continued to take place
 periodically throughout the country, though not on a
 nation-wide basis in 1981.
 
 
 911
 Under the Indian constitution, India is a secular
 state in which all religious groups are allowed to
 worship freely. While communal tensions based on
 different religious affiliations occur frequently and
 may lead to local injustice, the weight of government
 policy and practice does not favor one religious
 community over another. This commitment was put to a
 severe test in the wake of reports of mass conversion by
 untouchable Hindus to Islam in some villages of Tamil
 Nadu in August-September 1981. There was a strong Hindu
 reaction which included demands for government
 intervention either to ban such conversions or to seek
 actively  to discourage them through material
 incentives or restriction on Muslim proselytization.
 There have been no instances of eithet state or central
 government acquiescence in these demands, but rather a
 reaffirmation of India's secular principles.
 b. Freedom of Movement within the Country,
 Foreign Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Since Indian independence in 1947, millions of refugee
 from neighboring countries have been admitted into
 India. These include Hindus and Sikhs from Pakistan,
 Tibetans from China, and Bengali Hindus from present-day
 Bangladesh. The great majority of these refugees have
 been granted Indian citizenship and integrated into the
 society and economy. As such, they are no longer
 regarded as refugees and data on their numbers are not
 available. Tibetans form a more distinct ethnic and
 religious group and tend to be concentrated in a few
 areas. In 1981, they are numbered officially at
 64,562. There is no evidence of forcible repatriation
 of any of these groups of refugees. For its part, the
 Indian government has accepted the repatriation of many
 thousands of people of Indian origin from Burma
 (209,000), Sri Lanka (365,000) and lesser numbers from
 Uganda and other countries in East Africa, where there
 were either stateless persons or those who had retained
 Indian nationality. Ethnic Indians who hold other
 countries' nationality are considered to have no special
 right of repatriation to India. There is no evidence of
 refugees fleeing India since the Muslim exodus in
 1947-48.
 There is full freedom of movement within India
 for all citizens, except for a long-standing requirement
 for permits to enter sensitive border areas. Foreign
 travel and emigration are without political
 restrictions. The rules for obtaining a passport have
 been liberalized, new regional passport offices have
 been opened and the procedure regarding the issuance of
 passports has been simplified. Foreign exchange
 regulations aimed at conserving foreign exchange
 restrict Indian nationals to $500 in foreign exchange
 conversion privileges every two years. Some 945,000
 Indians were issued passports in 1980. There are 3
 million Indian citizens living abroad, and their number
 continues to increase.
 There are no special restrictions on internal or
 external travel, emigration, or repatriation which are
 applied to women or other groups.
 
 
 972
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political
 Process
 There is universal adult suffrage for all male and
 female citizens over 21 under the Indian constitution.
 Citizens have a variety of opportunities and avenues
 through which to participate in the political process.
 These include periodic elections at the village (or
 Panchayat) level, municipal and state assembly polls and
 national parliamentary elections. By-elections were
 held in June 1981 in several states.
 Elections in India are free and impartially
 administered and supervised by an election commissioner,
 whose responsibilities are defined in the constitution
 and who is responsible to the president alone. A
 multitude of local, state and national parties are in
 active opposition to the Congress (I) Party presently in
 national and state offices. They freely contest
 elections at all levels. Opposition parties of every
 ideology are represented in the state assemblies and in
 the national parliament. No groups in India, whether
 social, religious or linguistic, are denied political
 participation or suffrage. They are free to organize,
 agitate, publish, recruit, and to seek judicial redress
 in the event of perceived injustice. There are no
 problems of citizenship or nationality which impede
 political participation. The number of non-nationals
 residing in India is extremely small.
 Although there are no barriers to women
 candidates, their numbers have remained small through
 seven general elections. The present prime minister of
 India is a woman, and currently there are 28 women
 members of the lower house of parliament (Lok Sabha) of
 544, and 26 in the upper house (Rajya Sabha) of a total
 membership of 244.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding
 International and Non-governmental Investigation
 of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 No international investigations of the human rights
 situation in India are known to have occurred since
 1978.
 There are a few private human rights monitoring
 organizations in India. Perhaps the most prominent is
 the People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) based in
 New Delhi with chapters in some states and cities.
 Recently it split into two groups known as the PUCL and
 People's Union of Democratic Rights.
 There are also a few women's groups which monitor
 the status of women. The most significant channels for
 reporting human rights violations are parliament and the
 press. The latter has become increasingly active in
 its coverage of unjust social practices and
 exploitative economic relationships. It has been the
 main channel for focusing public and political attention
 on attacks in rural areas on low caste or Harijan people
 (untouchables), on violence against women, including
 rape, on injustices perpetrated against tribal people
 and on exploited labor. The press has also taken the
 lead in some instances in examining the functioning of
 the preventive detention ordinances, jail conditions,
 and the problem of undertrials.
 
 
 973
 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Section IV of the Indian constitution enjoins the Indian
 Government to "endeavor to minimize inequalities in
 income.. and in status, facilities, and opportunities"
 for all citizens of India. Among these the constitution
 lists "the right to work, to education, to public
 assistance, to secure a living wage.. .and a decent
 standard of life." Indian development and general
 economic policies emerged out of a series of five-year
 plans, the first beginning in 1950. India has a mixed
 economy in which key industries are vested in the public
 sector. Agriculture is entirely private, while many
 important industries and most retailing is also in
 private hands. Eighty percent of GNP is produced by the
 private sector and ninety-three percent of employment is
 in the private sector.
 The extent of human needs in India that are still to
 be met is brought out by a few random statistical
 examples. Life expectancy at birth is 51.9 years, and
 the infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births is 125.
 The population growth rate is 2.1. Adult literacy is 36
 percent. The percentage of population with access to
 safe water is 33 percent, and the average number of
 persons housed per room is 4.8 in the urban areas and
 5.3 in the rural areas. In each of these categories,
 however, there has been improvement in the past ten
 years.
 India's relatively poor growth performance has been
 a major cause of poverty. Between 1950-51 and 1977-78,
 overall income growth averaged only 3.6 percent per
 year. Per capita income grew by 1.5 percent and still
 stands at only $190 (1980). The Indian government has
 adopted a poverty line related to minimum nutritional
 requirements of 2400 calories per person per day for
 rural areas and 2100 calories for urban areas. The
 poverty line (in 1977-78 prices) was $97.50 equivalent
 for rural areas and $112.50 equivalent for urban areas.
 The most important dimensions of economic
 inequalities in India are income disparities by class,
 caste or occupational group and disparities by region.
 While overall distribution of income in India improved
 in the 1950's and 60's (oL at least did not
 deteriorate), income differentials among India's states
 seem to have widened considerably over time.
 In the field of health services there are great
 differences between urban and rural areas in all regions
 of the country. The rural crude death rate exceeds the
 urban rate by 42 percent, and the rural infant mortality
 rate exceeds the urban rate by 43 percent. The
 country-wide infant mortality rate stands at 125 per
 1000 births. Differential access to health, family
 planning,and nutritional services has been a serious
 barrier to reducing mortality and fertility in rural
 areas and particularly among the poor.
 A striking feature in India is the steady decline of
 the ratio of women to men over many decades, a trend
 which is likely to continue into the next century. This
 
 
 974
 is-attributed both to women dying at a faster rate than
 men, .and tomore boys.being born.than girls. Female
 mortality rate has. been higher than the male rate in.the
 age groups 0-8.
 The-Indian educational system has expanded rapidly
 since independence. Primary school enrollments
 increased from 43 percent to 80 percent of the relevant
 age groups between 1950-51 and 1979-80, while literacy
 rose from 19 percent to 36 percent over the same
 period. School enrollment figures are much higher for
 males than for females. Enrollments tend to be lower
 for children of disadvantaged groups, such as landless
 laborers and scheduled castes and tribes. The
 -persistence of substantial inequalities can be
 attributed to a variety of factors. The great physical
 -and climatic diversity of the Indian sub-continent
 contributes-to the differential regional incidence of
 poverty.
 In-addition to social and economic tensions
 resulting from India's caste system in general,
 scheduled castes.(the so-called untouchables or Harijans
 and. tribal peoples) pose a special problem. The
 scheduled castes comprise an estimated 15 percent of the
 population. Scheduled tribes are seven percent.
 Government efforts to improve the position of the
 scheduled castes and tribes since independence have so
 far met only modest success. These groups continue to
 .constitute a large proportion .of India's "poorest of the
 poor",..and the inequality of treatment of opportunities
 Savailable.to these groups constitutes a major impediment
 to India's economic, as well as its social and
 political, development.
