 SPAIN
 Spain's Government is a parliamentary democracy within the
 framework of a constitutional monarchy. Parliament is the
 policymaking body established by the Spanish Constitution; the
 King has very limited powers under the Spanish Constitution but
 plays an important unifying role in support of Spanish
 democracy. Three general elections have been held since the
 death of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco in 1975. The Union
 of the Democratic Center, a coalition of center-right parties,
 governed from the first elections in 1977 through 1982. In the
 October 1982 general elections, the Spanish Socialist Workers
 Party won an absolute majority of parliamentary seats. Voter
 participation, consistently over 60 percent, reached an
 unprecedented 79.5 percent in 1982, with more than 50 national
 and regional parties participating, spanning the entire
 political spectrum. Regional and municipal elections held in
 May 1982 reaffirmed Spain's commitment to democratic government.
 Most elements of current Spanish society and all major
 political parties are committed both in principle and in
 practice to democracy and the protection of human rights.
 Basic freedoms of speech, press, religion, assembly, movement,
 and participation in the political process are respected in
 Spain.
 The Spanish Constitution of 1978 protects all basic human
 rights. Some human rights activists say that the detention
 period of 10 days authorized by the antiterrorist law is a
 serious departure from human rights norms. Government
 officials, and probably a substantial majority of the
 population, believe that the law is necessary to cope with the
 indiscriminate killings carried out as a matter of policy by
 the Basque Fatherland and Freedom Movement. While the level of
 violence is well below that of the late 1970s, it is a
 continuing problem and there appears to be a growing national
 consensus on the need for additional legislation which would
 strengthen the Government's ability to deal with terrorism.
 There have been occasional charges of abuse on the part of
 members of the security forces in the course of performance of
 duties, but the Government takes seriously its responsibilities
 to supervise and control the police. Police officers can be
 and are held responsible for their actions. Charges of police
 abuses are declining.
 Human rights trends in Spain, both short and long term, are
 very positive. The Socialist Government, like its predecessor
 the Union of the Democratic Center, has supported the
 consolidation of democracy and the protection of human rights
 both in Spain and throughout the world. Spain is an active
 member of several international human rights organizations. It
 recently hosted the Conference on Security and Cooperation in
 Europe Review Conference. Internally, the Government has
 embarked on an ambitious program of legislative reforms and has
 sponsored human rights activities. The Government has also
 created a human rights subdirectorate general in the Foreign
 Ministry and a public defender's office. The public defender's
 office hears citizens' complaints concerning the Government and
 its administration, investigates, and reports its findings and
 recommendations to Parliament. In its first 10 months of
 operation, the office received 25,000 complaints, mainly
 regarding socioeconomic problems such as work, pensions, and
 
 (1088)
 
 
 1089
 social security. The independent Spanish Human Rights
 Association published its first annual report in December 1982,
 which concluded that, in spite of some continued human rights
 problems, Spain's record is very good.
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Antigovernment terrorism is the most widely publicized and
 emotionally charged violation of human rights in Spain. During
 1983, such terrorist activities have been primarily the work of
 the Basque Fatherland and Freedom Movement which has waged a
 terrorist campaign, mainly in the Basque Provinces, since
 1968. The Movement is a radical Marxist-Leninist group which
 is fighting for total Basque independence from Spain. It has
 directed most of its assassinations against members of the
 security forces or members of the business community who ignore
 its extortion demands. Although 428 Spaniards have died at
 terrorist hands since 1978, the annual death rate is
 decreasing, with 38 terrorist-related assassinations recorded
 as of December 3, 1983).
 The Socialist Government, like its predecessor, uses legal
 means to combat terrorism. During the past year, government
 internal security forces arrested numerous suspected
 terrorists, observing legal requirements. Since the December
 1982 death in a gun battle of the head of the leftist terrorist
 group First of October, there have been no reported terrorist
 deaths as the result of actions by the security forces.
 b. Disappearance
 Terrorist abductions occur in Spain, but there are no known
 cases of abductions, secret arrests, or clandestine detentions
 by official forces or by factions whose activities are condoned
 by the Government.
 Four separate terrorist-linked abductions were recorded in
 1983, the work of Basque terrorist organizations. In three
 cases, exorbitant ransoms were demanded. Police were able to
 find one victim before payment was made. In the two other
 cases, victims were released physically unharmed after ransoms
 were paid. The most recent kidnap victim was killed. The
 captor, an element of the Basque Fatherland and Freedom
 Movement, had demanded the release of terrorists on trial for
 an assault on a Spanish Army barracks in 1980.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 The Spanish Constitution forbids the use of torture or cruel
 and inhuman punishment and guarantees the "right to life and
 physical and moral integrity." The Government strongly opposes
 the use of torture and mistreatment and indicts perpetrators
 when enough evidence exists. As a result, accusations of
 torture and mistreatment lodged against security forces have
 decreased considerably. In 1983, the Spanish Human Rights
 Association received 120 complaints of mistreatment or torture
 and actively investigated 30 cases. Most of the alleged abuses
 involved common criminals and the Spanish Civil Guard, and
 appeared to be isolated incidents carried out by individuals
 rather than reflecting officially sponsored or condoned
 policies. In a recent case, two policemen accused in 1980 of
 
 
 1090
 torturing three members of an illegal organization were tried
 and found guilty in September 1983. In another case, a Spanish
 court ruled in December 1983 that torture charges and
 responsibility for the 1981 death of a member of the Basque
 Fatherland and Freedom Movement could not be proved against two
 national police defendants. In other instances, police
 officers have been suspended or transferred pending
 investigations into alleged abuses. Local groups in the Basque
 country are sensitive to real or perceived abuses by security
 forces, and allegations of torture and mistreatment are heard
 regularly. Nonetheless, there have been no confirmed cases in
 1983.
 Such mistreatment in jails as occurs appears largely to be a
 result of violence among prisoners, overcrowding, and
 antiquated prison practices. (The Spanish Human Rights
 Association criticized one jail in Huesca for using bed
 restraints and drugs to control prisoners.) Overcrowding was
 alleviated somewhat by recent penal code reforms which freed
 thousands of prisoners. Prison conditions have generally
 improved. This has in part been a result of the nominations of
 several new prison directors, as well as the Government's
 open-door policy which allows non-governmental groups freely to
 inspect prisons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and imprisonment, a
 rule which is respected in practice. In the Basque region,
 police occasionally search neighborhoods and detain suspects,
 but there are no known cases of secret arrests by security
 forces.
 Habeas corpus is provided for in the Constitution. Draft
 legislation to implement the principle is in parliamentary
 committee and will be considered and probably approved in early
 spring 1984.
 Although the Constitution guarantees detainees the right to
 legal assistance, many do not receive it. According to the
 Spanish Human Rights Association, nearly half of those arrested
 refuse legal aid mainly because they believe that it will
 prejudice their case. In a few instances, lawyers claim to
 have been expelled from police stations, and some jails have
 allegedly made it difficult for lawyers and clients to meet
 privately. On September 20, the Chamber of Deputies approved a
 new law on legal assistance to detainees which provides them
 the unrenounceable right to a lawyer, chosen or appointed, who
 must be present and an active participant during a prisoner's
 formal declaration. Lawyers previously often acted only as a
 witness to their clients' declarations; now they may ask
 questions and advise prisoners. Detainees now have the right
 to know the charges against them, the right to medical aid, an
 interpreter, and family notification. However, a prisoner who
 is being held incommunicado (usually those arrested under the
 antiterrorist law) cannot choose his own lawyer, but will be
 assigned the government lawyer on duty.
 Other laws, passed in the spring of 1983 as part of the penal
 code reform undertaken by Parliament, severely limit the use of
 pretrial detention and depenalize possession of soft drugs for
 personal use. Previously, the only rule governing pretrial
 detention was that it could not exceed the prisoner's maximum
 possible sentence. Now, prisoners accused of crimes with a
 maximum six year sentence can only be held up to six months in
 pretrial detention; prisoners accused of crimes carrying a
 
 
 1091
 minimum six year prison term can be held up to 18 months; and
 prisoners involved in serious crimes such as terrorism can be
 incarcerated up to 30 months awaiting trial. As a result of
 these reforms, over 7,000 prisoners have been released; the
 majority were in pre-trial detention, and a few were released
 for completion of reduced sentences. In the Madrid area,
 nearly 2,000 prisoners have already been freed; most of them
 were being held as suspects for robbery or for other charges in
 which no bodily harm occurred. Many of those released have now
 been rearrested for new crimes.
 Other pending legislation recommends suspensions and fines for.
 public officials who do not respect the human rights of
 prisoners and civilians.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The Constitution guarantees the right to a fair public trial, a
 right that is observed. According to Spanish law, an detainee
 must be released or presented to a judicial authority within
 the first 72 hours of police arrest. When appearing before the
 judge, the detainee will again be informed of his
 constitutional rights and offered the opportunity to confirm or
 change his declaration to the police. The Court then has an
 additional 72 hours to determine whether a suspect will be
 released or indicted. Defendants may always appeal to the next
 higher court and up to the Council of Europe in cases
 concerning human rights.
 The Constitution states that "citizens may participate in the
 administration of justice through the institution of the jury
 in the manner that the law may determine for certain criminal
 trials, and in the usual and traditional courts." Legislation
 to create a jury system has been proposed, but magistrates
 oppose the plan, claiming that it would prejudice terrorist
 trials. An alternate proposal includes a judicial system in
 which judge and jury would confer on the verdict.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Constitution guarantees "the right of honor, personal and
 family privacy, and identity. The home is inviolable and no
 entry or search may be made without legal authority except in
 the case of a flagrant crime or with the express consent of the
 owners. Secrecy of communications, particularly postal,
 telegraphic and telephone communications, is guaranteed, except
 by judicial order." Under normal circumstances, a search
 warrant issued by the court is required before officials may
 enter a private residence.
 The Spanish Government has upheld these rights, but one
 incident and a series of allegations attracted attention in
 1983. In the first case, the Government, citing the
 antiterrorist law, conducted a sweep of a Madrid neighborhood
 in April, searching for a prominent banker who had been
 kidnapped by terrorists. Police restricted access to and from
 the area and inspected dwellings for over two days. Many
 questioned the blanket application of the law to a large group
 of citizens. Police officials stated that it was both
 necessary and legal. The victim was not found.
 The second case involved privacy of communications. Spanish
 law permits court-authorized tapping of phones in the interests
 of combating terrorism or protecting national security. In
 
 
 1092
 June 1983, opposition leaders, the Madrid College of Lawyers,
 and an unofficial police union accused the Government of
 illegally tapping their phones. The Spanish press reported the
 allegations, and the public defender's office received several
 complaints from people claiming that their privacy had been
 violated. The Government denied the charges, stating that only
 244 phones in Spain were tapped, all legally. The possibility
 of some unauthorized phonetaps was later established.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedoms of speech and the press are protected by the
 Constitution and are respected by the Government. Opposition
 viewpoints are freely ventilated both in common speech and in
 the media. Although television is state owned and top
 officials are political appointees, it operates with a measure
 of autonomy under the supervision of a parliamentary oversight
 committee. There is also a state radio network, but most
 stations are private. Most newspapers are also privately owned
 and, although they receive a newsprint subsidy, they enjoy full
 freedom of expression. There are, however, laws in force that
 allow the courts to prevent publication of articles,
 particularly when an individual can demonstrate that his
 reputation would suffer harm from publication. In the spring,
 a Madrid court ordered the confiscation of two issues of a
 weekly magazine for publishing an inflammatory story about an
 opposition leader, allegedly without proof. A section of the
 "Law in Defense of the Constitution," passed in April 1981
 after the coup attempt the previous February, states that if
 the media publicly provoke, propose, or conspire to commit
 crimes constituting treason, the courts, acting on a petition
 by the prosecutor, may order the closure and seizure of
 property of the medium.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The right to assemble freely is a constitutional right and one
 that is exercised by all political groups. Labor unions in
 Spain are active and free to organize, strike, and negotiate as
 stipulated in the Constitution. They are allowed to maintain
 relations with recognized international bodies in their
 fields. Spanish trade unions are not influenced or subjected
 to official harassment. Approximately 18-20 percent of the
 Spanish work force is unionized. One major issue between the
 Government and the unions is the patrimony question. Union
 property was seized by the Franco regime and became state
 property under the Franco system of "vertical" unions. Union
 and employer associations have sought reinstatement of their
 property. The issue is complex, and a mutually acceptable
 settlement has not yet been reached.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 There is no state religion in Spain, and open practice of all
 religions is permitted. Catholicism is the predominant
 religion in Spain, but other religions are represented and
 function with full freedom. There have been no known incidents
 of religious harassment, persecution, or discrimination.
 Adherence to a particular faith does not by itself confer
 either advantage or disadvantage to one's secular status.
 Another issue of social concern is the right of conscientious
 objection which is guaranteed under the Constitution but not
 
 
 1093
 regulated by law. Prior to the Constitution, conscientious
 objectors received prison sentences, but since 1975 the military
 service of over 5,000 conscientious objectors has been deferred
 pending legislative resolution. A bill now under discussion
 would allow conscientious objectors to fulfill military service
 through social or other civilian work.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 Domestic movement and foreign travel by Spanish citizens are not
 impeded by the Spanish Government. There are no restrictions
 placed on residence in certain areas of the country or in the
 cities. Emigration and repatriation are not restricted by the
 Spanish Government, nor does the Government force refugees to
 return to the homelands from which they have fled. Spain has
 accepted large numbers of Latin American refugees and smaller
 numbers of Indonesian and Iranian refugees. Spanish citizenship
 cannot be revoked if acquired by birth. It can, however, be
 revoked if acquired by other means.
 To date, there are no laws governing asylum in Spain. The
 plight of over 80,000 refugees or displaced persons in Spain has
 become a serious governmental concern. (In Madrid, there are
 5,000 Iranians alone.) Many displaced persons have no
 documents, no means of livelihood, and rely on the support of
 refugee organizations. They can be deported with no legal
 recourse. In an effort to improve the situation, the Chamber of
 Deputies has given preliminary approval to a law of asylum that
 would affect approximately 7,000 of the recognized political
 refugees now in Spain as well as future political refugees.
 This bill has been criticized by human rights groups because the
 Ministry of the Interior is empowered to decide refugee cases
 instead of the Ministry of Justice or a semiofficial agency.
 Opponents feel that the Ministry of the Interior will evaluate
 cases in terms of security rather than on humanitarian grounds.
 Thousands of African workers are illegally present in Spain.
 Their living and working conditions are substandard and a matter
 of concern to Spanish human rights groups. Legislation now
 before Parliament is aimed at remedying this situation.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Formally a constitutional monarchy, Spain is a parliamentary
 democracy with multiple parties and candidates. Elective
 positions are contested in Spain as in other democratic
 countries. Opposition groups exist openly and actively
 participate in the political process. Spanish citizens at least
 18 years old are eligible to vote and elections are free. King
 Juan Carlos has played a crucial role during Spain's transition
 to democracy, urging respect for the new Constitution,
 moderating the political demands of the left and the right, and
 thwarting an attempted coup in February, 1981.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Spanish Government has allowed investigative groups to enter
 its borders, openly tour the country, and report on the status
 of human rights in Spain. The Spanish Human Rights Association
 and Amnesty International note that the Government is both
 accessible and generally responsive to inquiries and requests
 from them.
 Non-governmental groups can freely investigate human rights
 
 
 1094
 violations with no hindrance, persecution, or retaliation from
 the Government. They are allowed to publicize their findings
 and they concur that the Government supports their efforts.
 The Government is also interested in human rights practices in
 other countries, especially in Latin America.
 Amnesty International's 1983 Report expressed concern for
 allegations of ill-treatment of people detained under the
 provisions of the antiterrorism laws, as well as the
 prosecutions of some Basques on charges of criticizing the
 state and its representatives. Freedom House rates Spain
 "free".
 Since publication by Amnesty International of its 1983 Report,
 the Spanish Supreme Court in early December 1983 absolved 17
 Basque defendants charged with publicly insulting the King and
 concluded that they could only be sentenced for the much lesser
 offense of disturbing the peace.
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 The economy of Spain is mixed; i.e., a market economy with
 government intervention. Spanish Governments have taken
 significant steps over the last decade to move from a directed
 economy to a more open, market economy. The economic policies
 outlined by the new Socialist Government are designed to
 maintain this liberalizing trend. Current world economic
 conditions have greatly restricted the ability of the Spanish
 Government to manage its economy and deal with pressing
 problems such as stagnant economic growth, high inflation
 (currently 10.3 percent annual rate), and growing unemployment
 (17.2 percent). In an effort to meet the economic, health, and
 social needs of the populace, the Government has used both its
 monetary and legislative resources. A significant amount of
 the 1983 budget was allotted to social programs:  pensions and
 social welfare benefits (24.6 percent), health (0.9 percent),
 education (12.2 percent), and housing (3.5 percent). Pending
 legislation includes a comprehensive social services bill which
 would benefit many sectors of society previously underprotected
 by the law: minorities, the handicapped, the elderly, addicts,
 and illegal immigrants.
 The Spanish Constitution guarantees the basic rights of work,
 private property, food, and shelter. The following statistics
 provide a general indication of Spain's standard of living.
 Spain's population in 1983 was 38,234,000 and growing at an
 annual rate of 0.5 percent. GNP per capita is $5,763.70. Life
 expectancy at birth is 73.35 years, and the infant mortality
 rate is 10.3 per 1,000 live births.
 A new government agency, the Women's Institute, has been
 created to promote women's rights and fight discrimination
 against women. The Institute, with a current staff of about 25
 and a budget of 5 million pesetas, will research the situation
 of women in Spain and, in conjunction with other ministries,
 agencies and groups, will attempt to correct the social,
 judicial, and economic inequalities that exist. The Institute
 will serve as a center of coordination for all issues and areas
 that concern women and will organize and participate in
 international meetings and workshops. Improved legislation and
 correct interpretation and application of existing laws would
 improve the status of women in Spain. Other improvements
 include eradication of sexist language in job descriptions
 advertised by the National Institute of Employment, acceptance
 of women candidates for the national police and military, and
 participation of a woman on the executive board of Spanish
 television to deal with the treatment of women on television.
 The Institute will also study the problem of child abuse and is
 investigating allegations that children are rented out for
 begging.
 Gypsies are a minority group that is not fully integrated into
 Spanish society. The Government has created a special Office
 of Gypsy Affairs to improve their situation.
