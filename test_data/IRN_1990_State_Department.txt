 IRAN*
 Iran is an Islamic Republic under the leadership of Ayatollah
 Ali Khamenei. The formal system of government, based on a
 Constitution approved in 1980 by popular referendum and
 revised in July 1989, features a parliament and a president
 elected from among multiple candidates by universal suffrage.
 However, all candidates must meet highly restrictive religious
 and political criteria imposed by the Council of Guardians,
 and as a result the choice offered to voters is narrow. The
 Government, dominated by a'political elite composed of Shi'a
 Muslim clerics and of laymen allied with these clerics,
 attempts to impose its views on political and socioreligious
 orthodoxy. However, there are significant factional
 differences on important economic and political issues.
 The Government's hold on power is reinforced through arrests,
 -summary trials and executions, and other forms of intimidation
 implemented by an extensive internal security system.
 -Political arrests are made by the Revolutionary Guards or,
 less. commonly, by revolutionary committees (komitehs), local
 - neighborhood groups which once were quasi-official but which
 have now been subsumed under the Ministry of Interior. In
 practice, these groups retain a certain amount of autonomy,
 -particularly in the provinces, and the central Government is
 not always able fully to control their activities.
 The disruptions of the revolution, the destruction from the
 Iran-Iraq war, devastating earthquakes in June and November,
 and government mismanagement have caused serious economic
 deterioration. Inflation is estimated at 50 to 80 percent,
 while unemployment is about 40 percent of the work force.
 Many industries are operating at less than half of capacity.
 Corruption and black market activities are rife. While an
 economic Five-Year Plan was approved in January,
 implementation of reconstruction programs has been slow.
 Iran in 1990 continued to be a major violator of human
 rights. Abuses included summary executions of political
 opponents; widespread torture; repression of the freedoms of
 speech, press, assembly and association; arbitrary detentions;
 lack of fair trials; continuing repression of the Baha'i
 religious community; denial of citizens' right to change their
 government; and severe restrictions pn women's and worker
 rights.
 In January, however, the Government permitted the United
 Nations Special Rapporteur for Iran, Reynaldo Galindo-Pohl, to
 visit Iran for the first time to prepare a report to the U.N.
 Human Rights Commission (UNHRC). Galindo-Pohl paid a second
 visit to Tehran in October. The Government also proved
 somewhat more responsive to other international inquiries
 about the human rights situation. Both Amnesty International
 (AI), in its 1990 Report covering 1989, and the Special
 Rapporteur cited instances of torture, execution after summary
 proceedings, and the holding of political prisoners as among
 continuing human rights abuses in Iran. In his November
 report, the Special Rapporteur concluded that " the enormous
 quantity and variety of allegations and complaints received
 from very diverse sources.. .provide a credible factual basis
 *Because of the absence of a United States Mission in Iran,
 this report draws heavily on unofficial sources.
 
 
 1445
 
 IRAN
 for the belief that human rights violations occur frequently
 in the country and that government action to prevent and
 remedy such violations has not been sufficient to put an end
 to them."
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing
 There is no reliable estimate of the number of people killed
 for political reasons in 1990. Given the lack of basic
 procedural safeguards in political trials, most of the
 executions ordered each year in such cases amount to summary
 executions. Moreover, the Government often disguises
 political charges with accusations of criminal activity, e.g.,
 narcotics trafficking. Under a new antidrug law announced in
 late 1988, the Government executed hundreds of accused drug
 traffickers in both 1989 and 199a. According to several
 sources, many of those executed were actually political
 detainees.
 In its 1990 Report, AI also charged that executions of
 political prisoners were common. The Special Kapporteur's
 February 1990 report to the UNHRC recounts many cases of
 alleged executions of political prisoners. In addition, the
 Iranian Government carries out political executions of its
 opponents residing abroad.
 b. Disappearance
 The number of disappearances in 1990 is unknown. The
 situation is complicated by the lack of government information
 on many political prisoners. AI reports that many families of
 executed political prisoners have not been informed officially
 of their relatives' deaths; many others- who have been informed
 were often not told where the bodies were buried.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
 Treatment or Punishment
 Accounts of torture in Iran's prisons continued to be received
 in 1990 and included a wide range of inhuman practices
 documented by various human rights groups and eyewitnesses.
 The Special Rapporteur related several such accounts in his
 February 1990 report. Former prisoners told the-Speci-l
 Rapporteur that lashings and beatings of all kinds are
 common. Allegedly, prisoners are flogged on the- soles of
 their feet until they can no longer walk; some are forced to
 do so anyway. In one variant of this torture, guards
 reportedly rip the dried medical dressing from the feet of the-
 injured prisoners.
 The Special Rapporteur also said ex-prisoners told him that
 they were frequently held in solitary confinement or denied
 adequate rations as a way of forcing them to confess.
 Suspension from the ceiling is another common method of
 torture. Guards have threatened and intimidated family
 members of detainees, and relatives or other prisoners have
 occasionally been forced to watch torture.
 
 
 1446
 IRAN
 Prisoner protests against poor prison conditions have
 reportedly been met with beatings, denial of medical care,
 and, in some cases, execution. The Special Rapporteur
 -reported that a "Prisoner's Organization" exists to redress
 mistreatment. However, no -information is available on its_ -
 activities.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Arrests for expression of views critical of or different from
 those of the Government are known'to occur, but it is not
 known how many may have occurred in 1990.
 Some pbrsons have been arrested on trumped-up criminal charges
 when their actual "offenses" were political. Others were
 taken into custody on vague charges such as "corruption on
 .earth" or "warring with God." The lack of fair trials and
 other procedural safeguards encourage such practices.
 No judicial determination of the legality of detention exists
 in Iranian law. There is reportedly no legal time limit on
 incommunicado detention. Suspects are held for questioning at
 local Revolutionary Guard offices or-in jails.
 There have been reports that children often have been taken
 into custody with their mothers. The Special Rapporteur
 recounted one instance in which a child, arrested with its
 mother at the age of 2 months, grew up in prison. Some women
 have been imprisoned solely because they have associated with
 men who are political suspects.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There are essentially two different court systems. The civil
 courts deal with criminal offenses, and the revolutionary
 courts, established in 1979, try "political" offenses.
 By international standards, no trial by a revolutionary court
 can be called fair or public in the usual sense. If the trial
 is staged publicly, it is generally because the prisoner has
 already been forced to confess to a crime. Persons tried for
 political offenses enjoy virtually no procedural or
 substantive safeguards. The Special Rapporteur reports that
 trials lasting 5 minutes and less are not uncommon.
 The Special Rapporteur noted in his February 1990 report many
 examples of the lack of basic procedural guarantees,
 mentioning particularly the problem of limited access to a
 lawyer. The right to a defense counsel is provided for in the
 Iranian Constitution, a provision emphasized to the Special
 Rapporteur by the head of the Iranian Bar Association.
 Nevertheless, many defendants do not have access to a lawyer,
 are unable to call witnesses on their behalf, and are unable
 to appeal. One witness with 30 years of judicial experience
 told the Special Rapporteur that lawyers are generally not
 admitted before the revolutionary courts and are harassed and
 intimidated if they insist. Some persons have been imprisoned
 beyond the limit of their sentence, and even executed after
 the formal expiration of their prison term.
 The judicial system is weakened by the fact that revolutionary
 courts can consider cases formally under the jurisdiction of
 the civil and criminal courts. The review authority of the
 Supreme Court is also limited. Assignment of cases to regular
 rather than revolutionary courts is haphazard and apparently
 
 
 1447
 
 IRAN
 occurs mainly when arrests are made by regular police.
 Revolutionary courts can also overturn the decisions of the
 civilian courts.
 For common criminal offenses, many elements of the
 prerevolutionary judicial system survive, and the accused
 often have the right to a public trial with benefit of lawyers
 of their own choosing, assuming they can afford the fee. Even
 this judiciary is not fully independent, however. Many of the
 former judges were retired after the revolution, and new
 judges were selected. One criterion for new judges is
 grounding in Islamic law. and political acceptability is a
 requirement for any government position. Favorable verdicts
 reportedly can often be "purchased" from the judges serving on
 civil and criminal courts and to a lesser degree from judges
 of the revolutionary courts. The expert witness cited above
 told the Special Rapporteur that even in ordinary penal cases
 lawyers must be extremely careful, and mentioned the example
 of a colleague who was indicted after requesting an additional
 hearing in a case. In general, the witness said, the practice
 of interferinS with lawyers is becoming worse.
 No reliable estimate is available on the number of political
 prisoners. According to AI, seven women political prisoners
 were released in August.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Government rejects the Western distinction between a
 public sphere which the State may control and a sphere- of
 private life (religion, culture, thought, and private
 behavior) whichr the State may not properly control.
 Authorities still enter homes, wiretap telephones, and open
 mail, but these activities have been less common over the past
 few years than they were before 1982.
 Special Revolutionary Guard units and neighborhood komitehs
 check on social activities. Women whose clothing does not
 completely cover the hair and all of the body except hands and
 face, or wha wear makeup, are technically subject to arrest.
 In the past, men have also been required to dress 'modestly,"
 eschewing, for example, short-sleeved shirts. Enforcement of
 standards of Islamic morality has appeared to vary with the
 political climate and the jurisdiction. In May the Head
 Office for Combatting Unlawful Acts announced a crackdown on
 dress code and moral violations, stipulating that offenders
 would be handed over to the revolutionary courts.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 The Constitution states that "publications and the press may
 express ideas freely, except when they are contrary to Islamic
 principles, or are detrimental to public rights." In
 practice, most publications are controlled by the Government;
 independent publishers run the risk not only of press
 shutdowns and confiscation of publications and equipment but
 of arrest and summary punishment if they are overly critical
 of the Government.
 All books must be submitted to the Ministry of Islamic
 Guidance for review before they can be published. Publishers,
 authors, and printers also engage in substantial
 
 
 1448
 IRAN
 self-censorship before submitting books to the Ministry in an
 effort to ,avoid the substantial penalties, including economic
 losses, incurred when books are rejected. Iranian authorities
 have interpreted broadly their right to censorship on
 religious grounds.
 Newspapers, which are usually associated with various
 government factions, reflect a variety of viewpoints.
 :Officials and government policies are often subjected to
 public criticism, but newspapers are forbidden to criticize
 the concept of the Islamic republic, or to promote ethnic
 minority rights. Nevertheless, some independent publishers
 out of- favor with the Government.-continue to survive, and some
 books and pamphlets critical of the Government are published
 without reprisal. Foreign books, newspapers, and magazines
 may be imported only after they have been reviewed by the
 Ministry of Islamic Guidance.
 All, broadcasting facilities are government owned, and the
 content of their broadcasting reflects the political and
 socioreligious ideology of the Government.
 The severity of restrictions on academic freedom has been
 relaxed somewhat in recent years. However, course content is
 still monitored, and there is little genuine critical
 discussion of. issues. Informers are said to be common on
 campus and in the classroom. To achieve tenure, professors
 reportedly must cooperate with government authorities over a
 period of years. All textbooks proposed for use at the
 universities are reviewed by government authorities to
 determine their acceptability.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 The-Constitution permits unarmed assemblies and marches
 "provided they do not violate the principles of Islam.". The
 only ones permitted in practice are those sponsored by'the
 Government, such as Friday prayers and parades and
 demonstrations on official occasions.
 Early in the year, there were several reports of unofficial
 demonstrations against the Government, many of them centering
 on the deteriorating economy. In Eebruary, following the
 cancellation of a soccer match, spontaneous demonstrations
 occurred in Tehran during which slogans were shouted against
 government leaders and progovernment posters were torn down.
 -These demonstrations, like most other such disturbances, were
 suppressed by government forces.
 Article 26 of the Constitution allows the formation of
 political parties, groups, and professional associations, as
 well as Islamic and some minority religious associations,
 provided they do not violate the principles of "freedom,
 sovereignty, [and] -national unity" or question Islam or the
 Islamic Republic. In practice, most independent organizations
 have either been banned, co-opted by the Government, or are
 moribund.
 Former Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan told the Special
 Rapporteur in a February meeting in Tehran that the Freedom
 Movement, with which he is associated, continues to be
 harassed by Iranian authorities. For example, according to
 Bazargan the Movement's telephones have been tapped, its mail
 opened, and members subjected to intimidation. The houses of
 most of the leading members of the Movement had been bombed.
 
 
 1449
 IRAN
 While the Freedom Movement participated in the first
 parliamentary election after the revolution, it was prevented
 from doing so in all subsequent elections. For example,
 Bazargan was not approved as a candidate for the presidential
 elections in 1989. Constitutional guarantees notwithstanding,
 Bazargan said, the legal status of the Freedom Movement
 remains in suspense.
 In June, 21 members of the Freedom Movement were arrested
 after signing an open letter to the Government calling for
 greater personal and political freedoms as guaranteed by the
 Constitution. Government officials as well as the Iranian
 news media accused the Freedom Movement of acting as a "fifth
 column" in the service of the revolution's enemies.
 The Special Rapporteur also met in February with
 representatives of the 4-year old Association for the
 Protection of Liberties and Human Rights (APLHR). This
 organization, like the Freedom Movement, has received no
 official recognition, although its charter, based on
 constitutional principles, was submitted to the Ministry of
 Interior for approval. In 1988, APLHR representatives said,
 their party offices were occupied by the authorities and their
 chairman was arrested. They are denied access to printing
 facilities, although it is possible to circulate photocopies
 of their newsletter by hand. The Special Rapporteur noted
 that similar restrictions were experienced-by other
 organizations trying to promote human rights and freedoms.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 In Iran religion is almost inseparable from government. The
 President and many other top officials are mullahs (Islamic
 clergymen), as are the Speaker of the Parliament and nearly
 half the parliamentary deputies.
 Approximately 90 percent of Iranians are Shi'a Muslims. Aside
 from slightly over I percent who are non-Muslims (Baha'is,
 Christians, Zoroastrians, and Jews), the rest are Sunni
 Muslims. The Sunnis are mostly Kurds, Arabs, Turkomans,
 Baluch, and other ethnic minorities whose political influence
 is very limited. The Constitution declares that "the official
 religion of Iran is Islam and the sect followed is Ja'fari
 Shi'ism," but it also states that "other Islamic denominations
 shall enjoy complete respect."
 The small Christian, Jewish, and Zoroastrian (the pre-Islamic
 religion of Iran) populations are concentrate(L mainly in urban
 areas. Their religions are recognized by the Constitution,
 and they elect representatives to seats reserved for them in
 the Parliament_ They are permitted to practice their
 religions, to instruct their children, and--al-though with a
 great deal of disruptive interference--to maintain schools.
 Citing the. example of the Armenian Christians (who number
 about 20G,000G, the Special Rapporteur said in his February
 1990 report that religious minorities are freely able to
 practice their faith. He said the Armenians operate 7 active
 churches in Tehran and 12 in Isfahan, and are able to bury
 their dead in their own cemeteries. He also noted that the
 Armenians are permitted to, publish a weekly newspaper and to
 operate a number of cultural associations.
 Reports from other sources, however, suggest that while there
 is little overt discrimination against Christians,
 
 
 1450
 IRAN
 administrative and other official harassment is commonplace.
 In the case of.the Chaldean Catholics (numbering about
 14,000), the Government has reportedly refused to renew the
 church's registration and has, ds a result, denied requests to
 print Bibles, construct chapels, or engage in registered
 charitable activities. The Presbyterian church has allegedly
 suffered similar interference from the authorities; while the
 Interior Ministry was said to have allowed elections for
 church officials, it disrupted the meeting at which they took
 place and obstructed the balloting.
 The Government in 1990 continued to discriminate against the
 Baha'i community, Iran's largest non-Muslim minority (300,000-
 to 350-,000 members). The Baha'i religion, an offshoot of
 Islam, is considered a "misguided sect" by the authorities and
 is not officially recognized.
 In some important respects, the Government mitigated its
 repression of .individual Baha'is, continuing the trend of the
 .ast several years. According to the National Spiritual
 Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States, 14 Baha'is were
 arTested in 1990 while 19 were released, leaving only 9
 Baha'is in prison for religious reasons. No Baha'is were
 reported to have been executed in 1990. A small number'of
 Baha'is were permitted to leave the country. Some Baha'i
 property confiscated by the Goveiinment was returned,,including
 most Baha'i-owned shops, although the amount represents a
 small fraction of the total seized. Most Baha'is are now able
 to obtain food ration booklets. Baha'is are now generally
 able to bury their dead in Baha'i cemeteries, although this
 remains a problem in a number of areas. Baha'i children are
 now permitted to. attend grade school and high school. In his
 February.1990 report, the Special Rapporteur noted that "the
 situation of the Baha'is-is moving towards quite broad de
 facto tolerance."
 However, the Government has not officially abandoned its
 anti-Baha'i policies. Widespread discrimination against the
 community persists. All property of the community, such as
 places of worship, remains confiscated. Baha'i marriages are
 still not recognized. Baha'is generally cannot attend college
 (the Special Rapporteur notes that only four have been
 admitted to universities) or be employed on college
 faculties. Baha'is are forbidden to participate in social
 welfare organizations, and they may not teach their faith.
 Some Baha'is continue to be denied public sector (and often
 private sector) employment on account of their religion; in a
 number of cases ration cards have been denied on the same
 grounds. Thousands of Baha'is dismissed from government jobs
 in the early 1980's receive no unemployment benefits and have
 been required to repay the Government for salaries or pensions
 received from the first day of employment. Those unable t6 do
 so face severe prison sentences. While some Baha'i's have
 been issued passports, the Special Rapporteur reported that
 the vast majority of such requests are denied. The Government
 continues to attack the Baha'i community as a front for
 political and espionage. activities and prohibits the community
 from electing leaders or conducting religious activities.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Iranians may travel to any part of Iran, although there have
 been restrictions on travel to Kurdish areas at times of heavy
 
 
 1451
 IRAN
 fighting. Persons may change their place of residence without
 obtaining permission.
 Males of draft age are not issued exit visas except for
 approved courses of study, and Iranians who are suspect
 politically, such as some'retirea military officers and
 high-level public officials under the former regime, are not
 able to leave the country. Persons who have not repaid loans
 obtained from development banks under the old government also
 are denied exit visas. Reportedly some Iranians, particularly
 those whose skills are in short supply and who were educated
 at government expense, must'post bonds to obtain exit visas.
 In his February 1990 report, the Special Rapporteur recounted
 several instances in which passports were denied, sometimes
 for apparent political reasons, and on other occasions with no
 reason given. As noted in Section 2.c., most Baha'is are
 denied passports.
 Iranian Jews are permitted to obtain passports and to travel,
 even to Israel, but they are normally denied the multiple-exit.
 visas given to most Iranians and must make a fresh application
 (with a fresh fee) for each planned trip. Permission is not
 normally granted for all members of a Jewish family to travel
 outside Iran at the same time.
 Iranians are generally able to return to Iran after long
 periods abroad without reprisal. Since the end of the
 Iran-Iraq war, the Government has encouraged the many
 thousands of skilled Iranians living abroad to return to help
 rebuild the country. Of those who have gone back in recent
 years, a number have been able to pursue, through the Iranian
 judicial system, the return of their properties. However,
 many exiles complain that formal legal guarantees of their
 safety have not yet been provided, and, as a result, many
 remain reluctant to return.
 There are some categories of persons who may be in danger if
 they return to Iran. Some of those with close tie& to the
 former regime, draft evaders, and those who departed the
 country illegally face possible arrest upon their return.
 Members or sympathizers with the People's Mojahedin
 Organization of Iran, an opposition group, are subject to
 imprisonment and torture or even execution should they return.
 Nevertheless, immediate relatives of persons wanted by the
 - Government are often able to live in Iran, travel outside, and
 return without undue difficulty.
 Iranian passports have a-lways been stamped "not valid for
 emigration," but the Government does not make a clear
 distinction between legal residence in another country and
 emigration. Accorcing to the regulations, Iranians with a
 legal residence outside Iran may be issued passports and
 advance exit visas by the Iranian embassy, consulate, or
 interests section in their country of residence. Iranians who
 have acquired U.S. citizenship are considered Iranian (in
 effect dual nationals) unless they have formally renounced
 their Iranian citizenship in accordance with Iranian law.
 There have been many instances in which Iranian authorities
 have confiscated the U.S. passports of dual nationals. There
 are no known instances of the denial of Iranian citizenship to
 Iranians who left Iran, or to those who have remained there.
 
 
 1452
 IRAN
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Iran is ruled by a group of religious leaders (mullahs) and
 their lay associates who share a belief in the legitimacy of a
 theocratic-state based on Ayatollah Khomeini's interpretation
 of Shi'a Islam. Citizens are not free to question or to
 change this form of government.
 The reyolutionary Government has held elections at fairly
 regular intervals for president, Parliament deputies, members
 of the Assembly of Experts (responsible for choosing the
 Revolutionary Leader's successor), and members of local
 governnent councils. Elections for the Assembly of Experts
 and parliamentary by-elections were contested in October.
 Voting is by universal suffrage of everyone age 15 and older
 and is by secret ballot. All candidates must be approved by
 the Council of Guardians, however, and only those meeting the
 Council's vaguely described political and religious criteria
 may run. In practice, only supporters of the theocratic state
 are accepted.
 The Ministry of Interior annoinced in December 1988 that
 political parties would be allowed to form, provided they met
 the Government's religious and political criteria. Since then
 only a few have been licensed.
 The independence of the Parliament is provided for in the
 Constitution and exists to a large degree in practice. While
 Parliament deputies are typically allied with various powerful
 political and religious officials, they may speak and vote
 independently and may shift from one faction to another.
 Vigorous parliamentary debates--normally covered extensively
 in the press--cover a wide variety of issues. Harsh criticism
 of government officials is often heard in these debates, and,
 in some cases, laws proposed by the executive branch have been
 voted down.
 The Constitution provides for a Council of Guardians composed
 of 12 members: 6 clerics unilaterally appointed by the
 Leader, and 6 lay members well grounded in Islamic law who are
 nominated by the head of the Judicial Council, subject to the
 Parliament's approval. The Council of Guardians must certify
 all bills passed by the Parliament as being in accordance with
 Islamic law and the Constitution. 'If bills fail to be
 certified, they are sent back to the Parliament for revision.
 They cannot become law until passed by the Parliament and
 certified by the Council.
 The Council has rejected various important bills and portions
 of bills passed by the Parliament, including legislation on
 land reform, foreign trade, private enterprise, the press
 code, and-reform of the civil code.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 Iranian organizations that attempt to speak out on human
 rights, such as the Freedom Movement and the Association for
 the Protection of Liberties and Human Rights, face severe
 harassment by the Government (see Section 2.b.). In the past,
 the Government generally has been uncooperative with foreign
 human rights groups, whether government sponsored or
 independent, regarding their activities-as interference in the
 
 
 1453
 IRAN
 country's interfal affairs. Foreign diplomats stationed in
 Tehran who attempt to develop information about human rights
 abuses face strong interference from Iranian authorities.
 However, in January the Government, for the first time,
 permitted the U.N. Special Rapporteur to visit the country and
 interview both opponents and supporters of the Government,
 including high-ranking Government officials such as the
 President and the head of the judiciary. Nevertheless, his
 access to victims of abuse was limited, and some of those who
 testified faced reprisals. A second visit by the Special
 Rapporteur took place in October. Again, the Government
 denied him access to some of those imprisoned persons he
 wished to interview. Government-imposed controls during the
 Special Rapporteur's visits prevented him from being able to
 investigate fully all reports of human rights abuses.
 In his February 1990 report, the Special Rapporteur said that,
 during his visit in January, the Government responded
 favorably in principle to several of his suggestions. These
 included regular visits by the International Committee of the
 Red Cross (ICRC) to prisons throughout the country to examine
 conditions and to look into the situation of political
 prisoners; the possibility of the U.N. Center for Human Rights
 in Geneva providing technical assistance to Iran; development
 of a program to identify inconsistencies between Islamic law
 and international law to help bring the Iranian system more in
 line with accepted international standards of human rights-;
 and consideration of humanitarian requests submitted by the
 Special Rapporteur.
 To date, the Government has been in touch with the ICRC and
 has reached agreement in principle to facilitate prison visits
 by ICRC officials. The Foreign'Ministry is also working on a
 paper comparing international law and Islamic law.
 In addition to its acceptance of the Special Rapporteur's-
 mission, the Government has also indicated its willingness in
 principle to receive an official visit from Middle East Watch,
 a New York-based human rights monitoring group, in January
 1991.
 In its 1990 Report, AI said that it pressed the Government to
 respond to charges of mass execution of political opponents in
 1988-89. The Government responded that a small number had
 been executed for taking part in armed incursions by the
 People's Mojahedin into Iran, and that the Government had the
 right to punish those who took up arms against it. Al said
 that the Government failed to reply to repeated requests for
 details of any charges brought against political prisoners.
 In response to AI's appeal for an end to mass executions of
 accused drug dealers, the Government said it believes the
 death penalty is an appropriate response to such a serious
 crime, but did not respond to AI's concerns about the summary
 trials of many of those executed.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Women have faced heightened discrimination-since the
 revolution. Ultraconservative dress, entirely hiding the hair
 and all of the body except the face and hands, is a
 requirement for all women, regardless of their religion,
 national origin, or citizenship. In the past, women have been
 harassed, detained, or physically attacked if they appeared in
 
 
 1454
 IRAN
 public inc.cothing that Qfficial or self-appointed guardians
 of public-morality deemed insufficiently modest. While
 enforcement of these rules has varied considerably since the
 cease-=fire with Iraq in 1988, and particularly since
 Ayatollah Khomeini's .death last year, in 1990 a crackdown on
 dress code and morals violations was announced (see Section
 l.f.) ... -
 Although violence against women is known to occur in Iran,
 little is known ebout its extent. Abuse within the family is
 considered-a private matter in this conservative society and
 is seldom discussed publicly. There are no official
 tatistics on the subject. In his February 1990 report, the
 Special Representative related several accounts of the torture
 and execution of women detainees, some of whom-were allegedly
 raped before execution.
 Under legislation passed in 1983, women have the right to
 divorce their husbands, and regulations promulgated in 1984
 substantially broadened to 12 the number of grounds for which
 a woman.may seqk divorce. .A husband may obtain a divorce
 without having to state a reason or go to court.
 The Christian,,Jewish, Zoroastrian, and Baha'i minorities
 suffer varying degrees of officially sanctioned discrimination
 in a -number of areas,-partidularly with respect to employment,
 -education, and public accommodations. Muslims who have
 converted to Christianity are-similarly discriminated
 against. For example, one requirement of university admission
 is passing. a test on Islamic theology, which has the effect of
 excluding most religious minorities from higher education.
 Applicants for public sector employment are similarly screened
 for-adherence to standards of Islamic orthodoxy, with much the
 same effect.- There have also been reports that religious
 minorities have suffered discrimination in the legal system,
 such as receiving lower awards in injury and death lawsuits,
 and of suffering heavier punishments than those imposed on
 Muslims. Although Sunnis have encountered religious
 discrimination on the local level, the Government has made
 efforts to reduce Shi'a-Sunni antagonism.
 Section 6 Worker Rights
 a. -The Right of Association
 There are no real labor unions. A national organization known
 as the "House of Labor," founded in 1982 as the labor branch
 of the now defunct Islamic Republican Party, is the only
 authorized national labor organization. It works closely with
 the Islamic societies and "Islamic labor councils" set up in
 most Iranian factories. The House of Labor is headed by
 Hossein Kamali, the Minister of Labor; as such, it is largely
 a conduit .of government influence and control, not a trade
 union founded by workers to represent their interests.
 The officially sanctioned Islamic labor councils also are
 instruments of government control and not bodies created and
 controlled by workers to advance their own interests, although
 they have frequently been able to block layoffs or the firing
 of workers.
 There is also a system of "guild unions," which operates on a
 regional basis. These guild unions issue vocational licenses,
 fund financial cooperatives to assist members, and help

 workers to find jobs. The guild unions operate with the
 cooperation of the Government.
 No information is available on the right of workers in Iran to
 strike. No strikes are known to have taken place in 1990, and
 it is unlikely that the Government would tolerate any strike
 deemed to be at odds with its economic and labor policies.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively
 In practice, the right of workers to organize independently
 and bargain collectively is extremely limited. It is not
 known whether labor legislation and practice in the export
 processing zones differ in any significant respect from the
 law and practice in the rest of the country,
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor
 Section 273 of the Iranian Penal Code provides that any person
 who does not have definite means of subsistence and who,
 through laziness or negligence, does not look for work may be
 obliged by the Government to take suitable employment. This
 provision has been frequently criticized by the Committee of
 Experts (COE) of the International Labor Organization (ILO) as
 contravening ILO Convention 29 on forced labor. In its 1990
 report, the COE noted an indication by the Government in its
 latest report to the Committee that provision 273 had been
 abolished and replaced, for a trial period, by a new provision
 approved by the Parliament. The Government, according to the
 COE, stated that the new provision was not incompatible with
 Convention 29, and promised to provide a copy after the
 provision was translated- The COE noted that the Government
 had indicated in its 1977 report that similar regulations
 concerning unemployed persons and vagrants had been repealed,
 but had not yet complied with the Committee's request for a
 copy of the repealing legislation.
 d. Mfnimum Age for Employment of Children
 Iranian labor law, which exempts agriculture, domestic
 service, family businesses, and, to some extent, other small
 businesses, forbids employment of minors under 12 years and
 places special restrictions on the employment of minors under
 18. In addition, women and minors may not be used for hard
 labor or, in general, for night work. The extent to which
 these regulations are enforced is not known.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work
 The labor law establishes a 6-day workweek of 48 hours maximum
 (except for overtime at premium rates), with 1 day of rest
 (normally Friday) per week as well as at least 12 days per
 year of leave with pay and a number of paid public holidays.
 There are also legal provisions with respect to minimum wages
 and health and safety in workplaces. Further information on
 these laws and the amount and adequacy of the minimum wage is
 not available.
 Given the large segments of the economy exempted from the
 labor law, the State's still unresolved administrative
 disorganization resulting from the xevolution, the effects of
 the war with Iraq, and the general lack of effective labor
 unions, it is unclear to what extent the provisions of Iran's
 labor law affect most of the labor force.

 IRAN
 The ILO has long been-concerned with official discrimination
 in employment against members of the Baha'i religion. In its
 1990 report, the ILO's COE cited somewhat conflicting reports
 indicating that the Government was moving toward ending
 discrimination ih employment against Baha'is, and asked the
 Government to provide clarification of the current situation
 and the Government's intentions.
 When the COE report was discussed in the ILO Conference
 Committee on the Application of Standards in June, the
 Government delegate-from Iran-outlined and provided
 documentation on various legislative reforms and steps that
 the Government claims it is taking to bring about compliance
 with -onvehtion i1 barring discrimination in employment,
 which has been the primary focus of complaints against Iran at
 the ILO for its treatment of Baha'is (see also Section 5).
