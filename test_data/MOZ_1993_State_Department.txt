 MOZAMBIQUE
 In 1993 Mozambique continued to be governed by President Joaquim Chissano
 and the Ruling National Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO). The
 multiparty elections called for in the 1990 Constitution, and initially set for 1 year
 from the October 4, 1992 signing in Rome of the General Peace Accord of Mozam-
 bique, marking the end of the civil war, were delayed until October 1994. The Rome
 Accord addressed political party registration, organization of the electoral system,
 the size of the military, political amnesty and oversight of the state intelligence
 service. Approximately 16 unarmed politicai parties were active in 1993, 11 of which
 met the registration criteria set by the Government. FRELIMO and the Mozambican
 National Union (UNAMO) were registered by the end of 1992. The former insur-
 gents, the Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO), had acquired political party
 status as a result of the peace accord.
 The presence of a United Nations peacekeeping force (ONUMOZ) of approximately
 7,000 was fully operational by June and undertook responsibility for helping the
 Mozambique to achieve peace and democracy in their country. Although
 RENAMWO agreed that Mozambique would continue to be governed by the Chissano
 Government until multiparty elections were held, RENAMO continued to assert the
 right to control certain areas they claimed to have occupied prior to the signing of
 the Rome Accord.
 Estimates of the size of the government security forces varied from 60,000 to
 92,000. These figures included the Armed Forces of Mozambique (FAM), a territorial
 force, and a people's militia. RENAMO claims a force of 21,000. The State Informa-
 tion and Security Service (SISE) replaced the Mozambican National Security Service
 (SNASP) in 1991. SISE is to be placed under the supervision of a 21-member mon-
 itoring committee made up of representatives of the Government, RENAMO, and
 independent citizens. In an agreement reached between RENAMO's President
 Dhlakama and President Chissano in August, ONUMOZ is to have responsibility for
 overseeing the Mozambican police force. SISE, unlike the former SNASP, does not
 have the power to arrest and detain suspects, and there were no reported incidents
 of abuses by SISE in 1993.
 Under the terms of the peace agreement, the Government and RENAMO are to
 merge their armies into a new national force of 30,000 soldiers to be known as the
 Mozambique Armed Defense Force (FADM). Those soldiers on both sides not chosen
 for the new force are to be demobilized. RENAMO and the Government began send-
 ing soldiers to Nyanga, Zimbabwe, to start FADM training in August. Demobiliza-
 tion of troops on both sides began on December 1 at 20 assembly areas under U.N.
 supervision, but initially proceeded slowly and unevenly, especially on the RENAMO
 side. As the month progressed, the rate of demobilization picked up, and additional
 assembly areas were opened. At year's end, 35 areas were open, and ONUMOZ re-
 ported that a total of 7,949 government soldiers (19 percent of those expected at
 these areas) and 3,764 Renamo soldiers (36 percent of those expected) had checked
 in.
 The Mozambique economy remained heavily dependent on foreign aid. The coun-
 try continued to move towards a market economy. The gross domestic product de-
 clined over 2 percent in 1992, though the International Monetary Fund forecast a
 4-percent growth in 1993. The return of rain after the worst drought on record in
 1992 and continuing peace meant that many Mozambicans were able to farm their
 lands again, making them less dependent on food aid. Approximately 80 percent of
 the population is employed in agriculture, mostly on a small-scale, subsistence level.
 Major exports are shrimp and cashew nuts.
 Blatant human rights abuses in 1993 included the continuing use of access to hu-
 manitarian relief as an instrument of political control and RENAMO's continuing
 efforts to limit freedom of movement into and within zones over which it claimed
 control. Access to humanitarian relief improved as a result of complaints submitted
 to the Cease-Fire and Control Commission. Both sides frequently attempted to use
 control over the distribution of food aid for their own purposes. RENAMO used it
 as a political weapon for partisan ends, often refusing to cooperate with relief efforts
 while demandirg more assistance. On the government side, corruption and red tape,
 not political maneuvering, were the most significant obstacles to relief efforts.
 Each side accused the other of cease-fire violations and illegal military incursions
 and takeovers. Both sides submitted their complaints to the Cease-Fire and Control
 Commission. Laws guaranteeing individual human rights as granted in the Con-
 stitution were not implemented. Other major human rights problems included sex-
 ual violations of kidnaped women and children in RENANO-controlled areas, harsh
 prison conditions, incidents of military and police extortion and harassment of civil-
 
 
 191
 ians, and the inability of citizens to change their government. In some areas, the
 country's human rights' record improved. Press and other media criticized official
 corruption and, to a lesser extent, government policies, but there was no direct criti-
 cism of the President. Because legislation in 1991 enabled labor unions to register
 individually, three unions declared their independence, and the FRELIMO-domi-
 nated Labor Federation Union sought ways to respond more effectively to worker
 needs. Although hampered by lack of funding, political parties spoke up freely
 throughout 1993 on the economic and political situation in the country.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:
 a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing.-There were no known or suspected
 cases of Government forces targeting persons for political killing in 1993. RENAMO
 was accused by the family of Tiago Salgado of murdering him in July. RENAMO
 admitted that Salgado, a former RENAMO official, had been accused of being a
 FRELIMO spy but claimed he had been killed trying to escape detention.
 b. Disappearance.-There were no reports of government-perpetrated disappear-
 ances. However, thousands remained missing due to the conflict, often as a result
 of kidnapings in areas affected by the war. Although some missing children were
 identified for family reunification, RENAMO was reluctant to release them and in
 a few cases reportedly bartered the children's freedom for material goods or money.
 c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.-
 The Constitution expressly prohibits torture. However, during the prosecution of the
 war both government and RENAMO forces tortured prisoners and civilians, and
 there have been occasional allegations of torture since the war. In 1993 there were
 charges that RENAMO had tortured apparent defector Tiago Salgado before his
 death (See section 1.b.), as well as a Nampula police sergeant detained in December
 after an alleged attempt on the life of Afonso Dhlakama. While similar highly pub-
 licized allegations were not known to have been directed at the Government in 1993,
 the suspicion that it too continues to employ torture remains widespread.
 Prison conditions throughout the country remain poor. Medical and food supplies
 are often insufficient, and overcrowding is a serious problem. Machava Prison on the
 outskirts of Maputo, the largest in Mozambique, holds over twice the number of in-
 mates for which it was built. On July 26, inmates rioted at the Maputo City Jail,
 demanding that the guards remove the body of a prisoner who had died in his cell.
 The prisoners complained that the deceased, Moises Eduardo Mapuro, had been sick
 for 5days but had received no medical attention. In September inmates at Beira
 Prison in Sofala Province went on a hunger strike to demand better living condi-
 tions and an end to treatment that they felt violated their constitutional rights. Po-
 lice ended the strike by force, causing injuries among the inmates.
 Since 1988 the Government has allowed international human rights groups access
 to prisons where national security prisoners (mainly RENAM0 soldiers and
 sympathisers) were held. In 1992 the International Committee of the Red Cross
 (ICRC) was also given access to prisoners held in military prisons. This access con-
 tinued through 1993.
 Reliable evidence accumulated that RENAMO continued to hold women and chil-
 dren, about 5,000 of the latter, against their will. They lived in abysmally poor con-
 ditions and were used as porters, personal servants, and guards in RENAMO
 camps. There were credible reports that kidnaped women were used for sex, as were
 some of the children.
 In 1993 there were no reports of detention of prisoners for national security rea-
 sons.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile.-The law requires that most detainees be
 charged or released within 30 days. However, persons accused of the most serious
 crimes, i.e., security offenses or other offenses requiring a sentence of more than 8
 years, may be detained for up to 84 days without being ormally charged. With court
 approval, such detainees may be held for 2 additional periods of 84 days while the
 police complete their investigation. The detainee's constitutional right to counsel
 and to contact relatives or friends is often not respected.
 In some cases, detainees may be released from prison while the investigation pro-
 ceeds, but the bail system in Mozambique remains ill defined. The law provides
 that, if the prescribed period for investigation has been completed and no charges
 have been brought, the detainee must be released. In practice, however, this law is
 often ignored, in part because of the severe lack of administrative personnel and
 trained lawyers to monitor the jijdicial system (see Section 1. e.), and in part be-
 cause citizens are often unaware of their rights, particularly those granted under
 the 1990 Constitution, and do not demand them. As a result, throughout 1993 there
 
 
 192
 continued to be a large backlog of prisoners awaiting trial. Detainees often spend
 many months, even years, in pretrial status.
 The 1990 Constitution's prohibition of exile or the expulsion of any Mozambican
 citizen was honored in 1993.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial.-Mozambique has two complementary formal jus-
 tice systems: the civil/criminal, which includes customary courts; and the military
 justice system. The Ministry of Justice administers the civil/criminal system and
 shares the administration of the military courts with the Ministry of Defense. At
 the apex of the system is the Supreme Court, to which appeals, including military
 cases, may be made. Local customary courts handle matters such as estate and di-
 vorce cases. In these courts, proceedings are usually conducted in public by a
 trained representative of the Ministry of Justice, assisted by two to four popularly
 elected lay judges.
 The entire judicial process suffers severely from a shortage of trained personnel
 and the Government's inability to reduce a large backlog of cases. The Government,
 with international, assistance, continued to develop a comprehensive plan for im-
 proving the professional level and efficiency of the judiciary. However, no actions
 have been taken to put this plan into effect. As a result, there were no changes in
 the legal system in 1993; it continued to be weak and inefficient. Although all ac-
 cused persons are in theory presumed innocent and have the right to legal counsel
 and the right of appeal these rights are not always honored. Prisoners who were
 poor and without ormai education could remain in detention awaiting arraignment
 beyond the 30 days allowed by law, usually without access to legal counsel.
 The 1990 Constitution formally established an independent judiciary and provided
 for the selection of judgesby other jurists, replacing the prior system of administra-
 tively appointed justices. However, the President still appoints the members of the
 most important tribunal, the Supreme Court, and the FRELIMO-controlled Assem-
 bly appoints "lay judges" to that Court.
 Since the establishment of the Supreme Court in 1988 and the abolition of the
 Revolutionary Military Tribunal, persons accused of crimes against the State are
 tried in common civilian courts under standard criminal judicial procedures. A judge
 may order a trial closed because of national security interests or to protect the pri-
 vacy of the plaintiff in cases concerning rape.
 In 1993 the Government claimed that there were no national security prisoners.
 At the beginning of 1992 it was reported by credible sources that the Government
 held an estimated 400-550 national security prisoners, most of whom were accused
 of sympathizing with, or committing crimes on behalf of, RENAMO. The Rome Ac-
 cordprovided for the rele-ase of such prisoners, and an amnesty was passed allowing
 for thie release of over 300 prisoners. All credible reports indicate that the Govern-
 ment no longer detained national security prisoners in 1993.
 RENAMO continued to administer the areas under its control through a rudi-
 mentary form of civil administration. Reports continued that RENAMO relied on
 traditional courts in these areas, with military commanders sometimes acting as
 judges. On September 10, RENAMO announced that the authority of the Constitu-
 tion did not extend to areas under its control, a controversial position at variance
 with the 1992 peace agreement.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence.-The
 1990 Constitution provides for privacy. During the war, police and security forces
 entered homes at will, but after the sigin  of the Rome Accord such activity
 abated. Many persons were forcibly resettled during the war by both RENAMO and
 the Government. With the end of the war, persons in government-controlled terri-
 tory have been generally free to return to their homes. Persons under RENAMO's
 control have not always had the same freedom to return to their homes (see Section
 1. b.).
 Throughout 1993 there were credible reports that RENAMO was forcing individ-
 uals in areas under its control to join it. In Manica Province, RENAMO was accused
 of confiscating FRELIMO membership cards. A report from Zambezia Province
 claimed that RENAMO insisted that individuals join it before they could recover
 their property in RENAMO-controlled areas. RENAMO made similar accusations
 concerning government political activity, particularly in Nampula Province. While
 the accusations are credible, coercive activity by government authorities is not sys-
 tematic.
 It is widely assumed that government forces employ surveillance devices to mon-
 itor local and international telecommunications systems and that they periodically
 inspect mail, even though the new Constitution expressly prohibits such surveil-
 lance.
 g. Use of Excessive Force and Violations of Humanitarian Law in Internal Con-
 flicts.-The Rome Accord ended the fighting that had marked the brutal 17-year
 
 
 civil war although violations of the cease-fire continued to occur in 1993. Although
 neither t1e Government nor RENAMO officially opposed access to humanitarian aid
 during implementation of the peace process, RENAMO was credibly accused of hin-
 dering distribution of humanitarian relief in areas under its control. For example,
 an international nongovernmental organization (NGO) reported in September that
 malnutrition and medical shortages existed in some RENAMO-controlled areas in
 Zambezia Province due to RENAMO reluctance to allow access to relief organiza-
 tions. The same month another international assistance organization reported dif-
 ficulties with RENAMO administrators who hindered distribution of agricultural aid
 kits. There were also numerous cases of unpaid, hungry soldiers extorting food from
 NGO warehouses, including a late November incident in which armed government
 soldiers invaded offices and residences of an international NGO in Mutarrara in
 Tete province and seized food. These incidents do not represent any systematic gov-
 ernment policy, however, but rather are an indication of its inability to support and
 pay its forces.
 Section 2. Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press.-The Constitution, the 1991 press law, and the
 1992 Rome Accord provide for freedom of expression and the press, but with restric-
 tions in cases involving national defense considerations. Legally, criticism of the
 President is not prohibited; in practice few news reports or editorial commentaries
 critical of him appear. The 1991 press law holds that in cases of defamation against
 the President, truth is not a sufficient defense against libel. Through the end of
 1993, this law had not been tested in court, but its result was considerable self-cen-
 sorship.
 On balance, freedom of the press continued to improve in 1993. The media, par-
 ticularly the private newssheet Mediafax, television, and radio, reported objectively
 on controversial topics, including disagreements between the Government and
 RENAMO on peace agreement implementation, high-level military corruption, inter-
 nal unrest in the military, and political opposition viewpoints. Several journalists
 continued to push the boundaries of press freedom, and the National Organization
 of Journalists maintained its stron support of an independent media. For example,
 TV Mozambique aired a story in which the President's late brother was accused of
 suspect real estate dealings involving land of a psychiatric hospital. However, even
 without formal prior press censorship, journalists in the state-run media were often
 implicitly held to unwritten and vague guidelines by their directors (who are ap-
 pointed by the Government). There is ample evidence that journalists in the state-
 run media continue to be under strong pressure to avoid any investigative reporting
 that could expose high-level corruption.
 . During the 1993 multiparty conference on the electoral law, opposition politicians
 received almost daily coverage of their statements and views on the proceedings.
 RENAMO complained that it was consistently mistreated in the government-run
 media, whose bias was evident in skewed stories and em hasis on the negative.
 While the import of speeches and attendance at RENAMO rallies was routinely
 downplayed, for example, RENAMO defections or alleged hindrances to the peace
 process were blown out of proportion to their true significance. Nonetheless,
 RENAMO received wide coverage in media organs, and the party began to publish
 its periodical, Novos Tempos, in Maputo instead of Portugal.
 In early 1993, a reporter for radio Mozambique was denied access to RENAMO
 areas in Manica Province. As a result, the head of Mozambique's National Union
 of Journalists accused RENAMO of refusing to allow free press coverage in areas
 under its administration. RENAMO responded that all journalists would need spe-
 cific authorization to enter areas under its control. In practice, RENAMO territory
 is not freely accessible to journalists, or any other outsiders, and a few Mozambican
 journalists, who had given no advance notice of their trips, were turned away at the
 borders of RENAMO-controlled areas. For most journalists, this has not been an
 issue because they have been primarily interested in visiting RENAMO head-
 quarters at Maringue, a trip which for purely logistical reasons requires advance
 preparation. RENAMO was generally cooperative in arranging such visits.
 The Hi her Council of Social Communications (CSCS), created by the 1991 press
 law, met for the first time in 1993. Its stated mission is to arbitrate disputes, hear
 complaints, and set guidelines on media issues. At year's end, it was uncertain what
 influence the CSCS might have.
 Until 1992 almost all media were government owned or government operated. In
 1992 Mozambique's first privately owned daily news bulletin, Mediafax, began pub-
 lication, and in 1993 Mediacoop, Mediafax's parent cooperative, planned to begin
 publication of a weekly news journal, Savana, but complained that publication was
 being delayed by government interference and the levy of excessive taxes. These
 
 
 194
 charges appeared to be well grounded. Also in 1993, Mozambique's first independent
 television station, Radio Televisao Klint (RTK), began broadcasting in Maputo. Two
 opposition political parties, the National Convention Party (PCN) and the Social
 Liberal and Democratic Party (SOL), began publication of periodic newssheets. An
 independent media cooperative, Coopartes, received funding to begin a new weekly,
 although publication had not begun by year's end.
 In mid-1993, the government-run Noticias group of newspapers announced plans
 to privatize their operation, although the State directly and through the Bank of
 Mozambique will continue to have majority control after contracts are awarded.
 No formal restrictions on academic freedom exist, but in ractice teachers rou-
 tinely adhere to self-censorship since their employment depends on the State.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association.-The Constitution provides for
 freedom of assembly and association. Legislation enacted in 1991 set up guidelines
 for registering as a political party and for holdingpublic demonstrations. During
 1993 political groups were free to hold congresses and press conferences and to trav-
 el in areas under the Government's control. RENAMO, however, limited access to
 areas under its control and in September announced that it would not permit politi-
 cal parties to campaign in its areas.
 Under legislation approved in October 1992, a legally recognized political party
 must demonstrate that it has no racial, ethnic, or religious exclusiveness and secure
 at least 2,000 signatures of support. By the end of 1993, 10 parties, including
 FRELIMO, were registered. In September the registration application of one party,
 the Federal Party of Mozambique-Democratic Federalist (PARMO-DP), was denied
 by the Ministry of Justice because the use of the term "federalist" in its party name
 was deemed contradictory to the unitarist definition of the Mozambican State as set
 forth in the Constitution. Under the Rome Accord, RENAMO received political party
 status without having to meet registration requirements in advance.
 No groups were known to be have been denied permission to hold public marches
 in 1993.
 c. Freedom of Religion.-The Constitution mandates strict separation of church
 and state and provides for the freedom to "practice or not practice a religion." The
 Government does not require religious organizations or missionaries to register, and
 foreign missionaries are readily granted visas. The Constitution gives religious insti-
 tutions the right to own property and to operate schools. Relations between the Gov-
 ernment and religious organizations, tense in the early years after independ-
 ence,began to improve by 1992 and improved further in 1993.
 d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Re-
 patriation.-The Constitution provides for freedom of travel within the country and
 abroad. The Government no longer requires citizens to obtain permits from local au-
 thorities in order to travel within the country.
 The civil war and the 1992 drought caused massive internal migrations in search
 of food, water, and safety. With the end of the civil war and the return of the rains,
 3.6 million internally displaced people were free to return home, as were the almost
 2 million refugees who had sought safety in neighboring countries. Under the aus-
 pices of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Inter-
 national Organization of Migration, the displaced and refugee populations began to
 return. Although numbers were difficult to gauge, it was estimated that by the end
 of 1993 over 450,000 refugees had returned to Mozambique. Involuntary repatri-
 ation from South Africa continued well into 1993. An agreement between the
 UNHCR and South Africa was concluded in September to allow UNHCR access to
 Mozambicans who had fled into South Africa. In October South Africa, Mozambique,
 and the UNHCR signed a tripartite agreement governing the return of the
 Mozambican refugees from South Africa.
 Reports from credible sources, including international organizations indicated
 that in 1993 RENAMO prevented the free movement of people and goods through-
 out its regions. RENAMO officials were requiring travel documents, "Guias da
 Marcha", to allow people to enter areas under its control or to move within those
 zones. In June RENAMO detained a Member of Parliament, Aurelio Fernando
 Manhica, and his party of 18 in the Salamanga region of Maputo Province.
 RENAMO claimed that the party had been hunting in RENAMO territory without
 permission. Despite the intervention of the U.N. peacekeeping force, RENAMO held
 the detainees for almost 3 weeks.
 In July RENAMO detained 17 timber workers and confiscated 2 tractors in Sofala
 Province because they were doing forestry work in a RENAMO area without its per-
 mission. In August RENAMO refused to allow road repairs in areas under its con-
 trol. Both cases were symptomatic of the extremely contentious issue of administra-
 tive control in disputed areas.
 
 
 195
 Mozambique hosted few refugees from other countries. At the end of 1993, there
 were 80 refugees from other countries under the protection of the UNHCR and an-
 other 250 asylum seekers awaiting determination of their status. There were no re-
 ported cases in which refugees were forced to return to countries where they might
 have a well-founded fear of persecution.
 Section 3. Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Govern-
 ment
 In 1993 citizens could not change their government by democratic means. Though
 the 1990 Constitution officially ended FRELIMO's status as the sole legal political
 party and permitted the creation of other parties, the President, the FRELIMO Po-
 litical Commission, and the Council of Ministers continued to control policymaking
 and implementation and were set to remain in office pending future elections,
 scheduled for October 1994.
 The Rome Accord established an election timetable and an independent monitor-
 ing system to ensure their fairness. Multiparty elections decreed by the Constitution
 were to be held within a year of the October 4, 1992 signing of the Accord. However,
 because of delays in the implementation of the peace process, all parties agreed to
 postpone elections until October 1994. Balloting is to be secret, and an electoral
 commission made up of members of FRELIMO, RENAMO, and the political parties
 is to organize and direct the election process. The Accord specified that the Govern-
 ment, in consultation with RENAMO and other opposition parties, should enact an
 election law. A multiparty conference on the draft law ended after prolonged debate
 failed to produce results. However, the Government continued to consult with
 RENAMO and the opposition parties in bilateral meetings to produce a final docu-
 ment which was submitted to the National Assembly and ratified on December 9.
 The peace agreement allows for international election observers to be supervised by
 the United Nations.
 Under the Rome Accord, RENAMO is to be an equal partner in supervising and
 monitoring the electoral process, the cease-fire, and demobilization of the armed
 forces. The agreement accorded RENAMO the right to participate in the civil admin-
 istration of areas it nominally controlled at the time of the agreement. A summit
 meeting in Maputo in August between President Chissano and RENAMO's Presi-
 dent Dhlakama produced agreement that RENAMO was to appoint advisors to the
 provincial governors. A few days later RENAMO partially pulled back from the
 agreement and declared that the Government's Constitution would not be effective
 in areas under its control, nor would RENAMO permit political parties to campaign
 in its zones.
 There were no women ministers in the Government at year's end. There was one
 vice minister (of foreign affairs). J. few women are active in the leadership of non-
 governmental organizations. While there are no legal restrictions hindering women's
 involvement in government, cultural factors have inhibited their political advance-
 ment.
 Section 4. Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental In-
 vestigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights
 There are no legal obstacles to the formation of local human rights groups. The
 Mozambican League for Human Rights became active in late 1993, holding several
 public meetings in Maputo and developing plans for education and monitoring pro-
 grams to be started in 1994.
 Human rights organizations with more defined constituencies and goals have been
 effective. Two groups, the Association of Women, Law, and Development
 (MULEIDE) and the Association of Mozambican Disabled (ADEMO), were estab-
 lished chiefly to address the legal rights of the groups they represent (see Section
 5.). Another group, the Movement for Peace in Mozambique, announced its forma-
 tion in 1993. It aimed to involve all sectors of Mozambican society to safeguard the
 peace process.
 The Government remained receptive to international human rights monitoring
 gups and is responsive to inquiries on human rights issues. In 1992 the New
 York-based Africa Watch was allowed to visit and interview prisoners, and it pub-
 licly praised the Government for its cooperation. The only access by an international
 human rights monitoring group to RENAMO areas during 1993 was a trip by the
 Africa Watch rapporteur early in the year. It should be noted, however, that his
 visit was primarily concerned with investigating the mine-clearing issue, not the
 human rights situation.
 
 
 Section 5. Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or So-
 cial Status
 The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, religion, or disabil-
 ity.
 Women.-The Constitution forbids discrimination on the basis of sex and man-
 dates equal rights and responsibilities for women. In practice, however, women con-
 tinue to be underrepresented in the professions and in educational institutions at
 all levels. Over 80 percent of Mozanican women are peasant farmers, and most
 have had little education or access to good health care. Mozambique has one of the
 highest maternal mortality rates in the world.
 Although the Constitution upholds the equality of women in society and before the
 law, practical implementation often falls short of this ideal. Old civil and commer-
 cial legal codes that predate independence and still exist deny women full financial
 rights once they marry. The Justice Ministry, in collaboration with MULEIDE (see
 Section 4), was tasked with identifying these outdated laws which contradict rights
 granted women by the 1S90 Constitution. MULEIDE aims to promote and defend
 the legal rights of women, particularly as they pertain to improving social conditions
 and ensuring participation in the development process.
 According to medical and other sources, violence against women, especially wife
 beating, is fairly widespread in Mozambique, especially in rural areas. The police
 do not normally intervene in domestic disputes, and cases are rarely brought before
 the courts. The Government has not addressed the issue specifically. A local wom-
 en's group indicates that nondomestic violence against women also has increased
 and that there has been a rise in the number of rape cases in urban areas. Both
 trends are concomitant with the overall rise in the national crime rate.
 Children.--Children's rights and welfare have not been a priority of the Govern-
 ment. For its part, RENAMO in 1993 continued to utilize children taken from their
 homes during the war as soldiers and porters. While RENAMO has not agreed to
 a full-scale program aimed at resolving this problem, it cooperates on a case-by-case
 basis with efforts to reunify these children with their families.
 Female genital mutilation is practiced in Mozambique, most frequently in the
 Muslim northern part of the country.
 National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities.-There was no systematic persecution or dis-
 crimination on the basis of race but no whites and few mixed-race Mozambican and
 Asians serve in the military. Moreover, the FRELIMO Government includes at all
 levels a disproportionate number of southerners, mostly from the Shangaan ethnic
 group. The Government also includes white, Asian, and mixed-race Mozambicans.
 The leadership of RENAMO is predominately from the Shona-speaking ethnic
 groups concentrated in the center of the country. There is no indication that the con-
 flict between the Government and RENAMO was primarily motivated by ethnicity,
 although ethnic and regional factors may have played some role, and tribal factors
 may explain some of the violence during the conflict. Historical accident appears to
 be responsible for the ethnic composition of the RENAMO leadership; the Shona
 was the group culturally and geographically most accessible to the Southern Rhode-
 sian intelligence organization, which established the forerunner to RENAMO in the
 late 1970's. Since that time, RENAMO recruited from all ethnic groups and never
 significantly emphasized ethnic issues in its communiques or negotiating positions.
 It as, however criticized FRELIMO for being dominated by southerners.
 People with bisabilities.-Although the Constitution expressly states that "dis-
 abled citizens shall enjoy fully the rights enshrined in the Constitution," reality
 often falls short of this ideal. In 1991 ADEMO (see Section 4) was created to address
 the social and economic needs of the disabled. ADEMO provides training, raises
 public awareness of the need fully to integrate the disabled into society, and lobbies
 the Ministry of Labor to initiate legislation to support the working rights of the dis-
 abled. The Government has not legislated or otherwise mandated access for the dis-
 abled to public buildings. No special access facilities exist.
 Section 6. Worker Rights
 a. The Right of Association.-The Constitution specifies that all workers are free
 to join or refrain from joining a trade union. A labor law passed in December 1991
 further protects workers' rights to organize and to engage in union activity at their
 place of employment. The legislation gave existing unions-those created as append-
 ages of the FRELIMO-dominated Organization of Mozambican Workers (OTM)-the
 right to register independently. During 1993 the three unions that had broken away
 from the OTM announced their intention either to reform OTM from within or, fail-
 ing that, to form their own association. Their activities resulted in OTM's reexam-
 ination of its own constitution, structure, and policies in representing workers. Late
 in the year, in the face of threats by the independent unions to call a general strike,
 
 
 the Government agreed to negotiate with these unions on the minimum wage and
 other issues.
 The Constitution explicitly provides for the right to strike, with the exception of
 government employees, police, military personnel, and employees of other essential
 services (which include sanitation, firefighting, air traffic control, health care, water,
 electricity, fuel, post office, and telecommunications). Nevertheless, strikes by sol-
 diers to protest the Government's failure to pay back wages continued in 1993.
 Wildcat strikes continued to occur elsewhere, mostly due to the failure of pay rates
 to keep pace with inflation and employers' failure to provide promised benefits.
 Maputo postal workers went on strike for these reasons in August, returning on
 September 1 after some of their demands were met. In September workers at a mar-
 ble factory in Cabo Delgado Province successfully negotiated a 50-percent pay raise
 and better working conditions after a 3-day strike.
 The 1991 labor law forbids retribution against strikers, the hiring of substitute
 workers, or lockouts by employers. There were no known instances during 1993 in
 which employer retribution against striking workers was an issue.
 Most labor disputes continued to be arbitrated through ad hoc workers' commit-
 tees, formally recognized by the Government. The development of the newly inde-
 pendent labor unions was hindered by a lack of resources. However, their actions
 influenced the OTM which called for a national labor congress and began to address
 areas of dispute between the OTM and the independent unions.
 In August the OTM was highly critical of a government-announced minimum pay
 raise, complaining that it was insufficient to meet worker needs, and insisted that
 the OTM should have been consulted prior to the announcement.
 The Constitution and labor legislation guarantee unions the right to join and par-
 ticipate in international bodies. The OTM is a member of the Organization of Afri-
 can Trade Union Unity and the Suthern African Trade Union Coordinating Coun-
 cil.
 b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively.-The labor law protects work-
 ers' rights to organize and engage in collective bargaining. It expressly prohibits dis-
 crimination against organized labor, although antiunion discrimination has not been
 an issue since until recently unions were government-controlled organizations. In
 late 1991, the Government decreed that it would no longer set all salary levels. Ne-
 gotiating wage increases was left in the hands of existing unions.
 During 1993, workers continued to bargain with employers through legally recog-
 nized ad hoc committees. The law requires government arbitration if labor and man-
 agement fail to reach agreement. The majority of labor disputes dealt with manage-
 ment's failure to meet salary and other contractual obligations.
 There are no export processing zones in Mozambique.
 c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor.
 Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law, and there have been no reports
 of such labor practices by the Government. There were cridible reports in 1993 that
 RENAMO continued to hold and mistreat children and civilians, kidnaped prior to
 the 1992 Peace Accord, who were used for forced labor (see Section 1.c.).
 d. Minimum Age For Employment of Children.-Child labor is regulated by the
 Ministry of Labor. In the wage economy, the minimum working age is 16. Because
 of high adult unemployment, few children are in regular wage positions. However,
 children commonly work on family farms or in the urban informal sector, where
 they perform such tasks as guarding cars, collecting scrap metal, and vending.
 e. Acceptable Conditions of Work.-The Government sets minimum wage rates ad-
 ministratively. The minimum wage at year's end was approximately $13.75 (70,600
 meticais) per month. The Ministry of Labor is responsible for enforcing the mini-
 mum rates in the private sector, the Ministry of Finance in the public sector. Viola-
 tions of minimum wage rates are usually investigated only after workers register
 a complaint. It is customary for workers to receive benefits such as transportation
 and food. The minimum wage is not adequate to sustain an average urban worker's
 family. Workers must turn to second jobs, if available, as well as work garden plots,
 to survive. An estimated 80 percent of the work force is engaged in subsistence agri-
 culture and is not covered by minimum wage legislation.
 The standard legal workweek is 44 hours, with a 24-hour rest period stipulated.
 In the small modern sector, the Government has enacted health and environmental
 laws to protect workers. On occasion, the Government has closed firms for non-
 compliance with these laws, but enforcement by the Ministry of Labor has been ir-
 regular, particularly in the poor economic conditions of recent years.
