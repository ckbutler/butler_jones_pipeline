 CUBA
 Cuba has been ruled for 25 years by one man, Fidel Castro, and a
 group which seized power in 1959. Working through the state
 bureaucracy, and a network of subordinate organizations, the
 Communist Party dominates all aspects of daily life, controlling
 the means of production and distribution of all goods, services
 and information, public communication, public welfare, and
 education, as well as national defense, foreign relations and
 public security. Internal security is under the direction of the
 Ministry of Interior, which operates the border guard (both sea
 and land) and several police forces, regulates migration, and
 maintains a system of neighborhood informers and block wardens
 known as the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDR).
 Although extreme poverty is uncommon, scarcity is the hallmark of
 the Cuban economy, and many basic necessities are rationed. Long
 lines of Cubans wait for food and manufactured goods which are
 limited in quality and quantity.
 New reports in 1983 confirmed information obtained in previous
 years that the Cuban Government continues to violate human rights
 on a large scale. For instance, in January 1983 death sentences
 were pronounced on several persons who tried to organize an
 independent trade union. Their defense attorneys were later
 detained without charges. There are credible reports that
 summary executions also have been carried out in various parts of
 the country. Some recently released political prisoners
 confirmed that Cuban authorities are still practicing torture and
 other forms of cruel and inhuman treatment or punishment. Cther
 political prisoners have been kept in jail after the expiration
 of their sentences, and some former political prisoners have been
 re-arrested without explanation. A number of lawyers and judges
 have been arrested on allegations of corrupt practices but who
 may actually have been resisting intensification of security
 restrictions on dissent in Cuba. There have been persistent
 reports that the suicide of Minister of Justice Dorticos, a
 former President of Cuba, was linked to his distress over this
 matter. Cuba continues to deny that it violates the most basic
 human rights of its citizens but has refused to allow
 representatives of outside human rights organizations to visit
 the country.
 In the wake of economic distress in Cuba, it is probable that
 repression of human rights in Cuba will intensify. These
 conditions produced an explosion of popular discontent in 1980,
 leading to mass emigration when thousands eagerly responded to
 Cuban Government encouragement to enter the United States
 illegally by boat. With such a safety valve currently not
 available, Cuban authorities will be more watchful for signs of
 public restiveness or attempts to express dissatisfaction with
 the Cuban leadership or its policies.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Unlawful or Arbitrary Deprivation of Life
 Executions to discourage political dissent, which began when
 Castro seized power in 1959, continued in 1983. There are
 credible reports of summary executions following secret trials of
 civilians for alleged political offenses by military tribunals.
 At least three Jehovah's Witnesses are reliably reported to have
 been executed in June 1983 and five others sentenced to death for
 
 (524)
 
 
 525
 alleged crimes relating to religious practice. Another Jehovah's
 Witness was reported to have been executed in August 1983 for
 allegedly spreading "propaganda to incite armed rebellion." A
 23-year-old student in Santiago de Cuba, Carlos Alberto
 Gutierrez, was shot for belonging to a group caught painting
 anti-government slogans on walls.
 b. Disappearance
 Cuban secret police commonly round up persons in nighttime
 arrests; friends, neighbors, and family members have no knowledge
 of their fate and frequently are too terrified to ask. Usually
 these persons are tried and sentenced in secret, but sometimes
 they are interrogated and released. Some Cubans who have
 emigrated and become citizens of another country have later
 disappeared when they returned to Cuba. The Cuban Government
 does not acknowledge their dual nationality and if they are
 arrested when they visit Cuba, consular officials of the country
 of which they are citizens are not allowed access to them. If
 they disappear, the Cuban Government refuses to provide
 information about them to authorities of their new homelands. In
 1983, several Cuban-Americans "disappeared" while in Cuba
 visiting relatives. No information regarding their detention or
 whereabouts was provided to the U.S. Government nor to their
 relatives who inquired about them. In one case, an individual
 was arrested and held incommunicado for three months. When
 released, he reported that he had been interrogated about
 putative espionage and counter-revolutionary activities.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Although the Cuban Constitution proscribes torture by stating
 that "the person who has been arrested or the prisoner is
 inviolable in his personal integrity," there are reliable reports
 that physical and psychological torture continues. A prominent
 former political prisoner, the poet Armando Valladares, who was
 released in late 1982, stated that his jailers subjected him to
 an intensive physical rehabilitation program just before his
 release, in an attempt to show that he had not been mistreated.
 Valladares, along with some of his fellow prisoners, had been
 denied food for 46 days, resulting in the loss of the use of his
 legs. Prison authorities then denied him medical treatment.
 Another former political prisoner who was released in August
 1983, Jose Rodriguez Terrero, spent 22 years in Cuban prisons,
 including months at a time confined naked in a tiny cell called a
 "drawer," which forced the prisoner to curl up in an embryo-like
 position. Also included among the forms of cruel, inhuman, or
 degrading treatment or punishment employed in Cuban prisons is
 the placing of a prisoner in a small, sealed, unventilated room,
 as well as totally isolating a prisoner from other prisoners and
 from the outside world. The use of psychiatry for repressive
 purposes by Cuban authorities has been the subject of writings by
 Dr. Abdo Canasi. He received a 10 year jail sentence for his
 expose, and now that he has been released from confinement he is
 denied permission to leave the country.
 On Mother's Day, May 8, 1983, a group of mothers of prisoners
 gathered at the Combinado del Este Prison near Havana to sing the
 Cuban national anthem and protest against bad conditions in
 prisons, ill-treatment of prisoners, and lack of due process.
 Police reportedly dispersed the mothers, using high pressure
 water hoses and dogs. Reports indicate that 70 persons were
 injured and 40 arrested.
 
 
 526
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Persons who criticize the regime may be charged with serious
 crimes such as sabotage and counter-revolutionary activities. In
 such cases, secret trials are customary. One Cuban dissident,
 Ricardo Bofill, who was released in 1982 after spending 12 years
 in jail as a political prisoner, was re-arrested in September
 1983 when he discussed Cuban human rights abuses with visiting
 foreign journalists. Reliable reports confirm that Bofill was
 tried secretly November 12 and sentenced to an unspecified prison
 term. Reportedly, the prosecutor had asked for a sentence of 12
 years. Bofill's friend, Carlos Jesus Menendez Cervera, son of
 the well-known Cuban labor leader Jesus Menendez, was arrested in
 August 1983 for refusing to incriminate Bofill.
 The authorities in Sancti Spiritus province reportedly arrested
 200 persons for protesting the government confiscation of their
 harvests. Eleven of these farmers, accused of attempting to blow
 up the Baza Dam, are reported to have been executed. The
 Governing Body of the International Labor Organization (ILO)
 reviewed this case in November 1983 and determined that the ILO
 should ask the Cuban Government for detailed comments. The ILO
 also will ask the Cuban Government for a response to reports that
 20 to 30 workers were arrested at the Chaparra sugar refinery for
 attempting to organize an independent trade union. Police
 reportedly told the families of two labor leaders in the sugar
 industry, Rogelio Iglesias Patino and Euripides Nunez, who were
 arrested in early 1983 in connection with efforts to establish
 "Solidarity"-type unions, that they had "committed suicide" while
 in detention. Another person arrested in connection with the
 "Solidarity" affair, Dr. Jose N. Janet, also reportedly
 "committed suicide" while under arrest.
 The Cuban Constitution states that "none of the freedoms which
 are recognized for citizens can be exercised contrary to. . . the
 decision of the Cuban people to build socialism and communism."
 Protections provided under the law often are not afforded to
 persons charged with political offenses. Many prisoners have
 been kept arbitrarily in jail even after the expiration of their
 sentences. It is likely that hundreds of people are still in
 custody after being arbitrarily arrested or detained. The 1983
 report of Amnesty International makes special note of this type
 of human rights violation.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 Courts in practice are subordinated to the executive, although
 the Constitution states that they are independent. The
 Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) concluded in
 its 1983 report on Cuba that "there is neither a legal foundation
 nor a political practice that gives real independence to the
 system for the administration of justice, which the IACHR
 considers essential for the effective observance of human
 rights."(p. 70) All courts consist of judges (three are
 professionally qualified persons and two "workers'
 representatives") who ensure that the "interests of the
 revolution" are protected. The judiciary is reliably reported to
 follow orders from the Ministry of Interior as to whether
 prisoners should be convicted and what sentences should be
 imposed. The arrest of judges on unfounded charges of corruption
 indicates that some jurists may have sought to resist Ministry of
 Interior pressure for harsh sentences.
 
 
 527
 Although lawyers are appointed to represent all defendants, they
 know that lawyers who defended persons charged with political
 offenses have themselves been arrested and charged with crimes.
 In January'1983, a Cuban court sentenced five persons to death
 for having tried to organize a "Solidarity"-style trade union
 movement in Cuba. Subsequently, Cuban authorities arrested the
 attorneys who attempted to defend the five labor organizers.
 Groups such as Americas Watch and Amnesty International have
 estimated that there are over 200 political prisoners in Cuba;
 other estimates put the figure at about 1,000. Americas Watch
 also estimates that there are between 1,500 and 2,000 former
 political prisoners to whom the Cuban Government continues to
 deny employment. Amnesty International also draws attention in
 its 1983 report to the fact that other former political prisoners
 are refused permission to leave Cuba, even when other countries
 have indicated a willingness to give them visas.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 The Cuban Constitution states that "the home is inviolable. No
 one may enter the home of another against his will, except in
 those cases foreseen by law." Nevertheless, no aspect of an
 ordinary Cuban's private life is free from state surveillance.
 Telephones are monitored, mail is opened, and one's comings and
 goings are monitored 24 hours a day by block wardens in the
 neighborhood Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (Cr).
 The Committees also watch for patterns of consumption not in
 keeping with levels of reported income or other signs which might
 suggest involvement in black market activities or receipt of
 gifts from abroad. Meetings, parties, and other gatherings are
 subject to particularly intense scrutiny. Listening to foreign
 radio and television broadcasts is dangerous because of the
 surveillance by CDR members. A jamming signal to interfere with
 Voice of America broadcasts has been noted in the Havana area and
 presumably is used in other urban areas. Non-communist foreign
 periodicals are rarely permitted to circulate in Cuba.
 The Government pressures the entire population to participate in
 "voluntary" party-related activities. Nearly all families are
 coerced into sending their teen-aged children for 46-day stints
 of "voluntary work" in the rural areas. The children are kept in
 camps, where they are indoctrinated with party ideology and
 encouraged to inform on their parents and friends.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Rights, Includings
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 Freedom of speech and press does not exist in Cuba. The media is
 used exclusively to disseminate officially approved news and
 opinion. The State owns and controls all means of
 communication. The Cuban Communist Party, the government-run
 labor federation, and other state entities publish the
 newspapers. The state also closely controls all forms of
 intellectual and artistic expression and represses dissent
 through the threat of severe punishment for any deviation from
 authorized standards. The 1983 report on Cuba by the
 Inter-American Commission on Human Rights "considers the
 limitations on freedom of artistic expression . . .
 reprehensible."(p. 54) Cuban citizens may raise complaints about
 the quality of public services in municipal and regional
 legislatures, but these bodies are powerless to act upon the
 complaints.
 
 
 528
 The Minister of Culture has stated, "Needless to say, in Cuba we
 do not allow the publication of works that are an insult to man's
 dignity. Not a single fascist book or a single book contrary to
 the interests of the people." As a direct result of that policy,
 a number of Cuban artists and intellectuals are or have been
 political prisoners. Those released from prison have their
 movements controlled by the Cuban Government. Poet Andrea
 Vargas, grandson of Cuban independence hero General Maximo Gomez,
 although released in late December 1982 after serving 21 years in
 prison, may not leave Havana province. Nobel laureate in
 literature and former political prisoner Jose Lorenzo Fuentes
 also has been refused permission to leave the country. The same
 prohibition has been placed on poet Angel Cuadra Landrove, who
 was released from prison in April 1982.
 Filmmaker and poet Nicolas Guillen Landarin, who had served two
 previous sentences as a political prisoner, was arrested again in
 July 1983 and sentenced to 10 more years in prison. Jorge More,
 brother of well-known Cuban popular musician Benny More, was
 sentenced in June 1983 to 15 years in prison only two months
 after being released from prison, where he already had spent 14
 years. Intellectual and former Ambassador Gustavo Arcos Bergnes,
 who had served 9 years as a political prisoner, currently is in
 the third year of an additional 14 year sentence for having
 attempted to leave the country after being released from his
 .previous term in prison. Poet Jorge Valls Arango continues to
 serve a 20 year sentence.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Freedom of assembly and association is not guaranteed by the
 Cuban Constitution. Group meetings are monitored by the
 Committees for the Defense of the Revolution. Nearly all
 associations are government-controlled, and a few private ones
 operate only under close government scrutiny. The state and the
 Communist Party control all labor activity. Only one trade
 federation exists, and it is a transmission belt for the party.
 There is no collective bargaining, and the Cuban Constitution
 does not recognize the right to strike, although there have been
 reports of disturbances at work places. Labor-management
 relations are administered by the Ministry of Labor. Union
 members can vote for the officers of the local sections, but not
 for the municipal, provincial, and national officers who
 represent the union within the ministry that regulates their
 particular industry. According to the Inter-American Commission
 on Human Rights, in its 1983 report on Cuba, "The very function
 of unions has been distorted, and rather than protecting the
 concrete interests of workers they have become a channel to
 transmit government orders; the unions have thus become an
 instrument of control."(p.127) In early 1983, five people
 received death sentences (later reduced to 30 years in prison)
 for attempting to organize an independent trade union.
 Responding to international criticism about the severity of these
 sentences, the head of Cuba's trade union confederation asserted
 that it was not possible to form a new union because all work
 places in Cuba are already unionized.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 The state and the party discourage Cubans from exercising their
 constitutional right to freedom of religion. Both adults at work
 and children at school are discriminated against if they go to
 church. Religious activity is deemed totally incompatible with
 membership in the Communist Party. Members of the Committees for
 
 
 529
 the Defense of the Revolution monitor activity at the few
 neighborhood churches which still are open, forcing church-goers
 to attend large downtown churches where they can be less easily
 recognized. Children who admit to going to church are subjected
 to officially sanctioned ridicule by their peers. Participation
 in Communist youth activities is strongly encouraged as an
 alternative to organized religion. Older students who continue
 to participate in religious activities have been denied admission
 to universities. The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Havana was so
 concerned about indirect persecution of the practice of religion
 in Cuba that he issued a pastoral letter in late 1982 reminding
 the Government of the constitutional guarantees and urging
 parents not to refrain from sending their children to catechism
 classes out of fear that the child would be discriminated against
 for having attended. A Roman Catholic nun reported that she had
 to carry a copy of the Cuban Constitution with her on the street,
 in order to quote from it to party militants who tried to
 dissuade her from making her daily rounds.
 The Cuban Government actively discourages Protestant sects,
 especially proselytizing ones. It has outlawed the Jehovah's
 Witnesses for their "counter-revolutionary" beliefs. Three
 Jehovah's Witnesses were executed (Jesus Prieto Suarez, Saul Pey,
 and Efrem Noriegas Barroso) and five others sentenced to death in
 May 1983 for the "crime" of having a mimeograph machine to
 reproduce religious tracts. Another leader of the sect, Juan
 Olivera Alberto, was reported to have been executed in August
 1983 for allegedly spreading "propaganda to incite armed
 rebellion." Credible reports also indicate that one member of
 the Seventh Day Adventists group, Indalecio Ara, was killed while
 "attempting to escape" detention.
 d.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,
 Emigration, and Repatriation
 The Cuban Government takes advantage of the travel restrictions
 described below to restrict the exercise of other freedoms, such
 as speech and assembly. Cuban citizens must carry identification
 cards with them, and if they travel outside of their home
 provinces and are stopped by the police, they must provide
 convincing reasons for their presence in another part of the
 country. It is difficult to change one's place of work and
 residence, partly because of housing shortages and the problem of
 transferring ration books, which usually are issued on the basis
 of a family unit living together. Foreign travel requires
 permits both to exit and re-enter the country. Cubans under the
 age of 60 rarely receive permission to travel abroad. Permission
 is rarely given to emigrate, and generally an applicant will lose
 his job, housing, and his ration cards, and find his children
 barred from attending school while he waits for an exit visa. As
 an example of the extent to which people will go to leave Cuba,
 in early 1983 three young Cubans seized a small group of American
 tourists in Villa Clara province and held them hostage to force
 the Cuban Government to permit the Cubans to depart the country.
 The Americans subsequently were freed, and the young Cubans
 reportedly sentenced to death (later reportedly commuted to 30
 years in prison). The Cuban Government still refuses to permit
 the departure of some Cubans who sought asylum in the Venezuelan
 and Peruvian embassies in Havana more than three years ago.
 The Cuban Government refuses to repatriate Cubans who left the
 the country without official permission. More than one million
 people (one-tenth of Cuba's 1983 population) have fled the island
 since 1959; Government permission is required to return, even as
 
 
 530
 temporary visitors. Such temporary visitors must travel on Cuban
 passports, as the Cuban Government refuses to recognize any other
 nationality they may have acquired. In 1978 arrangements were
 made allowing persons who left before then to return to visit
 their families, but those who left after 1978 are not allowed to
 do so. There was also an increase in aircraft highjackings to
 Cuba in 1983, many by Cubans who wanted to return but were unable
 to do so legally because of Cuban restrictions on their travel.
 Section 3  Respect for Political Rights:  The Right of Citizens to
 Change Their Government
 Cuba is a highly centralized single party state organized on the
 model of "democratic centralism". Members of the Central
 Committee and the Politburo are selected by the top party
 leadership; "elections" are held only to ratify choices already
 made. The National Assembly of People's Power meets occasionally
 but only to approve decisions already taken by the party leaders.
 People's Assemblies, which were created in 1976 for the
 ostensible purpose of decentralizing the governmental system,
 provide a forum for citizens at the local, regional and
 provincial levels to discuss public issues related to daily
 life. However, these assemblies have no authority to make policy
 or legislate changes.
 The Cuban Government exerts heavy pressure to secure maximum
 citizen participation in the various "mass organizations" which
 it controls. But citizens are unable to change the policies and
 officials of their government. These "mass organizations" serve
 mainly to indoctrinate the populace and give the impression of
 participation by the masses in the political process.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 The Cuban Government routinely denies that any violations of
 human rights occur, but it refuses permission for any outside
 non-governmental organization to investigate charges that
 violations have occurred. It refuses to permit entry of
 investigation teams from the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.
 When foreign governments protested the sentencing of five persons
 to death for trying to organize a union, the Cuban Government at
 first denied any knowledge of the case. Later it conceded that
 there had been a trial but denied that the death sentences had
 been imposed and also contended that the offenses involved were
 ordinary crimes. When foreign governments have inquired about
 political prisoners in Cuba, the Government usually has responded
 that such inquiries are unacceptable because they concern the
 country's internal affairs. Human rights activists in Cuba who
 are not in jail are forced to carry out their activities
 clandestinely and must rely upon international non-governmental
 agencies for support and publicity.
 Amnesty International in its 1983 report recorded its concern
 over the increase in executions for allegedly political crimes,
 the continued detention of some 38 long term political prisoners,
 and the prolonged detention without charge of people suspected of
 political activities. Freedom House called Cuba "not free" in
 1983.
 
 
 531
 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL SITUATION
 Cuba's 1983 population of 9,958,000 grew at an annual rate of 0.9
 percent. Life expectancy at birth in 1980 was 73 years, while
 the infant mortality rate in 1983 was 17.3 per thousand. In
 1970, 64.2 percent of the urban population and 10.9 percent of
 the rural population had access to safe water. Because of the
 emphasis given by the Government to education, which includes a
 massive campaign to have all adults attain at least a ninth grade
 education, the adjusted primary school enrollment ratio (i.e. of
 children between 6-11 years) in 1979 was 116 percent of
 internationally accepted norm for males and 108 percent for
 females. The 1983 Cuban estimate of the rate of adult literacy
 is 96 percent.
 Cuba has a centrally-planned economy. The Soviet Union provided
 Cuba with an estimated $4.56 billion in aid in 1982, plus
 approximately $940 million in military equipment deliveries. The
 estimated per capita Gross National Product in 1982 was
 $1,000-1,250.
 Nevertheless, there are scarcities of many necessities, and items
 such as rice, beans, meat, clothing, and shoes are strictly
 rationed. The Cuban Government claims that the average daily
 caloric intake is 2900 calories, but missing are figures for the
 levels of protein, vitamins, and minerals in the Cuban diet.
 Cuba has constitutionally outlawed discrimination against women
 and ethnic and religious minorities, but few women hold high
 positions in government, despite publicly proclaimed efforts of
 the party to promote them. Of the 225 full and alternate members
 of the Central Committee of the Cuban Communist Party selected in
 December 1980, only 18 are women. No woman is a member of the
 Secretariat of the Central Committee. One Politburo member, an
 alternate, is a woman (wife of PCC Second Secretary Paul
 Castro). While women constitute 19 percent of the membership of
 the National Assembly of People's Power, only two of the 12
 standing committees of that legislative body are chaired by
 women. According to the Cuban Federation of Women, women have
 not received equal treatment in the work place as only four
 percent of all managerial positions in 1983 were filled by women
 while they constituted 32 percent of the work force. In 1982,
 according to the same source, 13,590 skilled female workers and
 6,228 female technicians could not find employment.
 Blacks and other minorities also are poorly represented in the
 top levels of government. While they comprise more than one
 quarter of the population, their percentage in the Central
 Committee (full and alternate members) is about 10 to 15
 percent. Only one of the members (full and alternate) of the
 Politburo is black. The 1983 report on Cuba by the
 Inter-American Commission on Human Rights asserts that blacks
 also "are underrepresented in management of enterprises and in
 the officer corps of the army, and overrepresented among those
 who perform manual labor and enlisted men."(p. 110)
