 ETHIOPIA
 Ethiopia is ruled by Chairman Mengistu Haile-Mariam who
 exercises absolute power over the majority of Ethiopians. The
 ability of the Mengistu regime to maintain itself in power is
 based on the conviction of most Ethiopians that it is prepared
 to take whatever steps are necessary to continue in power.
 Chairman Mengistu holds the top post of general secretary in
 the Workers Party of Ethiopia, established September 6, 1984.
 The stated goal of the party is to transform the country into
 a Marxist-Leninist state.
 Ethiopia deploys the largest standing army in Africa south of
 the Sahara, numbering over 250,000 soldiers. It uses this
 power to pursue military solutions to the armed insurgencies
 of varying intensities directed against the Government.
 Ethiopia also supports rebel movements fighting against its
 neighbors, Sudan and Somalia, in retaliation for their alleged
 support of Ethiopia's internal opponents. The Government has
 an extensive security apparatus which uses a comprehensive
 system of surveillance and informers to strengthen its control
 over the population.
 The economy is currently suffering not only from the
 aftereffects of the drought and civil strife (military
 expenditures take 25 percent of the budget) but also from
 ideological constraints, notably in the Government's efforts
 to impose upon a nation of small, independent farmers a system
 of collectivized and state farms.
 Ethiopia's record on human rights remains deplorable.
 Ethiupians have no civil or political freedoms and no
 institutions or laws to protect their human rights. Over
 1 million Ethiopians have fled the country, many preferring
 life in refugee camps. The Provisional Military Government of
 Socialist Ethiopia (PMGSE) dominates the media, labor,
 education, internal and external movements of Ethiopian
 citizens, and all political processes in government-controlled
 parts of the country. The Government expects to hold a
 national referendum in the near future on a constitution based
 on Soviet and Romanian models. This constitution will provide
 the legal basis for guarantees of human rights, but it is not
 expected to alter the human rights practices of the present
 regime. In recent years, the Government has forcibly moved
 hundreds of thousands of Ethiopians, in part to improve its
 control over them. Although the Government temporarily
 suspended its program of forcibly resettling massive numbers
 of northern highland peasants into lowland areas of the
 country, a much larger nationwide program involving the
 grouping of farmers in new villages accelerated in 1986. Also
 in 1986, both government forces and members of various rebel
 movements committed atrocities against prisoners and civilian
 populations.
 RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
 Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Political Killing
 There were reliable reports in 1986 of the execution of
 approximately 60 political prisoners in October 1985. None of
 the executed is known to have been granted a trial, much less
 an appeal, and the Government has never acknowledged the
 
 
 103
 ETHIOPIA
 executions nor attempted to justify them. Among those
 believed executed was Dejazmatch Asegahgen Araya Hailu,
 accused by the Ethiopian Government of being a "ringleader" of
 an opposition political group, and 1 of 18 persons detained
 since December 1983 for "distributing antirevolutionary
 pamphlets." There is uncertainty regarding the fate of the
 rest of these detainees, although another, Dr. Mengasha
 Gebre-Hiwut, is believed to have died under torture in 1985 at
 the infamous "Third Police Station" in Addis Ababa.
 In insurgent areas, political killings by both government
 forces and contending factions continued. Guerrilla forces
 used assassination, sniping, and the mining of roadways as
 tactics against the Government, while the Government continued
 to execute captured combatants and to bomb civilian population
 centers. Both government and rebel forces are believed to
 have destroyed crops and homes in their opponents' areas.
 On March 8, 1986, members of the Tigrean Peoples' Liberation
 Front (TPLF) entered a relief feeding center and clinic and
 shot and killed two civilian Ethiopian relief workers, one a
 nurse who was allowed to bleed slowly to death under the gaze
 of her assailants. The two victims were employed by the World
 Vision Relief Organization.
 b. Disappearance
 The most notable disappearance in 1986 was that of the
 Ethiopian Permanent Representative to the United Nations and
 Ambassador to Canada in April. No charges are known to have
 been filed against him, and his whereabouts have not been
 officially announced by the Government. He is believed to be
 in a prison in Addis Ababa. Amnesty International continues
 to express concern for 15 persons who disappeared in 1979 and
 who are presumed dead, including the Patriarch of the
 Ethiopian Orthodox Church.
 c. Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 Methods of torture, including severe beatings, crushing of
 bones of the hand, and the use of electric shocks, although
 technically illegal, are practiced by Ethiopian officials in
 cases involving insurgent combatants and those believed to be
 engaged in political activities against the Government.
 Amnesty International states that reports indicate torture is
 often practiced on Ethiopian prisoners interrogated at the
 Central Revolutionary Investigation Department ("Third Police
 Station") in the capital and is routinely used in other parts
 of the country to interrogate prisoners about opposition
 organizations.
 On February 8, 1986, the TPLF stormed the main prison in
 Makelle, the capital of Tigray Province, releasing hundreds of
 prisoners who provided fresh examples of torture employed by
 the Ethiopian Government. Interviews by the International
 Federation of Human Rights of 121 of those released
 documented repeated cases of beatings of prisoners while
 either bound and/or suspended from a ceiling and of forced
 immersion in hot or dirty water, sometimes upside down.
 Certain low-level officials who arbitrarily held prisoners
 without charge, however, were themselves imprisoned for false
 arrest and torture in 1985 and 1986.
 
 
 104
 ETHIOPIA
 d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile
 Ethiopians suspected of antigovernment actions or sentiments
 are subject to arrest or detention by the security police
 without charge or judicial review. Remarks considered
 critical or derisive of the Government, failure to attend
 mandatory political or kebele (urban neighborhood
 associations) meetings, and suspicion of association or
 sympathy with organizations opposed to the Government are
 common reasons for arbitrary arrest and detention. In most
 cases, political detainees are held incommunicado, at least
 initially, and sometimes for the length of their term of
 incarceration. The term of confinement for a suspect held
 without legal charge is subject to the whim of the detaining
 official or agent. Prisoners have been held without charge
 for periods of up to 9 years.
 In politically sensitive arrests, the Government generally
 prefers to operate in secret, taking the suspect from home at
 night. However, arbitrary arrest is not limited to the
 politically suspect. Even people with no record of political
 activity or political affiliations have been arrested and
 detained for months or longer without explanation.
 In common civil and criminal cases (but not political cases
 brought before the "special court" created after the 1974
 revolution), lawyers are sometimes permitted to appeal
 informally to government authorities, not judges, to know the
 charges against a client and to have a detainee released if no
 charges have been filed.
 In May 1986, over 700 prisoners were amnestied from prisons in
 Addis Ababa. Throughout the year, additional small groups of
 prisoners were released from time to time.
 Amnesty International and others continue to press for the
 release of the 10 remaining members of the royal family
 detained since the revolution, all held without charge.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 There is no discernible separation between the executive
 branch and the judiciary. Courts are subject to political
 control and are responsive to the requests and directions of
 Ethiopia's leadership. Ordinary criminal and civil cases are
 generally based upon the submission of evidence in a public
 setting. Minor cases are tried at the kebele level, while
 more serious criminal accusations are tried in courts where
 the accused has access to court-appointed lawyers. Members of
 Ethiopia's substantial Muslim population may elect to present
 their civil case to a traditional Shari'a court, if both
 parties agree.
 Ethiopian political detainees generally do not receive trials,
 public or otherwise. No guarantee of a public trial with
 counsel exists in such cases, nor isthe accused permitted to
 present witnesses or evidence in his or her defense.
 Political trials are almost always held in secret with only
 the verdict (if even that) publicly announced. Those cleared
 of charges or whose terms have been completed are not always
 promptly released from prisons.
 There are conflicting reports about the current number of
 political prisoners. If the total includes those taken
 
 
 105
 ETHIOPIA
 prisoner as a result of ethnic insurgencies, it could well
 number in the thousands. Amnesty International believes
 several thousand were still being held at the beginning of
 1986.
 f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or
 Correspondence
 Warrants are not required for entry into or search of offices
 or private homes. As a result, forced entry is commonly used
 by the police and security forces, particularly during
 military call-ups, although the level of this activity is
 currently much lower than during the "Red Terror" period of
 1977-78. However, surveillance of individuals, both visual or
 through use of listening devices, has increased and continues
 with no legal restraints.
 All mail is subject to monitoring by the Government.
 Ethiopian citizens can be called in at any time for
 questioning by authorities and for mandatory kebele meetings,
 political rallies, or marches. Refusal to appear for any of
 the above may result in imprisonment without hearing. Every
 urban Ethiopian lives under the watchful eyes of local kebele
 association officials. These officials monitor visitors
 received, items brought in and out of houses, any meetings,
 and adherence to local curfews.
 In November 1984, the Government began a massive and forced
 resettlement of famine victims, especially from the northern
 regions to western parts of the country. To date this program
 has involved the forcible removal, transport, and resettlement
 of over 500,000 persons, and eventual resettlement of up to 1
 million more is projected. The program, as conducted in
 1984-85, was rife with abuses, including the wholesale
 separation of families and inhumane conditions of transport to
 resettlement sites up to 700 kilometers distant. Following an
 international outcry, the resettlement program was suspended
 in December 1985. Efforts were made to improve the conditions
 in the resettlement areas, but people already moved were not
 officially permitted to return to their homes, although some
 have left on their own. Several thousand reportedly attempted
 to flee towards Sudan. Suffering from hunger, exposure, and
 attacks by Sudanese rebels, fewer than a thousand reached
 Sudanese relief centers. The Ethiopian Government has
 publicly stated its intention to resume the program on a
 "voluntary" basis in the near future.
 One tragic byproduct of both drought and resettlement is the
 'unaccompanied children/orphan" problem. According to
 conservative estimates, there are as many as 10,000
 unaccompanied children in relief areas alone, with an
 additional (and presumably sizable) number of unaccompanied
 children in the resettlement areas. By any accounting, many
 of these children are "orphaned," that is, separated from
 living family members because of the way the resettlement
 program was implemented. While there have been small-scale
 efforts at family reunification in several regions by both
 government and private voluntary organizations, the Government
 has not yet undertaken a countrywide project to reunite those
 children who are not true orphans, with either immediate or
 extended family members. Moreover, despite several offers by
 the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to embark
 on a family reunification program in resettlement areas, the
 Government has not yet accepted the ICRC proposal.
 
 
 106
 ETHIOPIA
 A much larger program of collecting scattered peasants into
 artificial and sometimes crowded villages continued in 1986.
 According to government figures, 4,587,187 Ethiopians have, as
 of November 1986, been forced into such villages. Peasants
 cannot avoid participating in the program, and so far almost
 everyone living in "villagized" areas has moved to the new
 villages. At least one group of "villagized" peasants has
 reported that they were told that their huts would be burned
 down by party officials if they refused to move to the new
 site. The Government has devoted very few resources to this
 large program, so peasants must dismantle their own houses,
 transport them to the government-selected village site, and
 reassemble them. Promised social services such as schools,
 new roads, or clinics, though promised, are rare.
 Approximately 30,000 additional Ethiopians appeared in refugee
 camps in Somalia during 1986, most claiming to have fled the
 villagization program. Their allegations of violent coercion,
 religious persecution, rape, and crop burning associated with
 the program in the Harerge region have not been substantiated
 despite extensive investigations in the area by
 representatives of foreign governments and international and
 private relief organizations.
 Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, including:
 a. Freedom of Speech and Press
 There is no freedom of speech or press in Ethiopia. The
 Government owns and operates all information media and
 exercises censorship through editorial boards and the Ministry
 of Information. Expression of unauthorized political opinions
 or of views at variance with the official government line can
 result in imprisonment. Political, economic, and social
 policies in Ethiopia are formulated at top levels of
 government, then disseminated and monitored through the.
 government-controlled media and government-organized citizen
 groups, i.e., women, youth, worker, and professional
 associations, kebeles, and military commissariats.
 The Government closely monitors the pronouncements of public
 officials, academics, and clergy. Some instructors and
 professors in secondary schools and at the university have
 resisted the politicization of education. Academic freedom,
 although circumscribed, especially in the political and social
 sciences, still finds expression at the university. Private
 secondary schools, where affluent Ethiopians can send their
 children, are mostly free of political orientation. Many
 Ethiopians, including government officials, seek to send their
 children abroad for education.
 Books and magazines can be confiscated if deemed to contain
 sentiments opposed to the revolution. For example, the August
 4, 1986, issue of Time magazine, which contained a lengthy
 article on Ethiopia as well as verbatim excerpts from an
 interview with Chairman Mengistu, was confiscated by
 government' censors. Foreign magazines and newspapers are not
 readily available since foreign exchange is not granted to
 purchase them. Foreign radio broadcasts are widely listened
 to in Ethiopia. There is no evidence of overt attempts by the
 Government to interfere with radio reception.
 During 1986 the government-owned television, radio, and
 newspapers significantly increased their use of American and
 
 
 107
 ETHIOPIA
 Western European "soft" news, features, and entertainment
 products in an effort to improve the quality of their
 programing and to make it more appealing to the public.
 "Hard" news, however, continues to come almost exclusively
 from official Ethiopian and Soviet/Eastern European sources.
 b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
 Assembly of any sort not previously approved by the Government
 is strictly forbidden under penalty of arrest. In contrast,
 attendance at government-sponsored rallies, meetings, and
 parades is mandatory and enforceable by arrest and detention.
 Ethiopians, traditionally cautious in their associations with
 one another and with foreigners, have become even more so
 under the present regime. There is a pervasive system of
 informers and surveillance. Frequent or close association
 with foreigners can result in questioning, arrest, and
 detention. Professional associations such as the Rotary and
 Lions Clubs are allowed to operate, though their membership
 and activities presumably are monitored by the Government.
 Trade and professional associations were reorganized in 1986
 by order of the Workers Party of Ethiopia. New boards were
 selected for these groups from members approved by the party.
 Workers are not permitted to organize independently in
 Ethiopia, and labor/management negotiations are strictly
 controlled. Collective bargaining does not exist. Strikes
 and slowdowns are forbidden. The only labor organization
 allowed to operate is the government-controlled All-Ethiopia
 Trade Union (AETU). The AETU, one of Ethiopia's mass
 organizations, is a political group used by the Government to
 implement its policies, expand party control within the
 workplace, and prevent work stoppages. Many of AETU's top
 leaders have been trained in Eastern Europe, and the
 organization has close ties to Soviet and Eastern European
 labor organizations. The 1985 report of the International
 Labor Organization (ILO) committee of experts criticized the
 mandatory, single trade union structure in Ethiopia and
 repeated its request that freedom of association be granted to
 rural workers and public servants.
 c. Freedom of Religion
 With the overthrow of the Haile Selassie regime, the Ethiopian
 Orthodox Church lost its favored position, along with its
 lands and most of its property. The Government allows the
 Orthodox Church and the Muslim religion (each claims about 50
 percent of Ethiopia's population) freedom of worship and
 proselytism. However, the Orthodox Church has
 government-appointed officials within its administration to
 ensure its conformity with party policies. Party members are
 legally prohibited from worshiping, but this ban is not
 enforced.
 Orthodox and Muslim holidays are recognized by the government,
 and officials of both religions are allowed to exercise
 jurisdiction over civil matters such as marriage. There is,
 however, a continuing effort to deemphasize the presence and
 importance of religion in Ethiopian life, e.g., references to
 any deity are expunged from dialog in television programs and
 movies and are forbidden in government statements or
 publications. Nevertheless, in recent years there has been a
 notable resurgence in religious observances and church
 
 
 108
 ETHIOPIA
 attendance, deemed by most observers to be a popular response
 to the regime's efforts to curb religion.
 Other religions, particularly foreign Protestant Evangelical
 organizations, have found their activities sharply curtailed
 by the Government, through the closure of churches, the
 seizure and nationalization of property and facilities, and
 harassment and surveillance. At least one organization's
 congregation, its leader imprisoned since 1977, now assembles
 in secret "safe areas" for worship and other church-related
 meetings. The Government gives permits to foreign
 missionaries to enter and work in Ethiopia in limited numbers,
 although ostensibly as development specialists, not as
 missionaries.
 Members of many of Ethiopia's Evangelical churches were
 released from prison in 1986. A general trend of greater
 tolerance by government officials at the central and local
 levels continued during the year, although there were
 exceptions. Several persons at a Protestant wedding ceremony,
 including the groom, were arrested, reportedly for assembling
 without a permit. The Jehovah's Witnesses church remains
 totally banned.
 Ethiopia's small Jewish community (the Falashas) live in areas
 of insurgency (Tigre, Gondar). Stories of "genocidal" actions
 by Ethiopian authorities or of highly brutal behavior toward
 Ethiopian Jews have not been substantiated by American
 visitors to these areas. Jews do suffer some degree of
 economic discrimination. The many craftsmen are not allowed
 to sell their wares themselves in local cities, and tourists
 are only infrequently permitted to visit a few of their
 villages. As in the rest of Ethiopia, visitors are required
 to get permission to visit these villages. Large numbers of
 Ethiopian Jews have surreptitiously left the country in recent
 years. The Government has attempted to block this exodus as
 part of its overall antiemigration policy.
 d. Freedom of Movement within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation
 Restrictions on freedom of travel within Ethiopia exist as a
 result of the insurgencies (several areas, mainly in the
 northern administrative zones, are closed to travel for
 security reasons). Moreover, permission is required for
 Ethiopian citizens to change their places of residence, and
 persons considered politically suspect can be forbidden to
 travel outside their home areas.
 Travel abroad by Ethiopians is closely controlled. A passport
 application can be denied for failure to attend the mandatory
 Sunday morning political meeting or to "volunteer" for kebele
 work activities. In 1986 the Ethiopian Government appeared to
 be more liberal in granting passports and exit visas to its
 citizens--applications for visas to visit the United States
 were up by 40 percent.
 Emigration is highly restricted, except in special
 circumstances such as marriage to or adoption by a foreign
 national. Some emigration has been allowed on the basis of
 family reunification. Leaving Ethiopia without authorization
 is a serious offense punishable by 5 to 25 years' imprisonment
 or, in exceptional cases, reportedly by death. Nonetheless
 considerable illegal emigration occurs either under the
 
 
 109
 ETHIOPIA
 subterfuge of travel abroad for business or to visit relatives
 or by arduous treks overland and surreptitious crossing of
 borders.
 The Government recognizes the right of voluntary repatriation,
 and its proclamation of mass amnesty for Ethiopians living
 abroad (numbering more than 1 million) remains in effect. The
 government does not participate in forcibly repatriating
 refugees from other countries. There are approximately
 180,000 Sudanese resident in Ethiopia, some genuine refugees,
 some armed Sudanese dissidents, while others are persons
 displaced by drought and insurgency in southern Sudan.
 Foreigners in Ethiopia, always required to obtain a travel
 permit for internal travel, found that permission occasionally
 denied in 1986. Representatives of the United Nations and of
 foreign assistance programs and embassies who had been allowed
 to travel freely in connection with emergency assistance
 programs over the past 2 years found restrictions being placed
 on such travel as the emergency subsided in late 1986.
 Most of the Ethiopians displaced by the drought/famine
 returned from Sudan before or during 1986. There is no
 evidence that they were mistreated or discriminated against
 upon their return. Also, from 1983 to 1986, 400,000
 Ethiopians spontaneously returned to Ethiopia from Somalia,
 according to the United Nations High Commissioner for
 Refugees. Approximately 32,000 refugees have returned from
 Djibouti as of the end of 1986.
 Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens
 to Change Their Government
 Ethiopian citizens have no legal right or peaceful means to
 change their Government. All power to determine policy in
 Ethiopia resides in the upper echelons of government, led by
 Chairman Mengistu and shared less each year by a small group
 of associates, mostly former military officers. Political and
 economic policies are dictated to the population. The
 Provisional Military Government of Socialist Ethiopia
 invariably claims to be speaking on behalf of all the
 Ethiopian people. The Workers' Party of Ethiopia (WPE)
 purports to offer Ethiopian citizens a means of participation
 in government, but its real role is to ensure that all
 government ministries, mass organizations, and nationalized
 businesses adhere to Marxist-Leninist principles. The WPE,
 like its Soviet counterpart, is a rather exclusive group--not
 everyone can join. Some, such as higher-level government
 officials, are required to join if they want to keep their
 jobs. Kebeles, the primary party/government control
 mechanisms at the local level, control housing allocation,
 basic food rationing, political indoctrination, and implement
 other government policies, such as registering and selecting
 youths for national military service.
 The highest government echelons are no longer dominated by the
 Amhara ethnic group but include many Oromos and a few
 Eritreans and Tigreans. Almost all senior government and
 political figures are of Christian origin although the
 population is approximately 50 percent Muslim. Women are
 poorly represented at the top echelons of government. Only
 one woman, a vice minister, holds a senior position.
 
 
 110
 ETHIOPIA
 Ethiopia's new constitution, which is scheduled to be voted on
 in a referendum in early 1987, would provide for the creation
 of a People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and
 representation by "nationality" or ethnic group in national
 and regional parliaments. The extent of autonomy, if any,
 that actually will be permitted groups such as the Eritreans,
 Tigreans, Somalis, and Oromos is not clear. Until the key
 issue of how the central government relates with its many
 nationalities is resolved to the satisfaction of ethnic
 minorities, antigovernment insurgencies can be expected to
 continue.
 Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and
 Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There is no governmental or private body to investigate
 alleged human rights violations. The government resists
 attempts by international and nongovernmental organizations to
 investigate such cases. Representatives of the International
 Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Addis Ababa are not
 allowed to visit political prisoners but are allowed to visit
 prisoners of war from the 1977-78 war with Somalia. The ICRC,
 however, does not have access to prisoners taken in fighting
 with insurgent groups or to prisoners held by Ethiopian-backed
 rebel groups opposing the governments of Sudan and Somalia.
 In March 1986, the United States, introduced a resolution at
 the annual meeting of the United Nations Human Rights
 Commission calling for monitoring the widespread reports of
 abuses associated with Ethiopia's resettlement program.
 Ethiopia vigorously opposed this proposal which was not
 brought to a debate or vote, despite the support of the
 Western countries for a vote on the substance of the
 restriction.
 Ethiopia is not a signatory to any of the U.N. human rights
 documents nor the Organization of African Unity's Charter of
 Human and Peoples' Rights.
 Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion,
 Language, or Social Status
 Various U.N. studies indicate Ethiopian women are subject to
 many disadvantages, encountering, inter alia, cultural and
 traditional biases, marriages imposed at a very young age,
 hard and time-consuming labor, and inadequate employment
 opportunities and decent wages in urban areas. Village
 leadership is invariably male, and all clergy are male.
 However, women in the central Ethiopian cultures (Oromo,
 Amhara, Eritrea, and Tigre) enjoy economic rights equal to
 those of men. They may inherit, sell, or buy property and
 engage in business. Women have a subservient status within
 the home, and child marriages remain common in some rural
 areas despite opposition by the Government. Female
 circumcision is widely practiced among Ethiopian Orthodox
 families and is less common with some other groups, although
 the Government has stated its opposition to this practice.
 The Revolutionary Ethiopian Women's Association, a mass
 organization created in 1980, has the proclaimed goal of
 improving the status of women.
 
 
 111
 ETHIOPIA
 CONDITIONS OF LABOR
 The minimum age of 14 for nonfarm labor seems to be
 respected. The maximum legal workweek of 48 hours is
 generally respected in practice. "Voluntary" work campaigns
 at places of employment are common. Workers "volunteer" to
 work extra hours and weekends so that factory or office quotas
 can be achieved but receive no pay for these hours. Although
 the right of workers to an annual vacation is guaranteed by
 law, in practice government workers are usually allowed little
 time off. Employers in private industry, however, are obliged
 by the Government to respect this law. Health and safety
 codes for the workplace are rudimentary and remain
 unenforced. Absenteeism is very high despite punishments,
 including beatings, in an attempt to curtail it.
 The minimum wage in Ethiopia remains about $24 per month.
 Additional allowances effectively raise the minimum wage of a
 full-time employee-to about $34. Day laborers in the
 agricultural sector receive almost $1 per day plus some
 payment in kind (shelter or a meal, for example). Day
 laborers in the urban areas receive almost $1.50 per day plus
 transportation to and from the workplace. The minimum wage is
 currently under review; a new rate may be established next
 year.
